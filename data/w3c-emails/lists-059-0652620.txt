I've always dislike the use of the word "ensure" in our guidelines.

I think this is a valid point to address.  I don't recall if we still
have a "support generation of accessible code and make that the default"
clause?

I think he's right with this; it should be priority one given that
a poorly written editor can easily destroy the accessibility of a
page when someone other than the author goes to edit it.

What is the reason for the priority one on this?

I don't know if there's any good way to write "what we mean" by 7.1. :-p
