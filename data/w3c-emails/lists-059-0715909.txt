At the meeting yesterday the general agreement seemed to be that if it was
easay, then we should indeed do this. Ian being as good as he is has done the
necessary magic, so the next draft will have the links to the techniques as
well as to the guidelines document, for people to look at.

(So if you think this is a bad idea, please speak up.)

Cheers

Charles
