William,

I don't think we have any great liability. We are making available some
reviews of publicly available tools according to a public specification, done
by individuals. We describe the status of each evaluation, and of the process
that is used, in such a way that people can reproduce the tests. This is
important in enabling the public and developers to criticise, improve on, and
understand the individual tests, and can only be achieved by very precisely
stating what is tested - not just names, but version numbers, the version of
the document that it is being reviewed against, etc.

The reviews are not a forum for haranguing developers, they are an
informative aid to the public who are seeking further help in using the
specification.

  slippery slope. I don't think the intent of our charter is to provide
  lists (necessarily incomplete) of conforming/non-conforming tools.
  Unless the makers of the tools request inclusion our liability is
  evident and unless we find *every* tool our neglect is unfair to some
  perhaps unknown excellence. We can describe problems in current
  (unnamed) products and point out satisfactory compliances - with
  anonymity.
