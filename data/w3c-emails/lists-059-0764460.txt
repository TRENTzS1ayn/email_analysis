Is there still time for comments on the Guidelines 1.0 [1] PR? It is a
pleasure to read, and I found only a few possible improvements to mention.
Line numbers refer to the source HTML.


Minor Typos

On line 291, "be satisfied," could be "be satisfied."

On line 1133, "HTML." could be "HTML)."

On line 1368, "ia available" could be "is available".


Two Suggestions

On lines 288 to 300, the last paragraph of the Introduction might be
considered repetitive. Something can be cut probably, for example:
"suggestions for how to satisfy the checkpoints, or where further
information can be found. They are". A resulting proposed version of the
second half of that paragraph follows:

"...Readers are strongly encouraged to become familiar with the techniques
document. The Techniques provided in [WAI-AUTOOLS-TECHS] are suggestions
for how to satisfy the checkpoints, or where further information can be
found. They are informative only, and other strategies may be used to meet
the checkpoint as well as, or in place of, those discussed."

Finally (and this is really nitpicking), one sentence on lines 1091-1092 in
the Glossary definition for "Accessible Authoring Practice" might be
tightened up. "For example" seems to obviate the need for "etc." "For
example, authors write clearly, structure their content, provide navigation
aids, etc." could read "For example, authors write clearly, structure their
content, and provide navigation aids." or "Authors write clearly, structure
their content, and provide navigation aids, for example." (If you agree,
then this change would also apply to the Techniques draft [2] lines
2315-2316.)


Checkpoints

Both the tabular Checklist [3] and List of Checkpoints [4] on lines 35-36
say, "postscript, pdf". It might be nice to match the Guidelines and
capitalize, "PostScript, PDF".

I will try to send my comments on the Techniques draft tomorrow. Best of
luck with your Proposed Recommendation.
