Susan,

thank you for your comments. We will fix the typos, and take your editorial
suggestions into account for the next draft, which I expect to be produced
some time next week.

Regards

Charles McCathieNevile

  Is there still time for comments on the Guidelines 1.0 [1] PR? It is a
  pleasure to read, and I found only a few possible improvements to mention.
  Line numbers refer to the source HTML.
  
  
  Minor Typos
  
  On line 291, "be satisfied," could be "be satisfied."
  
  On line 1133, "HTML." could be "HTML)."
  
  On line 1368, "ia available" could be "is available".
  
  
  Two Suggestions
  
  On lines 288 to 300, the last paragraph of the Introduction might be
  considered repetitive. Something can be cut probably, for example:
  "suggestions for how to satisfy the checkpoints, or where further
  information can be found. They are". A resulting proposed version of the
  second half of that paragraph follows:
  
  "...Readers are strongly encouraged to become familiar with the techniques
  document. The Techniques provided in [WAI-AUTOOLS-TECHS] are suggestions
  for how to satisfy the checkpoints, or where further information can be
  found. They are informative only, and other strategies may be used to meet
  the checkpoint as well as, or in place of, those discussed."
  
  Finally (and this is really nitpicking), one sentence on lines 1091-1092 in
  the Glossary definition for "Accessible Authoring Practice" might be
  tightened up. "For example" seems to obviate the need for "etc." "For
  example, authors write clearly, structure their content, provide navigation
  aids, etc." could read "For example, authors write clearly, structure their
  content, and provide navigation aids." or "Authors write clearly, structure
  their content, and provide navigation aids, for example." (If you agree,
  then this change would also apply to the Techniques draft [2] lines
  2315-2316.)
  
  
  Checkpoints
  
  Both the tabular Checklist [3] and List of Checkpoints [4] on lines 35-36
  say, "postscript, pdf". It might be nice to match the Guidelines and
  capitalize, "PostScript, PDF".

  I will try to send my comments on the Techniques draft tomorrow. Best of
  luck with your Proposed Recommendation.
