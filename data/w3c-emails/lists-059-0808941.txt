Here is a minor typo report for Techniques [1] "work in progress". Line
numbers refer to the HTML source.


Comments

alt appears as alt-text, alt text, "alt-text", alt, "alt", and "alt"-text
(and alternative text). I would try to settle on one representation and use
it throughout. Maybe "<code>alt</code>"-text

Mostly they are, but every instance of alt, BR, height, IMG, longdesc, P,
src, title, and width could be CODE (or TT or SAMP, but it looks like
you're settled on CODE). (See lines 519-521, 800, 846, 925-926, 934, 1248,
1372-1373, 1399, 2180, 2185-2187.)

The draft would read better if "etc." could be eliminated whenever it adds
no information.

"...For example, when requesting equivalent alternatives for an

[Cut into two or more sentences. One proposed new version follows:]
"...For example, when requesting equivalent alternatives for an
    image with the HTML OBJECT element, and there is no content
    which implies the image has no real function, offer an
    unchecked option for a null value. Position the cursor in
    the entry field for alternative text, and, if available,
    provide the appropriate value from the Alternative
