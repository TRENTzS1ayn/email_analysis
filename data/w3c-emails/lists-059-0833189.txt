Jutta's notion of renaming gets my vote. The positivity of using
examples of successful implementations is absolutely spot on.
Highlighting successful practices within tools rather than "reviewing"
products seems unassailably even-handed and useful. It also permits
those of us who try out these offerings to point to mostly what we like
(it won't be taboo to contrast the good with what had been wrong before)
in order to encourage developers to see how portions of tools may
improve and help assuage fears of the difficulties inherent in making
authoring tool output conformant. After all it is at least theoretically
possible to make the most "push-button" (save-as-xml) application do
good things for usability/accessibility. In fact if a tool is, in the
latter regard, fully automatic it is probably immune from requirements
about documentation, etc. since it will be "under-the-hood" performing
transformations into conformant output! The much-maligned "secretary"
who is charged with producing Web offerings "here, Connie, put our
newsletter on the Website" will not need to know why she has to describe
the illustrations, only that she must in order to get the job done.
