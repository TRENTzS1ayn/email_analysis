Reminder that there is a meeting today, 3pm Eastern time - half an hour
earlier than usual.

Sorry folks, I haven't been able to update the issues list as per my action
item from the last meeting. (Is anyone having trouble getting to the minutes
of the last meeting - 24 November?) I hope i will do that after the meeting.
