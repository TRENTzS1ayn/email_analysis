Apparently the WG has committed to this since it's listed
as a deliverable in the charter [1]:

      "4. Report on implementation progress and 
          assessment of need for subsequent work in this area."

There may be other ways to satisfy this deliverable than a list
of conforming tools, but such a list does not seem to be beyond
the scope of the charter.

An important question may be raised: Is W3C the definitive authority
for validating conformance claims? This question is pertinent even
without publication of a list of conforming tools on the site.
Publication of conformance claims at the W3C will surely contribute
to the perception that W3C has the authoritative word (and maybe
even exclusively). 

I think this question merits discussion in the WAI CG since at
least the UAGL should operate similarly. I suggest that:

1) Any list of conforming tools indicate that this is not the
   definitive list of conforming tools nor an advertisement
   for particular tools. It's just a convenient repository.

2) Any entry on the list clearly indicate whether W3C has
   "validated" the claim or not. Whether W3C chooses to validate
   claims at all is another matter for the CG.
