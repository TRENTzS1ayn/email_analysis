I like the language about the average user having a working understanding of
the UI metaphor. Can anyone (Wendy?) turn that into English and incorporate
it? (I don't think it is necessary, but it would probably be helpful.

  I today's call I took an action item to propose text for the priority 
  section that addresses the open issue "What level of skill in producing 
  accessible markup can the developer assume on the part of the 
  author?"  Here it goes, beginning with existing text in the section to set 
  the context:
  
  Each checkpoint has a priority level. The priority level reflects the 
  impact of the checkpoint in meeting the goals of this specification. These 
  goals are:
  That the authoring tool be accessible
  That the authoring tool generate accessible content by default
  That the authoring tool encourage the creation of accessible content
  
  <proposal>
  In creating a tool that meets the needs of its intended audience, the 
  "average targetted user" of the tool has the necessary skills appropriate 
  for that type of tool.  In today's environment, most authors will not have 
  the appropriate knowledge to create accessible content and it is up to the 
  tool to help them via methods appropriate to the type of authoring tool.
  </proposal>
  
  ... rest of text from priority section....
