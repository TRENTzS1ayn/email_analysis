aloha, ian!

your points are all well taken, and i would fully support your
outline-for-action -- namely to insert the disclaimers you drafted to the lists
of tools (as well as the list of user agents for UA web space) 

QUOTE
1) Any list of conforming tools indicate that this is not the
   definitive list of conforming tools nor an advertisement
   for particular tools. It's just a convenient repository.

2) Any entry on the list clearly indicate whether W3C has
   "validated" the claim or not. Whether W3C chooses to validate
   claims at all is another matter for the CG.
UNQUOTE

and to approach the CG on the issue of what constitutes a W3C Validated claim
(which may well be an impossibility, as parsing HTML or XML to ensure that
everything is nested properly is one thing, but checking for the accessibility
of a tool and the content it produces involves more complicated and
sophisticated heuristics, and often necessitate human interpretation slash
reveiw)
