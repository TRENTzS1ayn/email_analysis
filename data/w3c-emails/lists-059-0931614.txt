I would propose two changes:

1) I think the explanation about the "average user" should go at
   the end of section 1.2, after the [Relative Priority] description.

2) I propose the following text:

   <PROPOSAL>
      When considering strategies for meeting the goal of an
      accessible user interface, tool developers should follow
      principles they should always follow: strive to meet the needs of
      novice, experienced, and power users, but focus on the middle
group 
      and assume that these users will be familiar with the tool's user 
      interface. On the other hand, when considering strategies 
      for meeting the goal of encouraging the creation of 
      accessible content, assume that the author knows very 
      little about accessibility issues or their solutions.
   </PROPOSAL>
