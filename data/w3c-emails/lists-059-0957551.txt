KLB:

You forgot one of the best ways to check this -- asking someone with
a disability to try to use the site!  All the automatic checks in the
world won't tell you anything if a blind user can't navigate or a
deaf user can't access content!

KLB:

Wording nitpicks -- we should avoid words like "obvious" (if it's 
obvious, we don't need to say it's obvious!) and impractical which
imply value judgments and may not be true over the lifetime of the
document.

KLB:

That looks okay to me.  I would say "many authors" perhaps -- perhaps
it's just optimistic thinking on my part, but I hope that in the future
(over the lifetime of this document) things will really start to change
for the better!

KLB:

Well, I think it's clear (from member comments) that we need to show
we have addressed this issue in some way, at least.  Otherwise it looks
like an omission that discredits the document.

Your suggestion may be one way to do this.

No disagreement in principle.
