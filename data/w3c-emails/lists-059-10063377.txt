PROPOSED:
1.1 Ensure that the author can produce accessible content in the markup
language(s) or content type(s) supported by the tool. [Priority 1] 
At minimum, provide a code editing view that will accept manually-coded
accessibility content and ensure that this content is preserved as per
Checkpoint 1.2. 

WL's point: We are suggesting a UI implementation without specifically
saying that it should be accessible.

JR, CMN: 7.1 already covers the accessibility of the tool. JR: Besides,
we're not telling them to do a drag-and-drop solution for which
accessibility would be a major concern - we're talking about text
editing.

CMN's point: At minimum is misleading. Tools don't have to do this. We
might say "The simplest way to meet this is..."

Cheers,
Jan
