Proposal for the at minimum bit:
At minimum allow the author to add or edit any element or property supported
by the content type specification.

Note that this is close to the requirement of checkpoint 7.3 - is that
redundant? (the fact that that has to be in an accessible fashion is already
covered by 7.1)

  At minimum, provide a code editing view that will accept manually-coded
  accessibility content and ensure that this content is preserved as per
  Checkpoint 1.2.

  WL's point: We are suggesting a UI implementation without specifically
  saying that it should be accessible.

  JR, CMN: 7.1 already covers the accessibility of the tool. JR: Besides,
  we're not telling them to do a drag-and-drop solution for which
  accessibility would be a major concern - we're talking about text
  editing.

  CMN's point: At minimum is misleading. Tools don't have to do this. We
  might say "The simplest way to meet this is..."

  Cheers,
