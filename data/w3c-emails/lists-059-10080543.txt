The proposal is to have the next face to face meeting in Amsterdam, around
18-20 June. There are HTML meetings immediately afterwards, and Xforms
meetings concurrent, and it is proposed that WCAG and ERT would meet also, so
we could spend some time jointly meeting (resolve the AERT issues left with
WCAG, and look into EARL again with ERT if there has been progress there) as
well as potentially spending a little time with the HTML and Xforms groups.

Who would be able to attend?

If people can not attend, do you have a suggestion for something else which
you could attend.

Note: This is a rough proposal at this stage for a meeting in the middle of
the year. I am putting it out because we need to settle on a date soon to
allow for the necessary 8 weeks notice. There is unlikely to be another
plenary meeting in Europe in November, although there is a possiblity of a
meeting in Australia with WCAG and perhaps PF at that time.

Cheers

Charles
