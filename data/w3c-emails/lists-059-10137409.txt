Janice Hertz (my boss) has discussed with Judy Brewer, the limited scope
of Microsoft participate in all WAI face-to-face meetings until around
July.  At this time, Microsoft will not plan to send anyone to the
proposed meeting.  Alternatives are being discussed directly with Judy
Brewer.

Subject:Face to face meeting proposal

The proposal is to have the next face to face meeting in Amsterdam,
around
18-20 June. There are HTML meetings immediately afterwards, and Xforms
meetings concurrent, and it is proposed that WCAG and ERT would meet
also, so
we could spend some time jointly meeting (resolve the AERT issues left
with
WCAG, and look into EARL again with ERT if there has been progress
there) as
well as potentially spending a little time with the HTML and Xforms
groups.

Who would be able to attend?

If people can not attend, do you have a suggestion for something else
which
you could attend.

Note: This is a rough proposal at this stage for a meeting in the middle
of
the year. I am putting it out because we need to settle on a date soon
to
allow for the necessary 8 weeks notice. There is unlikely to be another
plenary meeting in Europe in November, although there is a possiblity of
a
meeting in Australia with WCAG and perhaps PF at that time.

Cheers

Charles
