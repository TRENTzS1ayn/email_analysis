good lord willin' & the crick don't rise (again), count me in...
personally, i wouldn't mind attending a suite of WAI face2face meetings that
week in june, which means that i'd prefer not to have overlapping meetings,
such as those that were held surrounding the W3C plenary this
february/march, save for when WGs are scheduled to meet in concert...  i
hate having to choose from amongst competing meetings--i'd rather attend
four or five day's worth of meetings and get a hell of a lot accomplished
(especially after traveling a distance) than to have to choose between
working group meetings...  moreover, i think that the WAI as a whole would
benefit from allowing members of other WAI/W3C working groups to sit in on
face2face meetings when their WG isn't meeting, or when they live close
enough to the venue for it to be practical--it worked well for the User
Agent WG at the plenary, and would do much to promote cross-fertilization of
ideas, as well as providing observers with a clearer picture of WG
dependencies...

just my 5 cents (american)
gregory.
