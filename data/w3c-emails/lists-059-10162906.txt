Regarding the subtext for 1.3. During our discussions last conference 
call, we  seemed to be  saying several things:

1. When the tool automatically adds markup without the author 
choosing the type of markup or the actual markup, it should be 
accessible.
2. When the tool automatically chooses the type of markup or file 
format it should choose the most  accessible markup type or format (a 
variant of 5.2).
3. The tool must go with the author's choice if the author chooses a 
markup type that is not optimal for access.

I propose the following draft subtext:

Any decisions made for the author by the tool should optimize the 
accessibility of the content (as per WCAG 2.0). This applies to the 
choice of markup type, file type, and markup practices. If the author 
chooses a markup or file type that does not optimize accessibility, 
Guideline 4 should be implemented.
