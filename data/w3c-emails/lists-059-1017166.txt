This is correct. (And it is a known bug - hopefully it will be fixed in the
next release, due very soon)

  I believe that the only reason ATAG declares the HTML 4.0 loose DTD is
  that
  Amaya keeps putting that declaration at the top of the file. I've put
  the strict DTD there with emacs, but when Charles edits with Amaya,
  it reverts to transitional. I consider this a bug.
