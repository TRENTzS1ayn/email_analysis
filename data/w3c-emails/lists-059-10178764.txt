I think these icons are very nice, well done graphically, nice to look at. One little problem I see though: they're so similar in overall shape that you have to look at tiny details to see their difference (and semantics) - which sort of defeats the purpose of having an icon in the first place, I think. (Sorry Matthias!)

I'm attaching my "programming" icon in two sizes. BMP format, but they can easily be converted to PNG or GIF. These were designed (together with a set of other icons) to be easily recognizable and discernable even at the small 16x16 icon size (as used in trees and "small icons" displays on Windows).

Cheers,
