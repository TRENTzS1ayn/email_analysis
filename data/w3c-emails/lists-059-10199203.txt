no problem - its just a sketch.
My pen and the hand are pretty much redundant. In this sense your 
icon is much better. It focuses on the distinguishing aspects. I?ve 
also tried to eliminate the bright colors to make the icons less 
dominant.
I?d like to stick with the shape. Because this conveys "application".

A lot of constraints need to be evaluated if you design icons. I will 
give it another try.

stay tuned :>
