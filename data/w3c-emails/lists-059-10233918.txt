This makes sense, but I don't think that the final reference to guideline 4
is required - it should be implemented anyway...

So I would propose the following:

  Any decisions made for the author by the tool should optimize the
  accessibility of the content (as per WCAG 2.0). This applies to the
  choice of markup type, file type, and markup practices.

  Regarding the subtext for 1.3. During our discussions last conference
  call, we  seemed to be  saying several things:

  1. When the tool automatically adds markup without the author
  choosing the type of markup or the actual markup, it should be
  accessible.
  2. When the tool automatically chooses the type of markup or file
  format it should choose the most  accessible markup type or format (a
  variant of 5.2).
  3. The tool must go with the author's choice if the author chooses a
  markup type that is not optimal for access.

  I propose the following draft subtext:

  Any decisions made for the author by the tool should optimize the
  accessibility of the content (as per WCAG 2.0). This applies to the
  choice of markup type, file type, and markup practices. If the author
  chooses a markup or file type that does not optimize accessibility,
  Guideline 4 should be implemented.
