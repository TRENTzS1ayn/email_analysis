Will be held in Amsterdam, during the week of 18 June 2001. Most likely dates
for the AU meetings are thursday and Friday of that week, being 21 and 22
June, following a WCAG meeting in the same place. We anticipate opportunities
to work with WCAG, HTML and Xform working groups, although some of that would
be done before the AU meeting - for example on the wednesday

More information shortly
