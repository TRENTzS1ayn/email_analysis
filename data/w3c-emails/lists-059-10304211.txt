Interesting... In fact I've just started to adopt the pair "at minimum - ideally" for specifications and similar I write (or add commnets to) for Macromedia. And pointed this out to my colleagues as a nice, "human-readable" way to distinguish priority levels...

I think it's important to make a difference between WAI guidelines and techniques. Guidelines, if well formulated, do *not* tell anyone "how" to implement something, just a minimal requirement for functionality. "At minimum" in this context should indicate that such functionality should -somehow- be provided; if not, there is no conformance. If you're talking about a "more advanced solution", then "solution" means technique to me. As long as that implementation technique meets the functional requirement of the "at minimum" in the guideline, it conforms.

As I see it, "at minimum" would not lower the bar in any way. It just tells you what you have to conform to - not how. We still have P1. P2 and P3. Well formulated, "at minimum" would be the same for all products, not something totally different for different products. Example: If we say that "at minimum" you have to provide a way to navigate the structure of the document being edited, that does not tell anyone how to do that. A structure view would be a nice solution, but find-find again would work, too (just not as nice).

Short comments below.

A minimum is just that. You are always free to have a "higher" standard.

Yes. Techniques give only suggestions for how something could be implemented. Only guidelines should use "at minimum".

Well-formulated guidelines apply to all technologies they say they apply to.

An advanced solution would implement the minimum.
