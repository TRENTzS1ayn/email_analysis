When you said "guidelines or sub text" Heather, did you mean to say ATAG or
the techniques or both?

I've found at IBM that I do in fact have to suggest "at a minimum" also for
techniques, using phrases like: at a minimum one or more of the following
techniques need to be implemented to meet the accessibility standard for x
y z.

Please see examples in the IBM Hardware Accessibility checklist at
http://www.ibm.com/able/accesshardware.html   These were just updated,
software and web will be up on the site soon as well.

I do NOT recommend this for ATAG, it's IBM, 508, and others that get to
decide what part of the W3C standard that they want to "at a minimum"
implement.
