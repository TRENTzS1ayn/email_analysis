One point might be that we might "what if" ourselves to death. The chance 
that such a "product" would be possible is close enough to nil that we 
shouldn't be concerned with it.

Another point is that there's the "in the meanwhile" problem - until such a 
benevolent company actually could show that there is some undercover 
content production that is successful in: producing accessible content; 
doing so without revealing how/what the process is, there is still a need 
to check and see if that particular fox is really guarding those particular 
hens, if you take my meaning.
