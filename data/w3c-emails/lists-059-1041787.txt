I tink that this text should go into the section on relative priorities in
the definition of priorities. I also think it could be shortened somewhat -
in particular I would drop the last sentence.

  Here is some proposed text regarding support being relative to the tool:
  
  "All authoring tools should support all applicable Web Content Guideline
  checkpoints, the nature of that support is relative to the look and feel of
  the authoring tool, the expected skill level of the author using the tool,
  and the properties of the WCAG checkpoint. In some cases support can be
  provided automatically, without the need for explicit author participation,
  in other cases human judgement is required and support is provided by the
  tool in the form of prompts and documentation. This continuum will differ
  greatly between a tool that requires manual input of markup by the author
  and a tool that completely hides the mechanics of generating web content
  from the author."
  
  I will try to come up with good illustrative examples to include in these
  sentences.
