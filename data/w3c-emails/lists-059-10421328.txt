I think that the Working group does need to specify what "at a minimum" can
satisfy the requirements of a checkpoint. The interpretation done by other
organisations to meet further needs  of theirs is additional to the
requirements which this working group addresses in our own work.

  When you said "guidelines or sub text" Heather, did you mean to say ATAG or
  the techniques or both?

  I've found at IBM that I do in fact have to suggest "at a minimum" also for
  techniques, using phrases like: at a minimum one or more of the following
  techniques need to be implemented to meet the accessibility standard for x
  y z.

  Please see examples in the IBM Hardware Accessibility checklist at
  http://www.ibm.com/able/accesshardware.html   These were just updated,
  software and web will be up on the site soon as well.

  I do NOT recommend this for ATAG, it's IBM, 508, and others that get to
  decide what part of the W3C standard that they want to "at a minimum"
  implement.
