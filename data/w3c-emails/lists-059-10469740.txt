URI again: http://www.w3.org/2001/04/atag-icon-check

I have fixed it up, put in Jan's icons so they work, put in longdesc links
(but still need to put in the longdescs at the other end), and mixed the
different icon sets through a bit to compare better in context.

I  have started a thread on WCAG to see if there is any accessibility issue
raised about how to make / use icons -  - please follow the discussion there.

cheers

Charles

PS Matthias, if you produce new icons can you please give them new URIs - it
would be useful to keep the old ones where they are for discussion purposes.
