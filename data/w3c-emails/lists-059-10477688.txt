Conversion tools.

Tools which take pre-existing content and convert it to another format.
Examples include tools such as gif2png, rtf2html, Web Transit, html2ps, and
others. These are tools wich do not include a facility for editing the source
format, although they may be used as a tool in conjunction with an editing
tool for the target format.

I am not sure if these are seperate from content management tools or not - I
think they are.

Cheers

Chaals
