So I got excited and I made an icon for it:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/sources/techimages/icons/convert (I haven't put it
into anything  yet - either the icon or the concept in a techniques draft.

  Conversion tools.

  Tools which take pre-existing content and convert it to another format.
  Examples include tools such as gif2png, rtf2html, Web Transit, html2ps, and
  others. These are tools wich do not include a facility for editing the source
  format, although they may be used as a tool in conjunction with an editing
  tool for the target format.

  I am not sure if these are seperate from content management tools or not - I
  think they are.

  Cheers
