Jan,
  
   The problem with the small icons is that on my screen, 600x800
resolution, the small ones are too small to tell what they are. I really
couldn't compare them well. On a higher resolution, they will turn into
pinheads. 

Yes, the larger  icons will move the line over, not much for a single
icon, but perhaps more on a line where all four icons are displayed. At
32x32 it won't occupy more than half the line yet, so I don't think visual
readability will be impacted, but I could be wrong.
