Not at my best in formulating English right now - maybe I'm just tired <g/>

Anyway, here's a draft proposal, subject to better wording, but I hope the intention is clear enough:

---
6.3 In a dedicated section, document the process of producing accessible content. [Priority 3]
At minimum, provide an overview of tags and attributes that are required for or enhance accessibility. Ideally, the text should explain which features help for which types of disability and tools; a general overview of steps to produce accessible content would be helpful.
---

Various techniques could help with that, one of them being:

At minimum: a "wrapper" document that lists tags and attributes and their function for accessibility, with links to a general HTML reference for syntax and context.

Cheers,
