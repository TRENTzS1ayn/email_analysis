Dear folks,

unless a member of the working group has a strong objection to us holding a
meeting, and raises it this week, the working group will have a face to face
meeting in Amsterdam on teh 18th and 19th of June. I will make a meeting page
available shortly. For people who are unable to attend in person it  is
possible that we will have telephone access, but note that the meeting will
be taking place in European business hours (naturally enough).

cheers

Charles
