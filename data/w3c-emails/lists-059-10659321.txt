These are my very rough notes - everyone elese's are appreciated.

Actions:
cmn - get draft out (next week)
cmn - find out about meeting (urgent)
cmn - find out about charter (urgent)
JT - ensure there is appropriate liaison with IMS (important / ongoing)

Discussion:

EARL

there is now draft vocabulary. there are examples, but we are waiting
for tools to output it and generate significant amount of example
material. CMN is thinking about how to use Annotea-type system to
enable multiple tools to work together with EARL (the real value). We
need to produce detailed techniques for using EARL.

Meeting

JT cannot make a meeting later in the week. Marjolein, Charles,
Gregory, Chris, Jan don't have any preferences. Heather, WL cannot make
a meeting in Europe, and at this stage Matthias can not either.

JT Believes Phill is planning to come.

Charter

Status unknown. CMN believes that we are going to get a charter and
hopes it will be announced soon. Believe that in theory we are not
supposed to publish TR documents without a charter, althojugh in
practice it can happen.

ATAG 2

CMN to publish a new draft, including existing 'at minimum' statements
we have worked over. Would like to have 'at minimum', and 'to do
better' in the checkpoint. Problem is where there are a whole lot of
different ways to do minimum and we don't have a good functional
description. As we develop the ATAG 2 we will try to generate
functional descriptions. there is a tension between being able to
provide relevant minima for different types of tools (which is good)
and having the techniques document inside the checkpoint (which is
bad). Unresolved at the moment - we will look at it in actual drafts.

Techniques

Not much progress either from AU or from WCAG/ER (for the AERT issues
list)

cheers

Charles
