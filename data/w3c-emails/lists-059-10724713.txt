18-19 it is. I hope you can find other people to represent IBM there.

Cheers, and sorry we will miss you

  I will not be able to participate (or be there) if it is still 18-19.  I
  would be able to attend latter that week or the next.  I'm also trying to
  involve other tool developers in IBM to participate.  I will report back by
  Monday.
