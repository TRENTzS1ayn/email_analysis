Dumb question, if I'm someone who works extensively in the field of
software for users who are visually impaired, and I make a special
purpose authoring tool for someone who can't see -- which relies 
on extensive aural cues (and doesn't work that well with a braille
terminal) -- have I met your goal or not met your goal?  It can be
used by (some) PWDs, but not all PWDs; is it therefore an invalid
tool according to our ATAG?

I forget, did we answer this?  If so, feel free to refer me back to
the archives or summarize an answer, we have enough stuff to worry
about at present if this has been covered.
