Designed well indeed.

Of course their meaning, as is the case with anything will only come from 
association with what they are intended to illuminate. "At the end of the 
day"/"in the morning"/"when all is said and done"/"after all the votes are 
counted"/ the only real factor of import is their acceptance in some 
context. E.g. the "strict" one is in an abstract way similar to the icon 
used to indicate some condition/action re elevator doors and I never 
remember whether the arrows pointing inward are to close the doors or to 
hold them open! But that's just me.

In the instant case I think they would serve splendidly and I hope will 
lead to a bevy/plethora/abundance/proliferation of such 
professional-looking items to accompany/illustrate/typify the contents of 
all our documents.

I would send them to GL where the main need for them is being recognized 
even though they don't specifically deal (at least in the designer's mind) 
with exemplifications therein.
