Hello all,

The following is an updated version of checkpoint 7.4. The "at minimum"
statement has been modified and a WSIWYG note has been added as per the
conversation on Monday.


7.4 Allow the display preferences of the authoring tool user interface
to be changed without affecting the document markup. [Priority?1] 

This checkpoint applies primarily to WYSIWYG markup editing tools and
requires that the author be able to view the content, as it is being
authored, in a way that differs from the presumed default appearance of
the rendered content. At minimum there must be some mechanism for
changing the document display independently of the document markup.
There are a number of ways that this can be achieved, including
supporting operating environment display preferences and allowing the
author to specify an editing style sheet that is different from those
included with the end document. In addition, there must be some means by
which textual alternatives can be displayed to the author in place of
non-text elements.
