Thanks Jan,

I am doing the editing of the new draft now, so this will make it in. I won't
finish it tonight though - I expect to have it out tomorrow evening European
time.

Cheers

Charles

  Hello all,

  The following is an updated version of checkpoint 7.4. The "at minimum"
  statement has been modified and a WSIWYG note has been added as per the
  conversation on Monday.


  7.4 Allow the display preferences of the authoring tool user interface
  to be changed without affecting the document markup. [Priority?1]

  This checkpoint applies primarily to WYSIWYG markup editing tools and
  requires that the author be able to view the content, as it is being
  authored, in a way that differs from the presumed default appearance of
  the rendered content. At minimum there must be some mechanism for
  changing the document display independently of the document markup.
  There are a number of ways that this can be achieved, including
  supporting operating environment display preferences and allowing the
  author to specify an editing style sheet that is different from those
  included with the end document. In addition, there must be some means by
  which textual alternatives can be displayed to the author in place of
  non-text elements.
