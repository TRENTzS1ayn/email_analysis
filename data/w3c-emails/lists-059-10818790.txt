(CWI can get a relatively cheap rate for us apparently. More information on
the WCAG meeting page
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2001/06/f2f-agenda.html#Logistics - hopefully the
network here will stay up now and I can update our page shortly.

But note the deadline in noon Tuesday Netherlands time - i.e. very early
morning for the US / Canada ( / South America, if anyone there is tinking of
coming...)

cheers

Charles

If people would like to book a room through CWI, note that you must send
them a note by the end of the day Monday.

CWI will try to get rooms through a booking agent.

It's my understanding that Amsterdam is very popular this time of year and
that rooms are scarce.  We are not guaranteed that the booking agent will
be successful, in which case we all might be on our own for booking hotel
rooms.

If you have not already sent your information, please send the following
information to w3c-netherlands@w3.org:
your name
the date and time you arrive in Amsterdam
how many nights you require a hotel room in Amsterdam

Thank you,
