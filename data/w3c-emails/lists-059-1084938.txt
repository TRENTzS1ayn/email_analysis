No, you haven't met the goal. You fail 7.1 by failing to make your tool
generaly accessible (probably by a failure to use standard components and
APIs, which would be a way of stopping the braille from working).

  Dumb question, if I'm someone who works extensively in the field of
  software for users who are visually impaired, and I make a special
  purpose authoring tool for someone who can't see -- which relies 
  on extensive aural cues (and doesn't work that well with a braille
  terminal) -- have I met your goal or not met your goal?  It can be
  used by (some) PWDs, but not all PWDs; is it therefore an invalid
  tool according to our ATAG?
  
  I forget, did we answer this?  If so, feel free to refer me back to
  the archives or summarize an answer, we have enough stuff to worry
  about at present if this has been covered.
