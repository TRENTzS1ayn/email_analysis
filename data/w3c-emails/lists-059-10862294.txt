Hi ATAG,
 This is Katie from WCAG.  I am introducing to this group a potential ATAG
WG member, David Wright. He will be sending a request to join to AU soon.
Shortly before Len passed away he asked me to help him find some Flash and
Macromedia people to not only come to his PIAT conference in November, but
also to get some of those folks represented on one or more of the Working
Groups.  The communication got started between him and the Macromedia
people, but I am not sure if he ever spoke with Dave, though he was
interested in him.  It all switched into Jan Knuth's (his associate at
Temple) hands once Len went into the hospital.  Excerpts of our email below.
I will be contacting the Macromedia folks this week.

Hi again katie,

We're putting together a statewide conference on access to Information
Technology Nov 7-8 and I'm having a panel on platforms... including java,
windows/msaa, pdf, linux, and flash.  The questions to people on the panel
will concern will be how accessible applications built upon them can be,
and the effort needed by programmers to provide the accessibility.

Do you have any suggestions on who I could ask from macromedia to talk
about flash?

Katie,

Well, it will be a few weeks before I can talk with him, since I'll be
off-line, but I'd suggest he look at the various groups in wai and see
which one is most interesting.  Hmmm.  Both guidelines and authoring tools
could use input from a person who authors in flash.

Just got off the phone with Steven Thorne @ Macromedia.  He is the 508

<Jan's email>
Also, by reading again the email messages you sent and one that Len sent to
Francis Hines at Macromedia, I learned that Len does want someone to talk
about Flash in the conference.  That makes David Wright very pertinent to
the
conference planning.
