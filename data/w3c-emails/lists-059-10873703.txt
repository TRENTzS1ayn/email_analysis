We are trying to find an appropriate name for our working draft 
revision of ATAG 1.0. Charles has suggested ATAG 1.9 as we are still 
referring to WCAG 1.0 until the draft WCAG 2.0 becomes more stable, 
but whatever we do will form the substantive basis of ATAG 2.0. 
Another alternative is ATAG 1.1 or simply an arbitrary name like 
"Wombat." What are people's thoughts?
