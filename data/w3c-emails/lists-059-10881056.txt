Bit more background - there are perception problems with a number, in that if
we say 1.1 then I don't think it conveys the fact that this is more or less
our expected 2.0 draft, and if we say 1.9 then people will wonder what
happened to 1.1 through 1.8. So the easiest thing is to have a name, hence
"wombat" as a proposal. (Because animals are relatively uncontroversial).

One of the reasons I would like people to scream now or hold their peace is
that I want to publish this so you guys can look at it before the next
meeting.

cheers

  We are trying to find an appropriate name for our working draft
  revision of ATAG 1.0. Charles has suggested ATAG 1.9 as we are still
  referring to WCAG 1.0 until the draft WCAG 2.0 becomes more stable,
  but whatever we do will form the substantive basis of ATAG 2.0.
  Another alternative is ATAG 1.1 or simply an arbitrary name like
  "Wombat." What are people's thoughts?
