Dear folks,

at long last the new draft has been published.
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/wombat/010523 is the specific dated version. I have
not really updated the change history yet - I will do that tomorrow I hope.

Please make proposals for change based on the latest draft available -
currently the URI above points to the latest, but
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/wombat will point to whatever the latest is for some
time to come.

cheers, and thanks for waiting

Charles McCN
