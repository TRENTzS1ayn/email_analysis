Proposed change to 1.2:
"Ensure the tool preserves all accessibility information during
transformations and conversions".

 The minimum requirement is to ensure that all information provided in the
 pre-conversion document or fragment is provided in the result. It is
 possible that this is not reversible. Better tools will use markup, such as
 RDF, to record the transformation and ensure reversibility. Note that this
 checkpoint covers importing from a format the tool does not use.

Rationale: There are two parts here - automatic (more or less)
transformations, and general authoring. As far as I can tell general
authoring is already covered in about half of the other checkpoints, and it
would be good to call out the fact that this is expecially relevant for
transformations. In particular, I think that being explicit about this in the
minimum requirements is important.
