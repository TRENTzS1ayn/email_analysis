proposed at minimum:
At minimum ensure that each example used is an accessible example. Note that
examples may be multi-part, so showing how to add an image in 5 steps,
including as step 4 or 5 adding alternative content, would meet this
checkpoint, but leaving the addition of alternative content to a different
section would not.


Issue: to what level should the content meet WCAG (since that is our
definition of be accessible)? Suggest level double-A, and I think that should
probably be in the checkpoint text.
