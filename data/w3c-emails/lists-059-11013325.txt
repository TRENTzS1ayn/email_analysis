Hello all,

Suggested revision to CMN's proposal for 4.4 subtext (The change brings
the subtext in line with the style of the Section 7 subtext):

This checkpoint is intended to encourage authoring tools to notify
authors of accessibility problems in a coherent way. At minimum, provide
a list of the problems by type. More advanced implementations might
integrate the summary with the tool's repair functionality to increase
the flexibility with which problems can be corrected (see checkpoint
4.2).

> At minimum, provide a list of the accesssibility problems by type. Better
> tools will integrate this functionality with repair functionality (see
> checkpoint 4.2)
