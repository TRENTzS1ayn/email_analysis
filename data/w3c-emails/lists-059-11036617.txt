  6.1 Document all features that promote the production of accessible

Proposed:
  This checkpoint promotes the production of accessible content by helping
  authors learn how to use the accessibility related features of the tool.
  At minimum, the tool should include documentation explaining the purpose
  and use each of these features. More advanced implementations might
  provide context-senstive links to this content from within the authoring
  tool user interface.

Issue - note that this is pretty close to what is required as the minimum for
4.2 (except there is the priority difference)
