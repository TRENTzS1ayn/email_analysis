Following the meeting Monday I have updated the draft - new draft is dated
May 30, and is available at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/wombat/010530

Changes list is up to date at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/changes - changes
for this draft (from the last one) are as follows:

- "authoring" removed from checkpoint 1.2
- New subtext for checkpoints 1.2, 1.5, 4.3, 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3
- Checkpoint 4.4 renumbered as checkpoint 4.3 (there was no 4.3)
- New definition of "prompt" as per errata to ATAG 1.0

plus a few minor typos fixed, and the glossary links in the checklist should
work better now. I have also started to mark issues inline. I am hoping that
W3C will have some significantly better (than hand tracking) issue-tracking
systems available very soon, and we can use those.

Please check for spelling errors, mistakes, and make proposals as suggested
changes to this draft.

cheers

Charles
