They are close, but not that close. The 6.1 minimum addresses
documentation of the features of a tool that benefit accessibility,
whereas the 4.2 minimum is about explaining the accessibility errors
found by the checker and then explaining how to fix them (which may or
may not involve using special accessibility features of the tool).

Example: An image input dialog has an "alt" field.

6.1 documentation might say=> The image dialog has an "alt" field for
the required alt text.

4.2 documentation might say=> Missing alt text: Open the image dialog
and write a short description of the image in the "alt" field. If the
image is serving as a bullet then use the word "bullet", .... etc.
