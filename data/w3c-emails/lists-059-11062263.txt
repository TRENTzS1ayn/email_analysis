  They are close, but not that close. The 6.1 minimum addresses
  documentation of the features of a tool that benefit accessibility,
  whereas the 4.2 minimum is about explaining the accessibility errors
  found by the checker and then explaining how to fix them (which may or
  may not involve using special accessibility features of the tool).

  Example: An image input dialog has an "alt" field.

  6.1 documentation might say=> The image dialog has an "alt" field for
  the required alt text.

  4.2 documentation might say=> Missing alt text: Open the image dialog
  and write a short description of the image in the "alt" field. If the
  image is serving as a bullet then use the word "bullet", .... etc.
