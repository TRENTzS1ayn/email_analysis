  I am actually trying to attend this meeting on Monday.  Since I haven't
  participated in a call in a while, I had forgotten how long they last.  I
  searched the AU page [1] and found the current meetings, but all the links
  are dead - ? I then searched the PAST WORK page [2] and couldn't find
  anything more recent that 23 Jan 2001- ? So I looked in the w3c-wai-au
  archives and couldn't find any mention of time length of meeting.  So, I
  went back to the AU home page and did find the text that says "for 60
  minutes", so that answers my question, but can someone fix the other
  problems [dead links and missing minutes] I found? [no need to update past
  minutes with time information]
