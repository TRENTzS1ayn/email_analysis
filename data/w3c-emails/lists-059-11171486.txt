Hi William,

Thanks for recommending the paper. It's not that good anyway ;-) Well, 
it is the first time I am "a point in an agenda", but the objective of 
my presence in the AU meeting tomorrow is not to talk about me, but to 
talk about the WAI-DA project in Europe. WAI-DA is a project lead by 
Judy and Daniel, and co-financed by the European Commision. WAI-DA has 
several objectives, mainly related to WCAG and ATAG. In the meeting I 
would like to talk about ATAG, the part in which I am involved.

Regards,
carlos
