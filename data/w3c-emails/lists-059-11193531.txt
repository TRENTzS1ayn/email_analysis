Please note the time zone difference, and if you intend to only be there for
part of the time let us know which part of the time. 9am - 5pm Amsterdam time
is 3am - 11am US Eastern time which is midnight to 8am pacific time.

cheers

  Subject: Phone connection to face to face meeting.

  It is probable that we can arrange a telephone connection, to call in
  via a
  US bridge. Are there people who are unable to make the face to face
  meeting,
  but would like us to have this facility?

  Please respond as soon as possible - the decision will be made early
  next
  week.

  cheers
