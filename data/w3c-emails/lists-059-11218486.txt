Sean B. Palmer; I was on the majority of the teleconference.

N.B., there were some (unminuted) comments towards the end of the call
pertaining to the overlap 'twixt EARL and CC/PP. I'll be chasing that
up (consider it an action item). We do have a pointer in the EARL
vocabulary to the CC/PP settings of the assertor, but that's part of
the context information, and as with the majority of the EARL
vocabulary, we have left the details thereof up to the implementors.
