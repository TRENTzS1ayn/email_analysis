Hello all,

Here are some ideas for subtext:

4.1 Check for and inform the author of accessibility problems. [Relative
Priority]

This checkpoint requires at least some automation of accessibility
checking. At minimum, prompt the author to manually check for specific
problems. More advanced implementations might be automated to a high
extent, prompting the author rarely and flagging problems as they occur.

4.2 Assist authors in correcting accessibility problems. [Relative
Priority]

This checkpoint requires that, once accessibility problems have been
found, either automatically or manually, authoring tools help the author
to correct them properly. At minimum, provide context-sensitive help for
problems detected by the accessibility checking that is required by
checkpoint 4.1. More advanced implementations might provide the author
with automated or semi-automated correction tools, in addition to
guidelines and examples.
