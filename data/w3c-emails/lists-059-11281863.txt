Hi, I disagree that there is a requirement for some automation in 4.1, since
to me that suggests that prompting the authro for everything is not
sufficient to meet the checkpoint. For the rest I propose we incorporate as
is.

  Hello all,

  Here are some ideas for subtext:

  4.1 Check for and inform the author of accessibility problems. [Relative
  Priority]

  This checkpoint requires at least some automation of accessibility
  checking. At minimum, prompt the author to manually check for specific
  problems. More advanced implementations might be automated to a high
  extent, prompting the author rarely and flagging problems as they occur.

  4.2 Assist authors in correcting accessibility problems. [Relative
  Priority]

  This checkpoint requires that, once accessibility problems have been
  found, either automatically or manually, authoring tools help the author
  to correct them properly. At minimum, provide context-sensitive help for
  problems detected by the accessibility checking that is required by
  checkpoint 4.1. More advanced implementations might provide the author
  with automated or semi-automated correction tools, in addition to
  guidelines and examples.
