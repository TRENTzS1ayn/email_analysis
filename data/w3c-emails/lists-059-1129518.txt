So is it okay for it to be considerably much harder to use if you're
a PWD, as long as you can use it?  (Confirming, not challenging.)

If my mom wants to make a web page have a particular shade of blue

if she were blind, she'd have to learn RGB codes most likely.  This is
the distinction you're making, correct?
