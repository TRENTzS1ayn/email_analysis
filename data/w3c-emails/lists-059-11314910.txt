Hi Charles,

Actually, maybe we may need to re-think this checkpoint a bit. "Check
for and inform the author" seems to me to imply al least some level of
task automation on the part of the tool. But how much?

I think we would all agree that it is not sufficient to put the full
WCAG guideines and relevant techniques into the tool's help section for
the author's reference.

But, at the same time, we don't want to require that everything be
automated, since some of the WCAG guidelines are not reasonably machine
checkable at the current time.

In your message, you mention "prompting for everything" should be
sufficient to meet the checkpoint. Do you mean asking the user to
perform a number of specific manual checks?


Cheers,
Jan
