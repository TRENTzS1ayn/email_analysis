Hello,

today will be my last call.  I am sorry to say that I can no longer 
participate in the activities of the Web Accessibility Working Group 
for Authoring Tools.
This is due to internal reasons at Adobe and has nothing to do with 
any lost of interest in the accessibility discourse.  Worded 
differently I am out of the office until December because I take a 
sabbatical.

Let me say that I appreciate the style of discussion in this group 
very much. I wish you all the best and I hope to meet you again 
sometime, somewhere.

kind regards,
Matthias M?ller-Prove
