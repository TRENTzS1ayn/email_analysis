The minimum would be to ask the author to perform manual checks for each
WCAG item (at the various priority levels). I agree that that would result
in a horrid tool, but it would do the job better than many things people are
using at the moment. One optimisation would be to customise the checks.
Another is to automate parts of them. A good tool will do some of both and
more besides. And the question of what part of the workflow  this happens at
is orthogonal - if it happens the tool can pass, if it doesn't the tool
fails, and if it has to be configured to happen then the tool can only pass
in that configuration.

Cheers

CMN:Yep.
JR  But, at the same time, we don't want to require that everything be

  In your message, you mention "prompting for everything" should be
  sufficient to meet the checkpoint. Do you mean asking the user to
  perform a number of specific manual checks?
