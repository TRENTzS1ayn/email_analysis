Just a few questions:

1. Must a compliant tool start the check on its own? (i.e. after a save,
before publishing, on the 27th minute of editing, etc.) Or is it
sufficient to have a "Check Accessibility" item in the menu, or even a
"How to check accessibility" section in somewhere in the Help.

2. Is it sufficient to provide a copy of the applicable WCAG techniques
document? Or would a compliant system re-work the techniques to make it
easier to manually check one after another?

3. How is the "inform" part done? Is this implicit in the fact that the
author is the one who did the checks? Or should the tool allow the user
to record the status of each manual check as it is done and then use
this to inform them of the problems?
