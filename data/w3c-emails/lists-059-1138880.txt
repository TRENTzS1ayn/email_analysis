To: Authoring Tools Guidelines List<w3c-wai-au@w3.org>

mistakenly sent this only to kynn and not to the list earlier today...

aloha, kynn!

your hypothetical tool, which was created for a niche market (in this case,
users with no usable vision), would fail to comply to ATAG...

this is the same debate that recently raged in the User Agent Working Group --
if a browser is targeted towards a certain niche market, should it be exempt
from the checkpoints that cover interoperability and anything else that the
developers believe do not pertain to their products...

the answer is clearly and definitively, NO!!!

ATAG, like UAGL, address the base functionality for a certain classes of tools,
and if a developer wants to selectively pick and choose from the ATAG or UAGL
checkpoints, then he or she is free to do so -- they just can't claim
compliance at any level...

in that respect, the issue you raised is similar to that raised by bruce -- we
can't control what use people make of ATAG, but we can clearly articulate what
constitutes quote proper unquote use of the document and make the intent and
import of the checkpoints as clear as possible...
