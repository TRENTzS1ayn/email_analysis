There is a review of Frontpage 2002 by Kathleen Andersen in progress. She has
klindly agreed to make the prliminary work she has completed available.
Currently it is in Word 200 format (I don't have word installed, so haven't
been able to convert it - if anyone can please let me know) available from
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/reviews/frontpage/fp2002 (actually there seems to be
a mirroring problem holdiung that up - if you try straight away and it isn't
there, please try again in a bit.
