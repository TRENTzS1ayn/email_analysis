Jan asked some great questions, but I think we should discuss more on
Mondays conference call.

As for my 2 cents, I think having the information in help is the minimum
for meeting 4.2 but that 4.1 does require automation.  I'm also somewhat
unclear about the benefits of prompting the user to perform a manual
test.

I think that a menu option to run the check is OK (but we should talk
about
that further I suspect). Having the stuff in help only is definitely not
sufficient.

I think that providing the manual checks prompting as the WCAG checklist
is
sufficient (but a pretty painful interface). Any good system (there are
a few
examples on the market) will do better than that, reworking the
interface to
suit the tool, and relating it correctly to the WCAG requirements.

Where the user is required to participate in the testing the informing
is
done as part of that process, in general. Where there are automatic
tests it
must be by some other means...

my 2 cents worth...

  Just a few questions:

  1. Must a compliant tool start the check on its own? (i.e. after a
save,
  before publishing, on the 27th minute of editing, etc.) Or is it
  sufficient to have a "Check Accessibility" item in the menu, or even a
  "How to check accessibility" section in somewhere in the Help.

  2. Is it sufficient to provide a copy of the applicable WCAG
techniques
  document? Or would a compliant system re-work the techniques to make
it
  easier to manually check one after another?

  3. How is the "inform" part done? Is this implicit in the fact that
the
  author is the one who did the checks? Or should the tool allow the
user
  to record the status of each manual check as it is done and then use
  this to inform them of the problems?
