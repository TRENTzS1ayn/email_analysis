Do we want authoring tools to interpret the work that the WAI has done?
Or are we trying to get authoring tools to document the features and
methods they support in order to adhere to the WAI Web content
guidelines?

Not at my best in formulating English right now - maybe I'm just tired
<g/>

Anyway, here's a draft proposal, subject to better wording, but I hope
the intention is clear enough:

---
6.3 In a dedicated section, document the process of producing accessible
content. [Priority 3]
At minimum, provide an overview of tags and attributes that are
required for or enhance accessibility. Ideally, the text should explain
which features help for which types of disability and tools; a general
overview of steps to produce accessible content would be helpful.
---

Various techniques could help with that, one of them being:

At minimum: a "wrapper" document that lists tags and attributes and
their function for accessibility, with links to a general HTML reference
for syntax and context.

Cheers,
