I agree that the minimum for 6.3 should not be

At minimum, provide an overview of the tags and attributes
that are required to enhance accessibility.

but as Heather suggests, point to WCAG.  Here is my proposal:

At minimum, provide an overview of the tags and attributes
that are support by the authoring tool and link to the latest
W3C WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and techniques.

Subject:  6.3: RE: checkpoints 6.1,6.2,6.3



I always thought the minimum for checkpoint 6.3 would be for an
authoring tools documentation to inform the author above the WAI Web
content accessibility guidelines and provide a pointer to their latest
documentation. Checkpoint 6.1 provides for documenting the accessibility
features and methods of that particular authoring tool.

Hello all,

To follow up on today's call, here's my take on checkpoints 6.1, 6.2,
6.3.


6.1 Document all features that promote the production of accessible
content. [Priority 1]

This checkpoint promotes the production of accessible content by helping
authors learn how to use the accessibility related features of the tool.
At minimum, the tool should include documentation explaining the purpose
and use each of these features. More advanced implementations might
provide context-senstive links to this content from within the authoring
tool user interface.

---

6.2 Ensure that creating accessible content is a naturally integrated
part of the documentation, including examples. [Priority 2]

This checkpoint promotes the production of accessible content by
implicitly demonstrating to the author that all content, regardless of
purpose, should comply with the WCAG guidelines. At minimum, all
documented examples of the authoring tool interface (i.e. dialog boxes,
code views, etc.) should include any relevant accessible authoring
practices.

---

6.3 In a dedicated section, document the process of producing accessible
content. [Priority 3]

This checkpoint promotes the production of accessible content by
explicitly informing the author of the steps they need to take (using
the the features of the tool documented for Checkpoint 6.1) to satisfy
this goal. At minimum, provide an overview of the tags and attributes
that are required to enhance accessibility. The documentation for each
feature might explain which disability groups and user agents benefit
from its use.
