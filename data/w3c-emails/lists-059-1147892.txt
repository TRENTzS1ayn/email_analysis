the following bounced back to me, apparently while the W3C's server was
down...  interesting thing is that the rejection notice came from
www19.w3.org.by way of sophia.inria.fr

anyway, i sent this whilst still on hold with my bank, shortly before
today's meeting commenced...

aloha, charles!

i do feel strongly that

quote
  having a conformance level available which allows a tool
  to get some kind of endorsement without meeting our aims is automatically a
  violation of our charter.
unquote

it all falls under the heading appropriate use, and what use a particular
developer makes of ATAG is up to that developer...  only when they slap a
conformance claim on their web site or on their boxes can we take action,
although what form that action might take, i know not...  (cherchez la vache!)
