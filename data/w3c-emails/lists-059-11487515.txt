Phone number is +1 617 258 7910

That is the agenda as far as we know, except that Graham Oliver, who did the
lotus evaluation, has agreed to spend some time on the phone talking about
it. Since he is in New Zealand I am expecting early morning European time to
be best, but there have been problems with the W3C web servers apparently so
he has not been able to confirm yet.

Phill, we will be expecting you to dial in from 1:30 both days?

Also, if there are any problems, you can call my mobile phone +61 409 134 136

cheers

Charles
