I am expecting Graham and Phill to be there at 1:30 pm (Amsterdam time)
Tuesday.

We will plan to talk about evaluating tools, and the Lotus evaluation in
particular.

cheers

Charles

Otherwise, please feel free to call me on my mobile +61 409 134 136

  That is the agenda as far as we know, except that Graham Oliver, who did the
  lotus evaluation, has agreed to spend some time on the phone talking about
  it. Since he is in New Zealand I am expecting early morning European time to
  be best, but there have been problems with the W3C web servers apparently so
  he has not been able to confirm yet.

  Phill, we will be expecting you to dial in from 1:30 both days?

  Also, if there are any problems, you can call my mobile phone +61 409 134 136

  cheers
