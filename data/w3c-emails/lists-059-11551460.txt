4.1 Assist the author to check for accessibility problems

This checkpoint requires the tool to provide the author with a utility that 
simplifies the process of checking documents for accessibility problems.

At minimum, this utility must provide at least one, automated or manual, check 
for each and every WCAG 2.0 checkpoint. This utility must be designed so that 
it always displays those questions pertaining to "In General" WCAG 2.0 
checkpoints, but only displays those "conditional" WCAG 2.0 checkpoints that 
have their conditions fulfilled by the document.


DEFINE:
"conditional" 2.0 checkpoints
"in general" 2.0 checkpoints
