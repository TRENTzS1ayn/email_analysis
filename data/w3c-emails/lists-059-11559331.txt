Except that for now we are still referring to WCAG 1, this looks good to me.

  4.1 Assist the author to check for accessibility problems

  This checkpoint requires the tool to provide the author with a utility that
  simplifies the process of checking documents for accessibility problems.

  At minimum, this utility must provide at least one, automated or manual, check
  for each and every WCAG 2.0 checkpoint. This utility must be designed so that
  it always displays those questions pertaining to "In General" WCAG 2.0
  checkpoints, but only displays those "conditional" WCAG 2.0 checkpoints that
  have their conditions fulfilled by the document.


  DEFINE:
  "conditional" 2.0 checkpoints
  "in general" 2.0 checkpoints
