(well, I guess we'd restart the numbering at 5.1, but anyway...)

This is based on the idea that it is OK to wait for the user to initiate
testing, but only if it is clear to them how this is done, following this
afternoon's discussion.

5.x Ensure that the functionalities for checkpoints 3.1, 3.2 and 4.1 are
alwways clearly available to the user [Priority 1]
Rationale: The user must be easily able to turn on accessibility support
functionality
Minimum (required basic functionality): Where the checking is intiated by the
tool, this is satisfied. Where it is initiated by the author, the menu or
button to initiate the function must be a visible part of the main user
interface
More advanced (suggested): Allow the user to configure this to happen on a
schedule or at user request
See also: techniques, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1

Issue: Should the checking things be labelled "accessibility" or something (I
think not)?

Cheers

Chaals
