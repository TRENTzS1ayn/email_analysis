None of the screen shots seemed to come through - after checking one I found that that link referred to a file on soemone's local drive ;-) Probably the same for all but I didn't go on and check all.
For example:
file:///F:/domino_atag_g123_v1%20Folder/Image5.gif
(Even then there shouldn't be a space in the URL either; in some browsers at least that will cause problems.)
