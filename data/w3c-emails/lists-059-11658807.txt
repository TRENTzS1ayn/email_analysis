An associate of mine reviewed the evaluation that Charles sent and in
general agree with the comments and assessment.  Many of the items were
known (can't specify table headers, no accessibility checking, some
database templates shipped with Domino are not accessible) and some she had
not paid attention to ("optional" label on the alternate text for applets,
generating standard markup).  There were some items that she didn't think
applied to Designer (providing text equivalents for sounds, stand-alone
audio files, audio tracks of video).  It also mentioned the Domino Import
Service which she has not seen or used.

Whoops, my bad. (Actually that's just to make everyone get the same
feeling,
absent any long descriptions...)

found that that link referred to a file on soemone's local drive ;-)
Probably the same for all but I didn't go on and check all.
  For example:
  file:///F:/domino_atag_g123_v1%20Folder/Image5.gif
  (Even then there shouldn't be a space in the URL either; in some browsers
at least that will cause problems.)
