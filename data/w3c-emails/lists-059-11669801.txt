6.1 covers describing the accessibility features, but not methods (process).
That is 6.3 and would include documenting whatever work-arounds are required
to get the tool to produce WCAG-conformant content - for example how to add a
DOCTYPE to produce valid markup, or how to add a longdesc using a tool that
doesn't support it.

  documentation. Checkpoint 6.1 provides for documenting the accessibility
  features and methods of that particular authoring tool.
