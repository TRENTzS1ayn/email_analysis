Hi Giorgio,

the Wombat draft of 22 June was published on 22 June, or are you interested
in waiting until the techniques documet gets republished? Anyway, I think it
is likely to be very useful if a developer does an evaluation, and asks the
group about things that were unclear. They are often able to do them faster
because they know more about the software (but not always) ;-)

And welcome to the group!

cheers

Charles McCN

  Hi Charles.

  I asked to join the group just now and thought of doing the
  evaluation of dreamweaver+508 accessibility suite.

  It might be an interesting exercise of a developer doing an auto
  evaluation.

  I'll do it as soon as the revised wombat document is ready.

  Cheers,

     Giorgio
