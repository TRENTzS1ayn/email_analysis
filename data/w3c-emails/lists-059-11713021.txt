Good morning,

At the meeting, I said I'd send a proposal for how to rework the
checkpoints in section 3. My proposal condenses the requirements down to
2 checkpoints. The first is a P1 that addresses "how do I use the
accessibility related features of this tool?". The second is a P2 that
addresses the general "how do I make documents in this language
accesssible?". Some of the other things have been worked in as minimum
or advanced requirements of these.

6.1 Document features of the tool that promote the production of
accessible content. [Priority 1] 

Rationale: Documenting each accessibility related feature of the tool
(dialog boxes, utility, code views, etc.) will help authors to learn how
to use them effectively.

Minimum functionality: Include documentation that explains the purpose
and use of the relevant features and document the process by which these
features of the tool can be used to create accessible content.

Optional advanced functionality: Provide context-sensitive links to this
documentation from the actual features, within the authoring tool user
interface. Also provide a dedicated "Accessibility" section of the
documentation for this material.

6.2 Document accessibility practices for all languages supported.
[Priority 2]

Rationale: Documenting the accessibility practices of the languages
supported will make these practices more visible to authors.

Minimum functionality: Provide an overview of the tags and attributes of
the supported languages that are required to enhance accessibility. The
documentation might explain which disability groups and user agents
benefit from their use.

Optional advanced functionality: All documented examples of markup
should include any relevant accessible authoring practices.
