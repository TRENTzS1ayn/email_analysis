  Hello all,

  Here's a reworking of 1.2 and 1.3 that enables them to better match the
  new structure:

  1.2 Ensure that the tool preserves all accessibility information during
  transformations and conversions. [Priority 1]

  Rationale: Accessibility information is often vulnerable to loss when
  content is converted or transformed from one format into another.

  Minimum functionality: All accessibility information present in the
  initial document or fragment to be must be present in the converted or
  transformed result. Where this is not reversible, inform the author.

  Optional advanced functionality: Use markup, or some other mechanism to
  record the transformation and ensure reversibility.

  1.3 Ensure that when the tool automatically generates markup, it
  conforms to the W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 [WCAG10].
  [Relative Priority]

  Rationale: Many tools generate markup that is not directly specified by
  the author. Ensuring that markup is accessible will reduce author
  workload during checking and correction.

  Minimum functionality: All decisions made by the tool regarding markup
  type or practices should optimize the accessibility of the content (as
  per WCAG). The author may be given the option of over-riding the choices
  proposed or made by the tool.
