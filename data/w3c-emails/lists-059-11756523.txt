Telecon on Monday at the usual time and place
12 noon Boston time, phone +1.617.258.7910

we will be talking about the Wombat draft, checkpoint proposals, and trying
to resolve as much as we can before we put out a first Public Working draft.

Next face to face meeting:

Redmond, WA, USA, hosted by Microsoft. Wednesday 12 and Thursday 13
September, preceded by WCAG meetings in teh same place (If we want to get our
outstanding HTML techniques issues resolved we might do well to attend some
of that meeting and request that it be on the agenda) and overlapped /
followed by a User Agent Guidelines meeting that starts on the same thursday

We have also an offer from WebCT to host a meeting in Vancouver, BC, Canada,
and we are planing to attend the next W3C Technical Plenary in France next
february. Mindful of the cost of getting to multiple meetings, the fact that
telephone participation is highly unsatisfactory as a way of participating in
general, and the desire for meeting venues that are not hideously expensive
places, the timing and placement of future meetings will come up on the
agenda before the next face to face, so we can try to get some real forward
planning happening.

cheers

Charles
