Hi folks,

in view of the fact that many people are unlikely to make the meeting time
anyway, any of us left will be camping on the ER meeting time:

10:30 Boston. +1.617.258.7910

Agenda will not be Wombat, as previously advertised. Agenda will be EARL -
quick guide and discussion of implementing it.

Apologies to anyone who now will be unable to make it. My suggestion is that
you enjoy Canada day a bit <grin/>

cheers

Charles
