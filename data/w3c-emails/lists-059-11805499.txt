  Hi folks,

  in view of the fact that many people are unlikely to make the meeting time
  anyway, any of us left will be camping on the ER meeting time:

  10:30 Boston. +1.617.258.7910

  Agenda will not be Wombat, as previously advertised. Agenda will be EARL -
  quick guide and discussion of implementing it.

  Apologies to anyone who now will be unable to make it. My suggestion is that
  you enjoy Canada day a bit <grin/>

  cheers

  Charles
