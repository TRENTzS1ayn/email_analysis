To get to a concrete proposal on this:

I suggest that we add to the document, in the section on prioriteis and how
they are defined, the following note:

In formulating these priorities and applying them to checkpoints "the
author" is assumed to be someone who is a competent but not necessarily
expert user of the tool, who may have no prior knowledge of
accessibility. For example we do not expect tham to have read all the help
documentation, but we expect them to know how to use it to find something
they are looking for.
