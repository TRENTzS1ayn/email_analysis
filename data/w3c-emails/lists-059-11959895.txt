Happy new Year everyone who uses a Christian Calendar (I am not sure when
other calendars turn over, but Happy New year anyway <grin/>).

Some housekeeping stuff:

Our first meeting for the year is on the 9th (i.e. Next week). It is a joint
meeting with the ER group, and we will be talking about the Accessibility
Description Language work - a way of describing the accessiblity status of a
page (and what has or could be repaired, ...) Any other Agenda topics please
send to the list - I will try to put the agenda page up in a couple of days.

The Working Group is now operating under a new charter. We all need to sign
up again - details from the Home Page - http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU

Please register for the face to face meeting that will be taking place as
part of the plenary - details on registration from
http://www.w3.org/2001/02/allgroupoverview (which is accessible by anyone
now...) - as the plenary session on Wednesday is restricted to the first 400
people who register for it.

Welcome back, and I hope we have a productive year...

cheers

Charles
