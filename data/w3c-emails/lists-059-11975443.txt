Dear AUWG Members,

Please note that this request was premature. 

The new charter is in fact in place, but it has not yet completed the
review and approval process. We expect to send a formal call for
participation shortly, with a request for existing members to renew their
membership. That call may request additional information compared to what
is currently listed on the sign-up request, and so please hold off for the
time being.

Thank you,

- Judy
