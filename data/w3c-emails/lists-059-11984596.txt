There is a combined glosary from the various WAI guidelines, that is
available at http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2000/12/unified-glossary

I suggest that this becomes the glossary for techniques, and for a future
version of ATAG. The goal is to have one glossary of terms, so we will need
to make sure that they meet our needs as they get merged together. If anyone
from this group wants to take on the role of joint editor (with
responsibility for making sure that things that affect us are discussed
here), please let me know. (Call for volunteers).

Cheers

Charles
