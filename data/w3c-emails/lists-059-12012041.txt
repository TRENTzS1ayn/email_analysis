I propose that we in specific technology views of the Techniques we provide
the possiblity of including WCAG techniques. Particularly for the developers
on this list, is this a useful approach?

This will be a simple extension to the scripts, but will require that the
WCAG techniques source documents are appropriately marked up.

Since I understand that the proposal is for WCAG techniques to start using
the XHTML + XSLT publishing system we are going to be using (very shortly now
I hope - just a couple of bugs left to sort out...) this should be possible
without too much trouble (but will take a while for all the WCAG stuff to be
converted).

Part of this transition is that WCAG techniques will include more code
examples, and information about what technology is required for a technique
to provide increased accessibility.

Please have a look at discussions on the WCAG list about this, and think
about which techniques that we currently have really belong to WCAG and
should be included back in technology-specific views, and which techniques
are in WCAG that we want to incorporate into views of our documents.

Reminder, the information about how our techniques views are being produced,
pointers to the work that Jan did in working out what were necessary for
meeting checkpoints and what were just good ideas to do better, and to the
SMIL techniques material that is not fully incorporated yet, are available at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/sources

The threads on WCAG that are most relevant are probably
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2001JanMar/0021 (a long
thread) and
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2001JanMar/0143 (a very short
thread)

cheers

Charles
