Note that I have cross posted this, but intend to follow it  up only on one
list - w3c-wai-au@w3.org as a thread, with bugs and comments being filed at
Mozilla as appropriate.

Well, I have started a review, which I think will go slowly and steadily. I
will continue it on the WAI-AU list (the group that wrote the ATAG
guidelines) which is public. People can read the archives -
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU - or if they get really excited can join the list. I
willl also try to file things on Bugzilla as I come across them.

(I currently have version 0.7 for the Mac)

And it passes checkpoint 1.1 (Ensure that the author can produce accessible
content in the markup language(s) supported by the tool), since it has a
source editing mode.

At first glance it also passes 1.2 - preserve all accessibility content
during transformation. Based on a three-minute test - create a file, add some
wierd things, save and quit, then reload and edit. Seems to preserve source.
But it doesn't check it for accessibility errors (failing ATAG 4.1). And I
couldn't figure out how to change the title of a document without source
editing.

So time to go learn more seriously about bugzilla too.

Cheers

  A while back I did a scan over the guidelines, I think it was back when
  it was a draft.
  In any case it certainly wasn't a thorough scan, though I filed a few
  bugs.  The tracking bug I created at the time is at
  http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16397 and you can find the
  individual bugs as bugs it depends on.

  I suggested somewhere a while back this tracking bug be replaced by the
  "access" keyword that already exists, mainly for the browser, but I
  think leger said she didn't want to.
