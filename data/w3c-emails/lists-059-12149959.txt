Part the second: Looking at 7.1 - ensure the tool is accessible.

I tried keyboard access (mostly absent - pretty poor even by normal Macintosh
standards).

I tried it with freeware talking keyboard and speech output packages (HearIt,
Talking Keyboard - URI's to come, but I got them via TuCows), and it worked
fine. From this I deduce that it uses reasonably standard APIs. I will try it
with a couple of other things I have as well.

  Well, I have started a review, which I think will go slowly and steadily. I
  will continue it on the WAI-AU list (the group that wrote the ATAG
  guidelines) which is public. People can read the archives -
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU - or if they get really excited can join the list. I
  willl also try to file things on Bugzilla as I come across them.

  (I currently have version 0.7 for the Mac)

  And it passes checkpoint 1.1 (Ensure that the author can produce accessible
  content in the markup language(s) supported by the tool), since it has a
  source editing mode.

  At first glance it also passes 1.2 - preserve all accessibility content
  during transformation. Based on a three-minute test - create a file, add some
  wierd things, save and quit, then reload and edit. Seems to preserve source.
  But it doesn't check it for accessibility errors (failing ATAG 4.1). And I
  couldn't figure out how to change the title of a document without source
  editing.

  So time to go learn more seriously about bugzilla too.

  Cheers

    A while back I did a scan over the guidelines, I think it was back when
    it was a draft.
    In any case it certainly wasn't a thorough scan, though I filed a few
    bugs.  The tracking bug I created at the time is at
    http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16397 and you can find the
    individual bugs as bugs it depends on.

    I suggested somewhere a while back this tracking bug be replaced by the
    "access" keyword that already exists, mainly for the browser, but I
    think leger said she didn't want to.
