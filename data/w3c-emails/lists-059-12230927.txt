My second message showed up in my "in box", but not my first.  So, I'm

Hello All,

I have been directed to inquire, on behalf of all Microsoft WAI working
group members, if there are any plans to offer conference call "call in"
capabilities for the upcoming plenary sessions.

If not, can this be requested at this time?
