Hi Lisa,

another use case is for the authring tool itself to generate EDL, according
to what it knows about the document. There is a requirement that a statement
can be verified to be about a particular version, but the idea was that this
information can be used by the author as a basis for a claim of accessibility
/ conformance to something, or for selecting a tool to use for repair, based
on the identified problems. (Or selecting an evaluation tool based on what
hasn't been checked yet...)

Since most of the work on this has been done in ER, it would be worth asking
them the same question.

cheers

Charles

  Hello All,

  As a newcomer to the arena of authoring tools and the related issues, I felt
  I needed to get a better handle on the issues discussed in the 1/9
  conference call before approaching our authoring tool product groups.

  I have exchanged a couple of e-mails off-list, as well as conversed by
  phone, with Len, and before I round up the troops (several products within
  MS), I wanted to be sure I was asking the right questions so that the
  feedback would be useful and meaningful to the E&R and AT working groups.

  So, here is my action item, in my own words.  If this is not correct, or if
  it is incomplete, please provide feedback at your convenience.

  The authoring tool input could be provided in XML or RDF, or would the
  authoring tool developers have any preferences including (or in addition to)
  these possible suggestions.
