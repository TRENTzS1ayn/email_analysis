Hi, Bruce!  Good to see you speaking up!!

What if the tool provides templates for the author to use, or tutorials/
examples/wizards for producing content?

I agree that there may be a lot of checkpoints, but I also feel that
there are not "too many" -- it's a big issue, and isn't it better to
leave it up to the tool creator?

This isn't a bad idea.  Do you have any time available to work on this
once the ATAG is done?  Obviously your continued involvement as a
vendor representative would be very valuable.

>2) Reaching the lowest level of conformance, level A, is very hard.

Using existing tools to create accessible web pages is very hard too.
I'm not sure I understand where you're going on this one.0

That's true.  We might want to make a "level -1" priority that all
existing tools pass.
</SARCASM>

To be honest, I feel that your argument could be applied by _any_
tool creator at any time, about any level of ATAG we would supply,
even if you or I think it's reasonable.  Someone will always stand
up and say "it's too hard!" -- so how do we know when it truly is
too hard, and how do we know when it's not?

Given that I'm a tool user (with a little experience with computers
-- I was a Computer Science and Engineering major at UCLA for 2
years in the '80s), can you, a tool creator, explain to me in terms
that I can understand why exactly you feel that it is too hard to
comply with this document as written?

If it is indeed too hard to comply, your argument should be able to
convince me in a non-technical manner that what we ask is undoable
-- you should be able to point to specific items that are priority
one, say "there's no way we can do this", and explain why.

I'm wearing my decision-maker hat now -- as the CEO of a Consortium
member, I have a stake in making sure that our AC rep knows how to
vote on this issue.  If you can explain it to her and me why this is
"too hard", then you have convinced the decision-makers.  If you
rely on "well, only a tool vendor could really understand" then you
have failed to convince me, and probably lost a sale.

I think we've just discussed this -- although I wasn't participating
in that thread -- and the concensus is that we can't really affect
what people choose to do with these guidelines, although many people
have proposed that since there are only partially compliant existing
tools, the most sensible approach would be to select on the basis of
"closest to the goal" now in 1999.

Hopefully by 2001 or so, it -will- be a valid criteria to select
single A or double AA.

This removes the incentive, though.  I may agree that a strict single-A/
double-AA/triple-AAA conformance standard has its flaws, but I believe
that something should be added to replace it.

I am not convinced that this is a satisfactory replacement.  I am not
sure what you feel this will; I think that your way of doing this would
make these standards -- including the priority 1 checkpoints -- more of
a metric than a goal.

In other words, the current compliance scheme PROMOTES minimal
accessibility (priority 1/single A) by the way it's structured.  Yours
would simply be used as a way to MEASURE accessibility.  I can easily
imagine products taking these as simply ways to rate themselves, and
not feel that bad about only getting a "0" in priority 7 (for example)
because, after all, nothing is driving them to up that.

This is a possibility.  I believe it was raised before, though.  In fact,
I believe I suggested something somewhat like it.  However, this wasn't 
accepted and the current system was maintained via consensus.

This is where the "naive user" concept may have entered the 
collective vocabulary. :)  [Looking it over, it isn't the -exact- same
concept as yours -- I think we actually have our priorities reversed,
although I'm not sure why -- but your point about the two levels of
priority that you perceive has been raised, at least.  My "naive
user" is the opposite of your "highly motivated user."]
