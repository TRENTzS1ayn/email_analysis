During the January 16th teleconference we discussed some new formats 
for teleconferences. It was unanimously decided that we would try a 
format of thematic teleconferences for the next few months. This 
means that each call would have a theme and a goal or deliverable to 
be achieved by the end of the call. We would invite experts related 
to the theme to participate during that call. The themes would act as 
building blocks toward achieving the larger deliverables outlined in 
our charter. The first themes would relate to our Techniques Document 
Views and would help us assess gaps in our Guidelines Document 
(toward creating ATAG 2). Participants in the call suggested the 
following 4 themes to start out with:
- Courseware
- XML
- SMIL and SMIL related products
- SVG

How does everyone that wasn't part of the conference call feel about 
this plan? If there are no great objections I will organize a 
Courseware teleconference for the 23rd or 30th.
