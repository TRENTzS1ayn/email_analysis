Issue:

Now that we have AERT techniques in the AU document, what shall be 
required?  Require implementation of all?  Only the algorithms (i.e. 
techniques that guarantee correct answer like, does ALT text 
exist).  Require the heuristics (e.g. heuristic that ALT text is 
sensible)?  Or just have these techniques as non-normative suggestions?
