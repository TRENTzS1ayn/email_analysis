Yes, this sounds like a good plan to me.

  During the January 16th teleconference we discussed some new formats
  for teleconferences. It was unanimously decided that we would try a
  format of thematic teleconferences for the next few months. This
  means that each call would have a theme and a goal or deliverable to
  be achieved by the end of the call. We would invite experts related
  to the theme to participate during that call. The themes would act as
  building blocks toward achieving the larger deliverables outlined in
  our charter. The first themes would relate to our Techniques Document
  Views and would help us assess gaps in our Guidelines Document
  (toward creating ATAG 2). Participants in the call suggested the
  following 4 themes to start out with:
  - Courseware
  - XML
  - SMIL and SMIL related products
  - SVG

  How does everyone that wasn't part of the conference call feel about
  this plan? If there are no great objections I will organize a
  Courseware teleconference for the 23rd or 30th.
