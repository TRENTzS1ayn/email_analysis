The Techniques are non-normative. (SO is AERT - that was resolved at the
Amsterdam face to face.)

We are trying to classify our techniques into things that we think are
necessary to meet a checkpoint (but for the AERT functionality we have
specific wording about what is the minimum required in the normative
guidelines), things that are sufficient to meet a checkpoint, and things
that are just a good idea.

  Issue:

  Now that we have AERT techniques in the AU document, what shall be
  required?  Require implementation of all?  Only the algorithms (i.e.
  techniques that guarantee correct answer like, does ALT text
  exist).  Require the heuristics (e.g. heuristic that ALT text is
  sensible)?  Or just have these techniques as non-normative suggestions?
