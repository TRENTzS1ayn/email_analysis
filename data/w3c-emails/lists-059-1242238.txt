Hello,

Per my action assigned 30 November at the ATAG teleconf, here is
a definition of "applicability" that is short.
It differs from the UAGL definition (as of the last
call draft) in that it relies on common sense, not a series of 
specific cases of non-applicability.

<DFN>
Applicable checkpoint

  Some checkpoints may not apply to certain classes of 
  authoring tools. Common sense dictates whether the 
  requirements of a checkpoint exceed the scope of the tool's
  design. Checkpoints that require a tool to 
  implement a functionality are applicable to the tool. However, 
  some examples of where a checkpoint might not
  apply include: the authoring tool does not recognize or 
  support a markup language or markup language feature, 
  the authoring tool does not support a particular content type, and
  the authoring tool does not control the properties of an embedded
  object.
</DFN>

Note that this definition should
also be accompanied by a change to the conformance statement
that says that authoring tools only need to satisfy applicable
checkpoints.

 - Ian

P.S. I have cc'd the UAGL WG in case people in that WG 
find this definition more useful for UAGL as well.
