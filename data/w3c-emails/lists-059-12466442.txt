Today's Teleconference at 2:30 Boston time (+1.617.252.7000) will be 
on Courseware Tools. Glen Low of WebCT will be joining the 
teleconference. The questions we will want to address are:
1) Does the guideline document adequately address accessibility of 
Courseware Tools
2) What techniques has WebCT employed to make their product more accessible.
3) In what way are Courseware Tools different from other authoring 
tools and what would be included in a Courseware view of the 
Techniques document.
