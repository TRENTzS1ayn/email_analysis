To: WAI AU Guidelines<w3c-wai-au@w3.org>


There is a new cross-wai mailing for discussion across WAI technical groups -
the Guidelines groups, plus ERT and PF. This is the place for discussion on
items such as the glossary, that affect several groups at once.

The list is called wai-xtech - to subcribe simply send a message to
wai-xtech-request@w3.org that says "subscribe"

Archives are at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/wai-xtech

This will be most useful if there is a high degree of membership from each
group. My proposal for AU was that it be a mandatory list for members (but
not necessarily for lurkers) - what do people think?
