These are good questions, and I am not sure that I have a sense of the
answers. I guess in a more general sense an idea of what is helpful in
getting the message across to developers is what I am looking for - most
particularly from the developers on this list. I guess the answers will
vary...

  Did this decision come about from concerns raised about inaccessibility by
  people like us? Did U.S. and various state regulations play a role? Did the
  business case arguments resonate with the management?
