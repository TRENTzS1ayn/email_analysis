We will be using today's teleconference at 2:30 Boston time 
(+1.617.252.7000) to finish our discussion of courseware tools. 
Specifically:
1. Tools within the courseware environment: white boards, chat facilities, etc.
2. The student as author and supports for accessible authoring
3. imported materials
4. dynamic content
5. graphically based "knowledge management" courseware tools

Next week we hope to discuss either Flash or XML authoring. This is 
dependent upon the availability of our guests.
