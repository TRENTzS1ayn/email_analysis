The following message from teh mozilla-accessibility list points to an
interesting document looking at techniques for implementing accessibility
standards (essentially guideline 7.1 stuff). It discusses the things that are
equivalent but have different names etc between MSAA, Gnome and Java
accessibility. I think it is valuable as a link form the techniques. In
particular it deals with the question of what does it mean for a cross
platform product to follow standards that don't exist in cross-platform form.

(and it is short :)

Cheers

Charles

Hello,

I've begun the process of posting a cross reference on-line describing
the difference between the way MSAA & Java Accessibility define
characteristics like role and state of an object. There's also a short
intro. Perhaps this document will evolve to more fully describe what
we're doing with MSAA, so we can use it to garner feedback.
