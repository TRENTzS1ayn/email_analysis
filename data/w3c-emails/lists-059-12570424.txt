Hi all,

If we are going to continue with thesee meetings on specific topics then I
think we should try to build a bit of a schedule for them. I think they are
useful, but we will often do better with people who have some extra expertise
in a particular area.

So any volunteers, or suggestions of people or topics, are welcome.

Some particular topics I am interested in are
+ Authoring Web applications - applets, services, etc.
+ Multimedia stuff (images, audio, "complete multimedia")
+ Making applications accessible (I suspect this is generally a reasonably
    specific field of endeavour/expertise)
+ Tools that provide for dynamic or interactive content. This is sort of like
    the first topic, and includes things like the chat and shared-whiteboard
    applications we have touched in in looking at courseware.

cheers

Charles McCN
