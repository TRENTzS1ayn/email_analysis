Although at first blush "3.3 Ensure that prepackaged content conforms to 
the...Guidelines. [Relative Priority]" seems clear enough, the idea of 
"prepackaged" might have to be amplified to precisely cover 
programmatic-type content that is imported, in part because "ensuring" will 
be difficult with such as applets.

The technique for fulfilling this checkpoint might be expanded with another 
bullet "Assure that imported interactive objects are conformant, e.g. that 
a 'whiteboarding' facility include a means of providing simultaneous 
on-line captioning/description."

I'm not sure how many examples (chat facility?) pertain?
