This gets into a fairly intersting crossoveer between what is content and
what is the user interface. I ahve some thoughts on a few kinds of techniques
for applications like shared whiteboards that I would like to turn into
reasonable words over the weekend.

Cheers

  Although at first blush "3.3 Ensure that prepackaged content conforms to
  the...Guidelines. [Relative Priority]" seems clear enough, the idea of
  "prepackaged" might have to be amplified to precisely cover
  programmatic-type content that is imported, in part because "ensuring" will
  be difficult with such as applets.

  The technique for fulfilling this checkpoint might be expanded with another
  bullet "Assure that imported interactive objects are conformant, e.g. that
  a 'whiteboarding' facility include a means of providing simultaneous
  on-line captioning/description."

  I'm not sure how many examples (chat facility?) pertain?
