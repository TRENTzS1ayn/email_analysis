COULD APPLE'S DVD AUTHORING TOOL BE THE NEXT KILLER APP?
Apple's most far-reaching product introduction at the recent MacWorld Expo
didn't get much press, but could end up driving PC users back to the Mac
fold. The company's high-end Power Macintosh G4 computer models -- set to
ship in March -- will contain a DVD "Superdrive" capable of creating DVD
video discs for consumer-level DVD players, for the first time provide an
easy way of producing near-professional quality video output at reasonable
cost. Analyst Andreas Pfeiffer compares the Superdrive rollout to Apple's
1980s introduction of the LaserWriter, which brought near-typeset quality
output to the desktop: "DVD authoring could indeed turn into tomorrow's
killer application for the personal computer," says Pfeiffer. "In the long
term, DVD authoring combined with the Web could have a deep impact on video
production. It could result in redefining distribution channels, and it
could also provide increased credibility for content which would otherwise
look relatively poor... DVD authoring is clearly groundbreaking: one of the
more exciting new applications of computer technologies to have appeared in
a long time." (Pfeiffer Report 22 Jan 2001)
