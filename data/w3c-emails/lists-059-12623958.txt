Hi all,

Instead of having HTML, SVG, SMIL, etc. "markup" level technique
groupings as the WCAG group has, I think we should have higher
"authoring tool" level technique groupings.

For example, we could have "page markup editors", "graphics editors",
"course tools", etc.

These would avoid specific markup level techniques and focus on
authoring level things like "how to prompt", "how to encourage", "how to
integrate into site managers" etc.

Just a thought,

Jan
