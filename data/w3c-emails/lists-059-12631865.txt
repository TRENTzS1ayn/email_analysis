I agree. If you look at the Overview information about the sources, I have
tried to divide the information more along these lines than by particular
languages.

  Hi all,

  Instead of having HTML, SVG, SMIL, etc. "markup" level technique
  groupings as the WCAG group has, I think we should have higher
  "authoring tool" level technique groupings.

  For example, we could have "page markup editors", "graphics editors",
  "course tools", etc.

  These would avoid specific markup level techniques and focus on
  authoring level things like "how to prompt", "how to encourage", "how to
  integrate into site managers" etc.

  Just a thought,

  Jan
