Dear AUWG Members,

Clarification: The decision of whether there will be telephone access to
the face to face meeting is NOT final yet. We may in fact have one or more
requests from people who cannot travel to the meeting for specific reasons. 

Jutta will announce a decision within the next several days, and in the
meantime please disregard the previous announcement, and our apologies for
any confusion.

Regards,

- Judy
