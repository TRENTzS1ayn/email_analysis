The meeting topic tomorrow will be authoring tools supporting SMIL. 
Geoff Freed from WGBH will be joining us for the first 1/2 hour. 
Since he can make it for a limited time could everyone make sure they 
join on time.

The XML meeting has been switched to the 20th and Lauren Wood of 
SoftQuad will be joining us.

Talk to everyone tomorrow at 2:20, +617-252-7000. Please send any 
specific questions regarding SMIL authoring to the list prior to 
tomorrow's call.

Thanks
Jutta
