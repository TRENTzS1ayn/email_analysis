Charles' summary of points discussed (addition welcome)

The PF group is working on updating the XML guidelines. Please provide input
to them. http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/xmlgl

different constraints can apply for different types of xml - xhtml, xml+css,
xml without links, ...

good schema design is to think about use cases

A useful technique is going  to be an intereaction between the author and the
tool - the tool presents the language or content in a few different ways and
asks the author if it still makes sense, or is there some other way it would
make better sense?

Lauren: ebXML people are interested in being able to relate one thing to
another.

CMN: EARL is potentially useful to track what has already been figured out
about
the accessibility of the language.

Lauren:It seems unlikely that end-users will create XML languages.

knowing what are the accessibility features of a language is important for a
tool for authoring documents in that language.

market agility express is an example tool. Does it support accessibility?
What could be done to do it better?

One technique is drawing from two different sources to get everything you
need. This is how authoring process involving more than one person work, but
it may also be the case that an approach to using a language that isn't good
for accessibility is to combine the data with something from somewhere else.

User Interface accessibility is its own topic, and a lot of it is common
across different sorts of tools.

xslfo and xslt authoring are different things.  xslt is kind of like any
other xml language - does the result do what you want? xsl-fo is a final
rendered form, so is normally only useful in a particular medium anyway.
(although things like language checking apply, the idea is that people will
do that in their source document)

The Working Group should look further into transformation authoring.
