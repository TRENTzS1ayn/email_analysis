Hi all,

My last proposal seems to have been met with resounding silence.  So I
decided to flesh it out a little by working through some of the
techniques document and trying to re-edit the techniques and assign them
to one or more categories of tools.

Note: Images (with alt text) are used to flag each of the techniques.
Note 2: I have tentatively added two new categories, Language Creation
Tools and Interface Creation Tools.

Cheers,
Jan
