   2.1 [...]

   Specifications that become W3C Recommendations after an
   authoring tool's development cycles permit input are not considered
   "available" in time.
   *Ensure that the tool recognizes and preserves elements that
   are defined in the relevant specification(s) even if it is unable to
   render them. This is particularly important for WYSIWYG editing tools.

2.1 Use the latest versions of W3C Recommendations when they are 
available and appropriate for a task. [Priority 2]

I think that the a conforming authoring tool must absolutely preserve 
the old version code, except if the user wants to modify it to a new 
version. Are the two points contracditory?
