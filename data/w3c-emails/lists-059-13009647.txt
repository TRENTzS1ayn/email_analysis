From Monday 19 March we will be moving to Monday meetings. We will also have
a new phone bridge, which works as follows:

Dial the new Zakim bridge (+1-617-761-6200) and then at the voice prompt dial
your conference number (2020).  We are scheduled for Mondays from 2:30pm -
4:00pm EST.

Once connected to the conference, you can mute yourself by pressing 6#. You
will receive the response "Muted". To un-mute, press 6# again.


These details will also be placed on the Web page.

cheers

Charles
