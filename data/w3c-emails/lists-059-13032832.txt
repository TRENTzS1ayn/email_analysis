The Xtech list - wai-xtech@w3.org - archived at
http://lists.w3.org/ARchives/Public/wai-xtech - is up and running, and is the
list for discussions of topics that affect several working groups at once -
for example glossary work.

Working group members should be subscribed to this list, or reading the
archives of it. Others may do so.

Cheers

Charles McCN
