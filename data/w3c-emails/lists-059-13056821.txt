>Authoring tool support for the creation of accessible Web content

>Guideline 7. Ensure that the authoring tool is accessible to authors

>The authoring tool is a software program with standard user

>relevant user interface accessibility guidelines. When custom 
>interface components are created, it is essential that they be 
>accessible through the standard access mechanisms for the relevant

>specifically to 
><http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-ATAG10-20000203/#def-authoring-tool>Web 
>authoring tools. For instance, authoring tools must ensure that the 
>author can edit (in an 
><http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-ATAG10-20000203/#def-Editing>editing 
>view) using one set of stylistic preferences and publish using 
>different styles. Authors with low vision may need large text when 
>editing but want to publish with a smaller default text size. The 
>style preferences of the editing view must not affect the markup of 
>the published document.
>
>Authoring tools must also ensure that the author can navigate a 
>document efficiently while editing, regardless of disability. 
>Authors who use screen readers, refreshable braille displays, or 
>screen magnifiers can make limited use (if at all) of graphical 
>artifacts that communicate the structure of the document and act as 
>signposts when traversing it. Authors who cannot use a mouse (e.g., 
>people with physical disabilities or who are blind) must use the 
>slow and tiring process of moving one step at a time through the 
>document to access the desired content, unless more efficient 
>navigation methods are available. Authoring tools should therefore 
>provide an 
><http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-ATAG10-20000203/#def-Editing>editing
