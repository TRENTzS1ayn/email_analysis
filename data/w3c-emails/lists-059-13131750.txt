Meeting time / face2face
XTECH

A cross-group list for discussion by working group members. Different from IG
in that xtech is for working group members and IG is a general public forum.
At the moment, it is good to send the odd archives pointer to specific group
lists

CMN I would like xtech to be required for AU working group members

WL Agree

HS Big load when reading IG

CMN Yes.

Plenary Update

JT Have been trudging though techniques - want to tidy it up, remove WCAG's
share of AERT, release as update for Note. Then look at working for
techniques for WCAG2. Begin work on ATAG 2 - Jan has submitted a bunch of
proposals mostly minor. Aim is to release ATAG 2 almost simultaneous with
WCAG2. Conentrate on evaluation document. Talked to QA folks.

HS Clean up techniques, get RTAG2 out with WCAG2. What about techniques for
ATAG 2?

JT Do at same time as ATAG2 - start work on it earlier. Talked about
structures for evaluation. For now go with present narrative structure. Might
also look at test-suite structure in paralell, but most important is to
actualy complete the document.

JT Had joint meeting with ER - partly on EARL, partly on AERT and who owns it
(that also with WCAG

JT Added some techniques stuff to draft
ACTION CMN Make that public

WL Device independence - we should watch things like this and talk to them.
EARL

There was a lot of discussion on what it would do. Common way to state
results of an evaluation. Allows AU tools and repair tools to communicate,
and carry bug reports between tools.

So far have talked a lot about talking about content evaluations. Do we want
it to express ATAG evaluation results?

CMN is tracking it specifically anyway, and will make sure that it doesn't
change so we can't use it. We aren't expecting ERT to evaluate authoring
tools.
Techniques / Evaluation techniques

There is a bunch of stuff that needs to be done. How to get more content?
Light on for dates.
Meetings

Move it to 12noon-1pm eastern mondays? better cfor europe, fine for all.
2;30pm eastern monday 19 march, propose to list that we go earlier (monday 26
if possible). Action Charles chase this up.

Face to face: proposal for europe in June. HS Not sure if anyone from MS will
go.
GR We should keep an eye on WCAG and plan our milestones and meetings
accordingly.
