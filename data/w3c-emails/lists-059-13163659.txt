Jan has proposed that checkpoint 2.3

 If markup produced by the tool does not conform to W3C specifications,
 inform the author. [Priority 3]

Be merged into checkpoint 2.1

 Use the latest versions of W3C Recommendations when they are available and
 appropriate for a task. [Priority 2]

As a minimum satisfaction requirement. I think it is still essentially a
different requirement, but in fact it may be subsumed by checkpoint 2.2 about
validation in combination with 4.1 about checking - if something claims to
conform to a W3C specification but does not, then the author should be
informed as a result of 4.1 being applied to P2 level (I think. Techically I
guess this goes to where the checkpoint priority is in WCAG).

So I am happy with actually removing it, although for different reasons.

cheers
