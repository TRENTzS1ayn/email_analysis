The 12 noon meeting time would suit me well. (And following my action
item we
can change to 12 noon for the meeting on the 26th and subsequent
meetings.

  We have had a proposal to hold the new Monday teleconferences at
  12:00 noon for one hour rather than 2:30. How does this time suit
  everyone.

  Our next meeting will still be at 2:30 on Monday. If 12:00 suits
  everyone we will adopt the new time for the following meeting.
