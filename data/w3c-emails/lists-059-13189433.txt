I'm ok with this, but think that 2.3 was redundant with 2.2, and
therefore should be combined with 2.2 rather than 2.1.

Subject:ATAG2 - remove 2.3

Jan has proposed that checkpoint 2.3

 If markup produced by the tool does not conform to W3C specifications,
 inform the author. [Priority 3]

Be merged into checkpoint 2.1

 Use the latest versions of W3C Recommendations when they are available
and
 appropriate for a task. [Priority 2]

As a minimum satisfaction requirement. I think it is still essentially a
different requirement, but in fact it may be subsumed by checkpoint 2.2
about
validation in combination with 4.1 about checking - if something claims
to
conform to a W3C specification but does not, then the author should be
informed as a result of 4.1 being applied to P2 level (I think.
Techically I
guess this goes to where the checkpoint priority is in WCAG).

So I am happy with actually removing it, although for different reasons.

cheers
