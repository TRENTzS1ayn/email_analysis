Today's meeting is at 2:30 pm Boston time - please adjust accordingly.

Graham Oliver will be giving us a user's perspective on developing content
with authoring tools, and what ATAG-confromant tools would (or wouldn't)
solve. (He is calling from New Zealand - this is the last chance in a while
for that not to be in the middle of the night)

NOTE: New bridge, so new instructions:
Meetings are by telephone on the W3C Zakim Bridge. Telephone +1.617.761.6200
and when prompted for a pin number enter 2020#

(from the Home page)

Please send regrets to the list, as always

cheers

Charles
