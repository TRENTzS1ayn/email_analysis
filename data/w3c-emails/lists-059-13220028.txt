There is a new draft that incorporates use of icons, some of the stuff for
the move to seperate views, the evaluation techniques that we have, and some
other work that Jan has done.

http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WD-ATAG10-TECHS-20010319

Linked from the WAI AU home page. The goal is to incorporate the table of
contents, references and definitions, and review comments into this then
publish it as an update to the existing Note as soon as possible.

At the meeting in Boston we were leaning to the idea that when there has been
an update to that note we would not update for WCAG 10 techniques anymore,
but would look to moving towards WCAG 2.

Please note that one of the features of this draft is an attempt to explain
which methods/techniques we think are necessary to meet the checkpoint, and
which are just useful or helpful. They are marked with "(Required) @@" where
@@ is intended to be replaced, in these cases with a description of why this
is required. That is so it is clear to a developer what is being done, and
easier to check whether their proposed alternative satisfaction meets the
goals.

And if you don't like the icons, feel free to provide your own (but I might
be very hurt - I made them all myself <grin/>)

cheers

Charles
