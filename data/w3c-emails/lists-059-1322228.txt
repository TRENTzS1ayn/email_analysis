I like the ideas. Minor editing:

  In choosing priority levels for checkpoints, the Working Group has
  assumed that "the author" is a competent, but not necessarily expert,
  user of the authoring tool, and that the author has no prior knowledge
  of accessibility. For example, the author is not expected to have 
  read all of the documentation but is expected to know how to turn
  to the documentation for assistance.
