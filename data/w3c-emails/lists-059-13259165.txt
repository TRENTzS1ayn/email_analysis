Dear all,

it is proposed to move the meeting time to noon Mondays (Boston time)
beginning with the coming Monday 26 March. If people are not happy about that
time for any reason please let us know urgently. If nothing appears on the
list Tuesday (or Wednesday for people East of Greenwich England), please
assume that the meeting will be at 12:00 noon Boston time, 1700Z, 6pm
European time, 9am Pacific US time, etc, until we decide to move it again.

Instructions for the meeting are likely to be the same as for yesterday's
meeting (listed on the home page) but confirmation wil come out before then.

cheers

Charles
