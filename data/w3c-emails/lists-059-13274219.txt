There was mention of a proposed tech plenary mtg in November at INRIA,
Sophia Antipolis, France.

But I like the Stockholm proposal in June as well.

By the way, please add AU to the subjects so that I can tell the difference
between AU, IG, and ER since I subscribe to all three.

Subject:  Face to Face meetings



Hi folks,

looking to coordinate meetings, and potentially with other groups, I
suspect
it would be helpful to have some concrete proposals.

Could people attend face to face meetings at one of the following
places/times? (And if not is it becuase of a conflict with the time,
inability to get to the place, inability to travel at all, ...)

Stockholm 4-5 June jointly with WAI Education and Outreach / INET
conference

Stockholm 10-11-12 (more or less) June jointly with WCAG / INET conference

Amsterdam week of 18 June co-located with HTML working group

Australia in mid/late November

Anyone got other proposals (offers to host a meeting...)?

Charles
