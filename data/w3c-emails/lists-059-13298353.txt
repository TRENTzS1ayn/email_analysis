Yes, it is possible that this will happen but not certain. Would that change
people's answers?

  But I like the Stockholm proposal in June as well.

  By the way, please add AU to the subjects so that I can tell the difference
  between AU, IG, and ER since I subscribe to all three.

  Subject:  Face to Face meetings



  Hi folks,

  looking to coordinate meetings, and potentially with other groups, I
  suspect
  it would be helpful to have some concrete proposals.

  Could people attend face to face meetings at one of the following
  places/times? (And if not is it becuase of a conflict with the time,
  inability to get to the place, inability to travel at all, ...)

  Stockholm 4-5 June jointly with WAI Education and Outreach / INET
  conference

  Stockholm 10-11-12 (more or less) June jointly with WCAG / INET conference

  Amsterdam week of 18 June co-located with HTML working group

  Australia in mid/late November

  Anyone got other proposals (offers to host a meeting...)?

  Charles
