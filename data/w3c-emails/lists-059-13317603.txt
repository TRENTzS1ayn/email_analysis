  would be helpful to explicitly mention the group, or document, or other
  detail in the subject line as in the following examples:

  not: face to face meeting     but: face to face AU meeting
  not: meeting time moved  but: AU meeting time moved
  not: guideline 6 comment but: ATAG guideline 6 comment
  etc.
