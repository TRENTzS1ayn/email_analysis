Since I am no longer Allaire's (or Macromedia's) representative in this
group (but will continue to be an active member), I'll have to take travel
cost and the need to take time off into account.

That means Australia is out of the question (travel cost), Amsterdam would
be fairly easy.

I have already a prior engagement for the 8-10 June weekend; but 4-5 June in
Stockholm *might* be possible, same goes for a meeting in France.

Cheers,
Marjolein

Yes, it is possible that this will happen but not certain. Would that change
people's answers?

  But I like the Stockholm proposal in June as well.

  By the way, please add AU to the subjects so that I can tell the
difference
  between AU, IG, and ER since I subscribe to all three.

  Hi folks,

  looking to coordinate meetings, and potentially with other groups, I
  suspect
  it would be helpful to have some concrete proposals.

  Could people attend face to face meetings at one of the following
  places/times? (And if not is it becuase of a conflict with the time,
  inability to get to the place, inability to travel at all, ...)

  Stockholm 4-5 June jointly with WAI Education and Outreach / INET
  conference

  Stockholm 10-11-12 (more or less) June jointly with WCAG / INET conference

  Amsterdam week of 18 June co-located with HTML working group

  Australia in mid/late November

  Anyone got other proposals (offers to host a meeting...)?

  Charles
