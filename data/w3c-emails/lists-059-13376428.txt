The short answer is: there is no new rep.

Allaire no longer exists since the "merger" with Macromedia became effective as of last Wednesday. I resigned as Allaire's representative for that reason; Macromedia has not asked me to be theirs.

If Macromedia are interested in being represented on this group I'm sure they'll put forward someone and I'm sure a Macromedia representative will be quite welcome (I understand there has been an open invitation for a long time).

(Any private replies please to access@javawoman.com)
