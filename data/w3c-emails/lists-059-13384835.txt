I may be presenting in the US on 4 June now, so that weekend would not be so
hot. How about the Amsterdam idea in mid June?

It looks less likely that there will be a technical plenary in France in
november.

cheers

  That means Australia is out of the question (travel cost), Amsterdam would
  be fairly easy.

  I have already a prior engagement for the 8-10 June weekend; but 4-5 June in
  Stockholm *might* be possible, same goes for a meeting in France.

  Yes, it is possible that this will happen but not certain. Would that change
  people's answers?

    But I like the Stockholm proposal in June as well.

    By the way, please add AU to the subjects so that I can tell the
  difference
    between AU, IG, and ER since I subscribe to all three.

    Hi folks,

    looking to coordinate meetings, and potentially with other groups, I
    suspect
    it would be helpful to have some concrete proposals.

    Could people attend face to face meetings at one of the following
    places/times? (And if not is it becuase of a conflict with the time,
    inability to get to the place, inability to travel at all, ...)

    Stockholm 4-5 June jointly with WAI Education and Outreach / INET
    conference

    Stockholm 10-11-12 (more or less) June jointly with WCAG / INET conference

    Amsterdam week of 18 June co-located with HTML working group

    Australia in mid/late November

    Anyone got other proposals (offers to host a meeting...)?

    Charles
