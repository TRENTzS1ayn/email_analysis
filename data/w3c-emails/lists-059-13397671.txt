I have been told that it would be unlikely for anyone on my team to be
given the go ahead to travel before July 1st, so June would be out for
me.

I may be presenting in the US on 4 June now, so that weekend would not
be so
hot. How about the Amsterdam idea in mid June?

It looks less likely that there will be a technical plenary in France in
november.

  That means Australia is out of the question (travel cost), Amsterdam

  I have already a prior engagement for the 8-10 June weekend; but 4-5
June in
  Stockholm *might* be possible, same goes for a meeting in France.

  Yes, it is possible that this will happen but not certain. Would that
change
  people's answers?

    But I like the Stockholm proposal in June as well.

    By the way, please add AU to the subjects so that I can tell the
  difference
    between AU, IG, and ER since I subscribe to all three.

    Hi folks,

    looking to coordinate meetings, and potentially with other groups, I
    suspect
    it would be helpful to have some concrete proposals.

    Could people attend face to face meetings at one of the following
    places/times? (And if not is it becuase of a conflict with the time,
    inability to get to the place, inability to travel at all, ...)

    Stockholm 4-5 June jointly with WAI Education and Outreach / INET
    conference

    Stockholm 10-11-12 (more or less) June jointly with WCAG / INET
conference

    Amsterdam week of 18 June co-located with HTML working group

    Australia in mid/late November

    Anyone got other proposals (offers to host a meeting...)?

    Charles
