aloha, ian!

you are correct in correcting me -- the phrase should be quote the input device
independence unquote

and, yes, the quote eloquently unquote in the phrase quote As the above
excerpts eloquently illustrate, unquote is obviously extraneous -- i suppose
that i'm just a sucker for alliteration...

as regards the phrase quote it is the consensus of the AUWG unquote, you
observed:

quote
 I don't think you can use the word "consensus" here since
 there are participants who do not yet agree to move ahead.

 You can say that it was the consensus of those present at
 the teleconference where this was discussed.
unquote

it is my fervent desire that the AUWG _reach_ consensus on this issue, via
discussion on-list, as well as on the phone...   if not, a vote, i suppose will
have to be taken, and -- if a majority decides to reject the recommendation --
then the phrase should be changed to quote it is the consensus of a majority of
the AUWG unquote, or something similar, although i would like to "see"
unanimity on this issue, as it strikes at the heart of the issue -- what
exactly does the word accessibility, which is used in the title of the
guidelines mean?

what troubles me is that the question of a Zero-A conformance level re-opens a
question upon which the WG _has_ repeatedly reached consensus -- that
accessibility means that both the tool AND the content that it produces are
accessible _by default_, without the addition of plug-ins, patches, add-ons,
etc.

the Zero-A conformance level request _should_ be rejected because it posits the
publicly stated -- and member-approved -- dual goals of ATAG as an "either-or"
proposition, rather than as inseparable parts of a whole...

please note, as well, that charles has yet to roll his suggestions slash
opinions into my draft -- perhaps when he does, the WG _will_ reach
consensus...
