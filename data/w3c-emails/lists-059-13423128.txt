Is there a significantly greater likelihood that approval will be granted
after july 1st? I.e. if we changed the meeting dates to accomodate this would
it have any effect?

Also, if Microsoft is not prepared to suppport attendance of working group
members at face to face meetings in europe, are they prepared to host such
meetings in order to allow people to attend without travelling?

cheers
