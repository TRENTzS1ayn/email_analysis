All,

Here's a picture (description after URI) of the happy people at the Authoring
Tools meeting in Amsterdam, 2001:

From bottom left going clockwise:
Jan Richards,
Giorgio Brajnik,
Daniel Dardailler,
Charles McCathieNevile,
Katie Heritos-Shea,
Gregory Rosmaita,
Wendy Chisholm,
Marjolein Katsma,
Jutta Treviranus

As well as Chris Ridpath (who took the photo to get out of being in it) the
telephone bridge that represented William Loughborough, Phill Jenkins and
Graham Oliver (to participants they looked like a couple of looudspeakers on
pole) is behind the camera.

(Also featuring a table full of food, drinks, cables and laptops)

Thanks to Chris Ridpath
