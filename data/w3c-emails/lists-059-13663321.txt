I have a concern or question with the phrase "Where this is not reversible
".  From the context, I'm not sure what "this" is referring to.

If "this" is referring to fact that if the tool does maintain all the
accessibility information but does not allow the process of conversion to
be reversed, then it must *also* inform the author, then I do have a
concern.  Why do I have to inform the author if the information is
maintained?

If "this" is referring to *only* the fact that the conversion process is
not reversible, independent of whether or not it maintains accessibility
information, then I have a concern.  I believe we should only minimally
require the "reverse function" when the accessibility information is not
maintained.  Which I think is the desire of the working group.

Proposed new wording:

Minimum functionality: All accessibility information [content & logical
structure] present in the initial document or fragment must be present in
the transformed result. Where the accessibility information is not
preserved and the process is not reversible, inform the author.
