On the call today we seemed to be leaning towards the idea that content must
be preserved, and that structure should be preserved, but it structure is not
preserved the author must be informed.

Maybe that is enough for expressing the minimum requirement - proposal:
Accessbility content must be preserved. Where sufficient structure
information to allow reversal of the transformation is not
preserved, the author must be notified that the transformation cannot be
reversed accessibly.

more thoughts:
Perhaps it leads to a P2 checkpoint, which requires (at the lower priority
level) that the structure is preserved.

One possible technique to do this is to link to a reversal method, for
example when going between XML languages an XSLT, or when going to plain text
a perl script that recognises markers inserted (underlining, for example) and
converts back to the approriate markup.

  If "this" is referring to fact that if the tool does maintain all the
  accessibility information but does not allow the process of conversion to
  be reversed, then it must *also* inform the author, then I do have a
  concern.  Why do I have to inform the author if the information is
  maintained?

  If "this" is referring to *only* the fact that the conversion process is
  not reversible, independent of whether or not it maintains accessibility
  information, then I have a concern.  I believe we should only minimally
  require the "reverse function" when the accessibility information is not
  maintained.  Which I think is the desire of the working group.

  Proposed new wording:

  Minimum functionality: All accessibility information [content & logical
  structure] present in the initial document or fragment must be present in
  the transformed result. Where the accessibility information is not
  preserved and the process is not reversible, inform the author.
