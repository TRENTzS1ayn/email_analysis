Hi folks,

(except Katie and Giorgio, who already did).

Please read the charter carefully, including the participation requirements,
and please follow the instructions for joining the group.

Note among participation requirements that you are expected to know at least
one authoring tool well, or be prepared to learn the use of one, and that you
are expected to do one evaluation of conformance each year and attend
meetings. If anyone feels they are not able to meet these expectations please
let Jutta and myself know.

Cheers

Charles
