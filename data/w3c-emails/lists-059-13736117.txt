Belated regrets....

Arrived Monday mid-afternoon back from Boston, jetlagged and with a heavy cold, only to find that my internet connection did not work. So I went straight to bed for some badly-needed sleep. (Did I say everything would be back to normal this week? I must be an optimist.)

My cable connection wasn't back to normal until today. Did wonders for my productivity (not!)

Back to normal next week? I hope!


Cheers,

Marjolein Katsma
