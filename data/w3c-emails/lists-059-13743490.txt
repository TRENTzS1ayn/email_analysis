thanks jim!

in the CNET article to which you referred the AU WG
http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-6547875.html?tag=st.ne.1005.saslnk.sase
ml

the following caught my attention:

quote
"There's no question--we are standards compliant," Ott said. "The issue is
with some of these emerging technologies, like XHTML, CSS 2 and
accessibility. These are all things that are on people's radar right now,
and we're working with different groups to make sure that all these new
features are in the product."

hmm...  in honor of brother gil, i have to preface my remarks by saying,
"emerging technologies, my ass" -- the TR edition of CSS2 is date-stamped 12
May 1998...  the TR for XHTML 1.0 is date-stamped 26 January 2000, but it is
bound/based upon 2 significantly older technical recommendations: HTML 4.01,
date-stamped 24 December 1999, which is actually HTML 4.0, date-stamped 24
April 1998, "as corrected", and XML 1.0, which has a date-stamp of 10
February 1998...

as for accessibility, how can you put a date-stamp on accessibility?
ironically, considering the subject of the article, accessibility as
expressed as a W3C technological recommendation, the one guidelines document
which has yet to reach technical recommendation status is the User Agent
Accessibility Guidelines -- WCAG is date-stamped 5 May 1999, and our lil'
buckaroo, ATAG, is date-stamped 3 February 2000...

as for awareness of accessibility, i'd like to believe that it dates back to
the very dawn of consciousness, but i'll settle for that serving as the
date-stamp for awareness (no doubt acute) of inaccessibility...
