changes list not updated yet - later today or tomorrow

I have added my proposal for subtext in checkpoint 1.2 - note that this is an
open issue, and merely represents my attempt to capture the concern we raised
at the meeting last monday.

Please identify any issues that you think must be resolved before we can
publish this more widely (as a draft) for Monday's meeting.

cheers

Charles McCN
