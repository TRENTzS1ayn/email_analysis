Well, of cource Eric Ott was wise enough not to state to *which* standards Dreamweaver is "compliant" <grin/>
Maybe HTML 4.0 and CSS1?

Macromedia right now is working to make Dreamweaver (and HomeSite/Studio) support XHTML 1.0 - maybe that's why he considers it an "emerging technology"...
HomeSite users have started to request XHTML support some two years ago (it's quite possible Dreamweaver users did the same, of course,  but I don't know them as well as I know HomeSite users). But due to "downsizing" support for accessibility in HomeSite and Studio was dropped as a major item for the next version; improvements in this area will be extremely limited and ad-hoc.
