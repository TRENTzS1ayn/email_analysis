Well, not really regrets ;-) I'm going on vacation and will be *very much* off-line while I'm retracing the Central Asia part of the old Silk Road (Uzbekistan, Kirgistan, West China (East Turkestan) and over the Karakoram Highway to northern Pakistan.

I'm expection to come back on the 18th of August, so if I'm not stuck (again) behind huge landslides, I'll be in teh meeting again on the 20th.


Cheers,

Marjolein Katsma
