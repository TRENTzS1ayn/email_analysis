yikes! thanks gregory for reminding me to send these.  most of the 
resolutions were being captured by charles in the document as we spoke, so 
i think most of these have already been incorporated.

only things not capture by charles' editing were 2 action items:
Action WC: to add EARL-let to the EARL overview.
Action and resolved GR editor for evaluation techniques for testing 
conformance (he volunteered! we all saw and heard it!)

Be well and sorry for the extreme delay,
