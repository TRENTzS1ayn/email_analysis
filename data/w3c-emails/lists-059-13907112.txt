As per my action item:

Note: When determining compliance with this relative priority
checkpoint, only the following checkpoints in the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 [WCAG10] apply: 1.1 [Priority 1], 1.2
[Priority 1], 1.3 [Priority 1], 1.4 [Priority 1], 1.5 [Priority 3], 5.5
[Priority 3], 6.3 [Priority 1], 6.5 [Priority 2].

FOR REFERENCE:

WOMBAT:
3.1 Prompt the author to provide equivalent alternative information
(e.g., captions, auditory descriptions, and collated text transcripts
for video). [Relative Priority] 

WCAG 1.0:
1.1 Provide a text equivalent for every non-text element...[Priority 1] 
1.2 Provide redundant text links for each active region of a server-side
image map. [Priority 1] 
1.3 Until user agents can automatically read aloud the text equivalent
of a visual track, provide an auditory description of the important
information of the visual track of a multimedia presentation. [Priority

1.4 For any time-based multimedia presentation (e.g., a movie or
animation), synchronize equivalent alternatives (e.g., captions or
auditory descriptions of the visual track) with the presentation.
[Priority 1] 
1.5 Until user agents render text equivalents for client-side image map
links, provide redundant text links for each active region of a
client-side image map. [Priority 3]

6.3 Ensure that pages are usable when scripts, applets, or other
programmatic objects are turned off or not supported. If this is not
possible, provide equivalent information on an alternative accessible
