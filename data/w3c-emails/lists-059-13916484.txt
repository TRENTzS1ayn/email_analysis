Agree with including all these, and I would add

9.1?Provide client-side image maps instead of server-side image maps except
where the regions cannot be defined with an available geometric shape.
[priority 1]

13.10?Provide a means to skip over multi-line ASCII art. [priority 3]

14.2?Supplement text with graphic or auditory presentations where they will
facilitate comprehension of the page. [priority 3]

  As per my action item:

  Note: When determining compliance with this relative priority
  checkpoint, only the following checkpoints in the Web Content
  Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 [WCAG10] apply: 1.1 [Priority 1], 1.2
  [Priority 1], 1.3 [Priority 1], 1.4 [Priority 1], 1.5 [Priority 3], 5.5
  [Priority 3], 6.3 [Priority 1], 6.5 [Priority 2].

  FOR REFERENCE:

  WOMBAT:
  3.1 Prompt the author to provide equivalent alternative information
  (e.g., captions, auditory descriptions, and collated text transcripts
  for video). [Relative Priority]

  WCAG 1.0:
  1.1 Provide a text equivalent for every non-text element...[Priority 1]
  1.2 Provide redundant text links for each active region of a server-side
  image map. [Priority 1]
  1.3 Until user agents can automatically read aloud the text equivalent
  of a visual track, provide an auditory description of the important
  information of the visual track of a multimedia presentation. [Priority
  1]
  1.4 For any time-based multimedia presentation (e.g., a movie or
  animation), synchronize equivalent alternatives (e.g., captions or
  auditory descriptions of the visual track) with the presentation.
  [Priority 1]
  1.5 Until user agents render text equivalents for client-side image map
  links, provide redundant text links for each active region of a
  client-side image map. [Priority 3]

  5.5 Provide summaries for tables. [Priority 3]

  6.3 Ensure that pages are usable when scripts, applets, or other
  programmatic objects are turned off or not supported. If this is not
  possible, provide equivalent information on an alternative accessible
  page. [Priority 1]
  6.5 Ensure that dynamic content is accessible or provide an alternative
  presentation or page. [Priority 2]
