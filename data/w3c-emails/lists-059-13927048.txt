Filling my action item, these are the WCAG 1.0 checkpoints that I think are
relevant to checkpoint 3.2 - I would class others as "not applicable".

In some cases the techniques for these will be pretty straightforward - I
think it is important that we produce techniques for each of these checkpoint
fairly fast.

Cheers

Priority 1 checkpoints

2.1?Ensure that all information conveyed with color is also available without
color, for example from context or markup. ? ? ?

4.1?Clearly identify changes in the natural language of a document's text and
any text equivalents (e.g., captions). ? ? ?

6.1?Organize documents so they may be read without style sheets. For example,
when an HTML document is rendered without associated style sheets, it must
still be possible to read the document. ? ? ?

6.2?Ensure that equivalents for dynamic content are updated when the dynamic
content changes. ? ? ?
? ?
5.1?For data tables, identify row and column headers. ? ? ?

5.2?For data tables that have two or more logical levels of row or column
headers, use markup to associate data cells and header cells. ? ?
?
12.1?Title each frame to facilitate frame identification and navigation.


Priority 2 checkpoints

3.1?When an appropriate markup language exists, use markup rather than
images to convey information. ? ? ?
?
3.4?Use relative rather than absolute units in markup language attribute
values and style sheet property values. ? ? ?

3.5?Use header elements to convey document structure and use them according
to specification. ? ? ?

3.6?Mark up lists and list items properly. ? ? ?

3.7?Mark up quotations. Do not use quotation markup for formatting effects
such as indentation. ? ? ?

12.3?Divide large blocks of information into more manageable groups where
natural and appropriate. ? ? ?

13.2?Provide metadata to add semantic information to pages and sites. ?
? ?
13.3?Provide information about the general layout of a site (e.g., a site
map or table of contents). ? ? ?

13.4?Use navigation mechanisms in a consistent manner. ? ? ?
?
5.3?Do not use tables for layout unless the table makes sense when
linearized. Otherwise, if the table does not make sense, provide an
alternative equivalent (which may be a linearized version). ? ?
?
5.4?If a table is used for layout, do not use any structural markup for the
purpose of visual formatting. ? ? ?

12.2?Describe the purpose of frames and how frames relate to each other if
it is not obvious by frame titles alone. ? ? ?

10.2?Until user agents support explicit associations between labels and form
controls, for all form controls with implicitly associated labels, ensure
that the label is properly positioned. ? ? ?

12.4?Associate labels explicitly with their controls.?  ? ?

Priority 3 checkpoints

4.2?Specify the expansion of each abbreviation or acronym in a document where
it first occurs. ? ? ?

4.3?Identify the primary natural language of a document. ? ?
?
9.4?Create a logical tab order through links, form controls, and objects.
? ? ?
9.5?Provide keyboard shortcuts to important links (including those in
client-side image maps), form controls, and groups of form controls. ?
? ?
11.3?Provide information so that users may receive documents according to
their preferences (e.g., language, content type, etc.) ? ? ?

13.5?Provide navigation bars to highlight and give access to the navigation
mechanism. ? ? ?

13.6?Group related links, identify the group (for user agents), and, until
user agents do so, provide a way to bypass the group. ? ? ?

13.8?Place distinguishing information at the beginning of headings,
paragraphs, lists, etc. ? ? ?

13.9?Provide information about document collections (i.e., documents
comprising multiple pages.). ? ? ?

5.5?Provide summaries for tables.
