Just to repeat what I sid in the meeting today:

agree that 9.1 and 13.10 don't need to be here.

I think 14.2 meand that we do have to change the basic functionalirty note,
either to point out that it is only relevant to level A or double-A, or
extend it a bit to add required functionality in the case of tools looking
for triple-A.

At the moment I am preferring the latter, but I think I need to think about
it first.

cheers

Charles

  JR: Hmmm. This works, but it necessitates changing the "required basic
  functionality" statement, since that assumes the orignal object is not
  plain text.

  Cheers,
