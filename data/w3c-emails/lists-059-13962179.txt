aloha, y'all!

in fulfillment of an action item from the june 2001 f2f in amsterdam

<QUOTE>
JT: moving on to 1.2 -- comments?

JR: this may not be reversible?

CMN: if take something and convert it, you may not be able
to convert it back to what it originally was; point is that
the minimal conversion -- stuff with structure dumped into
plain text, can't get structure back -- that's the
irreversible bit; in an advanced implementation would track
changes so could be undone

DD: if save as ASCII, going to lose structure; should be a
message to the user such as that in Word that warns that you
will lose information -- suggest use verbiage from Word

GJR: can provide text that pops up when attempting to save
Unicode to ASCII using NotePad in Win2k Pro -- it's of the
"some of the characters will not be able to be stored
correctly/retrieved"

JT: please propose something based on that

// ACTION GJR: provide example warning text //
</QUOTE>

so, based upon the following model, obtained from Word2000:

document in this format?

  * To preserve formatting, click No.  Then save a copy
    in the latest Word format.

[Yes] [No]
</MODEL>

i am submitting the following:

1. Minimal Warning (just warns the author, but doesn't prompt
   the author with an appropriate action, just serves boilerplate
   text)

<DATA-LOSS-PROMPT1>
WARNING!

</DATA-LOSS-PROMPT1>

2. More advanced Warning (warns the author, as well as prompting

   of the code which prompted the dialog)

<DATA-LOSS-PROMPT2>
