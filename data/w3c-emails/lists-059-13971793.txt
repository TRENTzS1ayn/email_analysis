I think that extending the required functionality statements could be
problematic. Priority 2 and Priority 3 checkpoints are sometimes
peripheral to the central issue that our relative priority checkpoint is
trying to address, so adding these to the required functionality
statements could greatly extend the length of the statements and dilute
their usefulness. Perhaps someone looking for the minimum requirement
will most likely be aiming for single A anyway.

On the other hand, maybe we do need to lay out, somewhere, what a
product needs to do to be AA and AAA compliant.
