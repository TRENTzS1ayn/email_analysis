Hi all,

Following "my" action item from the Amsterdam meeting in regard to "user 
prompting". As I mentioned, the way ATAG addresses prompting is quite 
ambiguous ("intrusive" and "unintrusive" alerts). There is work from 
other relevant areas such as that of coordination and interruption in 
HCI that can help to refine the concept. In this regard, McFarlane has 
done extensive research 
(http://www.aic.nrl.navy.mil/hail/mcfarlane.html). In his paper:

McFarlane, D. C. (1999). Coordinating the Interruption of People in 
Human-Computer Interaction, Human-Computer Interaction - INTERACT'99, 
Sasse, M. A. &  Johnson, C. (Editors), Published by IOS Press, Inc., The 
Netherlands, IFIP TC.13, 295-303.

He identifies four methods for coordinating user-interruption: (a) 
immediate; (b) negotiated; (c) mediated; and (d) scheduled. These 
methods could be further studied in the context of authoring tool 
accessibility and provide a richer perspective. There are further 
materials and references in McFarlane's page, although in PDF-PS formats.

Regards,
carlos
