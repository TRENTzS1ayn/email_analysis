I am in the process of republishing the techniques document as a group draft
so we can work on it more easily.

Things I am doing:

seperating it into multiple pages - for example the evaluation techniques are
essentially their own page, and there is a page of introduction, status,
how to use this document, etc. (In part this should help with editing)

Adding a table of contents. This was a major hassle in the last version.

trying to regularise the markup again so when we publish this as a TR draft
the links from ATAG 1 work fine.

working on the multiple views stuff.

At this stage I am hoping to have something published on Wednesday.

cheers

Charles
