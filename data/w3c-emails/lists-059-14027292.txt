Carlos,

could you look at the appendix to the techniques about prompting (when I get
the document done - I am starting to realise just how big it is by breaking
it into manageable chunks (well, sort of manageable anyway), and give us some
idea how to align the terms we are using with those used in other work (such
as the McFarlane reference you cite below)?

Cheers

Charles

  Hi all,

  Following "my" action item from the Amsterdam meeting in regard to "user
  prompting". As I mentioned, the way ATAG addresses prompting is quite
  ambiguous ("intrusive" and "unintrusive" alerts). There is work from
  other relevant areas such as that of coordination and interruption in
  HCI that can help to refine the concept. In this regard, McFarlane has
  done extensive research
  (http://www.aic.nrl.navy.mil/hail/mcfarlane.html). In his paper:

  McFarlane, D. C. (1999). Coordinating the Interruption of People in
  Human-Computer Interaction, Human-Computer Interaction - INTERACT'99,
  Sasse, M. A. &  Johnson, C. (Editors), Published by IOS Press, Inc., The
  Netherlands, IFIP TC.13, 295-303.

  He identifies four methods for coordinating user-interruption: (a)
  immediate; (b) negotiated; (c) mediated; and (d) scheduled. These
  methods could be further studied in the context of authoring tool
  accessibility and provide a richer perspective. There are further
  materials and references in McFarlane's page, although in PDF-PS formats.

  Regards,
  carlos
