Well, there is a draft of sorts:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WD-ATAG10-TECHS-20010801/Overview

It isn't finished, but the text is there. There are lots of broken links, or
links going to the wrong place. There isn't yet a references document
anywhere in the collection, nor a glossary. There are a bunch of errors in
the text and document metadata - wrong editors assigned, wrong section
numbers and so on.

The links from the table of contents on the first page should work, but links
to individual checkpoints might stil turn up broken anchors.

So where do we go now:

I will work on fixing the links because they are important.

I will work on text mistakes as I find them, but will not go looking for them
yet.

I will add a references document and glossary.

I will add the missing techniques for 4.1 and 4.2 and links to the appendix.

I will write up the markup conventions that are important so editors know
what not to mess around with.

So please read it before the Monday meeting, and let's talk about how to move
forward on it. (If you know the text of the previous draft there are few
changes - this is mostly a structural re-write. If not, might as well go
through the lot).

Cheers

Charles

  I am in the process of republishing the techniques document as a group draft
  so we can work on it more easily.

  Things I am doing:

  seperating it into multiple pages - for example the evaluation techniques are
  essentially their own page, and there is a page of introduction, status,
  how to use this document, etc. (In part this should help with editing)

  Adding a table of contents. This was a major hassle in the last version.

  trying to regularise the markup again so when we publish this as a TR draft
  the links from ATAG 1 work fine.

  working on the multiple views stuff.

  At this stage I am hoping to have something published on Wednesday.

  cheers
