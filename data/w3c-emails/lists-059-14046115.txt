Well, it is updated somewhat. I have now included glossary and references,
and tried to make all the navigation linking work right.

I have not yet incorporated the AERT stuff (I plan to do that before the
meeting monday, or shortly afterwards) in guideline 4, and I suspect there
are still odd errors around.

I have not yet written up the markup conventions, but here are some clues:

there is a standard template for each page, including linking information,
navigation bars, and titles. The actual content is (theoretically - I think
there is one missing still) in a single div. In some cases (such as glossary
and references) this is to automate generation from other documents via some
XSLT. Each checkpoint has a name/id which is consistent throughout and is
consistent with ATAG 1 and with wombat (in case where a checkpoint has moved,
the anchor name has not changed, so links to a technique for it will still go
there).

The document is (naturally enough) valid XHTML 1.0 written according to the
compatibility with HTML guidelines.

The sections are numbered - 0 is the cover page, 1-7 are implementation
techniques for guidelines 1-7, 8 is evaluation techniques, 9 is glossary, 10
is references, and there is an appendix A on prompting.

Note that I haven't updated the AUWG page yet, and it is 5 am so I am not
going to do it now. Please use the URI above until the AUWG page points to
the 1 August version of techniques.

Cheers

Charles
