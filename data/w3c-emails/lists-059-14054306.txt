Hi.

I thought some of you might be interested in taking a look to my ATAG
evaluation of dreamweaver with the accessibility suite, which is
attached below.

There are also a couple of notes concerning the "wombat" checkpoints and
the new techniques document.

It should be considered as my first exercise in assessing ATAG.

Comments are welcome.

Cheers,
Giorgio
