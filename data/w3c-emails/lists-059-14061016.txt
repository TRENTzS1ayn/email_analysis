normal time and place for preliminary discussion of techniques document.
(What chapters interest you most? Please read themm before the meeting...)

Note that the next W3C plenary will be in February, and we might have a
preliminary discussion about that too.

Please send regrets to the list (unless you are Jan and already announced
them).

Note that normally this would be a joint meeting with ER, but that will not
happen this month. Next month they want to talk to us about the
implementation of EARL and using it for testing stuff, so now they want to
have more time on that.

cheers

Charles
