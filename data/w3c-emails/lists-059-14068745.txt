We should start thinking about this and decide for sure over the next couple
of weeks.  The logistics info is as follows:

 Date: the week of Feb 25-March 1 2002.
 Location: Royal Casino Hotel - http://www.royal-hotel-casino.com/
           in Cannes-Mandelieu, France

As of the Amsterdam face to face meeting we were planning to attend, and I
still think it is worthwhile. The Technical plenaries give members of the
working group a chance to talk to a wide range of people from different W3C
work areas, which is valuable to us.

I think it is not so useful for us to be conflicting with any of WCAG, UAAG
PF or ERT, and that it would be very useful to meet with ERT, Device
Independence, Voice Browser, as well as being useful to talk to almost any
technical group working at W3C but most particularly those working on markup
languages - SVG, SMIL, Voice, Math, Style, and with developers from Amaya if
they are around (that isn't a working group).

What are people's thoughts? Who could attend this event?

Charles
