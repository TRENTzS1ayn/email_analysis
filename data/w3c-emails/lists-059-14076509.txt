Microsoft have arranged the meeting venue, which will actually be at the
Hyatt Regency Bellevue hotel, in Bellevue, Washington State. (Bellevue is a
part of Seattle in the way I think of cities, between downtown Seattle and
Redmond)

The good news is that:
- there won't be a commute to the meetings
- they got a rate of 189/night for people staying there, which is better than
    usual for that hotel
- it's a full-service hotel, so people will have access to room service etc
    as needed

Details:

Hyatt Regency Bellevue
900 Bellevue Way NE
Bellevue, WA 98004 USA
Telephone: +1 425 462 1234

There is a block of rooms under the code "MMCR" for USD$189.00 per night,
from September 9 through the 14. Rooms may be reserved online at
www.bellevue.hyatt.com -- select "Rates & Reservations" -- enter dates
(between Sept. 9 and Sept. 14) -- go to "Group/Corporate Number" field and
enter G-MMCR.

I tried this just now and there was an internal server error but I tried it
again and it worked OK (to the point of letting me know room availability -
I didn't make a reservation). The site doesn't seem like the model for
accessibility, but I think it will be workable with a screen reader.

cheers
