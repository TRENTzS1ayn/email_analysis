To: Charles McCathieNevile<charles@w3.org>, WAI AU Guidelines<w3c-wai-au@w3.org>

Apologies to all for the confusion regarding the meeting on August 
6th. We had announced during the call on July 30th that there would 
be no meeting on August 6th as several people were unavailable and it 
was a Canadian holiday. Due to various circumstances Charles and I 
didn't connect before the 6th.

We will have a regularly scheduled meeting on August 13th.
