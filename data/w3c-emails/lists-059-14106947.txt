There were Heather, Bill and I on the call.

We discussed plans for the meeting in Seattle.

Heather mentioned that there could be a number of different product groups
interested:
  Word
  Publisher
  FrontPage
  Visio
  Powerpoint
  a movie-editing group
  an evalution team

It seemed that it could be useful to spend time with each group where they
introduced themselves and their product, and then we could look at techniques
sections relevant to their work. Since this is essentially about developing
techniques, which is the major focus of the meeting, it seemed to me that it
would be alright if this took a large amount of meeting time, since we
expected it to be a productive result in terms of our aims as well as for the
visiting groups.

Obviously this is not the same as the group agreeing that this is a good way
to go, so please comment. In particular, Jutta and I have not yet been able
to discuss this.

Also, we may not get all the groups turning up, and it may make sense to
combine some groups. For example, from our  perspective I suspect that Word
and FrontPage are mostly the same kind of tool although Word may also have
more conversion tool functions in it (importing from different formats, and
natively using some other format than what it publishes to the web).

The other topic we discussed was the W3C Plenary meeting in France next
February and whether we want to attend. It looks like if the group is there
Bill won't be, Heather isn't sure (although some other Microsoft rep may
attend), and I will. Again, this needs more discussion than us 3.

Cheers

Charles
