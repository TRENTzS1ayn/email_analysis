Another seldom-dwelt-on fact is that this is also very important for machines.

The Semantic Web is essentially Web Accessibility for Machines, all of 
which are cursed with semantic-pragmatic disability. In all the 'droid 
movies the friendly robot is constantly led astray by 
simile/metaphor/irony/sarcasm. Attending to semantics and 
exporting/documenting its features is fundamental to authoring, whether of 
documents or of new languages.
