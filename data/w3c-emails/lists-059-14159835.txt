Seattle F2F

CMN: Should we meet with Frontpage and Word together, since they are both
document editing tools.

JT, JR, HS: No.

HS: Different user groups.

HS: Meeting with the testers.

JT: Good idea.

===
Late February Plenary

JT: Who should we meet with? WCAG?

CMN: Probably not. But shouldn't conflict with them.

JT: Which are the priority groups on CMN's list.

JT: Probably can only meet with 2 or 3 groups.

JT: Should we even go to the plenary? Please respond Yes or No.

Giorgio's DW Conformance Evaluation

JR, JT: In techniques change types of tool to functions of tool.

CMN: Wants to tighten up definitions. It is possible to provide normative
sets of functions (a la User Agent Guidelines) but could be tricky. And tools
will likely have to declare that they are or are not conformant in several
subsets

JR this can lead to confusion


1.4

JR, CMN, KS: It is possible to do some checking of templates. Some features
of checking templates can be automated.

1.5

WL: ACTION ITEM: will write rationale for 1.5.

3.2
CMN: ACTION ITEM: Will write something about imporance of well-structured
info to accessibility.

JR/JT: ACTION ITEM to look at 3.2 and its huge-ness!
