Hi all,

Currently, 3.2 says:

3.2 Help the author create structured content and separate information
from its presentation. [Relative Priority] 

However, there has been dome misunderstanding about what is meant by
this. I suggest splitting 3.2 into two relative priority checkpoints
each with their own applicable WCAG checkpoints (as laid out below).
Also using the defined word "Prompt" instead of "Help":

- 3.X Prompt the author to create structured content. [Relative
Priority] 
- 3.Y Prompt the author to separate information from its presentation.
[Relative Priority] 

These are obviously related but would allow products to achieve a higher
granularity of compliance.

- Applicable to 3.X Prompt the author to create structured content.
[Relative Priority]

PRIORITY 1
WCAG 4.1 Clearly identify changes in the natural language of a
document's text and any text equivalents (e.g., captions).
WCAG 5.1 For data tables, identify row and column headers.
WCAG 5.2 For data tables that have two or more logical levels of row or
column headers, use markup to associate data cells and header cells.
WCAG 12.1 Title each frame to facilitate frame identification and
navigation.

PRIORITY 2
WCAG 3.5 Use header elements to convey document structure and use them
according to specification.
WCAG 3.6 Mark up lists and list items properly.
WCAG 3.7 Mark up quotations. Do not use quotation markup for formatting
effects such as indentation.
WCAG 12.3 Divide large blocks of information into more manageable groups
where natural and appropriate.
WCAG 12.4 Associate labels explicitly with their controls.
WCAG 13.4 Use navigation mechanisms in a consistent manner.

PRIORITY 3
WCAG 4.2 Specify the expansion of each abbreviation or acronym in a
document where it first occurs.
WCAG 4.3 Identify the primary natural language of a document.
WCAG 9.4 Create a logical tab order through links, form controls, and
objects.
WCAG 9.5 Provide keyboard shortcuts to important links (including those
in client-side image maps), form controls, and groups of form controls.
WCAG 11.3 Provide information so that users may receive documents
according to their preferences (e.g., language, content type, etc.)
WCAG 13.5 Provide navigation bars to highlight and give access to the
navigation mechanism.      
WCAG 13.6 Group related links, identify the group (for user agents),
and, until user agents do so, provide a way to bypass the group.

----------

- Applicable to 3.Y Prompt the author to separate information from its
presentation. [Relative Priority] 

PRIORITY 1
WCAG 2.1 Ensure that all information conveyed with color is also
available without color, for example from context or markup.
WCAG 6.1 Organize documents so they may be read without style sheets.
For example, when an HTML document is rendered without associated style
sheets, it must still be possible to read the document.
WCAG 6.2 Ensure that equivalents for dynamic content are updated when
the dynamic content changes.

PRIORITY 2
WCAG 3.1 When an appropriate markup language exists, use markup rather
than images to convey information.
WCAG 3.4 Use relative rather than absolute units in markup language
attribute values and style sheet property values.
WCAG 5.3 Do not use tables for layout unless the table makes sense when
linearized. Otherwise, if the table does not make sense, provide an
alternative equivalent (which may be a linearized version).
WCAG 5.4 If a table is used for layout, do not use any structural markup
for the purpose of visual formatting.
WCAG 10.2 Until user agents support explicit associations between labels
and form controls, for all form controls with implicitly associated
labels, ensure that the label is properly positioned.
WCAG 12.2 Describe the purpose of frames and how frames relate to each
other if it is not obvious by frame titles alone.
WCAG 13.2 Provide metadata to add semantic information to pages and
sites.
WCAG 13.3 Provide information about the general layout of a site (e.g.,
a site map or table of contents).

PRIORITY 3
13.8 Place distinguishing information at the beginning of headings,
paragraphs, lists, etc.      
13.9 Provide information about document collections (i.e., documents
comprising multiple pages.).
