I like this a lot.

Thinking about techniques, one techcnique for several of these checkpoints is
for the tool to support them automaticallly. I will try to be a bit more
explicit, but I would support including this amendment in the next (group)
working draft of ATAG wombat.

  Hi all,

  Currently, 3.2 says:

  3.2 Help the author create structured content and separate information
  from its presentation. [Relative Priority]

  However, there has been dome misunderstanding about what is meant by
  this. I suggest splitting 3.2 into two relative priority checkpoints
  each with their own applicable WCAG checkpoints (as laid out below).
