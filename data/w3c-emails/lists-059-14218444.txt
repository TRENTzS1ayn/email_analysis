Hi all,

the W3C is holding a Technical plenary meeting in Southern France next year -
february 25 - march 1. These meetings are an opportunity for many different
working groups to hold face to face meetings, and for part of those meetings
to be held jointly with other groups whose work may overlap, or to spend time
talking to members of other groups about intersection of work.

At the face to face meeting in Amsterdam it was proposed that we would ask
to meet at this event, but we need to find out how many people would plan to
attend - it is clear that not everyone can get to any venue we choose.

Therefore if people would attend an AU meeting at this event please write to
the list and say so - we need sufficient response to justify asking for the
meeting space to be reserved for us.

cheers

Charles

PS I will be able to attend
