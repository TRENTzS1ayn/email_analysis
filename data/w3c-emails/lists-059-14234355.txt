Hi everyone,

As is my habit, shortly after returning from every far-away travel I send a (link to) an "electronic postcard" to all those I would have liked to send a paper one but could not.

Here it is:
http://www.taxon.demon.nl/greetings/pccaz2001.html
For the first time, with a proper longdesc!

(I'll backfit longdescs to the previous postcards later - you can reach them by following the "greetings from..." link; but of course there are always alt attributes <grin/>)

Also don't miss my latest self portrait with my aussie hat: http://www.taxon.demon.nl/selfportrait2001_1.html

And finally, keep your eyes on HomeSite Help ( http://hshelp.com/ ): important developments to be announced shortly!

Cheers,
Marjolein Katsma
