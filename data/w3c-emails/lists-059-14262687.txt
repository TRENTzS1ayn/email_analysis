We are relying on people to come up with areas of interest for some of this.
We are also waiting to hear what groups from Microsoft are planning to
attend, and any time constraints they may have.

In the meantime, I propse we consider the following areas:

Evaluation techniques.

  Gregory is the editor of this section, and we have had a couple of
  evaluations published recently. If people could check over this section
  with regard to their own favourite authoring tool, they will be able to
  determine what things seem to be missing, (tool type, particular
  markup problem, etc), and to contribute to this part of the meeting. It
  should also be helpful for completing the required tool evaluation.

Using multimmedia to aid comprehension, producing accessible multimedia

  There are various aspects of this that can be tested in a semi-automated
  way, but we have no techniques for doing so at the moment.

Techniques by technology?

  The last few drafts have attempted to divide the techniques according to
  what tools they are relevant for. Do the existing definitions work for the
  tools people are thinking about?

Accessibility of a tool (gl 7)

  Does this group have the necessary expertise to work on these techniques -
  if so who in the group can contribute? Where else should we look for
  information or participation? What is our relationship with various
  platform-specific guidelines, and with the User Agent group?

What kinds of tools do we (the group) use, evaluate?

  There have so far been evaluations done of HTML authoring Tools, and some
  work done on MS Word. Do people use multimedia editors at all, or
  conversion tools, or content management tools, or courseware tools? Do we
  need to recruit people who are more familiar with those, and if so from
  where? Do we need to broaden our own knowledge a bit?

Since I hope to publish an agenda soon, please provide thoughts on these and
other topics of interest (as per action from last meeting). Heather, if you
could provide details of Microsot participation that would be appreciated.

cheers

Charles
