So I propose something along the following lines:

Wednesday:

Intros, agenda setting, group administrivia (such as where we are up to in
wombat and techniques drafts...)

Visual Studio Web Forms (what is this? I don't know what it does)
presentation / discussion of relevant techniques areas.

lunch

afternoon to be determined based on what we decide we need.

Thursday

morning: document markup tools - word and frontpage presentations /
discussions

lunch

Early Afternoon; evaluation techniques, office evaluation team presentation

Late afternoon: to be determined.

---

what do people have as preferences for filling the gaps, if anything?

Cheers

Chaals
