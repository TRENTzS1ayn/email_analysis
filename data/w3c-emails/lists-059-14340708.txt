OK. I read the section 8 on eval techniques - good start..

I would be willing to present the latest "IBM Software accessibility
evaluation techniques" [not published yet] as input to the working group.

And I would also like to discuss the working group's "process" for posting
conformance evaluations as described on http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/reviews/ ,
specifically the section titled "Note about conformance reviews"

That is the current section * on evaluation techniques - in the current
draft
available as http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WD-ATAG10-TECHS-20010801/eval

And yes, we should be talking about it.

cheers

  Charles,

  I would propose also a discussion aimed at producing a draft about the
  evaluation methodology (something we talked about in Amsterdam).
