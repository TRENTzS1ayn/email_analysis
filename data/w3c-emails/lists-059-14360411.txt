I already covered this is a telecon, but thought it should go to the list as
well..........................

 In an attempt to nail down what type of a tool CSS editors are..........I
  came across what is already in the ATAG TECH's Glossary....."Tools for
  management of layout (e.g., CSS formatting tools)"........

  Why was this taken out? Or was it?

  Should we be referring to these items as "functions" or "functionalities"
of
  Authoring Tools?  Are we backing ourselves into a corner, providing
  loopholes for those who wish to call the rose by any other name? They
said,
  "Our tool type (definition) is not covered in ATAG, so we can avoid having
  to comply"......

  Tools are covering a wider territory, containing more and more bundled
  functions rolled into one........

  After all, it seems that the true goal here is to get developers to
provide
  the correct functions. Which includes, in my mind anyway, the
  equivalent-facilitation idea. We want to help guide them to generate the
  correct output, and allow for an accessible user interface.
  Defining the category of their tool is helpful, but, perhaps is not
  necessarily something we should define too narrowly.

  AS it is....for the name "Layout Tools"...........whether or not, referred
  to as functions of a tool, or, just tools..........should we think about
  some other names?

  Layout Management Tools (Functions), or Layout Repurposing Tools, or
  Device-Independent Presentation Tools, or Presentation Delivery Tools, or
  Presentation Multi-purposing Tools?

  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/Glossary/printable.html#def-authoring-tool1

  ......under the "layout tool" definition (within the "Authoring Tools"
def,
  I added XSLT and JSS editing programs. Is this correct, it seems so to
  me........but.......what do I know?  What about the others to come, or
already in existence, for PDA,
  eBook, multi-device delivery........it is, after all, web
  content..............

  Still thinking about this...........


  Below....... from last weeks meeting notes...........just as a
reference....


  <snip>
  How do we work on the techs:
  1. Remap techniques (not yet - maybe 2nd working draft)

  2. Necessary vs. sufficient (explanations)

  3. Re-think tool definitions

  4. WAI central glossary

  5. Action Item: Katie: What kind of tool is a CSS editor?
