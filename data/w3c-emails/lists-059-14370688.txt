Should we have issues and questions ready for the discussions with 
the Microsoft team members? Since we only have about an hour with 
each, it would be good to focus the presentation and discussion. As 
an example it would be good to discuss the issues that arose from the 
Front Page ATAG evaluations with the Front Page team. It would be 
good to discuss difficulties with conversion round-tripping or Word 
Style sheet to CSS conversion with the Word team, etc. Guideline 7 
compliance would be a good discussion topic with the Visual Studio 
team.
