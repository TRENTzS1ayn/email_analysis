At this stage the working group meeting will go ahead.

We have a phone bridge - reservation for Wednesday is the W3C Mystic Bridge:
+1.617.252.1859
Thursday will be the MIT bridge for the first two hours: +1.617.258.7910
(That's 9 - 11 am Seattle time, noon - 2pm boston time, adjust as applicable)

Following that we will be using the tobin bridge +1.617.252.7000 for the rest
of thursday.

We will have an IRC channel as well.

the channel is #wai

Connectivity here depends on my machine, so occasionally it gets overloaded
and we disappeor from IRC briefly.
