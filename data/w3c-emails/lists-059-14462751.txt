  At this stage the working group meeting will go ahead.

  We have a phone bridge - reservation for Wednesday is the W3C Mystic Bridge:
  +1.617.252.1859
  Thursday will be the MIT bridge for the first two hours: +1.617.258.7910
  (That's 9 - 11 am Seattle time, noon - 2pm boston time, adjust as applicable)

  Following that we will be using the tobin bridge +1.617.252.7000 for the rest
  of thursday.

  We will have an IRC channel as well.
  irc.w3.org:6665   (please note that this is not the default IRC port number)
  the channel is #wai

  Connectivity here depends on my machine, so occasionally it gets overloaded
  and we disappeor from IRC briefly.
