Judy Brewer clarified that we will be meeting with WCAG Tuesday
afternoon, so I have scheduled the Visual Studio Web Forms product group
(Glen Kowalski) to meet with us Wednesday morning from 10:30-12:00.

There's a bit of confusion, on my part, about our joint meeting with
WCAG.  WCAG agenda alludes to meeting with ATAG Wednesday afternoon, but
with no clear times I just chose to avoid Wednesday.

The following are the product groups that I have set up times to meet
with ATAG.  Unfortunately, Visio and the home movie production
application are unavailable to meet with us, andI'm still having
difficulty scheduling Visual Studio Web Forms (clarification on what
times I can schedule on Wednesday would be helpful).

Thursday Sept. 13th
9-10:30Jeff Reynar from the Word team
10:30-12:00Lou Nell Gerard from the FrontPage team
1:00-2:30Stephen McKain from Office testing
