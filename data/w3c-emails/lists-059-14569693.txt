Folks, I will make a smaller version of the image available in a few hours.

Just a general note - it is better if you have a really big image to put it
online and post a note to the list, or to mail it to me so I can do so (and
shrink it first if appropriate). I should have thought of this myself before
I asked Heather to mail it to us. My bad.

Cheers

Chaals
