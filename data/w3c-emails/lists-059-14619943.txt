#wai :chaals @jt
<chaals> Jeff Rayner, product manager.
<chaals> talk about Word 2002, access, HTML
<chaals> on phone LN, JT
<chaals> here HS GB WC KHS CMN
<chaals> JR Word 2002 is in officeXP
<chaals> We are trying to make things go better - give people more control
over how features wrk.
<chaals> e.g. spellcheck started out as a process you went through at a
particular time, then wee went to background indicatin, and then we went to
auto-correction, which can have problems if it gets then word wrong.
<chaals> So we are trying to make it stop being to aggressive for ordinary
users.
*** wendy (~wendy@tux.w3.org) joined #wai
<chaals> focus areas: collaboration (asynchronous co-editing)
<chaals> KHS panels are not dialogs?
<chaals> JR No - it can sit there, can be closed, but doesn't need to be
worked on.
<chaals> smart tags - e.g. enable people when pasting something to work out
in what form to paste it
<chaals> (e.g. as table, as the text content of the table, etc)
<chaals> so you can change what has happeneed from a default to some other
option
<chaals> compare and merge - like CVS for word documents, with user interface
for email etc..
<chaals> also helps that tehre is improved change tracking.
             chaals wonders how people are going on the phone.
<chaals> looked at section 508 compliance, improved accessibility, using
ItextStore (new MSAA API)
<chaals> KHS can you get heading levels out of iTextStore?
<chaals> JR That assumes that documents use styles.
<chaals> ..which isn't often the case
<chaals> HS doc mapping has been there a long time
<chaals> JR and outline. these are used by people, but not consistently in
the majority of cases
<chaals> CMN Usage patterns: International, or US based?
<chaals> JR not uniformaly tested internationally....
<chaals> CMN does it dump out the alt text into a plain text version
<chaals> JR I don't think so.
<chaals> .. it does it in word formats (doc, RTF) and HTML
   <wendy> CMN Having the option to do roundtrippable is good.
   <wendy> ..sometimes stripping out isn't a good thing.
   <wendy>  (this in response to seeing the HTML that was produced. It
contains a lot of info. )
   <wendy> JR You can save it as reduced w/out the info.
   <wendy> .. makes smaller.
   <wendy> .. html is just a file format in word.
   <wendy> .. it is not an HTML editor, it is a word processor.
   <wendy> .. whether come in in html, or rtf, or xyz, once in word, word's
data structs will be populated.
   <wendy> .. e.g. spell-checking will kick in.
   <wendy> .. when save it as html, you'll have spelling states saved (when
save as full).
   <wendy> LN When you filter it would that be a good time to say "make
formatting into styles?"
<chaals> LN when it produces filtered info isn't that a good time to convert
formatting to style?
   <wendy> JR Interesting idea, but dangers of converting direct formatting
into styles.
   <wendy> .. things may coincidentally look the same, what if need to change
style.
   <wendy> LN Right, that's why do it as an option.
   <wendy> JR In latest version, have a task pane, you can easily do things
like this yourself.
   <wendy> .. if the goal is to uniformly use styles, rather than direct
formatting,
   <wendy> .. there are many ways to do it w/out walking through the doc
repeatedly.
   <wendy> JT Don't you do that type of extrapolation when converting struct
to markup?
   <wendy> JR Not really.  It's looking at what styles are applied or direct
formatting and converting it
   <wendy> ..into HTML representation of it.
   <wendy> .. e.g., if bold something, we use the "b" element.
   <wendy> .. if there is something we can't directly translate, e.g. there
are things we might not be able
   <wendy> .. to translate to HTML. We'll warn the user, let them know it
might be lost.
<chaals> JT so word styles are not converted to equivalent CSS?
   <wendy> JR We use HTML constructs.
   <wendy> CMN If I write a new style in word, do I convert that to a css
style in the doc?
   <wendy> JR Type text, select, pick Heading 1. Then view as web page, view
source.  you'll see we have an H1
   <wendy> .. with an h1 style definition in the style element of the header.
   <wendy> .. therefore, if i define my own h1 style, it will put my
preferences here in the style definitions.
   <wendy> JT What if you start out in word and start a word style.
   <wendy> JR Yes, that's exactly what's happened.
   <wendy> .. we've created a defn of that.
   <wendy> JT I can then edit the styles w/in HTML?
   <wendy> JR Yes.
   <wendy> .. if you open the doc in notepad or something, then say where we
define style foo as font: helvetica,
   <wendy> .. you change to courier. will be picked up by word.
   <wendy> CMN If you create a style, is it a subclass h1 or paragraph
w/style attached?
   <wendy> HS I think it redefines h1.
   <wendy> JR Muliple cases. If you redefine the style so that it is
consistently applied, but if you
   <wendy> .. make a heading 1, but want this to be green, we'll likely apply
h1 but..
   <wendy> .. if normal and you a pply bold, the style associated w/it would
be normal, but have b elemnt.
   <wendy> CMN when i use styles i say, "i want htis to be h1, but then i
have special h1's."  e.g. h1+marching ants.
   <wendy> JR Are you asking, do we have one style based on the other or
create new style?
   <wendy> CMN Right.
   <wendy> JR make heading 1+underline.
*** Geeze (~love26@209.216.168.212) joined #wai
   <Geeze> anybody home?
      <jt> We have IIRC for the meeting
   <wendy> hi geeze.
   <wendy> we're on the bridge as well.
   <Geeze> me too
   <wendy> oh. welcome. i kind of sounded like someone joined.
             chaals takes an action item to put these online
   <wendy> JR The inheritence is handled inherently in word, but not html.
   <wendy> .. back to the presentation...
   <wendy> CMN w/in word, the standard source for images is the clip art
library.
   <wendy> JR The library  lets you manage images of diff types.
   <wendy> .. depending on the type they may or may  not...in tiff you could
stuff text.
   <wendy> CMN Most image formats have a place to put text.  We have a tool
for jpegs.
   <wendy> .. let's you put in all kinds of data in the tool. desc, author,
etc.
   <wendy> .. using rdf to put it in. can use any form you like.
   <wendy> CMN The min. conformance to the checkpoint is, I'll have to trash
the doc since I can't handle it. some info will be lost.
   <wendy> .. word does on save out.
   <wendy> JR Don't do here, could consider for future versions.
   <wendy> .. it's rare. would need a sophisticated html doc for this to kick
in.
<chaals> Wombat 1.5 - missed that it is possible to do this by warning the
user.
   <wendy> WL Is it tidy friendly?
   <wendy> JR It is valid HTML.
   <wendy> WL Tidy will make it XHTML.
   <wendy> JR Prompting: (3.1) difficult. could build a check, but there is
lots of tricky design issues.
   <wendy> .. exactly when do you prompt? only when saving to html?
   <wendy> .. do you want to force the user when saving to backup (in case of
crash) to prompt?
   <wendy> CMN Same type of challenge as spellchecking.
   <wendy> .. depends on workflow pattern.
   <wendy> JR And user settings.
   <wendy> .. we never really force you to change them.
   <wendy> .. could be a setting, just like for mail, where the spell checker
gets fired up when you hit send.
   <wendy> .. save versus send.  send - i'm done.
   <wendy> .. save, i don't want ot lose it.
   <wendy> CMN To take up, "this is only useful in HTML" what about if you
are blind and use word?
   <wendy> .. if get a doc w/an image in it, what happens?
   <wendy> HS The info is there, some screen readers get the info some don't.
It depends on how the
   <wendy> .. SR is accessing the document.
   <wendy> .. our accessibility relies on the accessibility aids.
   <wendy> CMN Many of these things, could be done as macros.
   <wendy> JR Yes, save as event, checks alt-text.
   <wendy> (4.1)
   <wendy> CMN It's just the collection.
   <wendy> HS And timing.
   <wendy> JR That's the hardest part.
   <wendy> HS Could we show how to edit HTML directly?
   <wendy> .. the vb environment.
<chaals> demo of being able to roundtrip and edit at each end in a word HTML
source editor
   <wendy> CMN Put longdesc="foo", will it roundtrip?
   <wendy> JR tries it.
   <wendy> .. it's still there.
   <wendy> .. but the quotes disappear.  seems to be a bug.
   <wendy> LN May I try a roundtrip?
   <wendy> .. if you made a word doc. spit out small version. run it through
html tidy. make it xhtml.
   <wendy> .. what would it do?
   <wendy> Action KHS: run a test.
   <wendy> cmn sends JR an xhtml file.
   <wendy> opens it as plain text, since doesn't recognize the namespace.
   <wendy> .. probably suggests that if save as xhtml and open in word, can
save it out again, but only plain text.

<chaals> site management tools done by a group.
   <wendy> CMN what is lead time?
   <wendy> HS depends on spec.
   <wendy> .. product, etc.
   <wendy> CMN Likely be 2 years? How find a place in the product cycle?
   <wendy> xx e.g. by the time wcag completed, we were frozen on this
release. roughly 2 years.
   <wendy> HS Under best of conditions. If hit at right time, you have about
18 months (that's short).
   <wendy> .. if hit inappropriate, e.g. just after planning, then they have
a year of following the plan, then it could be much longer.
   <wendy> CMN Some stuff easier to get into the plan than other things.
<chaals> so generally 2 to three years is "normal"
<chaals> LNG testing on accessibility of UI
   <wendy> s/xx/LNG
<chaals> HS different testing strategies used.
   <wendy> LNG working with developer, creating a site for brain injury
organization.
   <wendy> .. he said not enough support for cognitive issues.  people need
images.  too much emphasis on text in the guidelines.
   <wendy> KHS diff between 2000 and 2002.
   <wendy> LNG New usage and reporting tools.  Content management.
   <wendy> HS Share features w/word and rest office suite.
   <wendy> xx HTML preservation improved.
   <wendy> LNG Editing features - find & replace improvements.
   <wendy> .. work w/sharepoint.  server extensions groups, team
collaboration.
   <wendy> CMN Looked at CMN against authoring tool guidelines.
   <wendy> HS I've made it clear that we don't do public conformance
statements about our products.
   <wendy> .. we can talk about what we believe the opportunities for the
product are.
   <wendy> .. moving in structure.  accessibility checker.  we can discuss
generally, or go through specific checkpoints.
   <wendy> CMN list of things that spring to mind as opportunities.
   <wendy> HS Those two.
   <wendy> CMN list of successes? e.g. clean roundtripping, ..
   <wendy> HS Help system.  keyboard shortcut documentation, doc in general.
   <wendy> .. helping users understand that accessibility is a concern.
   <wendy> CMN managing libraries of object, having descriptions not so much
functional alternatives.
   <wendy> LNG Talking about using the same image throughout site?
   <wendy> CMN CLip art libraries.
   <wendy> LNG We don't own clip art.
   <wendy> JR Do the clip art people also own video and such?
   <wendy> HS Yes.
   <wendy> CMN If you have a photo library, collect descriptions of phtos.
Much harder to collect alt-text given
   <wendy> .. function of photo will change.
   <wendy> JR Also talking about captions, and such.
   <wendy> .. heard a bit about checking and correcting. can you give more
details?
   <wendy> LNG Hiawatha is a 3rd party vendor that uses our object model.
they use a tool that
   <wendy> .. checks and repairs.
   <wendy> .. we were involved to some extent, where they ran into problems.
   <wendy> JR How well is that integrated?
   <wendy> LNG I hear good feedback.
   <wendy> HS It's an add-in.
   <wendy> .. added to toolbar.
   <wendy> JR It's a check accessibility menu.
   <wendy> xx Have you used a lot of the tools?
   <wendy> CMN Yes.  (lists...)
   <wendy> xx how do you feel about their coverage? how well do they enforce
WCAG?
   <wendy> CMN The best are helpful. YOu still ahve to use your brain.
   <wendy> .. it's an interactive model.
   <wendy> xx question about wombat.
   <wendy> .. ensure that preauthored content conforms to WCAG.
   <wendy> .. WCAG contains many non-machine checkable info.
   <wendy> .. e.g. color info.
   <wendy> .. there are a lot of p1 that are not machine-checkable.
   <wendy> .. how could you conformant w/this. how can we ensure that all
content that we generate
   <wendy> is wcag.
   <wendy> CMN preauthored, just check it before you put it in.
   <wendy> xx these things that are not machine checkable...
   <wendy> CMN clear and simple language s the classic "not checkable."
   <wendy> .. as a technique, you can do grammar checking.
   <wendy> .. known complex things that can be translate.d
   <wendy> .. words not in primary school dictionary. thesaurus.
   <wendy> JR Issue of whether that is appropriate to the audience.
   <wendy> CMN machine support techniques.
   <wendy> LNG question about grammar checking tool, current word checker
help?
   <wendy> CMN Yes. adequate? stop using it.
   <wendy> .. australian english grammar and american english grammar are
different.
   <wendy> xx you offer priorities. you try to quantify how accessible
something is, when it is grey.
   <wendy> cmn we are putting markers along a continuum.
   <wendy> LNG Have you thought about publishing list of links of sites that
are good.
   <wendy> .. these are accessible but not usable.
   <wendy> WC Yes, supporting documentation in the works. Particularly libary
of test files and issues.
   <wendy> CMN One thing to push is particpants and sponsors of WAI saying
"this is a priority."
   <wendy> .. some work but never enough.
   <wendy> xx know of authoring tools that have been verified to be A, AA, or
AAA?
   <wendy> CMN no. surprised if one exists w/out single miss.
   <wendy> .. many are reasonably close to AA
   <wendy> .. if put together a series of prodcuts, it works.
      <jt> Charles keeps cutting out can you ask him to get closer the
themike
   <wendy> moving the phone.
   <wendy> does that help?
      <jt> yes tYes thats mcuh better
   <wendy> xx ensure foreground/background colors contrast.
   <wendy> .. if i want to enforce (checkpoint 2.2)
   <wendy> s/xx/ds
   <wendy> ds i am a dev in frontpage team.
   <wendy> .. i see 2 ways to do it, hard way: do image analysis.
   <wendy> .. use ocr, etc. or i could just prompt the user.
   <wendy> .. would the latter be adequate?
   <wendy> cmn yes. meets the min requirement. ask user is min.
   <wendy> JR in fact, don't even need to say it for each image.
   <wendy> .. in general, ... show colors changed in some way.
   <wendy> WC Can show user what it looks like - tool like that.
   <wendy> DS user still have to go through, would that be AA?
   <wendy> JR Prompting is A for asking, AA for showing, AAA for completely
automatic.
   <wendy> CMN Gets into integration.
   <wendy> JR Can have AAA if you ask the question in a way that seems that
integrates w/the rest of the way the tools works.
   <wendy> .. don't worry about sper complicated to get higher rating.
*** Phill (~pjenkins@pixpat.austin.ibm.com) joined #wai
   <wendy> CMN what underlies it is an assumption that A, AA, AAA matches
good, better, best.
   <wendy> .. in some way it does.
   <wendy> .. no requirement to get better.
   <Phill> Phill joins via chat
   <Phill> Are you getting ready for lunch (12 noon) ?
   <wendy> GB 2 goals: 1 is reaching a certain level of compliance.
<chaals> Hi Phill.
   <wendy> .. other is reaching support for the user.
   <wendy> .. they are not the same.
<chaals> Yes, we are. We are talking to the frontpage team
   <wendy> HS Tradeoff between making the goals.
   <Phill> I'll connect back at 1pm your time - ok?
<chaals> OK. We are on the phone as well.
   <wendy> JT will the ave use of the tool make accessible content?
   <wendy> .. that's what we set for p1.
   <Phill> I will connect on both phone & chat at 1pm-ish
   <wendy> HS Yesterday we started conversation about EARL and integration.
<chaals> EARL == Evaluation and Report Language
<chaals> WC we have been working on heuristics for testing things.
<chaals> .. how do we know when to prompt the user? When is something a
quote?
<chaals> .. there is a lot that is checked by humans - how can we keep the
results of that?
<chaals> .. can we pass information on checks between tools?
<chaals> .. EARL keeps track of checks that have been done.
<chaals> DS So this is a reporting format.
   <wendy> CMN talked w/hiawatha about how they track things.
<chaals> WC we can use it to do evaluations of tools, so we can record how
well tools do on aspects of checking.
   <wendy> CMN authoring tool evaluations 2 years ago.
   <wendy> .. simple reporting language.
<chaals> http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl
<chaals> HS this is the first explanation that has made sense to me - the bit
about not having to ask the same question again and again.
<chaals> WC We are trying to make the materials about EARL easier to
unsderstand.
   <wendy> CMN Use cases: passing info between tools, me looking for
accessible content,
   <wendy> .. tools to do partial evaluations,
