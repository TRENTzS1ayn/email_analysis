Dear folks,

thanks to everyone who participated in a very successful meeting in very
difficult circumstances.

Special thanks are due to Heather in particular, and to Tim, the people who
presented to us, and Microsoft, for looking after us.

Thanks also to Wendy for looking aftger us, driving us around, and being a
friend where we needed one.

It is hard to know what to do in a time like this, when people are concerned
for friends and colleagues, and we wish the best for everyone. It is not
possible to express properly our sorrow for the losses of people we know, and
for those whom we do not. I think we were all pretty shocked when we made the
decision to carry on, and I think it is amazing that we managed to have such
a productive two days.

Thank you all.

Charles
