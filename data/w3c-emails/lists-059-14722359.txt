During the Acrobat demo during the recent face-to-face meetings some
questions were raised about Word tables, I hope the following is
helpful.
 
1) Word does support the user defining a table header row, available
from the Table Properties dialog (only one row can be defined as the
header row).
 
Information on if a table has a header row, and which row it is, is
available within the Word document object model 
 
Using immediate window to prove the information is available in the word
object model...
? activeDocument.Tables(1).ApplyStyleHeadingRows
            -- table has a header row defined---
? activeDocument.Tables(1).rows(1).HeadingFormat
            --- row 1 of the first table in this document is the heading
row.
Both return Boolean's
 
2)  Word list structure is available regardless of if the list is within
a table or not.
 
Again using the immediate window...
? selection.range.ListFormat.ListLevelNumber
 
3)  The long description issue (removal of quotation marks) we found
within the Microsoft Script Editor has been reported to the appropriate
team.
 
Background information:
the immediate window is a feature within Microsoft Visual Basic Editor,
available from within the Office Tools Macros menu.
