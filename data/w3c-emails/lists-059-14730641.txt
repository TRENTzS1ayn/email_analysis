normal time and place:

noon boston/toronto time, adjust as necessary.
phone +1.617.258.7910

Liddy has requested that the meeting also be done by IRC, so there will be a
channel available at

irc.w3.org:6665 (Note this is not the normal default port number) channel
#wai

I am not sure how well this will work - it will depend on our ability to get
the conversation into/out of IRC. But it is something we have always planned
to try in the case that we have a member who is Deaf, so it is probably a
good trial.
