Minutes available at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/meetings/24sep01

Please note that there is an action item currently assigned to "someone", who
is not a member of the group - can we have a volunteer?

Action Items and Resolutions

+ Resolved: Decide on future joint calls with ERT group at next joint call,
    mid-October
+ Resolved: Email clients and archiving systems are in our scope
+ Resolved: If there are different interpretations of ATAG in a tool
    evaluation we will publish both of them.
+ Resolved: we want to offer 4 weeks for review, and will wait 4 more weeks
    for new versions to be available where applicable.

+ Action someone: propose update for the text we have on our reviews page
+ Action CMN find Frontpage 2002 review and response.
+ Action KHS: Do sample techniques for Outlook.
+ Action CMN: Publish current list as requirements document.
+ Action JT: Get permission to share the IMS work on courseware with this
    group, and then do so.

Well, the IRC thing seemed OK but not perfect. I propose that we try to
continue with it. It also allowed anyone online to get "instant minutes".
(although it adds a little to the difficulty of preparing minutes)

Cheers

Charles
