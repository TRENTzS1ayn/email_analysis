Sure, but we decided we specifically wanted to mention 4 weeks as the time to
be offered developers (this is much better than the current "a week or two")
and the possiblity of waiting a little more for an imminent improvement. So
your proposal would need to be rewritten in any case.  It is generally good
to have a proposal that could be cut/pasted into place - although commenting
on why as you did is of course critically important.

(If you want to challenge Jan for the action item I am sure eh would be glad
to offer it, or you can have one of mine instead... <grin/>)

cheers
