"AccVerify SE for FrontPage is a value-added solution that will promote
the creation of accessible Web sites and enable government and
businesses to easily
address the Section 508 standards for Web accessibility," said Mike
Paciello, CTO and founder of WebABLE Inc. and a Microsoft Accessibility
Advisor. "Better
yet, because it is available at no cost to all users of FrontPage, it
will help bring accessibility to webmasters who might not otherwise
focus on it as
an initial priority in their development efforts."

"Microsoft shares our focus of making technology broadly accessible to
everyone, including people with disabilities," said Robert B. Yonaitis,
