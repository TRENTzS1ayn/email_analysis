Hi Helle,

the only things that make a big appearance in the archive recently are
discussions of the evaluation of Lotus Domino/Notes - a content management
system that is very widely used and well established (and therefore a good
first case study).

However, the ATAG is designed to apply to content management systems - I am
about to start evaluation of another one which is provided as a web interface
and for which the developers think they are probably fairly close to
conformance to at least level A of ATAG.

Among the things which are very important for content management systems are
checkpoints

 1.1 requiring that you can make anything accessible *somehow*

 1.3 requiring that templates are themselves conformant to WCAG (at least to
      the conformance level the tool claims)

 3.1 requiring that alternative information for multimedia is provided

 3.5 requiring that tools keep information about alternatives along with
      media files

and guidelines 6 and 7, requiring help and documentation systems to cover
accessibility, and the software itself to be accessible, respectively.

Hope that helps. If you have suggestions for how we can make it clearer that
ATAG is designed to apply to these tools among others the group would be
grateful to receive them.

cheers

Charles

  Hi Charles
  I write you directly as I'm not on the AU mailing list. If you think it's
  interesting you can forward my question to the list.
  Lately I've been talking to some Web design companies and they all talk
  about their own "homemade special designed for you" Content management
  system whish will make it SO easy for you and your colleges to put
  information on the company web site. Parts of the product are some (mainly
  word) templates and then some database generated stuff. I haven't actually
  seen  any of these CMS products. My question and concern is if these CMS
  systems become more and more common in web design how can we/you guarantee
  compliance with any guidelines WCAG, AU??? I've looked through the last 2 Q
  of the AU archive, with no success  of finding any comments on this. Should
  I have looked in the IG archive?

  Best wishes Helle
