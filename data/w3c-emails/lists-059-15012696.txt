I am working on with my reviews of WebCT and how to use it best for
accessibility. I am wondering if:

1. you have done conformance testing of version 3.6 to see how it complies
with ATAG
and
2. if you have done conformance testing of Cobalt (is that the right name?)
to see how it conforms?

Perhaps someone else has done this work and could help me - it would be good
if we could do it if it's not yet done as many Australian Universities need
to know what to do with their content now and for the future.
