Liddy,
Jan has done an ATAG conformance test on WebCT, Blackboard and 
Prometheus that will be posted to the AU site soon (once the 
developers have had time to respond). Laurie Harrison has written a 
fairly extensive manual on how to author accessibly with WebCT. You 
can find it at: http://snow.utoronto.ca/access/courseware/index.html.
