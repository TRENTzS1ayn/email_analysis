Please add before last JT action item:

PJ: what do I do with AERT vs WCAG technique issues?
CMN: First check open AERT & WCAG issues list maintained currently by ER-IG
          http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/ert-open-issues.html
     If not already there - open issue on w3c-wai-au list

Notes:

Discussion of ATAG conf. eval of WebCT. JR has done one and can send to
Libby.

----
Evaluation techniques?
----

CMN: Should Frontpage 2002 review be linked to Frontpage 2000 review.

HS: Yes but MS response should also be posted.

JT: What are we doing with the techniques.

JT: JT will look into recruiting some people from U Wash. to the group.
Thes people are looking at the accessibility of authoring tools.


----
What the ER group is doing
----

CMN: ER is packing up and going home. With 3 to 6 months.

CMN: There responsibilities will be split up amongst QA, GL and us.

CMN: ACTION ITEM: Post techniques for the use of EARL by authoring
tools.

JT, CMN: There will also ATAG evaluuation techniques that use EARL.

CMN: "Tech spec language" to describe test. (EARL just records results)

JT,CMN: We do have to put together a test suite for ATAG.

JT: It will be very difficult - maybe beyond time availabilities of
people in the group.

CMN: We may need to go back to W3C companies to get more resources on
this. Is this something authoring tool makers want?

CMN: There may be some funding for work on this coming in 6 to 8 weeks.

JT: THere are some others sources we can tap as well.

CMN: W3C says it's ok to pay people to join the group. But
sub-contracting is more difficult.

CMN: Also there are people in GL who are doing maily tool stuff.

JT: ACTION ITEM: Will talk about authoring tool people in GL in the CG
meeting.

JT: ACTION ITEM: Can bring up at CG how issues list of ERT will dealt
with.
