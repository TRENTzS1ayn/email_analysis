FYI...
 
"Remember that "bug" we found while talking to the W3C's accessibility
committee when they visited a while back that pertained to dropping the
quotes around the longdesc attribute. Turns out it's not a bug. Quotes
are only required if the value contains a space and the string we tested
with was "foo" which doesn't contain any spaces." - Jeff (Microsoft Word
Program Manager)
