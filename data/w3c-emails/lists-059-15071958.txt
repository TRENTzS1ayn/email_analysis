Well, it depends. In order to be XML the Quote marks are required. No quote
marks means it is not a well-formed XML document.

Reference: http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-common-syn

What Jeff says below is correct for SGML languages such as HTML versions
prior to XHTML, but as far as I know Word is meant to produce XML.

  "Remember that "bug" we found while talking to the W3C's accessibility
  committee when they visited a while back that pertained to dropping the
  quotes around the longdesc attribute. Turns out it's not a bug. Quotes
  are only required if the value contains a space and the string we tested
  with was "foo" which doesn't contain any spaces." - Jeff (Microsoft Word
