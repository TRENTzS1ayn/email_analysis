Sorry Charles but Word is designed to produce HTML, no quote is valid.

Well, it depends. In order to be XML the Quote marks are required. No
quote
marks means it is not a well-formed XML document.

Reference: http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-common-syn

What Jeff says below is correct for SGML languages such as HTML versions
prior to XHTML, but as far as I know Word is meant to produce XML.

  are only required if the value contains a space and the string we
tested
  with was "foo" which doesn't contain any spaces." - Jeff (Microsoft
