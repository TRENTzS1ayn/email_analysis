We need to reconfirm or not.

The grops expected to be there are HTML, Xforms, XML Core, CSS, SVG, Voice,
RDF Core, i18n, XSL, XML Protocols, XML Schema, DOM, WAI EO, WAI
PF, and MathML.

Out of those I would suggest that interesting ones for us are (no particular
order)

HTML, Xforms, SVG, CSS, Voice, XML Schema and MathML.

It is an open question whether we try to meet formally with these groups, or
try to pin down people to talk to us for a little while about authoring
methods/issues for various areas, or try to nail people for one-on-one
hallway chat...

Also, how many people are expecting to attend? At the moment I have
Marjolein, Giorgio, Me, Liddy, Katie, Phill, as likely, unknown for Carlos,
Jan and Jutta, and not likely for Heather

cheers

  Hi all,

  the W3C is holding a Technical plenary meeting in Southern France next year -
  february 25 - march 1. These meetings are an opportunity for many different
  working groups to hold face to face meetings, and for part of those meetings
  to be held jointly with other groups whose work may overlap, or to spend time
  talking to members of other groups about intersection of work.

  At the face to face meeting in Amsterdam it was proposed that we would ask
  to meet at this event, but we need to find out how many people would plan to
  attend - it is clear that not everyone can get to any venue we choose.

  Therefore if people would attend an AU meeting at this event please write to
  the list and say so - we need sufficient response to justify asking for the
  meeting space to be reserved for us.

  cheers

  Charles

  PS I will be able to attend
