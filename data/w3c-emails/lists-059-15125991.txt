there is a clash between the IMS Accessibility Working Group meeting in
Sydney and this meeting. One possibility is that at least Jutta and I are
organised about making sure it is possible to attend both meetings - not
sure if Jutta can but I'd like to. So I guess the question is: exactly when
will the ATAG group meet or is this not yet confirmed and can we choose?

Unfortunately I will not be able to attend today's - this week's teleconf. I
cannot get a connection or pay the phone bill from here in Japan at that
time of night!
