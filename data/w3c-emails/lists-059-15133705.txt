Well, according to the minutes of the face to face we agreed to ask for the
beginning of the week (25/26 Feb) so I did.

Jutta, any news on this? (I have you down as a possible rather than definite
so far anyway - any news on that?)

cheers

  there is a clash between the IMS Accessibility Working Group meeting in
  Sydney and this meeting. One possibility is that at least Jutta and I are
  organised about making sure it is possible to attend both meetings - not
  sure if Jutta can but I'd like to. So I guess the question is: exactly when
  will the ATAG group meet or is this not yet confirmed and can we choose?

  Unfortunately I will not be able to attend today's - this week's teleconf. I
  cannot get a connection or pay the phone bill from here in Japan at that
  time of night!
