I will probably not be able to make the meeting monday - I am giving a
presentation in Argentina and connectivity is proving difficult.

I am therefoore leaving it to Jutta to announce the meeting / Agenda.

Note that I am not going to be able to make the meeting on 5 November due to
a W3C meeting.

regards

Charles McCN
