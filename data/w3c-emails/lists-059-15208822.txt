Hello folks,

the new W3C bridge "Zakim" (these are named after real bridges in Boston) has
been adjudged stable enough for us to use. Hopefully it will improve our luck
with getting dropped off, or not getting through, to some extent. (I assume
that not all the problems of the telephone system are due to the bridge, but
some clearly are).

Anyway, from now until further notice meetings will take place on the
following phone line:

Bridge name: Zakim
Telephone: +1.617.761.6200
Conference number: 2894 (for those with American phones, that's "AUWG")

I will update the AU page as soon as possible.

cheers

Charles
