Just a reminder that we are on a new phone number. I have also updated the
working group page now.

  Hello folks,

  the new W3C bridge "Zakim" (these are named after real bridges in Boston) has
  been adjudged stable enough for us to use. Hopefully it will improve our luck
  with getting dropped off, or not getting through, to some extent. (I assume
  that not all the problems of the telephone system are due to the bridge, but
  some clearly are).

  Anyway, from now until further notice meetings will take place on the
  following phone line:

  Bridge name: Zakim
  Telephone: +1.617.761.6200
  Conference number: 2894 (for those with American phones, that's "AUWG")

  I will update the AU page as soon as possible.

  cheers

  Charles
