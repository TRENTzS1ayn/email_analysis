I do plan to attend in Feb, ATAG, W3C Plenary, and EO.

I received two work items from last weeks call, but I am NOT prepared to
discuss either on today's call.
     Portal authoring software from IBM?
     Education-ware authoring software from IBM?

Regards,
Phill Jenkins

Subject:  Meeting today? Agenda items



Hi folks,

as I wrote before last week, I probably won't be able to attend a meeting
today. I am assuming that Jutta will anounce whether or not there is one.

An important agenda item is to finalise whether we are planning to go to
the
Technical plenary meeting. Whether or not there is a meeting, please look
at
this issue carefully this week - we will need to finalise sometime next
week
whether we are going to be there or not.

The proposal for who meets when is at
http://www.w3.org/2001/07/allgroupoverview.html#alloc and it seems that in
the time we are not meeting it would be good to talk to the SVG and Math
groups, and perhaps the semLang (semantic language processing - part of the
Voice browser work) group. It would also be useful I think to spend a litle
time with the schema group getting some common ground about how ATAG
applies
to schema development.

Cheers

Charles
