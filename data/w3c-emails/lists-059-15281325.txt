There are reviews of a couple of popular tools (including a version of
dreamweaver with an older version of the accessibility checking extension)
at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/reviews although there is no review there of
several tools that help produce accessible content, including the AccRepair
add-on for Frontpage, or IBMs Home Page Builder, which includes accessibiltiy
functionality I have never tried. Anyone else got favourites?

(We would be very interested in the results for this student if he or she
will share them <grin/>)
