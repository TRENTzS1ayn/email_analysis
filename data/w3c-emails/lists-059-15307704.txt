The taking of minutes slipped my mind, but here's what I remember:

Jutta
Jan
Phill
Heather
Liddy

1. Technical Plenary meeting, should we meet?

Probably not. There was talk of meeting at the next WWW conference but
Hawaii is sometimes a problem for business travel.

2. User preference Schemas

Agreed that user pref. schemas are appropriate for the techniques of
checkpoint 7.1. And they deserve watching.

3. Action item review

Phill Jenkins still getting together his material.

4. Other

Meeting adjourned.
