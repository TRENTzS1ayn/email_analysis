So, what are we planning for face to face meetings in teh next 6 months or
so? There is a possibility of meeting with IMS people at Hawaii, but we will
get a limited group. There is Vancouver at some point.

thoughts? Are we saying that we should cancel our place at  the technical
plenary?

  1. Technical Plenary meeting, should we meet?

  Probably not. There was talk of meeting at the next WWW conference but
  Hawaii is sometimes a problem for business travel.
