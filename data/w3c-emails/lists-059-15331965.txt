I thought that we were not sure about the plenary in France, and the same
for Hawaii. The problem with France for me and Jutta is that the IMS meeting
is at the same time. Unfortunately, IMS and W3C are in synch with their
quarterly plenary. One of the bosses of IMS, Marcia Rockwood, is keen to
help us get together and suggesting we think about what would be better.
IMS has its May plenary in Boston - we did think maybe we could have the IMS
accessibility F2F the week before in Boston.
Yesterday we had another IMS meeting - they have problems with Hawaii for
'business' meetings too - but I do point out that there are others who
attend the www meetings that might be useful at an ATAG meeting.

Finally, I think it would be good to have in the  minutes my report that DC
is now working on an element that describes accessibility for discovery. I
have the IG charter in with the exec and hope it will be up soon. next step
is a WG and there is good interest in all this. The benefits, as I see them,
are that a lot of resources will be tagged with this metadata quickly, or
have it associated with the resource in some other useful way, it draws the
attention of the very large DC community to accessibility, and it carries
accessibility into  about 40 countries - 30 plus languages.

I am expecting the DC IG/WG to work closely with the W3C groups and hoping
members of this group will join that effort. Again, scheduling meetings that
can bring both groups together will be of interest to us - and Hawaii seems
a very good time for that in the first instance.
