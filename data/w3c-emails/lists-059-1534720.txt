aloha!

actually, one of the nicest models for a color palette menu is that which is
available in WordPad, which lists the colors both with swatches and with
names...  you can access the palette both from the toolbar and in the "Font"
property sheet, where it appears as a list-box...

Word97 uses a different interface on the toolbar, which -- while ToolTipped --
isn't properly labeled, so the actual color choices available via the toolbar
are inaccessible to someone such as myself...    the list-box in the "Font"
property sheets, however, still operates the way it did in WordPad, which is
actually fine with me, as i never use the toolbar anyway -- preferring either
CONTROL+ keystrokes to activate a font effector (such as bold or italic) and to
invoke the "Font" property sheets with the CONTROL+D shortcut...

gregory.
