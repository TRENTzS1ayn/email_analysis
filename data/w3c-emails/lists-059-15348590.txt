I am really frustrated right now.  Could you please direct me to a site where I can find out information on how to fix this:

When I create a new page, template, whatever, a table with (Aquariusartgallery.com, tony ferguson--something I created in a page with a table on below it) is automatically inserted at the top of the new page.  It's really pissing me off.  Maybe I should have bought dreamweaver.  


Thank you!
