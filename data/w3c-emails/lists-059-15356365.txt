Tony:
It could be one of two problems: there's a problem with the FrontPage 2002
server extensions if you are using shared borders or Include pages:
http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q298/8/27.ASP

or

In Microsoft FrontPage, there is a file on your computer that is used as the
'template' for the new_page_1.htm that's created either when you open your
web or when you hit the "New Page" button.  The file is called "Normal.htm".

In a normal install of FrontPage 2002, this file is in C:\Program
Files\Microsoft Office\Templates\1033\Pages\normal.tem\

Check to see what your template has in it.

Subject: Frontpage 2002--new page equals insertion of a previous page


I am really frustrated right now.  Could you please direct me to a site
where I can find out information on how to fix this:

When I create a new page, template, whatever, a table with
(Aquariusartgallery.com, tony ferguson--something I created in a page with a
table on below it) is automatically inserted at the top of the new page.
It's really pissing me off.  Maybe I should have bought dreamweaver.


Thank you!
