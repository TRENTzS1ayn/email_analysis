Peter, or other folks

Is there anyone from the OpenOffice or StarOffice projects who has time to
represent the group on the W3C Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines
working group, or to give us updates and feedback on how much those
guidelines are implemented by the project?

The Guidelines are designed to apply to all tools used to produce content for
the Web - both "HTML editors" and the range of other tools that people use to
produce content, such as office productivity tools and media editing tools.

More information at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU and guidelines (W3C
Recommendation since Feb 2000) at http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG10

cheers
