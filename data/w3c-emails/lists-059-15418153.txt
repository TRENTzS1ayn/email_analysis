Everyone,

I have acted on the idea of a 'summit' at WWW11 in Hawaii and have the
following proposal. I don't have to make many changes but would love quick
feedback. The aim, as I am trying to say in the proposal, is the chance to
get everyone together... and to advance the metadata issue - we will have a
DC WG onthis by then....

This would happen, as I see it, during the conf period but we can also have
WG meetings if wanted

Talking to others, it goes like this:

a full day - two parts
open audience
a set of issues 
panel sessions and 
break out groups

The current draft is:
The aim of Part 1 of the workshop is to raise the awareness and efficiency
of the work being done to make the web more accessible. The 'summit' will
facilitate the interaction  in their work of several working groups, from
what are considered relevant international communities, to increase
accessibility of the web: W3C Working group members, IMS Working group
members and Dublin Core Working group members and any others interested in
making the web more accessible. Members of the three organisations involved
have sought this opportunity to work together and will welcome others who
can assist them. 
The aim of Part 2 is to work together towards a recommendation for metadata
about accessibility, especially working on the possibility of a Dublin Core
element.

The main topics for consideration will be:

Part 1 - morning

* what is the state of play in countries around the world?
* who is doing what about standards/guidelines and how can they collaborate?
* who is doing what about techniques for more 'cool stuff' with improved
accessibility?
* how is the problem of lack of compliant tools being solved? - authoring
tools, user agents, evaluation and repair tools, ...
* who is evaluating and repairing inaccessible content? how?

Part 2 - afternoon
* how is accessibility metadata created, recorded and used?
* what is needed?
-----------------------------------

Please send me any comments - I have to submit this asap as it is already
late ......

Liddy
