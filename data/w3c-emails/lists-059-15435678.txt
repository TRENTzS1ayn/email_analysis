Hi folks,

it looks like we will be going ahead with it. However there is a possiblity
that it will be one day instead of two - leaving people more time to talk to
other working groups and work out how to expand the range of our techniques.
Would that cause a problem for any of the people planning to attend?

(I know it won't for me or Giorgio)
