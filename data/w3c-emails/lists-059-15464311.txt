There are several important discussions in the WCAG area now, leading towards
WCAG 2.0 conformance schemata.

These have no real impact on what we are doing at the moment, but will have a
big impact on what happens to conformance for Wombat. Proposals are to
provide a more flexible scheme, or to provide a two-level scheme, or to
provide only one level of conformance - doing everything.

All of these would make big changes to the way we use WCAG and thhe ways it
is possible to claim conformance, due to our massive dependency on WCAG and
our relative priority structure as a way of working that into ATAG 1
conformance. Remembering that people are required by the charter to be aware
of these things, please take some time to ensure that you know where this
issue ends up, and think about how we might deal with these different
possiblities.

cheers

Chaals
