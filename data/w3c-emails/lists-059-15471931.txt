This seems like a good idea. But rather than making it a formal working group
meeting, which would be very difficult uinder W3C process anyway given the
format, I suggest that you make it a BOF or Panel session. In looking at
Accessibility metadata I think it is important to involve W3C semantic Web
folks too - there is fairly limited expertise in the area within WAI, and it
would be good to have both areas of W3C talking about it. As far as I can
tell this would in fact make it more open to WAI working groups than a
working group meeting would be, and while it wouldn't have the ability to
make decisions on behalf of a working group, it would be able to produce
proposals that could be well-represented and shold be able to be ratified as
decisions of working groups if there is broad agreement.

just my 2 cents worth.

  Everyone,

  I have acted on the idea of a 'summit' at WWW11 in Hawaii and have the
  following proposal. I don't have to make many changes but would love quick
  feedback. The aim, as I am trying to say in the proposal, is the chance to
  get everyone together... and to advance the metadata issue - we will have a
  DC WG onthis by then....

  This would happen, as I see it, during the conf period but we can also have
  WG meetings if wanted

  Talking to others, it goes like this:

  a full day - two parts
  open audience
  a set of issues
  panel sessions and
  break out groups

  The current draft is:
  The aim of Part 1 of the workshop is to raise the awareness and efficiency
  of the work being done to make the web more accessible. The 'summit' will
  facilitate the interaction  in their work of several working groups, from
  what are considered relevant international communities, to increase
  accessibility of the web: W3C Working group members, IMS Working group
  members and Dublin Core Working group members and any others interested in
  making the web more accessible. Members of the three organisations involved
  have sought this opportunity to work together and will welcome others who
  can assist them.
  The aim of Part 2 is to work together towards a recommendation for metadata
  about accessibility, especially working on the possibility of a Dublin Core
  element.

  The main topics for consideration will be:

  Part 1 - morning

  * what is the state of play in countries around the world?
  * who is doing what about standards/guidelines and how can they collaborate?
  * who is doing what about techniques for more 'cool stuff' with improved
  accessibility?
  * how is the problem of lack of compliant tools being solved? - authoring
  tools, user agents, evaluation and repair tools, ...
  * who is evaluating and repairing inaccessible content? how?

  Part 2 - afternoon
  * how is accessibility metadata created, recorded and used?
  * what is needed?
  -----------------------------------

  Please send me any comments - I have to submit this asap as it is already
  late ......
