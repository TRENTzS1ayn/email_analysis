Hi folks. I have now published it, so if you try the latest version link you
will get it http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/wombat and it is linked from the working
group page and listed in the news items there.

SIDAR (the spanish accessibility group, which has a tools expert group) are
watching us - they already picked up the notice that it was available...
