Hi folks,

I have uploaded a new techniques draft at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WD-ATAG10-TECHS-20011124 but it isn't yet the
official group draft - I will do that tomorrow.

If people look at it i in the meantime and find problems or incosistencies
please let me know and they will be fixed.

Major changes:
This is modularised like the last draft.
Each technique has a number T0001 to T0315 at this stage
There are some more techniques marked as applicable to conversion tools.

When we make this the real draft there are a few things to do:

1. Identify which techniques (by number) belong to which "wombat"
checkpoints. Some will stay the same, some will move, some will belong to
more than one checkpoint.

2. Identify which techniques are really the same thing and should be
combined.

3. Provide more information for techniques - rationale, examples, etc.

4. Propose new techniques

The numbering scheme I have used is simple - each technique has a number, and
any new technique gets the next available number. I propose not to re-use old
numbers, since they are also used to make a URI for each technique (meaning
we can use them with earl, xslt, and similar tools.

cheers

Chaals
