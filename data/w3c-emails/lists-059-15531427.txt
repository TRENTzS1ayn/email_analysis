Hi all,

the new draft is now published as the latest draft, and I will be updating
the working group home page in a minute. There are now some more things to be
done:

5. Identify the techniques which have been proposed at the face to face and a
couple of others in the mailing list, and write them up as proposals for
addition/change.

6. There are some references (from the techniques for guideline 7) which can
no longer be found. Leaving aside the question of whether we should continue
to link to things that don't have stable URI's (in general W3C policy is that
these are not reliable and should not be included in a specification) if
anyone knows how to find them it would be good. There are a handful from Sun
and IBM in particular that were good documents.

7. There are some techniques where there are terms with an asterisk (*) next
to them. I am not sure if these are meant to be linked to terms in the
glossary, or whether it is better to expand the techniques themselves - often
I think the latter would be a better approach.

8. Dealing with the evaluation techniques. I know gregory has been sick and
unable to work on these, and we have Jan's evaluation template as well as
some good material here. Does anyone want to get more involved with it?

9. Where is the AERT stuff? I can't find it in the drafts, so we need to work
out where to re-incoporate that or whether to have it seperate.

10. Deciding when to make what we have an update to the existing note. As far
as I am concerned the markup is now all valid and I have done the things
required technically before it could be published, and this is better than
what we have as the existing note, so I would like that to be as soon as
possible.

cheers

Charles

  Hi folks,

  I have uploaded a new techniques draft at
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WD-ATAG10-TECHS-20011124 but it isn't yet the
  official group draft - I will do that tomorrow.

  If people look at it i in the meantime and find problems or incosistencies
  please let me know and they will be fixed.

  Major changes:
  This is modularised like the last draft.
  Each technique has a number T0001 to T0315 at this stage
  There are some more techniques marked as applicable to conversion tools.

  When we make this the real draft there are a few things to do:

  1. Identify which techniques (by number) belong to which "wombat"
  checkpoints. Some will stay the same, some will move, some will belong to
  more than one checkpoint.

  2. Identify which techniques are really the same thing and should be
  combined.

  3. Provide more information for techniques - rationale, examples, etc.

  4. Propose new techniques

  The numbering scheme I have used is simple - each technique has a number, and
  any new technique gets the next available number. I propose not to re-use old
  numbers, since they are also used to make a URI for each technique (meaning
  we can use them with earl, xslt, and similar tools.

  cheers
