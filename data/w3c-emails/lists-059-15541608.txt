During the call last week, we discussed the frequency of 
teleconferences at present. Since we are in more of a work rather 
than debate mode during this time it was suggested that we go back to 
meeting every second week, unless something comes up. During the 
teleconference we will schedule reports on action items by specific 
members. This should also serve to speed along the action items.

Therefore we will not have a meeting this week, but will meet again 
next Monday.
