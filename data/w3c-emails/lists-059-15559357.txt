AccessEnable Launches Giving Web Site Owners the Ability to Meet
Federal Requirements

Ann Arbor, Mich. - Nov. 27 - The AccessEnable software product
launches today to address mandatory compliance issues related to
Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. This new product is from
RetroAccess, a provider of automated tools that enable Web site
owners the ability to rapidly conform to established standards - from
disability regulations, to corporate brand management to banking
compliances and regulations.

Targeted to government agencies that must conform to federal
regulations, AccessEnable is an online tool that evaluates, reports,
and corrects accessibility errors on Web sites.  Mandated by Congress
and enforced by the Department of Justice, all federally sponsored
sites - which includes federal departments, agencies and contractors
who provide services or products to federal agencies - must conform
to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act by June 21, 2001.  This law
establishes a set of enforceable standards ensuring that people with
disabilities have comparable access to and use of information from
Web sites.

Imagine not being able to cross the Digital Divide and access the
Internet. For the one in five people in the United States with a
disability, this may be a problem. While the Internet has the
potential to broaden the lives and increase the independence of
people with disabilities, statistics show that the disabled are only
one half as likely to use the Internet than those without
disabilities according to Falling Through the Net: Toward Digital
Inclusion, A Report on Americans' Access to Technology Tools.

"AccessEnable meets the market need for Web site accessibility and
compliance," said Stephen Markel, co-founder and president of
RetroAccess.  "There is a recognized societal need for all people,
regardless of disabilities, to have full access to Web site content.
Additionally, all federally sponsored agencies must be compliant
today with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.  AccessEnable
provides these organizations the ability to meet new federal
requirements."

In addition to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, the World Wide
Web Consortium (W3C) has published a comprehensive set of
accessibility guidelines that will influence future standards called
the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

"RetroAccess addresses the market's need for complete solutions to
rapidly conform to Web site standards," said Richard Eidswick,
managing director of Arbor Partners, LLC. "Web site owners, such as
federal agencies and other government supported organizations, now
have a comprehensive solution in AccessEnable, a product specifically
designed to address the new federal requirements for Web site
accessibility."

A common error in most Web sites today is the lack of alternative
text for images.  The ALT attribute is used to describe, in words,
the information portrayed by an image.  Visually-impaired users often
utilize special software to read the content of a Web site.  If the
ALT attribute is not used, the user may not be receiving all of the
available information.

AccessEnable is unique to the market in that it not only identifies
the accessibility violations in the Web site code, but it provides
multiple reports on errors, assists in the removal of accessibility
barriers and documents compliance status to improve legal standing.
AccessEnable has significant advantages over manual procedures
because it packages the process, rules set, and reporting mechanism
in a fast, easy-to-use application.

"AccessEnable provides significant advantages over manual site
corrections and other tools in that it is a complete, efficient and
easy-to-use tool," said Tom Brinck, RetroAccess co-founder and chief
usability officer.  "AccessEnable can be used by all professionals -
Web site programmers, administrators and auditors - and is a
comprehensive solution that evaluates, corrects, reports and
archives."

AccessEnable is generally available today.  Pricing is determined on
the number of Web site pages.  This ranges from $49.99 for 100 HTML
pages, to $250 for 2,500 HTML pages, to $2,000 for 40,000 HTML pages.
A free demo of the product is available at www.retroaccess.com.

RetroAccess is led by co-founders Stephen Markel and Tom Brinck - who
combined have nearly 20 years expertise in user-centered Internet
solutions and emerging technologies.  Brinck is an industry
thought-leader in human computer interaction.  Most recently, he was
the principal author of the book, Usability for the Web:  Designing
Web Sites that Work.  Markel brings more than 10 years of expertise
in establishing and growing successful companies and divisions to
RetroAccess.

RetroAccess also provides consulting services including compliance
testing, site optimization, development of compliance and guideline
strategies, and ongoing maintenance planning and implementation.

Future RetroAccess products will address additional disability
standards (ADA), banking compliance and regulation (FDIC), and
corporate branding guidelines
