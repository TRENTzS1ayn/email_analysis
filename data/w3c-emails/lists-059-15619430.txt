My take on the wording:

  Why a new version?

Because ATAG 1.0 went to Recommendation before the phase of Candidate
Recommendation was part of the
W3C Process, only a fairly rudimentary assessment of existing
implementations was done at that time. As more implementation experience
with ATAG 1.0 is accumulated, it has become clear that there are several
issues in need of clarification. Since some of these issues, require
changes that go beyond the level of errata, the group decided that a new
version of ATAG was desirable. Further impetus for a new version is the
ongoing development of a new version of WCAG, on which ATAG normatively
depends.

  Why "Wombat"?

ATAG 1.0 refers normatively to WCAG 1.0 for its requirements on content.
Ideally, in keeping with this model, the group would like to release,
the new version of the ATAG Recommendation as ATAG 2.0 as soon as
possible after the release of WCAG 2.0. However, in order to complete
the Candidate
Recommendation Process, it is important to have the draft and
supporting materials ("Techniques" Note, etc.) prepared as far in
advance as
possible. This opens up the possibility that a new version of ATAG will
be
ready before WCAG 2.0 has been released. In this
event, the group wanted to keep open the possibility of publishing the
new version as a 1.X
update, in order to keep the major ATAG version number parallel with the
WCAG version number on which it depends.
