Well, I was rewording this for a slightly different use and had the same
thoughts. I think this is good.

  My take on the wording:

    Why a new version?

  Because ATAG 1.0 went to Recommendation before the phase of Candidate
  Recommendation was part of the
  W3C Process, only a fairly rudimentary assessment of existing
  implementations was done at that time. As more implementation experience
  with ATAG 1.0 is accumulated, it has become clear that there are several
  issues in need of clarification. Since some of these issues, require
  changes that go beyond the level of errata, the group decided that a new
  version of ATAG was desirable. Further impetus for a new version is the
  ongoing development of a new version of WCAG, on which ATAG normatively
  depends.

    Why "Wombat"?

  ATAG 1.0 refers normatively to WCAG 1.0 for its requirements on content.
  Ideally, in keeping with this model, the group would like to release,
  the new version of the ATAG Recommendation as ATAG 2.0 as soon as
  possible after the release of WCAG 2.0. However, in order to complete
  the Candidate
  Recommendation Process, it is important to have the draft and
  supporting materials ("Techniques" Note, etc.) prepared as far in
  advance as
  possible. This opens up the possibility that a new version of ATAG will
  be
  ready before WCAG 2.0 has been released. In this
  event, the group wanted to keep open the possibility of publishing the
  new version as a 1.X
  update, in order to keep the major ATAG version number parallel with the
  WCAG version number on which it depends.
