Yep, I think this is a good question.

Maybe we should rephrase it "do I use ATAG 1.0 or Wombat?" (I think there is
a question on "who should use ATAG").

  I would like to suggest another question to put at the end after the
  suggested additional questions:

   Who should use "Wombat"?

  Authoring tool developers should use "Wombat" now that a public draft is
  available.  This is in anticipation of needing implementation experience
  before achieving candidate recommendation.  Please note that the draft may
  change etc.etc.etc.

  If this is not the case, then why point them to ATAG 1.0 if we know all the
  changes?
