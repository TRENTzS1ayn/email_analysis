Hi all,

Before we publish, I think we should revisit the design of the icons. In
my opinion, the ones we currently have are:

1. Too large: They are so large that they mess up the line spacing and
take away from the real content of the document.

2. Too busy: They have far too much detail in them.

If all else fails, perhaps we could just go with arbitrary geometric
shapes? Perhaps colored to make them easier to recognize?

Jan
