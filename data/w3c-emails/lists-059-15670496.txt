Hi folks,

I agree that they are too large - I made a page where they are reduced in
size at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WD-ATAG10-TECHS-20011124/timp1.html (that's
the only change to the page). I don't know if they are too busy or not - I
wanted something that could be viewed reasonably large and would be sort of
meaningful, and came out OK when viewed small.

We ran a thread on the WAI IG or WCAG list (I forget which) a while back to
find out about this, and I don't know that there was a lot of conclusion, but
I had modified the icons a bit based on feedback from that. There is, in that
thread, a pointer to a page that includes different kinds of icons, such as
those that Jan and Matthia produced, although I think there are a few missing
from that (Katie did some, and Emmanuelle Gutierrez did too, and I don't know
if those are incorporated).

I think it is better to have (semi-)meaningful icons than just shapes
although that does lead to "busy" graphics. (People can always turn them off
of course <grin/>)

Anyway, I am happy to go with what people think (although I am voting for
mine <grin/>) for this draft, although I would like to get some more
conclusion from the original thread too.

I'll follow this up (after some sleep) with a pointer to the collection of
different icons and the discussion so far.

cheers

Charles

  Hi all,

  Before we publish, I think we should revisit the design of the icons. In
  my opinion, the ones we currently have are:

  1. Too large: They are so large that they mess up the line spacing and
  take away from the real content of the document.

  2. Too busy: They have far too much detail in them.

  If all else fails, perhaps we could just go with arbitrary geometric
  shapes? Perhaps colored to make them easier to recognize?
