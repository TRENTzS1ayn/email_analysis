If it wasn't for the tool-tip I would not have had a clue except for the
Multimedia icon.  Re-fining the designing for an icon for conversion tools
might be worthwhile, but markup tools, or content [management?], or
programming tools are too odd.

I do think we should visit the checklist view.  To improve the "view at a
glance" we could use a column header that is the tool tip with the icon in
each column/row for the checkpoint it applies to.
