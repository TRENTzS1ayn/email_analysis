Right - the idea isn't that the icons are instantly comprehensible, just that
they are evocative so it is easy to recall what they mean. It is important to
have the explanation of each icon, and alternative text or a tooltip for
those that prefer it.

By the way I found the reference for the discussion thread in the WCAG group:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2001AprJun/0255 - I will
follow up later again with the page that shows the different icon sets and
updated to include what I didn't at the time.

  I do think we should visit the checklist view.  To improve the "view at a
  glance" we could use a column header that is the tool tip with the icon in
  each column/row for the checkpoint it applies to.

Hmm, I think I like this idea. But it requires a big document reformat that I
was hoping to do in stages, so I am not sure that it would happen in the next
draft.

Cheers
