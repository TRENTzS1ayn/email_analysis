Well, the icons we have available are all in a table now at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/sources/techimages/icons/ for people to select which
are the ones we want (unless someone wants to produce more).

So which icons do we go with?

cheers

    If it wasn't for the tool-tip I would not have had a clue except for the

    programming tools are too odd.

  Right - the idea isn't that the icons are instantly comprehensible, just that
  they are evocative so it is easy to recall what they mean. It is important to
  have the explanation of each icon, and alternative text or a tooltip for
  those that prefer it.

  By the way I found the reference for the discussion thread in the WCAG group:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2001AprJun/0255 - I will
  follow up later again with the page that shows the different icon sets and
  updated to include what I didn't at the time.

    I do think we should visit the checklist view.  To improve the "view at a
    glance" we could use a column header that is the tool tip with the icon in
    each column/row for the checkpoint it applies to.

  Hmm, I think I like this idea. But it requires a big document reformat that I
  was hoping to do in stages, so I am not sure that it would happen in the next
  draft.

  Cheers
