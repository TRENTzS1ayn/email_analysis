Hmmm. I think that having them renderable with a height of 16 pixels means
they will work nicely at a common font size of between 8 and 15 points
without disturbing the layout.

I don't care about the width much, although anything bigger than 2 and a half
times the height would look funny I suspect (I am not going to measure the
WAI icons, but I think they are no more than that).

I actually find it much easier to read when the text is somewhat more
spaced, so personally prefer the larger size. Therefore I vote for larger
icons that can be still be easily distinguished at 16x16

Looking at the icons page in double size and half size was interesting for me
to think about it. Different browsers do this very differently, too.

cheers

  least decide how large they should be displayed.

  I vote for 16 x 16 to lessen the likelihood that the icons will change
  the line spacing.
