Hi,

I have put together another set of icons (attached) that I hope will
provide a compromise.

- The designs are based primarily on Charles's.

- They are 16x16 (if we want extra spacing, let's just put it in the
markup instead of relying on the icons to create space between the
lines)

- Each has a different background color which should help when scanning
a long list of techniques (I don't care which colour goes with which
icon).

- However, the icons do not rely on this color - they each have a unique
shape as well.

---
Cheers,
Jan
