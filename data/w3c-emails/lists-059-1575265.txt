Somewhat general references that deserve (perhaps?) a matrix-like
correlation with information re accessibility features of markup
language types of documentation:

1.2 it may not be clear what "accessibility information" is.
1.3 & 1.4 are being addressed in the Phill/Charles matrices.

GL4 refers to "accessibility problems" and it might be that these are
relatable to specific elements being handled by tools, either creative
or transformational.

GL5's "accessible authoring practices" might merit cross-reference to
documents explaining exactly what these are.

GL6's "features that promote accessibility" could use expansive
explanation, perhaps via a "matrix".
