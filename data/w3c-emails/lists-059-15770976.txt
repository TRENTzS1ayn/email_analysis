Well, I don't think there ias a reference to Wombat in the techniques. But if
so, please let me know - it shouldn't be tehre in the current drafts (althouh
there is a work item to identify which techniques apply to which wombat
checkpoints - especially in the case of checkpoints that have been changes
for wombat)

cheers

Charles
