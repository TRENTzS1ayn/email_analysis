Yes that version is fine. You should really be looking at the current
version, nov 24 - http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WD-ATAG10-TECHS-20011124/appa but
there have been no changes in the content between the two drafts I don't

Since these are all editorial changes I will simply make them, unless there
are any objections.

cheers
