Hi.

I end up still voting for mine. The objections I have to these are as
follows:

The colours should be higher contrast - I actually couldn't really tell what
the backgrounds were.

If they get reduced they rapidly become indistiguishable.

I am about to add these to the icons table
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/sources/techimages/icons/ - give me 10 minutes...

cheers

Charles

  Hi,

  I have put together another set of icons (attached) that I hope will
  provide a compromise.

  - The designs are based primarily on Charles's.

  - They are 16x16 (if we want extra spacing, let's just put it in the
  markup instead of relying on the icons to create space between the
  lines)

  - Each has a different background color which should help when scanning
  a long list of techniques (I don't care which colour goes with which
  icon).

  - However, the icons do not rely on this color - they each have a unique
  shape as well.

  Cheers,
