Yep, I would like the dominant colours to be more saturated.

Anyway, I had a better look at them on the icon table and example pages, and
I think I would like the following:

Programming Tools: Set 5 (Jan - new ones)
DOcument Tools: Set 5 (Jan new ones)
Conversion tools: set 1s (charles)
Content management tools: set 1s (charles)
Multimedia editor: Set 4s (Emmanuelle)

I think it should be noted in the document that there are other icons
availabe and the group would appreciate feedback if there is a preferred set.

  What do you mean by "contrast"? There is a very high contrast between
  the background and the black detailing. If you mean you'd like the
  background colours to be slightly more saturated, fine by me.

  Why would they ever be reduced? They are already 16x16.
  It is the large icons that suffer quality reduction when they are
  displayed at 16x16.
