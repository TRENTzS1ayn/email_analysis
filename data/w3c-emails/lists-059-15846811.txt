Hi,

I think we should change the word Required, which we use to describe
techniques that we think are an imprtant part of meeting a checkpoint. I
would prefer to have "strongly recommended".

I think we should also explain in the "how this document is organised"
section at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WD-ATAG10-TECHS-20011124/Overview#this
that these terms reflect the working group's opinion:

"Strongly recommended" means that the working group considers that any
conformant application would have to implement this technique, although there
may be other ways of meeting the checkpoint that the working group has not
considered

"Suggested" means that the working group recommends implementing this
technique as a way to better meet the goals of the checkpoint, although this
is not necessarily required for conformance.
