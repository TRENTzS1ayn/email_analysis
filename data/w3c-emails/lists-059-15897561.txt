Now, maybe we are getting somewhere. 

I have:

Programming Tools: Set 5 (Jan - new ones)
= Increased color saturation background.

Document Tools: Set 5 (Jan new ones)
= Increased color saturation background.

Conversion tools: set 1s (charles)
= Tried to clean up this icon, but is just too complex for the 16x16
space, so I'm proposing another design.

Content management tools: set 1s (charles)
= Cleaned up this icon and brought it into line with the style of the
first two.

Multimedia editor: Set 4s (Emmanuelle)
= Given this icon a graphic background.

Does this bring us closer to agreement?

Maybe I'm spending too much time on this, but I really think that, given
the important role of these icons all the way through the document, the
appearance of these icons will be a major determinant in how seriously
people perceive the document.
