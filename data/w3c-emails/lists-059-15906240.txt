Maybe I am mistaken, but I believe that the point:
ATAG 3.4 Do not automatically generate equivalent alternatives.
it is correct.
The tool should not generate equivalent alternative automatically and they
should prevent that the document continues being published until the user
indicates the equivalent alternative, manually.

The possibility that the tool includes any alternative text for defect, it
would take to the necessity that the evaluation tools, of the own tool or
external, was able to identify those alternative texts, to notice to the
user that makes the evaluation that it lacks a correct alternative text.

By the way, very nice icons :)

Regards,
Emmanuelle
