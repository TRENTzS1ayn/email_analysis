I agree with Liddy, I thnk that getting these icons really good is valuable,
and that we need a lot of input and to try a bunch of stuff.

Anyway, I like the new ones. I think that it should be an open issue beyond
the next version, but I am now not decided on any set. (I am torn between the
reduced versions of mine - I find the busy thing helpful, and the colour
saturation important - and the new set Jan did).

I'll update the icons table over the weekend.

cheers

Charles

  I think you are doing a service by getting these right - they are very
  useful icons.
