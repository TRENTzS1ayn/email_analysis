It's like 2 except that that message is for the INTERNAL use by the tool
(basically flagging a problem). If it isn't fixed by the end of the
editing session, the attribute must be removed. Would removing this
flagged attribute violate 2.2? i.e. does "generate" refer to creating
the markup in the tool or saving it? Or both?

JR: 3.4 could be changed (in an errata) to specify that:
    the only allowable generated text is "place holder text generated by
    [authoring tool name]", which must be replaced by human authored
text
    by the end of the document editing session.
