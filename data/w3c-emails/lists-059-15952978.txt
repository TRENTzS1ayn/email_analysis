Yes, it would violate 2.2 - by removing the attribute from any HTML
specification since 1997 it is generating invalid markup. Internal
information held by the tool can be in any format desired - whether it adds a
temporary flag that is not saved as part of the document, (amaya does
something like this for marking various features) or whether it generates
some EARL that it stores and updates locally, publishing it only at the point
where the document is saved, or whether it applies a validity checking
algorithm to find where alternatives are missing.

In general we don't specify how tools should deal with checkpoints (what
their internal processes are) in the guidelines. We could list this as a
technique, but we still need to resolve the issue of which guideline comes
out on top. I agree with Emmanuelle that 3.4 is the important one, and we
should be explicit about that.

cheers

  It's like 2 except that that message is for the INTERNAL use by the tool
  (basically flagging a problem). If it isn't fixed by the end of the
  editing session, the attribute must be removed. Would removing this
  flagged attribute violate 2.2? i.e. does "generate" refer to creating
  the markup in the tool or saving it? Or both?

  JR: 3.4 could be changed (in an errata) to specify that:
      the only allowable generated text is "place holder text generated by
      [authoring tool name]", which must be replaced by human authored
  text
      by the end of the document editing session.
