Hi folks,

I have now posted a draft for a group FAQ at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/faq but becuase it is still a draft I ahve not
linked it from the home page yet. Would people please review it and check if
there is anything that must be changed before we publicise it, and then if
there are tings that should be changed / added / removed?

Cheers

Charles
