All AU working group members,
Before we publish the Techniques Document to TR we need consensus on 
a number of issues. Could everyone please respond by Thursday the 
13th.
The issues are as follows:

1. Which Icons should we be using. To view the candidate icons please 
go to: 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/sources/techimages/icons/Overview.html and 
follow the thread "Au Techniques: Icons" on the list.
2. We need to resolve inconsistencies regarding advice on default 
alt-text, for this please follow the thread: "Au techs/ ATAG errata
3. We need agreement on the proposal to move techniques from 3.3 to 
1.4, see thread " [AU Techniques] moving techniques for 3.3"
4. Does everyone agree with the proposed additional techniques 
relevant to conversion tools, see the thread titled "[AU techniques] 
Conversion tools"
5. We need agreement on the proposed rewording of the required 
terminology. See the thread "AU techs - change "[required]" and 
explain it"
6. Should we add the priority/conformance section? See thread: "AU 
techs ad priorities and conformance"

Please make your opinion known by this Thursday. If I don't hear from 
you by noon on Thursday, I might follow up individually.

Thanks Jutta
