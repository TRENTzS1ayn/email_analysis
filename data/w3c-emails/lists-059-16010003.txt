  All AU working group members,
  Before we publish the Techniques Document to TR we need consensus on
  a number of issues. Could everyone please respond by Thursday the
  13th.
  The issues are as follows:

  1. Which Icons should we be using. To view the candidate icons please
  go to:
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/sources/techimages/icons/Overview.html and
  follow the thread "Au Techniques: Icons" on the list.

In particular I have not yet added to the table Jan's icons, available at
