  2. We need to resolve inconsistencies regarding advice on default
  alt-text, for this please follow the thread: "Au techs/ ATAG errata

I stand by my proposal that 3.4 overrides 2.2 if necessary.

  3. We need agreement on the proposal to move techniques from 3.3 to
  1.4, see thread " [AU Techniques] moving techniques for 3.3"

I support moving these

  4. Does everyone agree with the proposed additional techniques
  relevant to conversion tools, see the thread titled "[AU techniques]
  Conversion tools"

I do

  5. We need agreement on the proposed rewording of the required
  terminology. See the thread "AU techs - change "[required]" and
  explain it"

I stand by my original proposal

  6. Should we add the priority/conformance section? See thread: "AU
  techs ad priorities and conformance"

I think we should.

(number 1 to come tomorrow)

cheers
