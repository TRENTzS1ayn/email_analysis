Hi all,

I have done a check to ensure that the technique wording stays above the
level of markup implementation. Here are my results:


T0176 If the author has not specified alternative text for an IMG, or
specified that none is required, default to having no "alt" attribute,
so that an accessibility problem will be noted. 

Should be:

T0176 If the author has not specified an alternative equivalent, or
specified that none is required, do not insert a place holder. Place
holders complicate third party checking for missing alternative
equivalents. 

---

T0225 Include considerations for accessibility - such as the "alt" and
"longdesc" attributes of the HTML IMG element - right below the "src"
attribute in a dialogue box, not buried behind an "Advanced..." button.

Should be:

T0225 Include considerations for accessibility, such as fields for
equivalent alternatives, in high priority locations within insertion and
editing dialogs for non-text objects. These fields should not buried
with rarely used functionality, behind an "Advanced..." button, for
example.

---

T0228 If there is more than one option for the author, and one option is
more accessible than another, place the more accessible option first and
make it the default. For example, when the author has selected text to
format, the use of CSS should be emphasized rather than deprecated FONT
element.

Should be:

T0228 If there is more than one option for the author, and one option is
more accessible than another, place the more accessible option first and
make it the default. For example, when the author has selected text to
format, the use of style sheets should be emphasized rather than
presentational markup.

---

T0234 Always include accessibility-related practices in every example
for which one would be required, regardless of whether the example is
meant to emphasize this or not (e.g., HTML IMG elements should appear
with an alt attribute and a longdesc attribute wherever appropriate).

Should be:

T0234 Always include accessibility-related practices in every example
for which one would be required, regardless of whether the example is
meant to emphasize this or not (e.g., non-text elements should always
include equivalent alternatives).

---

T0294 Implement the HTML "accesskey" attribute, and activate it in
editing views.

Should be:

T0294 Implement all the keyboard accessibility features of the supported
language (tab order, quick keys, etc.) and activate them in the editing
views.
