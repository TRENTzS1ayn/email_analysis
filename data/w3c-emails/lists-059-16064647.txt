I don't think the techniques need to stay aobve the level of markup
implementation - I think they should get as close into it with real examples
as possible.

  Hi all,

  I have done a check to ensure that the technique wording stays above the
  level of markup implementation. Here are my results:


  T0176 If the author has not specified alternative text for an IMG, or
  specified that none is required, default to having no "alt" attribute,
  so that an accessibility problem will be noted.

  Should be:

  T0176 If the author has not specified an alternative equivalent, or
  specified that none is required, do not insert a place holder. Place
  holders complicate third party checking for missing alternative
  equivalents.

  T0225 Include considerations for accessibility - such as the "alt" and
  "longdesc" attributes of the HTML IMG element - right below the "src"
  attribute in a dialogue box, not buried behind an "Advanced..." button.

  Should be:

  T0225 Include considerations for accessibility, such as fields for
  equivalent alternatives, in high priority locations within insertion and
  editing dialogs for non-text objects. These fields should not buried
  with rarely used functionality, behind an "Advanced..." button, for
  example.

  ---

  T0228 If there is more than one option for the author, and one option is
  more accessible than another, place the more accessible option first and
  make it the default. For example, when the author has selected text to
  format, the use of CSS should be emphasized rather than deprecated FONT
  element.

  T0234 Always include accessibility-related practices in every example
  for which one would be required, regardless of whether the example is
  meant to emphasize this or not (e.g., HTML IMG elements should appear
  with an alt attribute and a longdesc attribute wherever appropriate).

  T0294 Implement the HTML "accesskey" attribute, and activate it in
  editing views.

  T0294 Implement all the keyboard accessibility features of the supported
  language (tab order, quick keys, etc.) and activate them in the editing
  views.
