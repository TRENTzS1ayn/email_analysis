Hi all,

I suggest the following changes:

1.- In:
"Why are these guidelines necessary?
Many of today's authoring tools are difficult to use and/or they create
content that is difficult to access for people with disabilities. ..."

2.- In:
"Do authors have to use conformant tools to create accessible Web pages?
It is possible to create accessible Web pages with non-conformant tools, by
using either a text editor, WYSIWYG, or other editor, and directly applying
the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 while creating the page. This
may involve more steps than if using a conformant tool, for instance going
into the source code to ensure that the tool is generating valid code, or
performing steps manually to check the accessibility of a page. For authors
who are less familiar with <insert>the markup languages and/or </insert> the
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0, authoring tools that conform to
ATAG 1.0 may significantly facilitate production of accessible Web sites."

3.- In:
...be easy or difficult to use?

I believe that the fact that a tool supports ATAG affects its ease of use.
For example, the alternative texts of the buttons can help many people to
use the tool. But I don't have a suggestion for the writing of this point
because, as is clear, I am not a master of English. <green>


Kind regards,
Emmanuelle
