I have now linked the FAQ from the WAI page, and have asked the EO group for
comments since that is one of the things they do.
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/faq

I incorporated Jan's changes, since they didn't seem to me to alter the
substance at all, but have not incorporated any of the changes proposed by
Emmanuelle yet, since they seem significant.

I think that the best way to deal with this document in the future is to
propose modifications to the list, and when they are accepted by the working
group they can be incorporated into the FAQ. Hopefully it will have enough
changes made soon to be a useful introduction/overview of the group - at the
moment I think it is still heavily oriented towards ATAG 1, and the style
seems a bit odd to me, but I assume that will change as people use it and
comment.

cheers

Charles
