Hi folks

there is an issues list for Wombat http://www.w3.org/WAU/AU/wombatissues

at the moment it only contains references to the current live issues - there
is the prompt issue that was raised before the document ever came into being,
and no doubt there are other issues to go on the table when the group next
returns to editing the wombat draft.

cheers

Charles
