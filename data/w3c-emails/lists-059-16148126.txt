Could everyone please review the Wombat issues list. The URL is: 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/wombatissues.html. Does this correctly 
reflect  the issues and resolutions? We would like to publish the 
document this week. Could you send any concerns/corrections/edits or 
disagreements to the list by Wednesday the 19th.

Thanks Jutta
