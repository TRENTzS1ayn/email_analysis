Hi all, two corrections, and a note that I also took minutes in the end -
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/meetings/17dec01 - I'll link them to this as well.

corrections:

CMN said Technique T0176 does NOT need to be deleted if we accept proposal 3.

And the issues document was first published along with the 2 December draft
of Wombat, and updated last Friday.

cheers

Chaals
