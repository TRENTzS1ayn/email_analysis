Phill,

I'm happy to post stuff for the WG, (It needs to have its owner listed, and a
status of the document section, but I can add those) but the turnaround can
often be 24 hours - depends on whether I am awake at the time and online.

Cheers

Charles

  Charles, I'm fixing up the table with some better and "more accessible"
  makup.  Can I send it directly to you to host on a w3c server, or should I
  host it on one of my IBM public servers?
