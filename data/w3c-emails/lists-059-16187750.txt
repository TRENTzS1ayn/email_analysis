My two cents on the issues list:

In 1., put checkpoint number (i.e. 1.2) in the content of the list as
well as the table of contents.

In 3., 4., 5., 6., 7., 8., 9., reference the appropriate checkpoint.

In 6., suthor=>author

Under resolved issues, let's put in some of the other issues we have
resolved during the creation of Wombat (i.e. combining of some redundant
checkpoints, the accessible help examples issue, etc.)
