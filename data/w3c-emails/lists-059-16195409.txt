  My two cents on the issues list:

  In 1., put checkpoint number (i.e. 1.2) in the content of the list as
  well as the table of contents.

  In 3., 4., 5., 6., 7., 8., 9., reference the appropriate checkpoint.

  In 6., suthor=>author

All these can be done.

  Under resolved issues, let's put in some of the other issues we have
  resolved during the creation of Wombat (i.e. combining of some redundant
  checkpoints, the accessible help examples issue, etc.)

Yep, I am happy to go find these and do them afterwards. If you think this
needs to be done first (and it might do) please let me know as that stops the
publication process for this year.

cheers

Charles
