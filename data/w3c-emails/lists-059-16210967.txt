Updated...............


* note *  We will be working on this all day previous to the call, so
recheck here 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/508/508-UAAG.html just before the call to get
the latest. And if you have any specific suggestions or requests please
send them to us this am, but we will certainly be anxious to implement
the feedback received during the call. * /note *

As per the call last week, we have:

1) changed the title
2) Inserted Access Board disclaimer
3) added specific references pages
4) my favorite reindeer have been removed
5) Added a "Relevance to Accessibility" section which may or may
not be needed
6) Added a "Who Benefits" to some individual UAAG checkpoints
(taken from Tech.)

Relative to #20 adding 3.5, timed response and refresh are two different
things, but it still seems relevant.  What do you all think?

Relative to #10 adding 4.1, this talks about Variety of available "Text"
sizes, can this fit here?

Cannot find 2.12??
