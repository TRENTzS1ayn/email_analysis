To clarify, I was the one typing some of the content into IRC when 
possible, however this was not my expectation prior to the meeting, nor can 
I type for an extended time. Sorry if it wasn't what you were expecting.

That mode may or may not be realistic for the group to support on a regular 
basis, depending on the extent of connectivity of group members who are 
available to type into IRC for members who are not on the phone. IRC is 
used as a supplemental participation mode in a number of groups, but less 
frequently as a complete replacement mode except where there are several 
people with phone access available to type into IRC. I'll leave that up to 
the group.

Yes it usually takes extended rounds of conversation to reach a clear 
consensus in W3C WG's. But neither of the documents under discussion at 
this week's meeting were final stage specifications, so to some extent the 
group is in the midst of an on-going process on these documents.

WAI will be replacing the AUWG staff effort, and will likely have some 
interim support until the replacement is available.

>And with all these complicated docs outstanding we're losing Ian?

The minutes were incorrect with regard to Ian's involvement, where it 
mentioned him becoming AUWG staff contact; in actuality, he will be 
reducing but not eliminating his time with the group that he has been staff 
contact for, which is UAWG. That has been planned for a very long time -- 
in fact he has extended his stay at a high level of time with UAWG far 
longer than originally planned, which, though unanticipated, has been great 
for WAI. But again, we will be replacing the balance of Ian's effort on 
UAWG, but also keeping some of his involvement there, and he will remain 
active in the WAI domain. The total effort on UAWG will be slightly more 
staff support than previously.

There are a number of reasons for the change. WAI continues to be committed 
to the specifications under development in this group; to promoting 
implementations of the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines; to ensuring 
effective integration of the specifications; etc. As I've stated above, we 
are arranging for some interim support, then for a replacement of the staff 
effort on this group, and I expect that the group should be able to make 
good progress in the coming months.

But as with any W3C working group, the progress of the group does not 
wholly rest on the staff contact, but on contributed effort from other WG 
members as Jutta reminded people at the meeting this week. W3C working 
groups often do change staff contacts; when there is commitment & ongoing 
contribution from the group members, the group continues to move ahead. One 
of the most important things that AUWG members can do is to complete the 
conformance reviews that members have committed to. With more comparative 
data on ATAG implementations, it will be easier to see the areas where 
additional implementation promotion is needed, and also to see the areas 
where there's been an actual gain in support for accessible authoring.

Regards,

- Judy
