Please can people let me (everyone) know if they are going to this 
and what the agenda will be.  I am very worried that I have already 
spent a lot of money on half the ticket and don't want to spend even 
more on the other half if it is not going to be well attended, esp. 
as Jutta and I are supposed to be in Sydney with a very good 
collection of authoring tools folk at that time for IMS Accessibility.

The Sydney IMS meeting should achieve a lot so it might be better to 
contribute to that (and far less expensive from here!)

Liddy
