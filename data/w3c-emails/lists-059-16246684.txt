Hi folks,

I am not certain of attending that meeting yet - although I plan to be there,
my new priorities mean that it is possible I will be trying to work with
other groups at that time. (This is not clear yet).

cheers

Charles

  as Jutta and I are supposed to be in Sydney with a very good
  collection of authoring tools folk at that time for IMS Accessibility.

  The Sydney IMS meeting should achieve a lot so it might be better to
  contribute to that (and far less expensive from here!)
