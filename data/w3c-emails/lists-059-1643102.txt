On the call we discussed the idea that checking could be split three ways -
things that require the author to check, syntax that is machine checkable,
and semantics that are machine checkable.

I took an action to write up somthing that could be used as a definition of
check for in checkpoint 4.1

Proposal

Check for

   Check for means that the tool must provide some mechanism for testing,
   although it may be done by asking the author to check something that the
   tool cannot mechanically determine, by checking syntax, which is readily
   automated (and required also by 2.2 and 2.3) by mechanically checking semantic
   information, such as searching a dictionary for acronyms, or checking
   colour combinations, or by asking the author to confirm guesses made by
   the tool (for example presenting a linearised version of a page for the
   author to check if it makes sense).
