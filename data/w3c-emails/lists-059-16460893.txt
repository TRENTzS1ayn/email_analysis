Hi all,

I have put together a prototype of how the conformance page might look.

http://ultrajuan.ic.utoronto.ca/~jan/WAI/tools2.html

1. The disclaimer for the page is given more visibility.
2. The process we were discussing yesterday on the call has been spelled
out and placed at the end of the page.
3. The process section includes a link to the conformance evaluation
template that I sent out several months ago. I have updated the template
with the review disclaimer and the required review information.
4. As a space saving measure, only tools with evaluations have a row in
the table. The others are placed in a single row at the bottom. I have
only done this with markup editor category so far, but if people like
it, I'll do the same with the other categories.

Comments? Do the process steps cover all that we discussed yesterday?

Cheers,
Jan
