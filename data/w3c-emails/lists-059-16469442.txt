Jan,
2 quick comments.

If this page becomes public (outside the WG scope) please take out the 
evaluation of Dreamweaver I did. It was only an exercise to see how 
usable where the ATAG and their techniques at that time. I will produce 
shortly a public review.

I think it would be useful to list, in a new column, also the author of 
the review. And to describe more thoroughly the tool. In my specific 
case it was Dreamweaver + 508AS.
