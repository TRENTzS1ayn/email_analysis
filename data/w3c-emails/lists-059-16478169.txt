Yep, this looks good. I think a bit of tightening on the wording could
happen, but nothing really crucial.

  Hi all,

  I have put together a prototype of how the conformance page might look.

  http://ultrajuan.ic.utoronto.ca/~jan/WAI/tools2.html

  1. The disclaimer for the page is given more visibility.
  2. The process we were discussing yesterday on the call has been spelled
  out and placed at the end of the page.
  3. The process section includes a link to the conformance evaluation
  template that I sent out several months ago. I have updated the template
  with the review disclaimer and the required review information.
  4. As a space saving measure, only tools with evaluations have a row in
  the table. The others are placed in a single row at the bottom. I have
  only done this with markup editor category so far, but if people like
  it, I'll do the same with the other categories.

  Comments? Do the process steps cover all that we discussed yesterday?

  Cheers,
  Jan
