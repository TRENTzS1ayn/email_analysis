Dear Jan,

I reviewed the page, and I think it reflects the discussion Monday. 
Three comments:
* The proposed template is too long. Maybe we shall review it in one of 
the WG meetings. As we discussed off-the-list, maybe we shall develop a 
review XML Schema that will allow for different views of a review 
through an XSLT transformation.
* The Bluefish tool is not part of OpenOffice.org, but sponsored by a 
Dutch company called OpenOffice. http://www.openoffice.nl/
* Tools not evaluated maybe shall be in another page.

Regards,
carlos
