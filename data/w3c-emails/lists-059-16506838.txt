  Dear Jan,

  I reviewed the page, and I think it reflects the discussion Monday.
  Three comments:
  * The proposed template is too long. Maybe we shall review it in one of
  the WG meetings. As we discussed off-the-list, maybe we shall develop a
  review XML Schema that will allow for different views of a review
  through an XSLT transformation.

Well, that would be cool. In  the meantime we could use a standardised XHTML
format that can be transformed, or can be read straight out in browsers - I
think that it is easier for people to edit XHTML but I notice that even then
a lot of editors are in practise producing buggy code...

  * Tools not evaluated maybe shall be in another page.
CMN
That was how it used to be, and I have to admit that I prefer Jan's approach
of having all the tools together. I guess this is a good question for a poll
<grin/>

cheers
Charles
