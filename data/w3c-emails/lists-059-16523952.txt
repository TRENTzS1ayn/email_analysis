I have taken the opportunity presented by the need to integrate the
real-time (live?) prompting piece into the prompting appendix to put
together a proposal to revamp the whole document (with input from
Carlos). This includes: working in some concepts from the HCI literature
on interruption and adapting the screenshots to show accessibility
related scenarios rather than grammar and spell checking.

The proposal is located at:
http://ultrajuan.ic.utoronto.ca/~jan/WAI/appa.html

Please send proposed additions, comments, questions, etc. to the list.
