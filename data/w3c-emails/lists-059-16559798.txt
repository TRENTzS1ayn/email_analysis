I'm sorry - like Jutta I was on a train but I couldn't find a phone 
on my train.

I worked on the appendix for prompts and my suggestions are attached 
- mostly little things but it is tricky stuff and so I think getting 
it very clear and simple is important. The content and ideas seem 
fine to me.
