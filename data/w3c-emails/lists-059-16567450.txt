Thanks Liddy,

I have put up a new version of the Appendix at:

http://ultrajuan.ic.utoronto.ca/~jan/WAI/appa.html

New things:
-Changes from the meeting (including Carlos's idea to remove grouping of
prompts)
-Liddy's changes.
-New screenshot for how the real-time prompting of a secondary author
might look.

Thoughts?

Cheers,
Jan

PS: I hope to have the new tools pages up tomorrow.
