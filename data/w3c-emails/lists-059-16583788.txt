Here is the updated tools page (sorry for the delay - I was side-tracked
last week):

http://ultrajuan.ic.utoronto.ca/~jan/WAI/tools.html

The process section has been tightened up and placed in a linked page
"tools_process.html". For the evaluation template, I made the link
changes agreed on during the call and added extra instructional text. I
have not yet removed the WCAG references, since the new instructional
text and techniques links might adequately address the concerns about
how the Relative Priority Checkpoints are handled.

Cheers,
Jan
