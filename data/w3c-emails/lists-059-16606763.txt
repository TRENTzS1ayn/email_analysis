I note the administrative order Feb 4, 2002 from the
Illinois Office of the Governor
     http://www200.state.il.us/tech/tech_administrative.cfm
directs each agency to utilize the accessibility requirements,
     http://www200.state.il.us/tech/technology/accessibility/
among other issues. Included are requirements that meet or exceed all
Section 508 and WCAG priority 1.

At the bottom of that administrative order are six blocks using the State's
public key infrastructure for digital signatures/PK3 authenticity verification:
Sign, Verify, Unsign, Get Signer, PKI Status, and PKI Signer.
Each of these six textual images has the same alt text:

     "Submission Form Elements"

I think that those may pose an accessibility issue. I'm not clear what 
value they
provide, or what content may be missed.

A second image contains the governor's signature (with alt text).
