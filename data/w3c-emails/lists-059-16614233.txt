Hi folks,

I did a conformance review of Amaya 5.3 a little while ago. As far as I can
tell it is reasonably correct, and I have got no suggested changes from the
Amaya Team.

I note that Amaya 6.1 is now available, and some changes have been made. I do
not know if I will have time to maintain this report.

It is available at http://www.w3.org/2002/03/amaya5-3-atag1

enjoy
