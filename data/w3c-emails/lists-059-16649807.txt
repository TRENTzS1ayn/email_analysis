The next two Mondays are holidays in one country or another. How many 
people can make the call on Monday the 21st and how many people can 
make it on the 24th?

Also in planning the next face to face meeting, how many people would 
be able to make a face to face meeting in Linz Austria on July 15 and 
16th?
