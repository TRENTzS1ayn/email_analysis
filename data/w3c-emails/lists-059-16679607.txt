Ironically it looks like we have more people who can make it to the 
meeting in Austria than to the teleconferences on the next two 
Mondays. I also put the wrong dates in my last email for the Mondays, 
the dates are actually May the 20th which is the Canadian Victoria 
day and the 27th which is the US Memorial Day and the Spring Bank 
Holiday in Britain (I'm not sure what calender I was looking at, my 
apologies).

Given the small number of people who can attend the teleconference 
next Monday the 20th, we will not hold a teleconference on that date. 
The next regularly scheduled teleconference will be on June 3rd which 
is a holiday only in New Zealand. If important issues arise that we 
need to discuss synchronously, in the interim, I will try to arrange 
another teleconference time before June the 3rd as well.

Given the positive replies to the meeting in Austria, I will pursue 
organizing this.

Thanks
Jutta
