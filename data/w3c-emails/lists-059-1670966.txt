In putting together the matrix I made the comment that many of the WCAG
checkpoints don't apply to the ATAG checkpoints "3.1 Prompt for alternative
information..." and "3.2 Help create structured content and separate it..."

This is confusing and at least a note needs to be added to the 3.1 and 3.2
checkpoints
