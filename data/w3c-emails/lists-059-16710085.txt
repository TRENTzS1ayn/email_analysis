We have had a fairly good response to the meeting in Linz, 
consequently we have booked the meeting from noon Monday July the 
15th and all day Tuesday the 16th. This will be in conjunction with 
the ICCHP conference, www.icchp.at. WCAG will also be holding a 
meeting at the conference.  We will briefly finalize the agenda 
during the call on Monday June 3rd.
