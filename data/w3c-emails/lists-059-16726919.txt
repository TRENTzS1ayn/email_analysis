Great subject line. :)

I don't have any answers, but glad you are asking these questions.  Another 
thing to take into consideration is the work on WCAG 2.0. [1]  WCAG 2.0 has 
"success criteria" for each checkpoint - these are supposed to be testable.

The Techniques documents will have more testable criteria that look more 
like the AERT. [2]

Therefore, if WCAG provides what should be produced, ATAG should provide 
how to help the author get it there....not a new idea....just restating it 
FYI.  This follows along what we discussed last June in Amsterdam [3].
