At this point the evaluation techniques are for ATAG 1.0, which
references only WCAG 1.0. Once WCAG 2.0 is released, a new version of
ATAG can be published that refers to the new version of WCAG. Only then
we will be able to update the ATAG implementation techniques and ATAG
evaluation techniques documents to take advantage of all the advances in
WCAG 2.0, including the "success criteria".

Absolutely.
