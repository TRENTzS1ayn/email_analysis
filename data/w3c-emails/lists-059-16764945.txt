Wendy, today there are WCAG 1.0 techniques by mark-up; Core, HTML, CSS,
SVG?  -  are there going to be in WCAG 2.0 testable *by mark-up format*
that ATAG can reference?  If true, then ATAG evaluation techniques would be
"something like AERT but with different tool types" that reference the WCAG
2.0 testable techniques for *mark-up formats* such as HTML, SVG, etc. Today
AUWG will have to reference WCAG 1.0 techniques, even though they may not
be as testable as the WCAG 2.0 ones will be.

great.

Is there any discussion of a mock web site or set of files that has correct
and incorrect mark-up so that both the "testable techniques" of WCAG 2.0
and ATAG evaluation techniques could reference them?  For example. if the
HTML mark-up type authoring tool does not "prompt" the author in some way
to correct the missing alt attribute in file x (from WCAG 2.0 techniques),
then the tool fails compliance with ATAG checkpoint 3.1

At this point the evaluation techniques are for ATAG 1.0, which
references only WCAG 1.0. Once WCAG 2.0 is released, a new version of
ATAG can be published that refers to the new version of WCAG. Only then
we will be able to update the ATAG implementation techniques and ATAG
evaluation techniques documents to take advantage of all the advances in
WCAG 2.0, including the "success criteria".

Absolutely.
