A little perspective: I attended the "kickoff breakfast" at WWW6 for
WAI. The "accessibility track" was fairly intense and many of us who
were there are still about. The high point of the overall proceedings
for me were the presentations of Cascading Style Sheets by Chris Lilley,
Bert Bos and Hakon Lie. Not only were they supportive of Prof.
Goldfarb's (creator of SGML - he spoke at the WAI kickoff) urge to
religiously maintain separation of content/presentation, but they seemed
well aware of their importance to our aims. Now a few Web decades later,
CSS is still only spottily implemented or widely understood.

The point of all this history is that as we move towards Recommendation
for our Guideline Document, we should maintain a little metaview of how
long it will take before any effects take hold for our friends/clients.
The participation of vendor reps has made this a much more salutary
undertaking than I'd previously feared, so perhaps the tools in question
will get better faster than I worry, but at any rate: patience! This is
the point at which I want to thank all Working Group participants for
the privilege of being permitted to observe and hopefully affect this
little Cosa Nostra.
