Another thing I forgot :-(

The checklists now have text explaining that they refer to WCAG, and can be
met at three different priority levels. (THe table version doesn't make a
space for that yet)

I ahve not updated the issues list to reflect yesterday's meeting - that will
have to wait until thursday.

  I forgot to mention that I have added references to ERT, the XML draft
  guidelines, accessibility notes, etc to 4.1 techniques as pointers for now.
  
  Cheers
