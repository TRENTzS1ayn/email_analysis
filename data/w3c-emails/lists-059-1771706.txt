I like the wording on 1.3, 3.1, and 3.2 with the following editorial
changes

>Checkpoint 1.3 (as per the meeting yesterday):
>
> 1.3 Ensure that when the tool automatically generates markup it conforms
to
> the W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
> [WAI-WEBCONTENT].  [Relative Priority]
>
PJ: delete 'W3C's' and add 'Note.' as in:
Note. Some checkpoints in the Web ... are not applicable to the tool
automatically generating markup.

>Checkpoint 3.1:
>
> 3.1 Prompt the author to provide equivalent alternative information
(e.g.,
> captions, auditory descriptions and collated text transcripts for
> video). [Relative Priority]
> Note. Some Checkpoints in Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
> [WAI-WEBCONTENT] may not be applicable.
>
PJ: finish sentence and lowercase for 'checkpoint' as in:
Note. Some checkpoints in the Web ... are not applicable to providing
equivalent alternative information.

>Checkpoint 3.2:
>
> 3.2 Help the author create structured content and separate information
from
> its presentation. [Relative Priority]
> Note: Some Checkpoints in Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
> [WAI-WEBCONTENT] may not be applicable.
PJ: finish sentence and lowercase for 'checkpoint' as in:
Note. Some checkpoints in the Web ... are not applicable to creating
structured content and separating it's presentation.


The section or sections in the techniques document would then have the
appropriate information [proposed matrix] about each WCAG checkpoint
applicability to that ATAG checkpoint.
