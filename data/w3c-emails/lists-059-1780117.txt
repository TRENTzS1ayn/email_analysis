I believe we should keep my proposed [different from the 2 Dec draft] in
the guidelines to improve understanding on the applicability in the
conformance section:

<PJ proposal>:
Note. Some "Authoring Tool Accessibility Guideline" checkpoints may not
apply to certain classes of authoring tools.  The scope of the tool's
design
dictates whether the requirements of a checkpoint are applicable. [A]
Some checkpoints require a tool to implement applicable functionality in
order
for the tool to claims conformance with the checkpoint.  [Sample
conformance
evaluations] are provide as example only, and are not necessarily validated
 or
endorsed by W3C.

[sample conformance evaluations] would link to ?

As I read the paragraph again, a "for example" might need to be added, such
as:

[A] For example, [checking for and alerting the author] about [providing
information about the general layout of a site (e.g., a site map or table
of contents)] would not be in the scope of all authoring tools.
