I believe the issue raised by Bruce Roberts, Lotus is not being address or
resolved.
The issues as stated by Bruce

As a working group we've added a definition of "skill level of the author"
as it applies the definition of priorities.
But we haven't really addressed the notion of assuming a higher level of
skilled user and therefore being able to lower the priorities assigned.
