One proposal raised by Phill that we did not have time to address in
yesterday's meeting was his proposal regarding relative priority and
applicability text. Could everyone review this and comment to the list
before Friday.

I would remove much of the paragraph under "relative priority", because it
deals more with "applicability".  "applicability is being covered nicely
with each checkpoint and a general paragraph may add to the confusion.  I
would replace both paragraphs about with this one:

<PJ proposal 1.1[*]>:
In assigning priority levels for checkpoints, "the author" or user of the
tool is assumed to be aware of the language supported, to be a competent,
but not necessarily an expert, user of the tool, and to have only a nominal
knowledge of accessibility. For example, the author is not expected to have
read all of the documentation packaged with the tool, but is expected to
know how to turn to the integrated help and documentation for assistance.

[*]I deleted the first sentence and fixed some grammar from my earlier
post...
