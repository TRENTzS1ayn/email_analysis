aloha, jutta!

i concur with ian's editorial enhancements to your statement, with the possible
exception of his request that you change quote must be applied by unquote to
quote apply to unquote...

the WG adopts his suggestion, so will i -- unless, of course, i can marshal my
scattered thoughts on the subject into something coherent and convincing...
