As I recall the discussion, the idea that an author would be familiar with
the language produced by the tool was implicitly rejected in the majority vie
of the working group that an author cannot be expected to know the nuts and
bolts, only how to use a tool. I know almost nothing about Word's binary
encoding, and nearly nothing about RTF. But I am quite happy to use a tool to
produce them, and hope that the tool knows what I need to do and makes me do
it.

So I am not going to add the "language" phrase in the draft I am about to
do. This can be discussed on list if it is in fact an issue.

  I would remove much of the paragraph under "relative priority", because it
  deals more with "applicability".  "applicability is being covered nicely
  with each checkpoint and a general paragraph may add to the confusion.  I
  would replace both paragraphs about with this one:
  
  <PJ proposal 1.1[*]>:
  In assigning priority levels for checkpoints, "the author" or user of the
  tool is assumed to be aware of the language supported, to be a competent,
  but not necessarily an expert, user of the tool, and to have only a nominal
  knowledge of accessibility. For example, the author is not expected to have
  read all of the documentation packaged with the tool, but is expected to
  know how to turn to the integrated help and documentation for assistance.
  
  [*]I deleted the first sentence and fixed some grammar from my earlier
  post...
