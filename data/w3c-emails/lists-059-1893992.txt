The problem with this is that guidelines aren't the critical bit, checkpoints
are, but in some cases they are not applicable. For example, a tool which has
no editing view of a document, such as a one-pass converter, doesn't need to
have a search feature in the editing view.

I am thinking about it for a bit. The wording here seems cleaner than the big
piece thatis currently in the definition, so if I can see how it works with
applicability then I'll put it in for the draft which I plan to publish later
tonight my time which means in the US morning (I missed a flight home last
night and my day has been rather skewered by the opportunities that raised).

Actually I think Ian's amendments are all good - I think the reservation
might be about taking out must, but I thought about that and decided it was
redundant, myself.

So if I don't get to play on the swing, we can always ahve a go on the
roundabout.

  i concur with ian's editorial enhancements to your statement, with the possible
  exception of his request that you change quote must be applied by unquote to
  quote apply to unquote...
  
  yet, since i can't quite articulate my opposition to his last suggestion, if
  the WG adopts his suggestion, so will i -- unless, of course, i can marshal my
  scattered thoughts on the subject into something coherent and convincing...
