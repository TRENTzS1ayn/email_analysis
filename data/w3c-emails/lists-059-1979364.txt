As I understand this issue, Phill and Bruce have slightly different
positions.

I understand Phill's position to be that we should assume an author has some
knowledge of and strong motivation to produce (and therefore to teach
themselves about) accessibility. If we made this assumption, there would be
some priorities that should be reassessed.

I understand Bruce's position to be arguing for a more substantial change,
which is that we rewrite the priorities section so that it is P1 for a user
to be able to to create accessible content if they are extremely
knowledgeable and motivated, P2 if they are are somewhat knowledgeable, and
P3 that the content is acessible even if the author doesnt try at all.

I suspect thta I have oversimplified somewhat. Could Phill and Bruce plese
clarify these positions for me (well, for the issues list really).
