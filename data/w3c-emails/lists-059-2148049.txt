I agree that they should do both, but I think in actual fact the real
requirement is in the User Interface. Which is why I am now strongly in
favour of changing the wording.

  No, not at all.  I want them to do both!
  
  Not all plumbing as a UI.  And not all UI requires additional plumbing.  So
  by "not limiting" the requirement to UI, or in other words, not inserting
  the phrase "user interface:, it implies both the UI and the plumbing are
  required.
