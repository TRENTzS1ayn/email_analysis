Cc: Authoring Tools Guidelines List<w3c-wai-au@w3.org>

aloha, phil!

i agree that you and i and probably most -- if not all -- of the WG agrees that
the current wording of 5.1 covers both the plumbing and the UI itself, but
clarity on this point, i feel, would strengthen the checkpoint, and reduce the
potential for mis-interpretation...

if the WG doesn't feel that it is necessary to clarify the checkpoint, however,
i do believe that we should at least add some verbiage to the introductory text
to GL5 to make it as clear as possible that both the UI and the underlying
plumbing are being addressed in this GL...

just my 2 cents,
        gregory.
