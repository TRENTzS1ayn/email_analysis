Hi everyone, retro-regrets -- this morning I got a CERT security
advisory about a root exploit for Solaris, and while I was proofing
my machines against that, I found out that one of them had been
hacked in that very way -- yesterday!

So today has been spent on backups, patch downloads, and OS
reinstalls; which unfortunately left no time for the meeting. :(
