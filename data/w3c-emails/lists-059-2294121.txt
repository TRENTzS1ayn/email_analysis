Gregory,
I agree table markup items should be higher priority in WCAG.  But I am not
sure what that has to do with the DOM.  Implementing and exposing the DOM
will allow assistive technologies to access table markup information
provided by the author.  If the author didn't include information on table
markup, the DOM cannot magically provide it to an assistive technology or
for that matter a graphical rendering in a GUI environment.  

I am therefore not sure what you mean by "pushing it off on to the DOM"?

Jon
