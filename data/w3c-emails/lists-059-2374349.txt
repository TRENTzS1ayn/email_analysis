JG: The working group tried for over a year to deal with the table issue,
including linearization techniques and complex visual transations.  I main
problems we kept coming back up is:

1. Assistive technologies use different techniques to access visual
renderings of information

2. Visual renderings were incomplete representations of the information the
author provided in the source document, so AT using visual rendering would
always be missing information

3. Visual renderings do not carry any information about the relationships
between cells rendered in a table or in many cases the boundaries in cells.
 ATs maybe able to guess these boundaries, but it seems like a waste of
effort if they could use the information in the DOM.

4. The idea of point-of-regaurd and focus were different for visual and
auditory renderings.  Things that make sense in one medium, did not make
sense in another.

5. Specialized navigation mechanisms (with I assume some type of point
point of reguard indicator moving with the navigation) that don't make
sense in one rendering medium, would complicate an already problematic
keyboard access issues.  It would also potentially delay implementation by
mainstream browser developers as they try to figure our how they fit into
their existing technologies.

6. It was felt that emphesis should be placed in the guidelines on what
will work in the long term.  If the guidelines talk about alot of
techniques that don't make sense for visual rendering, some companies may
evenntually implement them, but they won't happen for a long time.  This
would drain resources from long term solutions and give the impression to
AT developers that they do not have to address their technology.

JG: The DOM provided the only mechanism that the group could find consensus
on that accurately represented the document.  The group decided that access
to the DOM and implementation of the DOM was the path that would lead to
improved access by assistive technology in the shortest time and with the
best results for consumers.  Some companies like Henter-Joyce are already
using this model, and others are not.  It is the groups responsibility to
work with AT developers and to help them understand how to use the DOM.  It
is also important to work with mainstram browser developers to fully
implement the DOM and develop and document high speed access to the DOM.
This will be an issue during the candidate recommendation stage of the
document.

JG: We have tried to do this in the past and the group could not find
checkpoints or techniqes that the group could come to consensus to be
technically sound as long term solutions.  It always came back to the DOM
as the only medium that seemed to make sense.
