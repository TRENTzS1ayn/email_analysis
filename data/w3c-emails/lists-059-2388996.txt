Hello,

I have published the 18 December version of the ATAG Guidelines [1]
and Techniques Document [2]. In addition to changes made
by Charles (which I will let him document), I made the following
changes:

1) Incorporated changes from 15 Dec atag teleconf
   http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/telecon-15dec99

2) Incorporated editorial changes from Ian's propsals of 12 December
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/1999OctDec/0295.html

3) Deleted the term "impairment" and replaced with "disability"
   (one occurrence). Based on 14 December CG decision to not use
"impairment"
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-wai-cg/1999OctDec/0053.html

4) Deleted the term "alt-text" and replace with "text-equivalent"
   (notably in the section on A-prompt).

5) Changed "fulfill a checkpoint" to "satisfy a checkpoint"
   (for unity with other guidelines).

6) Added the following links:
   a) Techniques now back link to the Guidelines (via the checkpoint
number)
      Linking is to the latest version of the guidelines.
   b) Samples (e.g., Amaya) now back link to the Techniques (via
      the checkpoint number)

7) I made some changes to the document processing machinery to
   align ATAG and UAAG (and ultimately WCAG). Readers should notice
   absolutely no different. But if you remark anything strange, 
   please let the editors know.

Thank you,

 - Ian
