 Due to network problems Charles was experiencing, a number of edits did not
 make it into the draft. As a result the draft to sign off on will be posted

the list never received confirmation that the corrected draft had been

        http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/PR-WAI-AUTOOLS-19991218/
the current draft?  is it the draft that will form the basis of our discussion
later today?  there isn't an agenda posted to confirm whether or not this is
the corrected draft...
