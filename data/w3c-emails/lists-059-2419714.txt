The draft has not been successfully mounted to W3C space. It will be
announced as soon as I get it there. In fact I believe there are only minor
editorial differences (cleaning up the use of user / author and so on, and
shifting the sentence about existing tools that do some things around)

So people sould sign off on the current draat if they are not concerned
about
editorial stuff (for the record, I am signing off on it) or "watch this
space" otherwise.

In the absence o any comments, there seems to be little point in holding a
teleconference this afternoon.

  the list never received confirmation that the corrected draft had been
  successfully mounted in W3C space...  is the draft which is located at:
          http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/PR-WAI-AUTOOLS-19991218/
  the current draft?  is it the draft that will form the basis of our discussion
  later today?  there isn't an agenda posted to confirm whether or not this is
  the corrected draft...
