aloha, charles!

thanks for your expeditious reply...

i do have one question on the 18 december draft...  the text for Checkpoint 4.1
reads:

quote
   4.1 Check for and inform the author of accessibility problems.
          [Relative Priority]
          Note: Accessibility problems should be detected automatically
          where possible. Where this is not possible, the tool may need
          to prompt the user to make decisions, or to manually check for
          certain types of problem.
unquote

i still fail to "see" why we switched from "alert" to "inform" -- we have a
very strong definition of alert in the techniques document, which, if ported to
ATAG itself, would have removed any potential confusion that we were directing
developers to use a platform specific mechanism which also happens to be called
an alert...

so, i propose keeping the word alert in checkpoint 4.1, porting the techniques
document's definition of the term alert to ATAG, and hyperlinking the word
alert to the expanded definition...

and, while i realize that, if we are to reconsider the ramifications of every
noun, adverb, adjective, and verb used in the document to ensure that none of
them conflict with their use in a platform-specific setting, that ATAG will
never be finalized, i do believe that this particular checkpoint needs to
convey the full gamut of functionalities captured in the Techniques document's
definition of accessibility...
