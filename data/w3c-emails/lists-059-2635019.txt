Could everyone in the group sign off on the present document by Monday,
January 3rd, 2000 at 4pm Eastern Time. This should be done by sending a
message to the list saying that you sign off. As Charles stated there may
be very minor editorial changes occuring to the document between then and
now, these will not be changes that affect the document content or
intention.

Thanks

Jutta

and have a happy new year!
