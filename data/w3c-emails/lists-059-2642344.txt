Happy New Year everyone, from Oz, where it is now 1900. (I think)

And yes, it would be nice to get explicit sign-offs. I know some people are
going to in the next few days, but if you hadn't thought about it please get
your fingers on the keyboards...

Cheers

  Could everyone in the group sign off on the present document by Monday,
  January 3rd, 2000 at 4pm Eastern Time. This should be done by sending a
  message to the list saying that you sign off. As Charles stated there may
  be very minor editorial changes occuring to the document between then and
  now, these will not be changes that affect the document content or
  intention.
  
  Thanks
  
  Jutta
  
  and have a happy new year!
