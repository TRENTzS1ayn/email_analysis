Our charter runs out in April so we need to re-charter. At the 
face-to-face meeting it was proposed that we re-charter for one year. 
The deliverables would be a completed techniques document, a 
conformance evaluation process with conformance evaluations, and an 
assessment of whether we need to create a new revision of the 
guidelines document.

How do people feel about this proposal?
