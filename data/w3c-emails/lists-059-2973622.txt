aloha, y'all!

due to vastly changed circumstances since the day slash time change was 
first raised, i am now (and shall continue to be) available for telecons on 
tuesdays at 2:30pm

it is, however, too bad that we couldn't get a thursday time, as that would 
have stacked the WAI guidelines calls (UA and GL) into a single day

oh, well -- such is life...

anyway, i'm confirming that tuesdays at 2:30pm U.S. EDT is fine with me,
         gregory.
