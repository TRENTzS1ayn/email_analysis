I would have to change a longstanding weekly meeting in order to do 11:30
Tuesday Seattle time. Thursdays are better.

The ongoing saga...

The reason why Tuesdays were no good is because Gregory couldn't do them,
and
then because there was a conflict with the WAI Coordination Group.

Gregory, as I understand it, can apparently do Tuesdays now (Gregory, can
you
please confirm) and the WAI-CG meets at 4pm.

We could get a bridge on Tuesdays at 2:30 pm for 90 minutes and have it
regularly and reliably.

We cannot get a W3C bridge on Thursdays during the US day.

If Tuesday at 2pm is OK for people (I think Phill said it was the best for
him, so I hope that means the phone problems we have had don't happen on
Tuesdays *grin*)  then it would be easiest to do it then. Otherwise I will
look into options for getting an external bridge.

Please reply if you cannot make meetings at 2:30 pm Boston time (8:30 pm for
Marjolein - sorry, 11:30 on the US West Coast, 4:30 am on the Australian
East
Coast, and adjust as necessary your time zone)

cheers

Charles
