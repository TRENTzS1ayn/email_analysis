Hello, friends in the Web Accessibility Initiative!

Because I have recently accepted a new, full-time salaried position
with a company called Edapta, I am going to have to resign my
positions as a representative of the HTML Writers Guild in the
following WAI working groups:

1.  Authoring Tools Accessibility Working Group
2.  Protocols and Formats Working Group

The reason for this resignation is simple -- as I'll be working for
a company involved directly in web accessibility, it doesn't make
sense for the HTML Writers Guild to be subsidizing my involvement
in these working groups.  Instead, I've suggested to Edapta management
that it should be part of my job to do so on behalf of Edapta.  This
resolves the conflict of interest -- I can't represent both the
interests of the Guild and of Edapta at the same time, well, not with
a straight face.

This doesn't mean you'll be rid of me -- in fact, likely WAI
participants will see more of me than ever.  However, it does mean
that when you speak to me, you won't be speaking to Kynn Bartlett,
HWG Guy, you'll be speaking to Kynn Bartlett, Edapta Guy.  I'll
still be the same guy underneath, but just wearing a different
hat.
