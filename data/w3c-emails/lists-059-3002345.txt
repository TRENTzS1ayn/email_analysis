aloha, kynn!

as long as you remain actively involved in WAI work, i, for one, don't care 
whose hat you wear!

i guess the question for the HTML Writers' Guild (HWG) now becomes, will it 
continue to actively participate in the WAI?

i firmly believe that if the WAI's aims are to be achieved, it is 
imperative that HWG continue to actively participate in (at least) the 
Authoring Tool and Web Content Guidelines working groups...  as creators of 
web content, and the users of a wide range of authoring tools, the 
individuals that collectively comprise HWG are one of the main target 
audiences for the WAI suite of guidelines, and it is in the WAI's best 
interest to ensure that the Guild's membership is kept abreast of the work 
currently being performed by the AU and GL working groups, as it has been 
during Kynn's tenure...

likewise, the WAI would continue to benefit from the active participation 
of the largest organization of web professionals and hobbyists, 
particularly in the evaluation of content creation tools against ATAG, for 
the HWG's members' experience with this class of tool is both wide and 
deep, and collaboration with a disabled evaluator would be an eye-opening 
experience for all involved...  the revision of WCAG would also benefit 
from direct HWG participation -- not least in the contribution of 
techniques that have been used in "real-life" situations in order to ensure 
accessibility -- and, perhaps, even an example of accessible design in 
action...

i'd also like to see other web content creation organizations involved in 
the WAI process, but that's a subject for another emessage...
