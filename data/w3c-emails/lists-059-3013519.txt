Dear folks,

following the discussion on conformance reviews over the last couple of
weeks, I have started to compile a list of tools for which developers have
committed to give feedback on evaluations.

I would suggest that for the following tools, if you have done an evaluatrion
you contact Jutta or me and we will give you addresses of people to forward
them to for comment before you make them public. This provides a chance to
clear up any errors, but should not be a way of delaying publication. Please,
as always, remember that these are busy people, so allow them a few days to
respond, and be courteous in your dealings. Although individuals do not
represent the group or WAI, the impressions given are still important.

Tools for which we have commitment to review evaluations:
FrontPage
Publisher
Amaya

Tools for which we have firm contacts (without firm commitement as yet):
HotDog
HomeSite
ColdFusion Studio
asWedit
Mozilla editor/composer

In addition I hope that we can bring up many more. There are a number of
developer companies where we may have contacts in the company but not on the
development team - it never hurts to ask. I will be compiling a list of
contacts (which I will not publish) and marking on the tools and reviews
pages those tools for which we have contacts or review commitments. If you
have further information, please feel free to send it to me or Jutta

cheers

Charles McCN
