Hello,

The information for the WAI Evaluation and Repair Tools face2face meeting 
May 11 and 12 in Amsterdam is available at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/2000/05/agenda

Authoring Tool WG members have been invited to attend (at least) on Friday 
(12 May).

This includes a rough agenda that does not yet reflect AU 
involvement.  Thoughts for agenda items?  One topic for Friday ought to be 
coordination issues between ER and AU but I'm not sure what questions we 
want to address.

Registration is open until 8 May.
