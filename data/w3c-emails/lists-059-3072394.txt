Although I did no more than a quick scan of the text yet, I have two comments:

1. I have some trouble deciding which image goes where (images show up as attachments, the text doesn't - so maybe that is the problem)

2. In - 4. Types of Prompting, Prompts - 

you state:

[HomeSite example] "Although the dialog itself is in some sense intrusive, the inclusion of the Alt. Text field, once the dialog is displayed, would not be considered intrusive."
But I don't see how the tag editing dialogs can ever be "intrusive": the user has many ways to enter or edit each tag (including just typing the code), and a tag editing dialog is only ever displayed at the user's specific request.

Possibly more later, when I've read more.

Cheers,

>A user configurable schedule allows individual authors to determine, to some extent, how and when they will be prompted about accessibility issues.  For example, authors should have control stringence of the checks (i.e. WCAG level A, AA or AAA) and the scheduling of explicit prompts (i.e. as problems occur or at the completion of authoring). Of course, the extent of this configurability should be determined by developers on and individual basis. Some tool developers may decide to restrict authors to several global settings while others might allow authors to make fine grained distinctions, such as different scheduling for different types of problems.

>Authoring tool support for the creation of accessible Web content should account for different authoring styles. Authors who can configure the tool's accessibility features to support their regular work patterns are more likely to accept accessible authoring practices (refer to <http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-ATAG10-20000203/#gl-integrate-naturally>guideline 5). For example, some authors may prefer to be alerted to accessibility problems when they occur, whereas others may prefer to perform a check at the end of an editing session. This is analogous to programming environments that allow users to decide whether to check for correct code during editing or at compilation.

>Most authoring tools will have ways of conveying information to users and collecting information in return.  These methods vary according to factors such as the design of the tool and the user interface conventions for its platform. The following is relatively generic overview of how these methods can be used for accessibility prompting.

>Prompts are basically requests for information. On most GUI platforms prompts take the form of dialog boxes that request information from the user.  Prompts can be used to encourage authors to provide information needed to make the content accessible (such as alternative text equivalents). For example, a text equivalent entry field prominently displayed in an image insertion dialog would constitute a prompt. Prompts are relatively unintrusive and address a problem before it arises. However, once the author has ignored the prompt, its message is unavailable. In the example below, Allaire Homesite prompts the user to enter Alt. Text by including this property within dialog that is displayed during image insertion. Although the dialog itself is in some sense intrusive, the inclusion of the Alt. Text field, once the dialog is displayed, would not be considered intrusive.

The way authors are alerted, prompted, or warned can influence their view of the tool and even their opinion of accessible authoring. Refer also to <http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-ATAG10-20000203/#gl-integrate-naturally>guideline 5.

>Intrusive alerts are informative messages that interrupt the editing process for the author. For example, intrusive alerts are often presented when an author's action could cause a loss of data. Intrusive alerts allow problems to be brought to the author's attention immediately. However, authors may resent the constant delays and forced actions. Many people prefer to finish expressing an idea before returning to edit its format. The following screenshot shows an example of an intrusive alert that might be displayed if the author fails to enter Alt-text at an image insetion prompt.

>Unintrusive alerts are alerts such as icons, underlines, and gentle sounds that can be presented to the author without necessitating immediate action. For example, in some word processors misspelled text is highlighted without forcing the author to make immediate corrections. These alerts allow authors to continue editing with the knowledge that problems will be easy to identify at a later time. However, authors may choose to ignore the alerts altogether.
