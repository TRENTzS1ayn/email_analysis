Thanks for the quick reply.

There is not much I can do about your first point.  I just attached all
six files and that's how it came out.

In response to your second point, you are right probably right.  The
process of looking at a dialog is more of a hassle than dragging and
dropping but "intrusive" may be the wrong word.

Cheers,
Jan
