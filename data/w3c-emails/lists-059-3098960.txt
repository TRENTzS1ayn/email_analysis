Maybe a function of the email client you use? Some setting you may change? I have specifically set my mail client to *not* render HTML and yet this happens (and before with mail from you) but I've been sent email with HTML attachments from others where it does not happen.

Which is more of a hassle is entirely up to the user: if you need more than the basic attributes, the dialog may actually be *less* of a hassle because everything is available in the single dialog while with a dragged image (producing the tag) you may have to add the  other attributes afterwards. You never get the dialog unless you ask for it.
