I don't know about the others but that would certainly help me. I assume the images are actually included as IMG tags in the HTML document? If so, a ZIP could be unpacked in a temp directory and then the HTML could be viewed as a separate document.

If that would make thing more difficult for others, I'll keep guessing though.

Comments, anyone?
