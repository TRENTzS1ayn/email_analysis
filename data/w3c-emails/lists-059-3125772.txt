Dear all,

note that we have to have a draft to IG by the middle of April. I will be
aiming to produce it for the meeting on 19 April so we can check it and send
it off to them, meaing they get a bit more than the absolute minimum one week
review before we wind up their comments on 4 May and publish more or less
immediately.

This means that anything that has not gone to the list by Sunday 16 April
(about 10 days away) will not get into the draft, nor the Public draft. 

For people new to the group, a public draft is one which is listed on the
W3C Technical reports page - http://www.w3.org/TR/ - and we are obliged to
produce one at least every three months as part of W3C process rules.

Cheers

Charles McCN
