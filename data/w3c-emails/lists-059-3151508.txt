Hi folks. The minutes are posted, linked from the home page, or directly at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/meetings/6apr00 (yes, the date thing again. But
trying to read meaning into a URI is a mistake - it is set up for the
convenience of the person who wrote the page, not the user).

I have also updated the home page with details of meetings and preliminary
agendas for the next few weeks.

Please note that we will be changing times to Tuesday 2:30 pm Boston time
(currently US Eastern Daylight Time - Z-0400) beginning with the meeting on
Tuesday 25th April.

Charles McCN
