Hello all,

Here is the next draft of my prompting techniques piece. It is a zip
file containing a web page and gifs. Extract it into a folder before
viewing.

So far I have only had detailed comments from Marjolein.  Do the Allaire
and Microsoft people have a problem with screen shots of their products
being used in this way?

Cheers,
Jan
