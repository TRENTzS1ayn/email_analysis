This is a reminder that we will have a short one hour phone meeting 
tomorrow Wednesday the 19th from 4pm to 5pm Boston time. The phone 
number is +1-(617)-252-7000. The agenda is at:

http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/meetings/19apr00.html

Hopefully we will have closure on all action items by the meeting so 
we can proceed in preparing the techniques draft, (hint, hint).

Talk to you then.

Jutta
