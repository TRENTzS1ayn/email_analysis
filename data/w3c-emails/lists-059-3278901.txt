     Hi. I'm Frederick Barnett, and I'm the replacement for Kynn Bartlett here 
for the HTML Writers Guild. While I realize this is not the best way to make a 
first impression, I'm afraid I have to ABEND what would've been my first 
meeting. I will not be home all day Wednesday. I will definitely be there for 
the next meeting. My apologies for missing this one.
