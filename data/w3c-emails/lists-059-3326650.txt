I think in this case, where the screen shots are illustrating how a user
interface works, it is still important to describe what is going
on. If members of this working group can't find out what is happening in our
document we have a serious problem functioning, let alone producing something
useful.

  I'm not volunteering to describe them, just noting that we came upon this
  same issue in some on-line education where screen shots are used to "teach"
  someone how to use a software application.  I decided that if the screen
  shot is only to teach someone sighted how to do something with a visual
  graphical user interface, then the screen shots do NOT need any long
  descriptions, for example: how to drag and drop an icon.  HOWEVER, if an
  alternative accessible "view" is available, for example a text structure
  view of menus, and or a keyboard command way to drag and drop, then that
  description would need to be considered in the design of the course
  materials.
