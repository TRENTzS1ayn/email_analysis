There are a handful of problems that I need to solve which I know about:
  numbering of sections in the appendix
  some WCAG checkpoint references say WCAG but not all of them yet
  there is some cleaning up I would like to do in my templates

I will be generating the final draft for interest group review (with these
things fixed) on Friday, but thought it would be handy for people to be able
to see this first. Note that there are a number of images that are not
properly described. If anyone can provide descriptions for them I would be
very grateful.
