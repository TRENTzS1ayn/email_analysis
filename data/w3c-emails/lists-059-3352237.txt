Since the Amaya sample sections in the document are not really sample 
implementations (they are comments on how well Amaya implements the 
guidelines), can we either replace them with actual sample 
implementations or delete them from the techniques document and move 
them to the compliance site for this draft. Having them there as they 
are now is misleading regarding our intentions for the sample 
sections.
