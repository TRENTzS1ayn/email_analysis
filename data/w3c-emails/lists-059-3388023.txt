Word2000 Underlining
Screenshot of Word2000 showing underlining alerts. The normal menus,
toolbars, sliders, etc. appear along with a short document, reading:
"This sentence has a grammar problems. This sentence has a misspelled
woord." The underling alerts appear under "a grammar problems" in green
(grammar error) and under "woord" in red (spelling error). The lines
themselves are tightly zig-zagged. The user has just right-clicked on
"woord", bringing up a pop-up menu with its upper-left corner just below
"woord". The menu provides suggestions "word, wood, and wooed", Ignore
All, Add, AutoCorrect (submenu), Language (submenu) and Spelling (to
launch a full check). The rest of the interface remains unchanged.

Frontpage 2000 Highlighting
Screenshot of Frontpage2000 showing font colour highlighting alerts. The
normal menus, toolbars, sliders, etc. appear. The HTML document being
edited can be viewed in three ways using tabs near the bottom (normal,
HTML, preview).  In this case the HTML view is selected so the raw HTML
code is displayed.  However, the user has left the end bracket off the
<head> tag. This syntax error causes all later tags to be displayed in
red font (to show the error). The <html> tag is shown in blue font
because it appears before the syntax error.
