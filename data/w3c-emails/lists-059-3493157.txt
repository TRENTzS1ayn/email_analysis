Dear WAI Interest Group,

There is a new draft of the Techniques for Authoring Tool Accessibility
available which the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines Working Group
would like the Interest Group to review, prior to publication as a public
Working Draft.

The new draft is available at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WD-ATAG10-TECHS-20000421

Comments should be sent to the Working Group mailing list -
mailto:w3c-wai-au@w3.org - by Sunday 30 April. The Mailing list archives are
publicly available at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/

Please note that the techniques specified in the draft are not requirements,
but are examples of how developers might meet the requirements which are
specified by the checkpoints in the Guidelines document (reproduced in the
Techniques document for covenience). The Working group welcomes public
comment, including suggested further techniques, at any time.

The working group is also looking for information on existing tools which
implement the checkpoints, either using the Techniques described or other
techniques.

We look forward to your comments

Charles McCathieNevile (staff contact), for Jutta Treviranus (chair).
