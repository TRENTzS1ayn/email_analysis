We justify because it is an absolute (priority 1) requirement for access that
alternative content is available when multimedia objects cannot be rendered,
whereas it is a lower priority requirement that spelling be corrected. I
think we should make it clear (as I said in the teleconference - minutes to
come as soon as my computer is working again, hopefully in the late morning)
what the level of requirement is - prompt the author to provide alternative
content means that at some point before publicatin or saving a document,
where there are objects without alternatives, the author is prompted at least
once to provide alternative content. For example, at save time, a warning may
say "No alternative content has been specified for N objects. Add content or
proceeed anyway?". Another example is that each time an object is added the
author gets prompted for content. OR when a file is opened and is missing
things the author is prompted - "no alternative content for objects X, Y and
Z, please add it - click OK to continue"...

  If Word never prompts the author to correcting misspelled word, how can we
  justify prompting the user to include alternative textual information for an
  image and still adhere to guideline 5?

  I agree with Charles. I think that a prompt requires author response.
