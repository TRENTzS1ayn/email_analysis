Reminder that our meeting time changes this week - the meeting is on the
usual number (+1.617.252.7000) but is at 2:30 pm Boston time, 11:30 PDT,
1830Z, 8:30 pm netherlands, 4:30 am Melbourne, and whatever is appropriate
for other places.

I have had a few hassles with my computer, but hopefully will have minutes of
the last meeting available just before this one. Main agenda item is to talk
about what we mean by prompting (unless anyone has any comments on the
draft).
