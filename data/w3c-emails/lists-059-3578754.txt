Marjolein,

this seems pretty clear (at least to me). The difference between your
understanding of prompt, and my understanding of the way it is defined and
used in the guidelines, is that where a checkpoint requires prompting, it is
required that there is a response, and that a prompt doesn't necessarily get
any data from the user.

Note that the relevant checkpoint (3.1) says to prompt the author to provide
alternative content, not when, how often, or whether it has to be done all
the time for each piece of content that may have an alternative specified, or
can be done once in a prompt that covers everything (but requires some
response) and is more like what you are describing as an alert with a
required response.

  So I'll attempt to write down my definition of these terms here:
