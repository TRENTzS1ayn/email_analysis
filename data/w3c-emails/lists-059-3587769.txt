Not quite - since an alert (in my definition) gives information *to* the user but doesn't get information *from* the user.

The way I understand the checkpoint (or its purpose), it would be more like a dialog, containing a prompt; where the dialog requires a response (OK or Cancel) but the prompt on that dialog doesn't necessarily require information (data to be filled in).
