I agree.

I tend to agree with Phil, although I think the whole "pop-up in your
face" discussion may have been too black and white.  For instance, a
developer could get around the problem of explicit prompting by adding a
short alert (icon and explanatory text) to a pre-existing save or
publish dialog.  In this scenario, the author is already being
interrupted with a request for information ("enter file name", "confirm
write over", confirm publish to web", etc.) and an accessibility warning
could be added without necessitating extra mouse clicks. 

> 2. Should the author be able to turn off all prompts in a single step?

Not for a universal (all future pages) setting.

Cheers,
Jan
