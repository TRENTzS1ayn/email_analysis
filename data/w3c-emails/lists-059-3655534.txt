     Agreed.

     Agreed.

     I prefer the second definition, allowing the prompt to be ignored if 
someone is just laying out a rough outline, or in the case of a word processor, 
not even intending to publish on the web.

     Yes. I think one button or menu choice that says "Accessibility features 
on" or something like that is more likely to be used than something that 
requires checking several boxes to turn off, and on.

     I'll have to get back to you on that one.
