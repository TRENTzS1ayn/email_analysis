  I tend to agree with Phil, although I think the whole "pop-up in your
  face" discussion may have been too black and white.  For instance, a
  developer could get around the problem of explicit prompting by adding a
  short alert (icon and explanatory text) to a pre-existing save or
  publish dialog.  In this scenario, the author is already being
  interrupted with a request for information ("enter file name", "confirm
  write over", confirm publish to web", etc.) and an accessibility warning
  could be added without necessitating extra mouse clicks.

I had a look back over the minutes and drafts for August/september last
year. It seems we had agreed that a prompt could be part of another
prompt. We also agreed that the wording of the checkpoint would be prompt,
not alert/inform (as per 4.1) and that a prompt required some kind of
response.

  Not for a universal (all future pages) setting.
