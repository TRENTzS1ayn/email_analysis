HS:: "Any tools that followed this suggestion would not be single-A
compliance "out-of-the-box", unless the accessibility option was set to
force prompts."

WL: I believe that this misunderstanding is at the root of a problem we
are experiencing. The configurability *INCLUDING THE DEFAULT SETTINGS OF
THE VARIOUS ACCESSIBILITY FEATURES* does not affect the conformance
level of the tool. That is my understanding. 

If the tool makes all the important features an integral part of the
regular look/feel, (even though these features may be set to "off" by
the user) it can be triple-A conformant - even if it is "shipped" in a
default mode that some insensitive sales/marketing department has
decided is the "best practice" for their customers.

Even though many will have the opinion that: people don't want
"in-your-face" warnings when they're creating Web materials; surveys
show that these features aren't important to most purchasers - the
market for accessible (for which read "usable") sites and especially
tools that are easily able to create such sites is much larger than
expected.
