I'm not sure I agree, Heather. On April 19th, CMN wrote the following:
"I would prefer us to use the more common definition of prompt, that it
requires author response, with the proviso that a prompt can have
multiple
parts, for example the different pieces of stuff required for an image,
or
can cover a multitude of things, for example "there are accesibility
errors
in this document - save anyway?""

This example would inform the user without requiring anything more than
pressing Cancel to proceed. I think that a warning in the Save dialog
(i.e. my example bitmap) might accomplish the same thing as CMN's
example because the user has the choice of whether to press Save or
Cancel on the basis of this new information.
