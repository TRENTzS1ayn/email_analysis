Proposed revised definition:

Prompt, as used in these guidelines, means something which requires
author response (for example a warning box which must be dismissed, an
interactive dialoigue or wizard). 

Note 1: A required prompt (as in checkpoint 3.1) may be included as
part of a larger dialogue or wizard process. In that case it must be
clear that it is an important field, but need not be 'required' (i.e.
it is not necessary that the user enter content or select null content
to continue the authoring process)

In addition I propose an erratum for 3.1:

add
Note: Prompting may be done at any time in the authoring process. For
example it may occur once for each missing alternative, or as a single
prompt at publish or close or save reminding the author that there are
object(s) that require alternative content to be added.
