Hello,

I have published the 4 May draft of the AU Techniques
document as a Note [1]. Here's the status section:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
   This document is a W3C Note, published as an informative 
   appendix to "Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 1.0". 
   This document updates the previous version of this Note 
   but does not represent consensus within the WAI Authoring 
   Tools Guidelines (AUWG) Working Group, nor within W3C. This
   document is likely to change and should not be cited as 
   reference material or anything other than "work in progress".
   The WAI Interest Group was invited to review the material 
   that led to this version of the document. The Working Group
   expects to update this document in response to queries
   raised by implementors of the Guidelines, for example,
   to cover new technologies. Suggestions for additional
   techniques are welcome.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

I don't have a list of changes available, so I will let 
Charles provide that list.

 - Ian
