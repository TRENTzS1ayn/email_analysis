     With the inclusion of the note above, I think this is a workable solution, 
at least in regards to programs that do more than web authoring, like Word, 
Wordperfect, Excel, etc.
     As the new guy here, I was wondering something. Was it ever discussed in 
the group about using different guidelines based on what type of program was 
being used? For instance, I would feel that a dedicated web authoring tool 
(HTML or XML editor) should have stronger accessibility features than a 
"general purpose" word processor et al that merely has a "save as HTML" 
feature. Any one who is serious about the web sites the create or maintain will 
almost certainly be using a dedicated web design program rather than a GP 
program. And those are the people most likely to use accessibility options if 
presented them in an alert or prompt that would come up when a image or 
whatever is used. Someone using a GP program isn't going to want to have to 
deal with such interruption when when typing a letter or such with pictures in 
it. For them, a prompt when saving as HTML, or the blue squiggly line we keep 
talking about, would suffice I feel.
     If this was discussed before, and rejected, I was wondering, why?
