Could group members please send your thoughts to the list regarding 
the proposed merger of the ERT and AU working groups. Just to 
clarify, the deliverables would remain the same, an AU Techniques 
Document, an ERT Techniques Document, etc.
This would happen after the re-chartering of the two groups.

Thanks Jutta
