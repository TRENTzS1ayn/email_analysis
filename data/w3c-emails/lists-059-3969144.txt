On stardate 9 May 2000, Jutta Treviranus sent a subspace communication stating:

> Could group members please send your thoughts to the list regarding 
> the proposed merger of the ERT and AU working groups. Just to 
> clarify, the deliverables would remain the same, an AU Techniques 
> Document, an ERT Techniques Document, etc.
> This would happen after the re-chartering of the two groups.

     I have no objection to this.
