Subject: Thoughts on ERT and AU

Could group members please send your thoughts to the list regarding
the proposed merger of the ERT and AU working groups. Just to
clarify, the deliverables would remain the same, an AU Techniques
Document, an ERT Techniques Document, etc.
This would happen after the re-chartering of the two groups.

Thanks Jutta
