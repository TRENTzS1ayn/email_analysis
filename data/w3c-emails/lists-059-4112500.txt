In general, I do not think that the conformance of a tool should not be
conditional upon the default settings of the accessibility options.

However, I believe that in the context of our guidelines and our goal of
reducing the production of inaccessible pages on the Web,
configurability should refer to the scheduling and intrusiveness of the
accessibility features rather than an ability to turn the whole system
on or off.

I agree with Phill that we should not be talking about turning all the
accessibility features off.  If accessibility features are disabled by
default or may be completely disabled later on, it is a fairly good bet
that they won't be turned back on.  Therefore, I would argue that some
accessibility indicators should remain, even once the settings have been
set to their lowest level. If these indicators were instructional, but
inobtrusive, and allowed an easy method for enabling more accessibility
features, then the tool should comply.

At minimum, I think authors should be notified at "save" by an alerting
message (such as the one I sent out last week) that they are saving out
an inaccessible page and that the tool they are using has (currently
disabled) features to help them prevent that.
