     If the default is set to "no prompting" then no, I don't think it meets 
the guidelines. I believe accessibility features should be "on" by default, and 
that the user should turn them off, or "down" as it were.  Regardless of what 
we decide "prompt" means later on, accessibility features should always be 
enabled by default if switchable.
