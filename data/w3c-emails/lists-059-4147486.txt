In a tool like HomeSite, by its very nature, all prompting for anything is always off - prompting never occurs unless the user actually requests a prompt. After all, the core is a text editor - any user can choose to just type text. Accessibilty checking would just be one of the tools made available, just like dropdown lists, inspectors and dialogs are now tools made available to the user - but none of the avaiable tools can ever be "forced" on the user. 

There are now some options for automatic alerts though (spell check and syntax check) - a similar option might be used for accessibility. Again, by the very nature of the product, even if the alerting is on (it can be turned off) it's still up to the user to ignore, repair manually (just type) or trigger a prompt.

A prompt at saving is also out of the question: depending on the work method some documents will have to be saved literally hundreds of times while being worked on, before it's finalized. Also we should take into account that frequently the document being created or edited is not itself HTML but (a combination with) server-side code which will ultimately _generate_ the HTML to be sent to the browser; accessibility does not apply to server-side code, so even (forced) prompting at deployment time (as opposed to saving) is not an option in many cases: the server-side code is what will be deployed but only the resulting HTML (i.e., after deployment) can be checked.

==> I'll maintain that an authoring tool is compliant if it _provides_ the user with the necessary tools for alerting and prompting for accessibility. Whether those tools need to be or even can be switched on by default depends completely on the nature of the tool and its intended users (and languages supported!).
