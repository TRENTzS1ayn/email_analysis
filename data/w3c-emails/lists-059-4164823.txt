I agree that a tool can be compliant if it ships with the default of all
things accessibility-related turned off - provided that they are clear and
obvious, as required by the P2 checkpoints in Guideline 5, (and the other
stuff like GL6 is done). If I were doing a conformance review I would make it
explicit that it conforms when in mode XYZ, but I don't see that as
contradicting the statement that this tool conforms.

  In a tool like HomeSite, by its very nature, all prompting for anything
  is always off - prompting never occurs unless the user actually requests
  a prompt. After all, the core is a text editor - any user can choose to
  just type text. Accessibilty checking would just be one of the tools made
  available, just like dropdown lists, inspectors and dialogs are now tools
  made available to the user - but none of the avaiable tools can ever be
  "forced" on the user.
  
  There are now some options for automatic alerts though (spell check and
  syntax check) - a similar option might be used for accessibility. Again,
  by the very nature of the product, even if the alerting is on (it can be
  turned off) it's still up to the user to ignore, repair manually (just
  type) or trigger a prompt.
  
  A prompt at saving is also out of the question: depending on the work
  method some documents will have to be saved literally hundreds of times
  while being worked on, before it's finalized. Also we should take into
  account that frequently the document being created or edited is not
  itself HTML but (a combination with) server-side code which will
  ultimately _generate_ the HTML to be sent to the browser; accessibility
  does not apply to server-side code, so even (forced) prompting at
  deployment time (as opposed to saving) is not an option in many cases:
  the server-side code is what will be deployed but only the resulting HTML
  (i.e., after deployment) can be checked.
  
  ==> I'll maintain that an authoring tool is compliant if it _provides_
  the user with the necessary tools for alerting and prompting for
  accessibility. Whether those tools need to be or even can be switched on
  by default depends completely on the nature of the tool and its intended
  users (and languages supported!).
