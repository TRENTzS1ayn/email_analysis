HomeSite doesn't "require" another app to preview. It does have a builtin, 
totally separate previewer. You can use IE with it in order to get more 
functionality, but you don't have to have it. Also, even with IE HS doesn't 
have to save the document. It can be set to only save a temp file, then preview 
that. Since the temp file isn't the actual document, a prompt for ALT text, 
etc., likely wouldn't come up as we're presently discussing a prompt at saving.
