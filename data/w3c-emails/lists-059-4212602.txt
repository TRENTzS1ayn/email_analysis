You are perfectly correct, of course. Even for viewing in an external browser a save is not strictly necessary.
My point was that some working methods require frequent saves (some other tools than a browser, for instance a links checker, do work only on disk-based files, not on code in memory) - it's not the tool itself that requires it.
