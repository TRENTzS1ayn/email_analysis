Agreed. And my point was that for some tools,it makes no sense to stop work
at each of a hundred saves in a day, while for others, opr for other working
styles (such as a person who wants to get each piece correct as they add it
rather than wait until the end) it does make sense to do that. There is
nothing that requires this technique in absolute terms, although it would be
one way of easily demonstrating that the requirement is met (a different
question from whether the tool is any good for users...)

  You are perfectly correct, of course. Even for viewing in an external browser a save is not strictly necessary.
  My point was that some working methods require frequent saves (some other tools than a browser, for instance a links checker, do work only on disk-based files, not on code in memory) - it's not the tool itself that requires it.
