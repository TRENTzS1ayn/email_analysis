Potential regrets - I may be available, but I may have W3C team commitments
in Amsterdam.

  This is a reminder that we will not have a conference call today. 
  Many group members are in transit or at the WWW9 meetings. Our next 
  meeting will be Tues the 23rd.
  
  Those of you who committed to send proposed rewordings of the 
  definition for prompt to the list, please do it by the end of this 
  week. We will try to resolve the issues related to guideline 3.1 and 
  the definition of prompt on the 23rd.
  
  Thanks Jutta
