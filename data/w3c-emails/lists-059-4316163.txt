Agreed.

Agreed.

That depends on when the "problem is detected." Every time an image is 
inserted into an MS Word document, no. When that document is saved as HTML, 
yes. Note that I'm reading this part to mean a dialog box will pop up each time 
an image is inserted. Something like the blue squiggly line wouldn't be any 
problem, but it would depend on the author to check why it's there. So I don't 
think that fits what you wrote.

I have to go with request on this one.

Again, that depends on what you're writing. I would lean towards no.

I do believe accessibility features should be on be default. Lots of people 
start using a program with out even reading the manual or help file first, an 
so might not even know they're there. Also, I feel on by default helps to show 
how important accessibility is.

Agreed.
