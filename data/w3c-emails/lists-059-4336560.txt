PJ: Since this will become the basis of the actual definition text in the
glossary, allow me to slightly change the last two sentences:

...therefore "prompt" is different than what is encompassed within
guidelines 4, 5, and 6:
     4. Provide ways of checking and correcting inaccessible content.
     5. Integrate accessibility solutions into the overall "look and feel".

     6. Promote accessibility in help and documentation.
"Prompting" is more than checking, correcting, and providing help and
documentation. "Prompting" should be integrated into the overall "look and
feel" of the tool.  "Prompting" does not depend upon the author to seek out
the support.  "Prompting" is initiated by the tool, not requested by the
author.

PJ: If, how, and when the author responds to the "prompt" depends on the
design of the tool and the overall "look and feel" of the prompt.  Using
the phrase "requires" seems to cause interpretations problems when
determining compliance.  Specifying when - as in "during the same authoring
session", specifying "requires a response", and "must be on", are "look and
feel" design considerations that we should not dictate with the
Recommendation. I believe we could and should add information in the
techniques that these things should be considered when integrating
"prompts" into the tool - and that the techniques detailed have considered
these things.

PJ: I agree, but that is what is covered in the text after the Guideline 3
heading.  I do not think we need a proposed re-wording in the guidelines
text nor additional wording in the definition of "prompt" text.
