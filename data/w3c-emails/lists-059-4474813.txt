Here is the proposed definition of prompt. It incorporates what we 
have agreed upon. Please comment and edit:

Prompt:
In this document "prompt" does not refer to the narrow software sense 
of a "prompt," rather it is used as a verb meaning to urge, suggest 
and encourage. The form and timing that this prompting takes can be 
user configurable. "Prompting" does not depend upon the author to 
seek out the support but is initiated by the tool. "Prompting" is 
more than checking, correcting, and providing help and documentation 
as encompassed in guidelines 4, 5, 6. The goal of prompting the 
author is to encourage, urge and support the author in creating 
meaningful equivalent text without causing frustration that may cause 
the author to turn off access options. Prompting should be 
implemented in such a way that it causes a positive disposition and 
awareness on the part of the author toward accessible authoring 
practices.
