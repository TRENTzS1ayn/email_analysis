1. Integrating AERT and ATAG techs - what do we ned to do to each document to
ensure they are compatible?

2. Tracking tools.

Wendy and I took an action item at the face to face meeting to look into
using the rpmfind / rpm2html architecture for doing this. So we had better
have something to say for ourselves...

3. Evaluating tools

The AU group does evaluation of tools, the ERT group has within its charter
responsibility for developing evaluation tools.

One of the things that would be useful is to be able to keep track of what
ERT tools solve what problems in AU (and also in UA..) This would enable
searching for a tool or combination of tools that meet a set of criteria -
for example, tol x, plugin y, and tool z collectively meet the requiremetns
of ATAG double A for the magic operating system...
