At last week's joint teleconference between the AU WG and the ER WG, it was 
suggested that the ER WG's scope should include evaluation of tools.  The 
scope of the ER WG has been evaluation of Web content, although we do keep 
track of tools that perform evaluations, repair, and transformations.  At 
this time, we would not like to expand this scope.

We anticipate continuing the work on test suites (sample pages) to help 
tool developers determine if they have correctly identified accessibility 
issues on a page (i.e. implemented AERT).  However, this is different than 
the request that we heard from AU WG which was to develop a tool (similar 
to the Web Accessibility Report Tool) that would help developers determine 
their conformance to ATAG.

The minutes from our call where we discussed this are available at:
