First, excuse me I don?t speak English very well.

I want to know if is posible generate Internet pages with your tool. I
have read some information about your tool but I do not understand some
important things. Is posible that you give me an example of the creation
of a page?

How I should to do for putting information throught a language, for
example, Power Builder from a database in Internet using your tool?
Is there information in Spanish?

Thank you for your help.
