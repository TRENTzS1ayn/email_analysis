At the last conference call, I was asked to send information to the list on
the Microsoft Windows Logo program, so that we could brainstorm some
processes that would allow products to "officially" gain WAI compliancy.
 
General information, and main site: http://msdn.microsoft.com/winlogo/

            Note the test fee is $950 for a major release.
