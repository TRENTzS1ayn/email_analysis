I have a few concerns about how much of this is a definition: I propose an
edited version as follows:

In this document "prompt" is used to mean urge, suggest, encourage. The form
that this takes can be user configurable, but should not depend on the author
to seek out the support, instead being initiated by the tool.

Prompting is more than checking, automatically correcting, or making help
and documentation available, as provided for in Guidelines 4, 5 and 6.

The rest of the information is not part of a definition, but implementation
advice. I think it is useful in the text of techniques, but not part of a
definition.

  Prompt:
  In this document "prompt" does not refer to the narrow software sense 
  of a "prompt," rather it is used as a verb meaning to urge, suggest 
  and encourage. The form and timing that this prompting takes can be 
  user configurable. "Prompting" does not depend upon the author to 
  seek out the support but is initiated by the tool. "Prompting" is 
  more than checking, correcting, and providing help and documentation 
  as encompassed in guidelines 4, 5, 6. The goal of prompting the 
  author is to encourage, urge and support the author in creating 
  meaningful equivalent text without causing frustration that may cause 
  the author to turn off access options. Prompting should be 
  implemented in such a way that it causes a positive disposition and 
  awareness on the part of the author toward accessible authoring 
  practices.
  
  Are there any objections from members who were not part of the call?
