I disagree. While the techniques document should definitely contain examples
of acceptable prompts for alternative text, the definition should not
contain examples.

Subject: Re: definition of "prompt"

It would be helpful, in the definition, to discuss some concrete examples of
what are or are not considered prompts - the example in the current
definition is a good starting point, and another example would be a dialog
which says "There are elements missing alternative content. Please provide
alternatives for them <OK> <Help> <Forget it>" (or something like that).

  edited version as follows:
 
  In this document "prompt" is used to mean urge, suggest, encourage. The
form
  that this takes can be user configurable, but should not depend on the
author
  to seek out the support, instead being initiated by the tool.
 
  Prompting is more than checking, automatically correcting, or making help
  and documentation available, as provided for in Guidelines 4, 5 and 6.
 
  The rest of the information is not part of a definition, but
implementation
  advice. I think it is useful in the text of techniques, but not part of a
  definition.

    Prompt:
    In this document "prompt" does not refer to the narrow software sense
    of a "prompt," rather it is used as a verb meaning to urge, suggest
    and encourage. The form and timing that this prompting takes can be
    user configurable. "Prompting" does not depend upon the author to
    seek out the support but is initiated by the tool. "Prompting" is
    more than checking, correcting, and providing help and documentation
    as encompassed in guidelines 4, 5, 6. The goal of prompting the
    author is to encourage, urge and support the author in creating
    meaningful equivalent text without causing frustration that may cause
    the author to turn off access options. Prompting should be
    implemented in such a way that it causes a positive disposition and
    awareness on the part of the author toward accessible authoring
    practices.
   
    Are there any objections from members who were not part of the call?
