Section 3.3.1, within Techniques for Using Prompting, uses the software
definition of prompt.  I think this is acceptable, but it might be helpful
to specifically call this out.

I believe section 3.4 can be removed or combined with section 3.3.  Our
current definition of prompt is a mixture of the software definition of
prompt and alert.  By having these examples in a section entitled alerts it
implies that these examples would not comply with the authoring tools 3.1
recommendation.

Could people please review the techniques in the document to assess
whether they are consistent with the new definition. This will be
discussed in the next teleconference.
