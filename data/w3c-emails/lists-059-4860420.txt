The consensus of the last teleconference was that we would not be creating 
tools for testing authoring tools.

However, lets keep in mind that if we create a set of accessible and 
non-accessible pages to test AERT tools, the accessible test pages provide 
one test of authoring tools: viz. the test of whether they can create each 
accessible page at all.
