Thanks to all of you who signed off. There are a large number of
administrative tasks that go with this process. We will keep you updated of
major milestones. For those of you who have not yet signed off (or sent
your approval) please do so as soon as possible. We will be sending out
personal reminders as well.

Great work all.
Jutta
