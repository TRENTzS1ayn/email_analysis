No worries Bruce.

Thanks everyone - we are now awaiting a director's decision on what to do
with the proposed Recommendation, which means the Working Group is no longer
responsible for the document (unless the director decides to return it to
us). Which means we are ready to get working in detail on the techniques
document, test suites, an impact matrix, describing in detail how to
implement and test for the relative checkpoints (in conjunction with the ERT
document from the Evaluation and Repair Group, and the GL and UA groups),
sample conformance evaluations, etc etc.

Good Work - let's keep it up *grin*
