Of the people who would be able to make a meeting Sunday 27 March, are there
any that couln't make it in LA on Monday, 28 March instead? Is there anyone
who can make that but not Sunday? Or does anyone have a suggestions about a
date that is better than either of those?

(Bear in mind that we are required by W3C process and good manners to give 8
weeks notice of a meeting date. There is a potential conflict with an
Education and Outrecah meeting on Sunday for several members of this group,
and if we can avoid it I would like to.

Cheers
