Note a correction to the dates in the previous email: 

March 26 is a Sunday
March 27 is a Monday

We are currently exploring options for the AUWG to meet on March 27,
Monday, so that it will not conflict with the EOWG meeting on March 26,
Sunday.

Please give feedback as soon as possible to Jutta and Charles.

Thank you,

Judy
