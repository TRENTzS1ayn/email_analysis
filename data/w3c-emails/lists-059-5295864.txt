We've kind of given longdesc short shrift - in the guidelines it is only
used to be defined; in the techniques I think maybe we should suggest
contexts in which it should be prompted for and this would require
asking if this image (or object or frameset or whatever) merits
lengthier expression than the usual ALT provides?
