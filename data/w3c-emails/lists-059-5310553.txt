Hello,

On the ER IG/WG call today we discussed how to prevent an author from 
receiving warnings for manual checks between sessions if the author has 
already performed the manual check.  If a tool maintained results in meta 
data for each file (or site) that is checked/repaired by a tool this would 
be useful for a number of reasons:
1. generating conformance claims to WCAG
2. keeping track of what the user has yet to fix or has  fixed and thus 
reducing the numbers of repeat alerts they may get for a particular element.

Have these issues been discussed in this group?  If so, please point us to 
the resolutions.

thanks,
--wendy
