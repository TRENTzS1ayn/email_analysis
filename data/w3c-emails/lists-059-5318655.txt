This has not been discussed as requiring any resolution in the AUWG. The
benefits mentioned are valuable, particularly the ability to generateWCAG
conformance evaluation semi-automagically at least. In the context of
Authoring Tool Guidelines this woul fall under the rubric of techniques for
checking for accessibility, in particular across sessions.

  Hello,
  
  On the ER IG/WG call today we discussed how to prevent an author from 
  receiving warnings for manual checks between sessions if the author has 
  already performed the manual check.  If a tool maintained results in meta 
  data for each file (or site) that is checked/repaired by a tool this would 
  be useful for a number of reasons:
  1. generating conformance claims to WCAG
  2. keeping track of what the user has yet to fix or has  fixed and thus 
  reducing the numbers of repeat alerts they may get for a particular element.
  
  Have these issues been discussed in this group?  If so, please point us to 
  the resolutions.
  
  thanks,
