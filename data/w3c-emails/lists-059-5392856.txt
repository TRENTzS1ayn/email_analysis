Congratulations everyone! We did it! The Authoring Tool Accessibility
Guidelines are now a W3C Recommendation, and there is a W3C Note
"Techniques for Authoring Tool Accessibility." Check out the W3 web site
for the Press Release, Testimonials, etc.

Judy and Ian deserve our special thanks, they both put in huge amounts of
work to get the document through the process and published as a
Recommendation, with the accompanying materials and adminstrative work that
is entailed.

Congratulations one and all!

Jutta and Charles
