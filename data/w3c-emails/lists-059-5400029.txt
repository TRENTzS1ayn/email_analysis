Despite our recent impressive achievement, now is not the time to rest on
our laurels (grin).

We are chartered to work on a revision of the techniques document, and to
track implementation experience and produce a report on what we think has to
happen next.

Since CSUN is not far away, it is probably time to start getting back into
the techniques in earnest, so send along those ideas that have been stewing
at the back of your minds for the last few weeks.

We would also like to resume the weekly teleconferences at 4:00 pm EST
starting Wed. Feb. 16. Is this time still available for everyone?

Jutta
