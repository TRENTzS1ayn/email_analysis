aloha, kynn!

while i'd welcome an eval of HomeSite by fred, i just wanted to let you know
that i have actually begun my long-delayed update of my conformance eval of
HomeSite 4.01 by testing HomeSite 4.5 with JFW 3.5 against the final draft... 
it is up to fred whether he wants to duplicate this work or not -- i personally
think that it would be interesting to compare his perspective to mine (i.e. how
the ATAG impacts an author versus how it impacts an author with a
disability)... or, he might want to evaluate ColdFusion Studio, if he so
chooses and is familiar with that particular Allaire product...

gregory.

PS: i'm also trying to clear time to finish my long-delayed eval of HoTMetaL
6.0
PPS: list of current authoring tool reviews is available at:
        http://www.w3.org/wai/au/reviews/
my HomeSite 4.01 eval against the Last Call draft is at:
        http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/reviews/homesite-19991007.html
PPPS: charles -- you still have the wrong URI listed in the HREF for the
HomeSite eval linked from the Review page -- it points to an earlier iteration,
rather than the one listed above
