You might want to check out something called the Common Industry Format (CIF)
at:
http://www.nist.gov/iusr
It's purpose is
"The overall purpose of the Common Industry Format (CIF) for Usability Test
Reports is to promote incorporation of usability as part of procurement
decision-making for interactive products. It provides a common format for human
factors engineers and usability professionals in supplier companies to report
the methods and results of usability tests to consumer organizations. "

Althought not designed for tool evaluation I suspect something similar would be
suitable.

I don't know anything else about it...ask the contacts on the site.
