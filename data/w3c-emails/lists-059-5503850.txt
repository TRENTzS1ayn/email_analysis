This would be a good idea to have multiple evaluations -- and it
also points out an opportunity for me to *tweak* Gregory for his
assumptions. :)  Fred is also an author with a disability, but it's
just not the same as Gregory's.

So rather than contrasting disabled user vs. non-disabled user,
we'd be contrasting visually impaired access vs. Fred's mobility-
impaired access.
