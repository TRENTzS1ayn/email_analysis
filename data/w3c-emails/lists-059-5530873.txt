As many conformance reviews as we can get are usful I would think - whether
of the same tools or different ones, by authors with all kinds of
disabilities, etc. For checkpoints like 7.1 I think that wide review and
testing is the only way we are going to get really good evaluation.

  Fred Barnett, a member of the HTML Writers Guild's governing board
  who has experience using and reviewing authoring tools is interested
  in writing a review of Allaire's Homesite product to evaluate how
  it complies with ATAG.
  
  Would this be a useful project for him to undertake?
  
  The HTML Writers Guild's greatest resource is our huge membership
  base -- and our membership base includes a -lot- of people who
  use authoring tools.  It may be possible to find more volunteers
  who likewise could spend some time evaluating their favorite
  authoring tools.  Would -that- be a useful project as well?
  
  (If it's not possible/useful as a W3C project -- it could be useful
  as a HWG project posted on our AWARE Center site.)
  
  Opinions?
