As a start I suggest using the list format of the checklist, and simply ading
a line below each checkpoint to give the status of the tool with regard to
that checkpoint.

Phill suggested using the cheklist with HTML inputs containing comments, as
well as having a couple for tester, date, tool tested... I think the idea is
good.

  Yes it would definitely be useful, there are quite a few tools to evaluate.
  To pull together the evaluations as one document we should probably agree
  on a common format. Perhaps we could offer a completed evaluation as a
  template to follow.
