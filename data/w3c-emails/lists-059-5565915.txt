The IBM Accessibility Center (formerly IBM Special Needs Systems) has
developed a set of IBM Accessibility Guidelines, one each for software,
the Web, Lotus Notes, hardware and Java. See
http://www.austin.ibm.com/sns/guidelines.htm.
Each guideline contains checklists and links to rationale, techniques for
implementation and methods for testing compliance. They have short sections
on related subjects, for example, screen readers and the Microsoft Object
Inspector tool for MSAA in the Software Accessibility Guideline,  and Home
Page Reader and Bobby in the Web Accessibility Guideline.

These documents were prepared for IBM developers who need to understand
what they must do to make their products accessible.  All the guidelines
include extensive references to related documents, such as the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines published by the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative
and Windows Accessibility Guidelines published by Microsoft.

This is the first release of the expanded IBM Accessibility Guidelines
which we expect to update periodically. We would be grateful to have your
comments. Please send those comments and suggestions directly to me,
thatch@us.ibm.com, or Shannon Rapuano, shannont@us.ibm.com.
