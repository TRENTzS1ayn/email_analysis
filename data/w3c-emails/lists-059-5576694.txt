I am giving a presentation on ATAG ta group of representatives from Japanese
W3C member organisations this Monday (Sunday evening US time). If anybody has
any great ideas they think should be there, feel free to post them to the
list. After all, they are likely to be sparks for ideas that we should
consider...
