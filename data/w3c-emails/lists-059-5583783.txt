Well, there is now a french translation of the recommendation available.

http://www.la-grange.net/w3c/atag10/ which was done by Karl Dubost (Thanks
Karl)

during the presentation in Japan there was interest in a japanese
translation, and if anyone else is interested in working on a translation
please check the ATAG translations page at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/ATAG-TRANSLATIONS and the information about W3C
translations that is linked from that page.

Cheers

Charles (looking forward to reading more things in other languages...)
