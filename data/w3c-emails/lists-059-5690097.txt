    Checkpoints:
    
   1.1 Provide a text equivalent for every non-text element (e.g., via
          "alt", "longdesc", or in element content). This includes:
          images, graphical representations of text (including symbols),
          image map regions, animations (e.g., animated GIFs), applets
          and programmatic objects, ascii art, frames, scripts, images
          used as list bullets, spacers, graphical buttons, sounds
          (played with or without user interaction), stand-alone audio
          files, audio tracks of video, and video. [Priority 1]
          For example, in HTML:
          
          + Use "alt" for the IMG, INPUT, and APPLET elements, or provide
            a text equivalent in the content of the OBJECT and APPLET
            elements.
          + For complex content (e.g., a chart) where the "alt" text does
            not provide a complete text equivalent, provide an additional
            description using, for example, "longdesc" with IMG or FRAME,
            a link inside an OBJECT element, or a [1]description link.
          + For image maps, either use the "alt" attribute with AREA, or
            use the MAP element with A elements (and other text) as
            content.
            
          Refer also to [2]checkpoint 9.1 and [3]checkpoint 13.10.
          
          [4]Techniques for checkpoint 1.1
          
   1.2 Provide redundant text links for each active region of a
          server-side image map. [Priority 1]
          Refer also to [5]checkpoint 1.5 and [6]checkpoint 9.1.
          [7]Techniques for checkpoint 1.2
          
        HTML
                Ask the author to identify regions in an image map, or to
                describe how the coordinates will be used so that a
                form-based input method can be generated.
                
   1.3 [8]Until user agents can automatically read aloud the text
          equivalent of a visual track, provide an auditory description
          of the important information of the visual track of a
          multimedia presentation. [Priority 1]
          Synchronize the [9]auditory description with the audio track as
          per [10]checkpoint 1.4. Refer to [11]checkpoint 1.1 for
          information about textual equivalents for visual information.
          [12]Techniques for checkpoint 1.3
          
   1.4 For any time-based multimedia presentation (e.g., a movie or
          animation), synchronize equivalent alternatives (e.g., captions
          or auditory descriptions of the visual track) with the
          presentation. [Priority 1]
          [13]Techniques for checkpoint 1.4
          
   1.5 [14]Until user agents render text equivalents for client-side
          image map links, provide redundant text links for each active
          region of a client-side image map. [Priority 3]
          Refer also to [15]checkpoint 1.2 and [16]checkpoint 9.1.
          [17]Techniques for checkpoint 1.5
          
        HTML
                Use the alt associated with area elements to build a
                redundant text navigation bar
                
   2.1 Ensure that all information conveyed with color is also available
          without color, for example from context or markup. [Priority 1]
          [18]Techniques for checkpoint 2.1
          
   2.2 Ensure that foreground and background color combinations provide
          sufficient contrast when viewed by someone having color
          deficits or when viewed on a black and white screen.
          [Priority 2 for images, Priority 3 for text].
          [19]Techniques for checkpoint 2.2
          
   3.1 When an appropriate markup language exists, use markup rather than
          images to convey information. [Priority 2]
          For example, use MathML to mark up mathematical equations, and
          [20]style sheets to format text and control layout. Also, avoid
          using images to represent text -- use text and style sheets
          instead. Refer also to [21]guideline 6 and [22]guideline 11.
          [23]Techniques for checkpoint 3.1
          
   3.2 Create documents that validate to published formal grammars.
          [Priority 2]
          For example, include a document type declaration at the
          beginning of a document that refers to a published DTD (e.g.,
          the strict HTML 4.0 DTD).
          [24]Techniques for checkpoint 3.2
          
   3.3 Use style sheets to control layout and presentation. [Priority 2]
          For example, use the CSS 'font' property instead of the HTML
          FONT element to control font styles.
          [25]Techniques for checkpoint 3.3
          
   3.4 Use relative rather than absolute units in markup language
          attribute values and style sheet property values. [Priority 2]
          For example, in CSS, use 'em' or percentage lengths rather than
          'pt' or 'cm', which are absolute units. If absolute units are
          used, validate that the rendered content is usable (refer to
          the [26]section on validation).
          [27]Techniques for checkpoint 3.4
          
   3.5 Use header elements to convey document structure and use them
          according to specification. [Priority 2]
          For example, in HTML, use H2 to indicate a subsection of H1. Do
          not use headers for font effects.
          [28]Techniques for checkpoint 3.5
          
   3.6 Mark up lists and list items properly. [Priority 2]
          For example, in HTML, nest OL, UL, and DL lists properly.
          [29]Techniques for checkpoint 3.6
          
   3.7 Mark up quotations. Do not use quotation markup for formatting
          effects such as indentation. [Priority 2]
          For example, in HTML, use the Q and BLOCKQUOTE elements to
          markup short and longer quotations, respectively.
          [30]Techniques for checkpoint 3.7
          
        Where material appears within quote marks ask the author if this
                is a quotation.
                
   4.1 Clearly identify changes in the natural language of a document's
          text and any [31]text equivalents (e.g., captions).
          [Priority 1]
          For example, in HTML use the "lang" attribute. In XML, use
          "xml:lang".
          [32]Techniques for checkpoint 4.1
          
   4.2 Specify the expansion of each abbreviation or acronym in a
          document where it first occurs. [Priority 3]
          For example, in HTML, use the "title" attribute of the ABBR and
          ACRONYM elements. Providing the expansion in the main body of
          the document also helps document usability.
          [33]Techniques for checkpoint 4.2
          
        HTML
                Ask the author to provide an expansion or confirm that a
                previously supplied one should be used again.
                
   4.3 Identify the primary natural language of a document. [Priority 3]
          For example, in HTML set the "lang" attribute on the HTML
          element. In XML, use "xml:lang". Server operators should
          configure servers to take advantage of HTTP content negotiation
          mechanisms ([34][RFC2068], section 14.13) so that clients can
          automatically retrieve documents of the preferred language.
          [35]Techniques for checkpoint 4.3
          
        General:
                Ask the author to identify the language of any document.
                Provide a mechanism for setting a default.
                
   5.1 For data tables, identify row and column headers. [Priority 1]
          For example, in HTML, use TD to identify data cells and TH to
          identify headers.
          [36]Techniques for checkpoint 5.1
          
   5.2 For data tables that have two or more logical levels of row or
          column headers, use markup to associate data cells and header
          cells. [Priority 1]
          For example, in HTML, use THEAD, TFOOT, and TBODY to group
          rows, COL and COLGROUP to group columns, and the "axis",
          "scope", and "headers" attributes, to describe more complex
          relationships among data.
          [37]Techniques for checkpoint 5.2
          
        HTML
                Ask the author to group columns, rows, or blocks of cells
                that are related.
                
   5.3 Do not use tables for layout unless the table makes sense when
          linearized. Otherwise, if the table does not make sense,
          provide an alternative equivalent (which may be a
          [38]linearized version). [Priority 2]
          Note. [39]Once user agents support style sheet positioning,
          tables should not be used for layout. [40]Refer also to
          checkpoint 3.3.
          [41]Techniques for checkpoint 5.3
          
   5.4 If a table is used for layout, do not use any structural markup
          for the purpose of visual formatting. [Priority 2]
          For example, in HTML do not use the TH element to cause the
          content of a (non-table header) cell to be displayed centered
          and in bold.
          [42]Techniques for checkpoint 5.4
          
   5.5 Provide summaries for tables. [Priority 3]
          For example, in HTML, use the "summary" attribute of the TABLE
          element.
          [43]Techniques for checkpoint 5.5
          
        HTML
                Ask the author to provide a sumary of the table.
                
   5.6 Provide abbreviations for header labels. [Priority 3]
          For example, in HTML, use the "abbr" attribute on the TH
          element.
          [44]Techniques for checkpoint 5.6
          
   6.1 Organize documents so they may be read without style sheets. For
          example, when an HTML document is rendered without associated
          style sheets, it must still be possible to read the document.
          [Priority 1]
          When content is organized logically, it will be rendered in a
          meaningful order when style sheets are turned off or not
          supported.
          [45]Techniques for checkpoint 6.1
          
   6.2 Ensure that equivalents for dynamic content are updated when the
          dynamic content changes. [Priority 1]
          [46]Techniques for checkpoint 6.2
          
   6.3 Ensure that pages are usable when scripts, applets, or other
          programmatic objects are turned off or not supported. If this
          is not possible, provide equivalent information on an
          alternative accessible page. [Priority 1]
          For example, ensure that links that trigger scripts work when
          scripts are turned off or not supported (e.g., do not use
          "javascript:" as the link target). If it is not possible to
          make the page usable without scripts, provide a text equivalent
          with the NOSCRIPT element, or use a server-side script instead
          of a client-side script, or provide an alternative accessible
          page as per [47]checkpoint 11.4. [48]Refer also to guideline 1.
          [49]Techniques for checkpoint 6.3
          
        HTML
                Ask for server-side alternatives for scripts and applets.
                
   6.4 For scripts and applets, ensure that event handlers are input
          device-independent. [Priority 2]
          Refer to the definition of [50]device independence.
          [51]Techniques for checkpoint 6.4
          
   6.5 Ensure that dynamic content is accessible or provide an
          alternative presentation or page. [Priority 2]
          For example, in HTML, use NOFRAMES at the end of each frameset.
          For some applications, server-side scripts may be more
          accessible than client-side scripts.
          [52]Techniques for checkpoint 6.5
          
        HTML
                Ask the author for appropriate links and content to
                include in a noframes element, or for a server-side
                alternative to applets and script functions.
                
   7.1 [53]Until user agents allow users to control flickering, avoid
          causing the screen to flicker. [Priority 1]
          Note. People with photosensitive epilepsy can have seizures
          triggered by flickering or flashing in the 4 to 59 flashes per
          second (Hertz) range with a peak sensitivity at 20 flashes per
          second as well as quick changes from dark to light (like strobe
          lights).
          [54]Techniques for checkpoint 7.1
          
   7.2 [55]Until user agents allow users to control blinking, avoid
          causing content to blink (i.e., change presentation at a
          regular rate, such as turning on and off). [Priority 2]
          [56]Techniques for checkpoint 7.2
          
   7.3 [57]Until user agents allow users to freeze moving content, avoid
          movement in pages. [Priority 2]
          When a page includes moving content, provide a mechanism within
          a script or applet to allow users to freeze motion or updates.
          Using style sheets with scripting to create movement allows
          users to turn off or override the effect more easily. [58]Refer
          also to guideline 8.
          [59]Techniques for checkpoint 7.3
          
   7.4 [60]Until user agents provide the ability to stop the refresh, do
          not create periodically auto-refreshing pages. [Priority 2]
          For example, in HTML, don't cause pages to auto-refresh with
          "HTTP-EQUIV=refresh" until user agents allow users to turn off
          the feature.
          [61]Techniques for checkpoint 7.4
          
   7.5 [62]Until user agents provide the ability to stop auto-redirect,
          do not use markup to redirect pages automatically. Instead,
          configure the server to perform redirects. [Priority 2]
          [63]Techniques for checkpoint 7.5
          
   8.1 Make programmatic elements such as scripts and applets directly
          accessible or compatible with assistive technologies
          [Priority 1 if functionality is [64]important and not presented
          elsewhere, otherwise Priority 2.]
          [65]Refer also to guideline 6.
          [66]Techniques for checkpoint 8.1
          
   9.1 Provide client-side image maps instead of server-side image maps
          except where the regions cannot be defined with an available
          geometric shape. [Priority 1]
          Refer also to [67]checkpoint 1.1, [68]checkpoint 1.2, and
          [69]checkpoint 1.5.
          [70]Techniques for checkpoint 9.1
          
        HTML
                where regions are not easily defined, ask the author to
                provide information that can be used to generate a
                form-based input method and explains how the coordinates
                input will be used. For example, on a map the input might
                be used to lookup latitude and longitude of a point and
                then give information about that point.
                
   9.2 Ensure that any element that has its own interface can be operated
          in a device-independent manner. [Priority 2]
          Refer to the definition of [71]device independence.
          [72]Refer also to guideline 8.
          [73]Techniques for checkpoint 9.2
          
   9.3 For scripts, specify logical event handlers rather than
          device-dependent event handlers. [Priority 2]
          [74]Techniques for checkpoint 9.3
          
   9.4 Create a logical tab order through links, form controls, and
          objects. [Priority 3]
          For example, in HTML, specify tab order via the "tabindex"
          attribute or ensure a logical page design.
          [75]Techniques for checkpoint 9.4
          
        HTML
                Where there are only a few links that change in each page
                of a collection, ask the author if they should receive
                focus first. If so, then give them a tabindex, leaving
                the rest to after the tabindexed links have been
                focussed.
                
   9.5 Provide keyboard shortcuts to important links (including those in
          [76]client-side image maps), form controls, and groups of form
          controls. [Priority 3]
          For example, in HTML, specify shortcuts via the "accesskey"
          attribute.
          [77]Techniques for checkpoint 9.5
          
        HTML
                Ask authors to specify an accesskey for links that appear
                common to a number of pages
                
   10.1 [78]Until user agents allow users to turn off spawned windows, do
          not cause pop-ups or other windows to appear and do not change
          the current window without informing the user. [Priority 2]
          For example, in HTML, avoid using a frame whose target is a new
          window.
          [79]Techniques for checkpoint 10.1
          
   10.2 [80]Until user agents support explicit associations between
          labels and form controls, for all form controls with implicitly
          associated labels, ensure that the label is properly
          positioned. [Priority 2]
          The label must immediately precede its control on the same line
          (allowing more than one control/label per line) or be in the
          line preceding the control (with only one label and one control
          per line). [81]Refer also to checkpoint 12.4.
          [82]Techniques for checkpoint 10.2
          
        HTML
                See also checkpoint 12.4 - use the information to ensure
                that label text is positioned appropriately.
                
   10.3 [83]Until user agents (including assistive technologies) render
          side-by-side text correctly, provide a linear text alternative
          (on the current page or some other) for all tables that lay out
          text in parallel, word-wrapped columns. [Priority 3]
          Note. Please consult the definition of [84]linearized table.
          This checkpoint benefits people with [85]user agents (such as
          some [86]screen readers) that are unable to handle blocks of
          text presented side-by-side; the checkpoint should not
          discourage content developers from using tables to represent
          [87]tabular information.
          [88]Techniques for checkpoint 10.3
          
   10.4 [89]Until user agents handle empty controls correctly, include
          default, place-holding characters in edit boxes and text areas.
          [Priority 3]
          For example, in HTML, do this for TEXTAREA and INPUT.
          [90]Techniques for checkpoint 10.4
          
   10.5 [91]Until user agents (including assistive technologies) render
          adjacent links distinctly, include non-link, printable
          characters (surrounded by spaces) between adjacent links.
          [Priority 3]

   11.1 Use W3C technologies when they are available and appropriate for
          a task and use the latest versions when supported. [Priority 2]
          Refer to the [93]list of references for information about where
          to find the latest W3C specifications and [94][WAI-UA-SUPPORT]

   11.2 Avoid deprecated features of W3C technologies. [Priority 2]
          For example, in HTML, don't use the [96]deprecated FONT
          element; use style sheets instead (e.g., the 'font' property in
          CSS).
          [97]Techniques for checkpoint 11.2
          
   11.3 Provide information so that users may receive documents according
          to their preferences (e.g., language, content type, etc.)
          [Priority 3]
          Note. Use content negotiation where possible.

   11.4 If, [99]after best efforts, you cannot create an [100]accessible
          page, provide a link to an alternative page that uses W3C
          technologies, is accessible, has [101]equivalent information
          (or functionality), and is updated as often as the inaccessible
          (original) page. [Priority 1]
          [102]Techniques for checkpoint 11.4
          
   12.1 Title each frame to facilitate frame identification and
          navigation. [Priority 1]
          For example, in HTML use the "title" attribute on FRAME
          elements.
          [103]Techniques for checkpoint 12.1
          
        HTML
                Ask the author to specify what the frame does in a short
                sentence
                
   12.2 Describe the purpose of frames and how frames relate to each
          other if it is not obvious by frame titles alone. [Priority 2]
          For example, in HTML, use "longdesc," or a [104]description
          link.
          [105]Techniques for checkpoint 12.2
          
        HTML
                Ask the author to identify which links and content should
                be contained in a noframes element
                
   12.3 Divide large blocks of information into more manageable groups
          where natural and appropriate. [Priority 2]
          For example, in HTML, use OPTGROUP to group OPTION elements
          inside a SELECT; group form controls with FIELDSET and LEGEND;
          use nested lists where appropriate; use headings to structure
          documents, etc. [106]Refer also to guideline 3.
          [107]Techniques for checkpoint 12.3
          
        HTML
                Where there are more than 10 choices in a list (select,
                checkbox or radio boxes) ask the author to identify
                subgroups
                
   12.4 Associate labels explicitly with their controls. [Priority 2]
          For example, in HTML use LABEL and its "for" attribute.
          [108]Techniques for checkpoint 12.4
          
        HTML
                Ask authors to mark explicitly the labels for form inputs
                (input and textarea elements)
                
   13.1 Clearly identify the target of each link. [Priority 2]
          [109]Link text should be meaningful enough to make sense when
          read out of context -- either on its own or as part of a
          sequence of links. Link text should also be terse.
          For example, in HTML, write "Information about version 4.3"
          instead of "click here". In addition to clear link text,
          content developers may further clarify the target of a link
          with an informative link title (e.g., in HTML, the "title"
          attribute).
          [110]Techniques for checkpoint 13.1
          
   13.2 Provide metadata to add semantic information to pages and sites.
          [Priority 2]
          For example, use RDF ([111][RDF]) to indicate the document's
          author, the type of content, etc.
          Note. Some HTML [112]user agents can build navigation tools
          from document relations described by the HTML LINK element and
          "rel" or "rev" attributes (e.g., rel="next", rel="previous",
          rel="index", etc.). [113]Refer also to checkpoint 13.5.
          [114]Techniques for checkpoint 13.2
          
        General
                Ask authors for information about a page or site. If its
                function is known (see also checkpoint 13.9) add this
                information as metadata.
                
   13.3 Provide information about the general layout of a site (e.g., a
          site map or table of contents). [Priority 2]
          In describing site layout, highlight and explain available
          accessibility features.
          [115]Techniques for checkpoint 13.3
          
   13.4 Use navigation mechanisms in a consistent manner. [Priority 2]
          [116]Techniques for checkpoint 13.4
          
   13.5 Provide navigation bars to highlight and give access to the
          navigation mechanism. [Priority 3]
          [117]Techniques for checkpoint 13.5
          
   13.6 Group related links, identify the group (for user agents), and,
          [118]until user agents do so, provide a way to bypass the
          group. [Priority 3]
          [119]Techniques for checkpoint 13.6
          
        HTML
                Ask authors if lists of links are a group and should be a
                map.
                
   13.7 If search functions are provided, enable different types of
          searches for different skill levels and preferences.
          [Priority 3]
          [120]Techniques for checkpoint 13.7
          
   13.8 Place distinguishing information at the beginning of headings,
          paragraphs, lists, etc. [Priority 3]
          Note. This is commonly referred to as "front-loading" and is
          especially helpful for people accessing information with serial
          devices such as speech synthesizers.
          [121]Techniques for checkpoint 13.8
          
   13.9 Provide information about document collections (i.e., documents
          comprising multiple pages.). [Priority 3]
          For example, in HTML specify document collections with the LINK
          element and the "rel" and "rev" attributes. Another way to
          create a collection is by building an archive (e.g., with zip,
          tar and gzip, stuffit, etc.) of the multiple pages.
          Note. The performance improvement gained by offline processing
          can make browsing much less expensive for people with
          disabilities who may be browsing slowly.
          [122]Techniques for checkpoint 13.9
          
        General
                
               o Pattern-matching - ask authors to specify the role of
                 pages linked from a navigation bar.
               o Where common names are used (search, home, map) as
                 links, ask the author to confirm these functions for use
                 in linking.
                 
   13.10 Provide a means to skip over multi-line ASCII art. [Priority 3]
          Refer to [123]checkpoint 1.1 and [124]the example of ascii art
          in the glossary.
          [125]Techniques for checkpoint 13.10
          
        HTML
                Where a PRE element is used with substantial punctuation
                and non-words, ask for text alternative.
                
   14.1 Use the clearest and simplest language appropriate for a site's
          content. [Priority 1]
          [126]Techniques for checkpoint 14.1
          
   14.2 Supplement text with graphic or auditory presentations where they
          will facilitate comprehension of the page. [Priority 3]
          [127]Refer also to guideline 1.
          [128]Techniques for checkpoint 14.2
          
   14.3 Create a style of presentation that is consistent across pages.
