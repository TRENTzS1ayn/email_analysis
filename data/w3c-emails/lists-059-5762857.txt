Good morning,

I recall that we discussed illustrative figures in a conference call
several months ago.  Here are some of my ideas as to where such figures
might be appropriate.  Of course, each figure should only be a visual
representation of the content that will already be present in the text
of the
"sample".  Currently, most of the techniques include Amaya "samples", so
many of the figure suggestions reflect this.  We can always substitute
more APROMPT or ideal fictitious examples for Amaya screen shots if
necessary.  I'm guessing we should stay away from samples from
commercial tools.

3.1 Prompt the author to provide equivalent alternative information
(e.g., captions, auditory descriptions, and collated text transcripts
for video).
SUGGEST: Screen shot of APROMPT or AMAYA prompting for a CAPTION for a
TABLE. 

3.3 Ensure that prepackaged content conforms to the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 [WCAG10].
SUGGEST: Screen shot of fictitious clip art management tool (with search
capability)

3.5 Provide functionality for managing, editing, and reusing alternative
equivalents for multimedia objects.
SUGGEST: Screen shot of APROMPT alt-text management tool

4.1 Check for and inform the author of accessibility problems.
SUGGEST: Screen shot of a fictitious in-line accessibility checker.

4.2 Assist authors in correcting accessibility problems.
SUGGEST: Screen shot of an APROMPT correction screen.

5.1 Ensure that functionality related to accessible authoring practices
is naturally integrated into the overall look and feel of the tool.
SUGGEST: Screen shot of fictitious LONGDESC tool in an image insertion
dialog.

6.2 Ensure that creating accessible content is a naturally integrated
part of the documentation, including examples.
SUGGEST: Screen shot of relevant section of AMAYA's help system.

7.2 Allow the author to change the presentation within editing views
without affecting the document markup.
SUGGEST: Screen shot of AMAYA's local style sheet functionality.

7.3 Allow the author to edit all properties of each element and object
in an accessible fashion.
SUGGEST: Screen shot of AMAYA's attribute editing from the structure
view.
