Sounds like a great idea.

  Hi all,
  
  Looking at the voluminous postings for Checkpoints 1.3, 3.1 and 3.2, I
  can't help but think there must be a better way.  After all, the
  techniques we are using as a basis ALREADY appear in the WCAG techniques
  note!
  
  Perhaps the answer is that the techniques for ATAG should not focus so
  much on how to meet the WCAG guidelines (they have techniques for that
  already).  Instead our techniques should focus on ways that tools can
  meet the ATAG guidelines most effectively.  This would include pointing
  out how multiple ATAG guidelines can be met simultaneously, to what
  extent certain types of things can be automated, suggestions on what to
  tell authors so that they write quality descriptions, etc.
  
  Of course, we can still narrow down the applicable WCAG checkpoints and
  techniques (ex. the priority of ATAG Checkpoint 3.1 is relative but it
  only applies only WCAG Guideline 1).
  
  What do other people think?
  
  Cheers,
  Jan
