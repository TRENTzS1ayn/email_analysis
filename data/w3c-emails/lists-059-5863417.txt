aloha, phil!

as scribe for the last telecon, i recorded the "cool-o-matic" response to 
what charles was minuted as having stated immediately prior to the general 
agreement voiced on the call, to wit:

quote
CMN: yeah; running threads -- ATAG 4.2 WCAG 1.1, ATAG 4.2 WCAG 1.2; etc;
unquote

recently, charles has begun to post quote thinking points unquote for 
discussion at tomorrow's telecon on the AU list, which are being threaded 
using the following syntax:

         Technique X.Y (technique subject)

rather than using the cool-o-matic approach

         ATAG X.Y WCAG Z.Q

but before i ascribe this inconsistency to the age-old gap between theory 
and practice rearing its ugly head, charles should have his say...  i think 
he is merely trying to collate in one place all of the WCAG checkpoints 
that apply to specific ATAG checkpoints, as a basis for moving forward on 
specific techniques, which will then be threaded using the cool-o-matic 
subject line syntax, viz:

         ATAG 3.2 WCAG 1.1

at least, that's what _i_ think charles is doing...  charles, what say you?

gregory.
