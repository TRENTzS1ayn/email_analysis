  aloha, phil!
  
  as scribe for the last telecon, i recorded the "cool-o-matic" response to 
  what charles was minuted as having stated immediately prior to the general 
  agreement voiced on the call, to wit:
  
  quote
  CMN: yeah; running threads -- ATAG 4.2 WCAG 1.1, ATAG 4.2 WCAG 1.2; etc;
  unquote
  
  recently, charles has begun to post quote thinking points unquote for 
  discussion at tomorrow's telecon on the AU list, which are being threaded 
  using the following syntax:
  
           Technique X.Y (technique subject)
  
  rather than using the cool-o-matic approach
  
           ATAG X.Y WCAG Z.Q
  
  but before i ascribe this inconsistency to the age-old gap between theory 
  and practice rearing its ugly head, charles should have his say...  i think 
  he is merely trying to collate in one place all of the WCAG checkpoints 
  that apply to specific ATAG checkpoints, as a basis for moving forward on 
  specific techniques, which will then be threaded using the cool-o-matic 
  subject line syntax, viz:
  
           ATAG 3.2 WCAG 1.1
  
  at least, that's what _i_ think charles is doing...  charles, what say you?
