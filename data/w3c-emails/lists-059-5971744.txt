A trimmed down version included at the end of this.

There are other WCAG checkpoints that seemed to be relevant. Note that
references to checkpoints or techniques are in fact to WCAG checkpoints/techs
- I think that this should be made explicit in the text, but haven't done
that yet.

          [3]Techniques for checkpoint 1.1
          
        HTML
                
               o prompt for longdesc and alt for img elements
               o prompt for alt for area elements
               o prompt for text transcript for audio objects.
               o prompt for collated text transcript for movies.
                 
        SVG
                Prompt for a title and desc for each g group
                
        SMIL
                Prompt for alt, longdesc, a text or textstream object for
                audio, image and video objects
                
   1.2 Provide redundant text links for each active region of a
          server-side image map. [Priority 1]
          Refer also to [4]checkpoint 1.5 and [5]checkpoint 9.1.
          [6]Techniques for checkpoint 1.2
          
        HTML
                
          + Use the same User interface for server and client side image
            map creations, including prompting for alternatives for each
            region. Use alternatives provided to generate redundant
            text-based links for server-side maps.
          + Prompt for text which describes the range and the effect of
            possible coordinate entries, and generate an alternative,
            form-based entry system.
            
   1.3 [7]Until user agents can automatically read aloud the text
          equivalent of a visual track, provide an auditory description
          of the important information of the visual track of a
          multimedia presentation. [Priority 1]
          [8]Techniques for checkpoint 1.3
          
        SMIL
                
               o Prompt the author to provide an audio track that
                 includes description, if necessary with an alternative
                 version of the video.
                 
   1.4 For any time-based multimedia presentation (e.g., a movie or
          animation), synchronize equivalent alternatives (e.g., captions
          or auditory descriptions of the visual track) with the
          presentation. [Priority 1]
          [9]Techniques for checkpoint 1.4
          
        HTML
                
               o Use a format such as SMIL which allows for the inclusion
                 and synchronisation of equivalent tracks
                 
        XML
                
               o Use SMIL timing to synchronise equivalents
                 
   1.5 [10]Until user agents render text equivalents for client-side
          image map links, provide redundant text links for each active
          region of a client-side image map. [Priority 3]
          Refer also to [11]checkpoint 1.2 and [12]checkpoint 9.1.
          [13]Techniques for checkpoint 1.5
          
        HTML
                Use the alt associated with area elements to build a
                redundant text navigation bar
                
   2.1 Ensure that all information conveyed with color is also available
          without color, for example from context or markup. [Priority 1]
          [14]Techniques for checkpoint 2.1
          
   2.2 Ensure that foreground and background color combinations provide
          sufficient contrast when viewed by someone having color
          deficits or when viewed on a black and white screen.
          [Priority 2 for images, Priority 3 for text].
          [15]Techniques for checkpoint 2.2
          
        HTML, SVG, CSS
                Where only one color has been specified (for example a
                background but not foreground) ask the author to specify
                (or confirm default) colors for other parts, where
                possible from a range that has sufficient contrast.
                
   3.1 When an appropriate markup language exists, use markup rather than
          images to convey information. [Priority 2]
          Refer also to [16]guideline 6 and [17]guideline 11.
          [18]Techniques for checkpoint 3.1
          
        HTML
                
               o Where images are readable through Optical Character
                 Recognition (OCR) as text, use text with CSS styling.
                 
        XHTML, XML
                
               o Where images are readable through Optical Character
                 Recognition (OCR) as text use SVG
               o Where images are recognisable as mathematical content,
                 use MathML
               o Prompt the author to use a markup language for text,
                 mathematics, etc.
                 
   6.2 Ensure that equivalents for dynamic content are updated when the
          dynamic content changes. [Priority 1]
          [19]Techniques for checkpoint 6.2
          
        HTML
                
               o Where scripts change the src attribute of images, prompt
                 the author to include changes in the alt attribute or
                 element content.
                 
        SVG, XHTML
                
               o Where SMIL animation is used, prompt the authro to
                 ensure that desc and title elements are appropriately
                 updated by hte animation
                 
   6.3 Ensure that pages are usable when scripts, applets, or other
          programmatic objects are turned off or not supported. If this
          is not possible, provide equivalent information on an
          alternative accessible page. [Priority 1]
          [20]Techniques for checkpoint 6.3
          
        HTML
                Ask for equivalents for scripts, and applets, for example
                a movie (and collated text transcripts, audio, etc)
                
   6.5 Ensure that dynamic content is accessible or provide an
          alternative presentation or page. [Priority 2]
          [21]Techniques for checkpoint 6.5
          
   7.1 [22]Until user agents allow users to control flickering, avoid
          causing the screen to flicker. [Priority 1]
          Note. People with photosensitive epilepsy can have seizures
          triggered by flickering or flashing in the 4 to 59 flashes per
          second (Hertz) range with a peak sensitivity at 20 flashes per
          second as well as quick changes from dark to light (like strobe
          lights).
          [23]Techniques for checkpoint 7.1
          
        HTML (relying on lowsrc attribute - not in W3C recommendation)
                Prompt for a non-animated "lowsrc" version of animated
                images.
                
   7.2 [24]Until user agents allow users to control blinking, avoid
          causing content to blink (i.e., change presentation at a
          regular rate, such as turning on and off). [Priority 2]
          [25]Techniques for checkpoint 7.2
          
   7.3 [26]Until user agents allow users to freeze moving content, avoid
          movement in pages. [Priority 2]
          When a page includes moving content, provide a mechanism within
          a script or applet to allow users to freeze motion or updates.
          Using style sheets with scripting to create movement allows
          users to turn off or override the effect more easily. [27]Refer
          also to guideline 8.
          [28]Techniques for checkpoint 7.3
          
   8.1 Make programmatic elements such as scripts and applets directly
          accessible or compatible with assistive technologies
          [Priority 1 if functionality is [29]important and not presented
          elsewhere, otherwise Priority 2.]
          [30]Refer also to guideline 6.
          [31]Techniques for checkpoint 8.1
          
   9.1 Provide client-side image maps instead of server-side image maps
          except where the regions cannot be defined with an available
          geometric shape. [Priority 1]
          Refer also to [32]checkpoint 1.1, [33]checkpoint 1.2, and
          [34]checkpoint 1.5.
          [35]Techniques for checkpoint 9.1
          
        HTML
                Use the same interface for defining areas of client- and
                server-side maps, and produce the image as client-side
                where possible
                
   11.1 Use W3C technologies when they are available and appropriate for
          a task and use the latest versions when supported. [Priority 2]
          [36]Techniques for checkpoint 11.1
          
        Raster images (PNG, JPEG, GIF)
                
               o Use RDF to incorporate textual equivalents in image
                 encodings
                 
        Vector images
                
               o Use SVG, and prmpt the author to provide appropriate
                 title and desc elements for each g element.
                 
   11.3 Provide information so that users may receive documents according
          to their preferences (e.g., language, content type, etc.)
          [Priority 3]
          [37]Techniques for checkpoint 11.3
          
   11.4 If, [38]after best efforts, you cannot create an [39]accessible
          page, provide a link to an alternative page that uses W3C
          technologies, is accessible, has [40]equivalent information (or
          functionality), and is updated as often as the inaccessible
          (original) page. [Priority 1]
          [41]Techniques for checkpoint 11.4
          
   13.2 Provide metadata to add semantic information to pages and sites.
          [Priority 2]
          [42]Refer also to checkpoint 13.5.
          [43]Techniques for checkpoint 13.2
          
        Images
                Metadata can be added to most image formats comonly used
                on the Web, includin PNG, JPEG, GIF, and SVG. @@Include
                link to rdfpic sample tool that does this (source
                available too).
                
   14.2 Supplement text with graphic or auditory presentations where they
          will facilitate comprehension of the page. [Priority 3]
          [44]Refer also to guideline 1.
          [45]Techniques for checkpoint 14.2
          
        HTML
                Provide libraries of accessible clip art to illustrate
                common concepts, or allow the author to build them. See
                also ATAG 3.5
