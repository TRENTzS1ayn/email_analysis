Hello,

Here is what I have put together for my work item.  I am only partially
finished 3.1.  The intent is to make links between lots of ATAG and WCAG
checkpoints in order to show how work on one thing can help accomplish
another.  I am aiming for maximum independence from WCAG wherever
possible.

ATAG Checkpoint 3.1
Prompt the author to provide equivalent alternative information (e.g.,
captions, auditory descriptions, and collated text transcripts for
video). [Relative Priority]

GENERAL NOTES:
Reference:
  WCAG 3.1 (Convey information with markup rather than images)
  WCAG 2.1 (Ensure information is not conveyed solely by color)

SHORT DESCRIPTIVE TEXT:
Reference:
  WCAG 1.1 (text equivalents) [Priority 1]

Relevant to:
  HTML (ex. alt for img, alt for area, caption for table, etc.)
  SVG (ex. title for g group)
  SMIL (ex. alt for image)

Prompting:
- The tool may prompt the author to enter a short (10 word or less)
description whenever an element that requires one is added or edited.
- Emphasize that the description alone should provide reader with
sufficient information.
- Provide a link to a number of well described objects in the help (ATAG
Checkpoint 6.1). [our example here]
- The object name is not necessarily a good indication of its content
and so should not be used as a default text in the prompting field (ATAG
Checkpoint 3.4).  If the tool stores previous descriptive text-object
associations (including developer authored text for clip art) these can
be placed as default in the prompt field.

SHORT FUNCTIONAL TEXT:
Reference:
  WCAG 1.1 (text equivalents) [Priority 1]

Relevant to:
  HTML (ex. alt for img serving as a button, alt for button, etc.)

Prompting:
- The tool may prompt the author to enter a short (10 word or less)
description that emphasizes its FUNCTION (rather than the appearance)
whenever an element that requires one is added or edited.
- Emphasize that the functional description alone should provide reader
with sufficient information about the destination
- Provide a link to a number of well described linked-objects in the
help (ATAG Checkpoint 6.1). [our example here]
- The link destination path is not necessarily a good indication of its
content and so should not be used as a default text in the prompting
field (ATAG Checkpoint 3.4).  If the tool stores previous functional
text-object associations these can be placed as default in the prompt
field.

***END OF WORK SO FAR ***

LONGER DESCRIPTIVE TEXT:
Reference:
  WCAG 1.1 (text equivalents) [Priority 1]

Relevant to:
  HTML (ex. longdesc for img, longdesc for frame, etc.)
  SVG (ex. desc for g group)
  SMIL (ex. longdesc for image)

Prompting:

TRANSCRIPTS:
Reference:
  WCAG 1.1 (text equivalents) [Priority 1]

Relevant to:
  HTML (ex. Text transcript for audio object, Collated text transcript
for video)
  SMIL (ex. textstream for video)

Prompting:

AUDITORY DESCRIPTIONS:
Reference:
  WCAG 1.3 (auditory descriptions)
  WCAG 1.4 (synchronization)

Relevant to:
  HTML (ex. )

Prompting:

REDUNDANT TEXT LINKS
Reference:
  WCAG 1.2 (redundant text links for server side image maps) [Priority
1]

3]

Relevant to:
  HTML (AREA element)

Prompting:

Reference:
  WCAG 13.2 (metadata)

Relevant to:
