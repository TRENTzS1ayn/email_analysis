In reviewing the latest draft of the ERT document (not linked from site
yet), it seems to cover all of the techniques we would need for 4.1 and
4.2, it has some good techniques for 4.4 and 4.5 and it helps to clarify
which WCAG guidelines can be automatically checked and repaired and which
need author intervention. The question now is how do we integrate the
document. Do we link it in or do we restate it in our document?
