I have tried 3 time to call in - all circuits are busy message is all I
get!  Sounds like a Boston area phone problem.  I'll try again in a few
minutes to see if the circuits are available.

I have a rough draft of an accessible template.

Some things I wanted to discuss is the scope of the template:
In priority order:
1. Must look good, sound good, Braille good, and print good:
     "Look good" means it looks good on Nav4, IE4, IE5, and Opera
     "Sound good" on IBM Home Page Reader and PW WebSpeak
     "Braille good" on JFW 3.5? on Windows w/Braille display
     "print good" means ?
2. Should pass BOBBY.
3. Should be valid code.


Regards,
Phill Jenkins




To be more specific we will review progress on action items agreed to last
week and assess what additional action items are needed. The action items
were:

Phil and Greg: Accessible Templates
Jan: Techniques to meet several checkpoints at once
Dick and others at Microsoft: actual implementation examples
Charles: Relative priority checkpoints
William: The hundred mile view
Jan: illustrations of existing implementations
Jutta and ATRC staff: example implementations in courseware tools and ER
imports
