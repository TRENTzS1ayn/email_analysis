Minutes

   CMN I did some stuff for 3.1 and some 3.2 which I haven't sent. There
   is a lot of redundancy in WCAG. Seems like a good approach, and we
   will end up with lots of stuff
   
   JT Redundancy in WCAG
   
   CMN In the checkpoints themselves - meeting one checkpoint often
   already meets several others need lots of cross-referencing
   
   JR I tried to stay away from the WCAG techniques
   
   CMN I have left in links ot WCAG techniques. Are people finding the
   length impossible?
   
   JR How many will we have? THere are 7 P-R checkpoints. Another
   apporach - I broke mine into different types of alternate content.
     * short descriptive
     * short function
     * longer description
     * metadata
     * alternate pages
     * etc
       
   For each of these I will leave references to WCAG, and some sample
   information. I had a heading called prompting - think about what the
   authoring tool needs to automate to get this done.
   
   GR I really liked the short functional text approach and emphasis on
   function rather than description.
   
   JR The difference can mean different types of information needs to be
   kept.
   
   CMN How do you find using WCAG
   
   JR I think it needs to be tightened up a lot, and that will mean
   changes
   
   CMN Yes. That will take time though - I think we will be able to keep
   up.
   
   JT The thing we want to get at is how to make sure you have done it in
   a tool
   
   JR There is a problem that you cannot use it as a step-by-step test -
   you have to go back to WCAG at that point, but they are not totally
   clear on everything that is needed.
   
   CMN Please take issues with WCAG to that working group.
   
   JR I think my text and Charles' can be complementary
   
   CMN It sounds like it would work as complementary (but I haven't read
   it yet.)
   
   JR I still have a lot of work to keep doing this.
   
   DB Heather Swayne is probably going to attend face to face, but no
   further news.
   
   WL First thing that came up is whether what Jan was talking about
   deals with authoring tools rather than the act of authoring. As to
   standing back one thing that comes up is whether the techniques
   document should be more than examples from the real world
   
   JT I think there need to be possible implementations as well.
   
   WL I started writing something of a long view as to how this fits into
   accessibility.
   
   GR I sent out some other techniques stuff. I have some stuff i have
   been working on - how do you want them?
   
   CMN Attach them or include them as a message to the list.
   
   JR What kind of templates
   
   GR Frameset, etc.
   
   JT I went over ERT document. It basicaly covers 4.1 and 4.2, and it
   also provides some material for 4.4 and 4.5. There are nice
   discussions about how to deal with author intervention. The question
   is how to incorporate it
   
   CMN Perhaps we just say this is the set of techniques, and link to it.
   
   JR I would agree with that.
   
   JT Yes, that would make sense.
   
   WL I am leaning to deferring lots of techniques to ERT.
   
   JT It can serve as pieces for 4.4 and 4.5, but for the rest we need
   text.
   
   CMN I think Bill's point about pointing to existing things is good - I
   would like to have a lot of them
   
   JT I think sample implementations are extremely important.
   
   CMN I would like to produce a new draft of the techniques in the next
   week, just so we can see if we are going in a sensible direction. So
   please put stuff up as proposals for pieces of the techniques
   document.
   
   GR Don't think I can get stuff up by Friday
   
   JR I will try to shape some stuff out but probably not friday
   
   DB Not just days.
   
   CMN How about Tuesday?
   
   /* should be able to have some of them as examples */
   
   JT We will have some examples from courseware tools - that should be
   done by friday. We are going to need implementation test examples.
