Phill, we're finished now. I will investigate the bridge problems - seems
that there have been a few poeple having them, so if anyone else can add
symptoms to the information pool....

Another possiblity for brailling is running on a line-mode browser. We could
ask the WCAG and ERT groups to evaluate the templates for us, too.

But I think the basic requirements seem sound. Note that passing Bobby has to
be substantially human-tested, and really means being level-A (if I recall
correctly - maybe it is double-A) compliant with WCAG.

Cheers

  I have tried 3 time to call in - all circuits are busy message is all I
  get!  Sounds like a Boston area phone problem.  I'll try again in a few
  minutes to see if the circuits are available.
  
  I have a rough draft of an accessible template.
  
  Some things I wanted to discuss is the scope of the template:
  In priority order:
  1. Must look good, sound good, Braille good, and print good:
       "Look good" means it looks good on Nav4, IE4, IE5, and Opera
       "Sound good" on IBM Home Page Reader and PW WebSpeak
       "Braille good" on JFW 3.5? on Windows w/Braille display
       "print good" means ?
  2. Should pass BOBBY.
  3. Should be valid code.

  Phill Jenkins
  
  
  
  
  To be more specific we will review progress on action items agreed to last
  week and assess what additional action items are needed. The action items
  were:
  
  Phil and Greg: Accessible Templates
  Jan: Techniques to meet several checkpoints at once
  Dick and others at Microsoft: actual implementation examples
  Charles: Relative priority checkpoints
  William: The hundred mile view
  Jan: illustrations of existing implementations
  Jutta and ATRC staff: example implementations in courseware tools and ER
  imports
