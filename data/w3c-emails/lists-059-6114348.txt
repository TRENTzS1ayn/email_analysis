Please comment on my new prioritized goals for templates:

1. Must pass WCAG AAA
2. Must look good, sound good, Braille good, and print good:
     "Look good" means it looks good on Nav4, IE4, IE5, and Opera
     "Sound good" on IBM Home Page Reader and PW WebSpeak
     "Braille good" on latest screen readers w/Braille display
     "print good" means ? [dare I say pdf]
3. Should pass BOBBY.
4. Should be valid code
