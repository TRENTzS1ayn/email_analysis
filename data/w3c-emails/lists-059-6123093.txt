If it passes WCAG AAA then it doesn't need to pass Bobby...

I presume you are not talking about producing PDF templates. I would suggest
for print good that it comes out as well as common sites around (pick a few
from your bookmarks list). There is a printCSS implementation in Amaya, if
anyone wants to test it out.

  Please comment on my new prioritized goals for templates:
  
  1. Must pass WCAG AAA
  2. Must look good, sound good, Braille good, and print good:
       "Look good" means it looks good on Nav4, IE4, IE5, and Opera
       "Sound good" on IBM Home Page Reader and PW WebSpeak
       "Braille good" on latest screen readers w/Braille display
       "print good" means ? [dare I say pdf]
  3. Should pass BOBBY.
  4. Should be valid code
