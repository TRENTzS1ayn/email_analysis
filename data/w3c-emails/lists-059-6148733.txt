Gregory and working group members:

I have almost finished cleaning up two templates drafts and I would be
interested in your comments on the design scope:

1 is a Frameset including 4 frames:
     top banner and top site navigation,
     left side detail navigation,
     right side main content,
     bottom banner and secondary site navigation

2. Secondary pages with design elements from number 1:
     same top banner and top site navigation,
      main content includes:
          form page,
          data table, chart, D-link and longdesc page,
          multimedia clip page.
     animated advertising image,
     good navigation around each page,
     bottom banner and secondary site navigation.

a.  Top site navigation would cover the organization's site wide level
links like home, products, about them, events, worldwide [other natural
languages version of the site],  etc.
b.  Bottom navigation would cover the organization's site wide secondary
level links like legal and copyrights, contact and feedback, notices, etc.
c.  Detail navigation would cover navigating around the specific area of
the site, for example, the specific products links such as overview, how to
buy, downloads, tutorials, support, site map, etc.
d. Good navigation around each page would cover top, Table of Contents,
skip navigation links, related topics, etc.

Regards,
Phill Jenkins
