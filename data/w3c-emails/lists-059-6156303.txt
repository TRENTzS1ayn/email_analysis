aloha, phil!

since i am tasked with the same action item (preparing sample templates), i 
would prioritize the goals for such templates as follows:

1. Must contain only valid code (P1)

2. Must be Triple-A conformant to WCAG (P1)

3. Should look good, sound good, feel good, Braille well, and print well: (P2)

3A. "Look good" means it looks good on Nav4, IE4, IE5, and Opera

3B "Sound good" both with self-voicing browsers, such as Home Page Reader 
or WebSpeak, or in conjunction with a screen reader

3C. "Feel good" on a refreshable Braille display

3D. "Braille well" when output to an embosser

3E. personally, i'm not sure about "print well"  unless you mean to 
encourage use of the CSS media selector "@media print"

4. Must be capable of passing an evaluation and repair tool's tests (tools 
include, BOBBY, A-Prompt, and HTML Tidy) (P1)
