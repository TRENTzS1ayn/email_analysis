Seems to me that "print good" means, at a minimum:

+takes into account that there are a wide variety of paper sizes
used around the world (eg US letter and A4);
+actually prints on the page (ie no fixed width tables that run off
the side);
+actually appears on the page (ie no white text on black background,
that is invisible on white paper);
+... I'm sure that there are others that drive you crazy.

Now how do we capture that in a simple phrase?
