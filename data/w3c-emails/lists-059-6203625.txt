>  Please comment on my new prioritized goals for templates:
>  
>  1. Must pass WCAG AAA
>  2. Must look good, sound good, Braille good, and print good:
>       "Look good" means it looks good on Nav4, IE4, IE5, and Opera
>       "Sound good" on IBM Home Page Reader and PW WebSpeak
>       "Braille good" on latest screen readers w/Braille display
>       "print good" means ? [dare I say pdf]
>  3. Should pass BOBBY.
>  4. Should be valid code

Suggestion.
Markup in XML.
XSLT to HTML, strict 4 dtd. 
(optional) to HTML targetted at HPR and Webspeak,
though I know they are good with good html.
XSLT to plain ASCII for braille displays, with good para and line breaks.
XSL to pdf for good print.
Validate with whatever in the DTD of choice.

First time I've heard a statement of intent for
multi media output on WAI. We are getting there.
