A template that did this would be great. But for the moment we will also need
plain boring HTML templates, since ther are a lot of authors who aren't going
to accept cutting out people who don't have XSLT, and don't have sufficient
control over their servers to do it server-side. (And a lot of developers who
won't credit their customers with the intellect to do that anyway. Presumably
because there are a lot of customers who will say it is too complex and they
just want something they can cut and paste text into and "publish".)

  Suggestion.
  Markup in XML.
  XSLT to HTML, strict 4 dtd. 
  (optional) to HTML targetted at HPR and Webspeak,
  though I know they are good with good html.
  XSLT to plain ASCII for braille displays, with good para and line breaks.
  XSL to pdf for good print.
  Validate with whatever in the DTD of choice.
  
  First time I've heard a statement of intent for
  multi media output on WAI. We are getting there.
