I have put a couple of pages nad the associated CSS stylesheet online at
http://www.w3.org/2000/02/atag-templates/cmnMain and 
http://www.w3.org/2000/02/atag-templates/cmnNews and 
http://www.w3.org/2000/02/atag-templates/cmnStyle

I think we should actually turn the templates over to ER and WCAG for
review of content accessibility, since they are the experts. We may like to
also offer them to IG for review.

If anyone else has templates (or other documents to put online) you can send
them all to the list as MIME-encoded attachments and they will be archived
(make sure that if they refer to a stylesheet it is available - there is a
horrendous Netscape bug that makes things inaccessible otherwise) or you can
contact me and I will ensure that you can write them into the scratch spaces
I have set up.

Cheers
