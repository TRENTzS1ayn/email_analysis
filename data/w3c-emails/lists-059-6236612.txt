Folks,

I am planning to make a new draft of the Techniques document available on
Tuesday for people to get a feel for where it is heading. Please note that
this is a working draft, and nothing in it need e final or perfect - the goal
is to get a sense of how we think the techniques document might work in a
revised edition.

In order to get as much idea as possible, please send everything you have
done, completed or not, to the list on Monday.

Cheers

Charles McCN
