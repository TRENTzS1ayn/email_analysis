  Folks,
  
  I am planning to make a new draft of the Techniques document available on
  Tuesday for people to get a feel for where it is heading. Please note that
  this is a working draft, and nothing in it need e final or perfect - the goal
  is to get a sense of how we think the techniques document might work in a
  revised edition.
  
  In order to get as much idea as possible, please send everything you have
  done, completed or not, to the list on Monday.
  
  Cheers
  
  Charles McCN
