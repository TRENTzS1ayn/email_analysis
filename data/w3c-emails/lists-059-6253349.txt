I hav done a basic evaluation of Dreamweaver 1.0. I skipped a couple of
things after it was clear that they would not affect the conformance level
achieved (none, although there are some promising signs). It is linked form
the reviews page at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/reviews so if anybody wants to
look at it, or do a better job, or do a review of the most recent version, it
would be very welcome.

Cheers
