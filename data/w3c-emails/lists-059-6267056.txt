It will involve a little bit of effort to organise the metings moving to
thursday. It may be easier to arrange for Tuesday at 2pm - does that time
suit people better or worse than 

  a) Thursday at noon
  b) Wednesday at 4pm

(boston times)

(For me the thursday is best, tuesday is second best, and wednesday is a
distant third.)
