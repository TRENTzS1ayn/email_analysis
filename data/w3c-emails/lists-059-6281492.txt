aloha, charles!

my order of preference:

1. Thursday at 12pm U.S. EST
2. Wednesday at 4pm U.S. EST

and, as things stand now, i wouldn't be able to attend regularly (if at 
all) on tuesdays, as tuesday is the one day during the week that is (at 
least on my calendar) unsullied by a teleconference of any kind, so it is 
the day i have reserved for visiting physicians, getting acupuncture, and 
performing other things that one can't quite do whilst grafted to a 
telephone, nor whilst trapped in one's apartment waiting for the next 
telecon to roll around, nor online...

gregory.
