Hello all,

Last night I accidentally sent the new draft of my alternate equivalents
techniques piece to Charles only.  I have attached it here.  There is
one html document and a number of illustrative images. The piece is
still rough with only a short description of the images appearing  above
them, as well as some ALT text.


Cheers,
Jan
