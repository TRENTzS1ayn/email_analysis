Thanks Jan

Having short descriptions in text is fine. One of the questions we will end
up with is whether to use longdescs, d-links, or just describe images in the 
document text.

Having something that may not be complete will still allow us to include it
and get a feel for how the techniqeus document is developing, which is fairly
important. Anyone else who has some stuff, please send it along. In fact I am
not going to do the work until the end of the US east coast day today, so you
have a few hours.

Cheers

Charles

  Hello all,
  
  Last night I accidentally sent the new draft of my alternate equivalents
  techniques piece to Charles only.  I have attached it here.  There is
  one html document and a number of illustrative images. The piece is
  still rough with only a short description of the images appearing  above
  them, as well as some ALT text.
  
  
  Cheers,
  Jan
