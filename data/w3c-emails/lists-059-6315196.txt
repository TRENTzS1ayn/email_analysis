Folks,

the following article is about 136 companies who have headquarters in the US,
do web design for at least one fortune 500 company, and answered a survey
completely.

http://www.internetworldnews.com/article_bot.asp?inc=110199/WDS/11.01WDS1&issue=11.01

(Kynn, does the HTML Writers' Guild have similar information for its
membership? I realise they are largely a different market segment, but there
are also a lot more mebers, and they are a better international
representation than "companies with headquarters in the US. It would be very
interesting data to collect...)

There are (at least) three images of data on the page. The first one is a bar
graph of which authoring tools are used, with the data as follows:

BareBones BBEdit: 42.6%
Allaire HomeSite 52.9%
Developed in-house 15.4%
Other  10.3%
Microsoft FrontPage 22.8%
Macromedia DreamWeaver 41.2%
Microsoft Visual InterDev 19.1%
NetObjects Fusion 8.1%
Adobe PageMill 4.4%
Adobe GoLive 11.0%
SoftQuad HotMetal Pro 2.9%
Sausage Software HotDog 4.4%
Adobe SiteMill 5.1%

The interesting thing about this (other than the fact that it adds up to
about 230% - I assume people are using multiple tools) is the predominance of
source-editing tools. Of course what is not mentioned is what cominations are
used.

The second is a pie chart showing how much they charge ( < $100k about 40%,
100-500k about 40%, more than 2M a few % ) for a first website for a fortune
500.

The third is a pie chart showing what platform they use. 
Windows NT 36%
Macintosh 28.7%
Windows 9x 22.8%
Other 8.1%
Unix 3.7%
No answer 0.7% (I think out of 136 participants that means one.)

Cheers

Charles McCN
