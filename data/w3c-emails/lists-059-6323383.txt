4pm Boston, +1.617.252.7000

A couple of items for the Agenda:

+ New Techniques draft (if I get it out in time for people to have read
it). I note that at the moment only Jan, Gregory and I have proposed
techniques, and Bill has proposed some introductory material. If we are to
have a new public draft we need to offer it first to the WAI-IG for review,
which means it will be difficult to get it published before our Face to face
meeting.

+ Next face to face meeting (as in after this one). Any suggestions? How many
people will be in Amsterdam before WWW9 (or will be there during the
conference - perhaps we should organise an informal meeting there)?

+ Conformance evaluations - it would be good if we had a process for inviting
developers to review conformance evaluations. Often they can point out
errors, or features in the tool that are poorly documented (and can fix that)

Anyone else lhave anything for the agenda (or the tchniques document?)
