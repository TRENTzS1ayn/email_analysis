Thanks Wendy.

From the perspective of AU, having a first public working draft will help us
to give it a fixed position in the Techniques document. We had hoped to have
a new version of that published in the next couple of weeks, so further
review time for the first draft is probably not as valuable to us as having
it published. (But I have not yet discussed that with the working group).

Cheers

  The latest ERT is always available from: http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/
  
  The earliest that I think we can release a public working draft is 28 March.
  
  Here's the timeline I think we are working under:
  1. I will release a new working draft later today.
  2. The group should review the draft in its entirety Wednesday through 
  monday 13 March.
  3. We ought to discuss it at our 13 March meeting and decide to invite 
  others to review.
  4. If all is well, on Monday or Tuesday (13 or 14 March) we will invite IG, 
  AU, and WCAG to review for 2 weeks.
  5. We ought to discuss comments from IG, AU, and WCAG at our 20 and 27 
  March meeting.
  6. If all is well, we will release a public working draft on 28 March.
  
  I will not be able to attend the 27 March meeting as I will be traveling 
  home from CSUN.  I will also not be able to attend the 20 March meeting as 
  I will be attending the WCAG face2face meeting in L.A.  I don't think that 
  has to put a damper on our plans.
  
  Perhaps we give people 3 weeks to review instead?
  
  thoughts?
