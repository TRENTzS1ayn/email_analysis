aloha, charles!

i will be in amsterdam from at least the ninth (for the ER meetings on the 
tenth and eleventh) and through at least the nineteenth -- and probably a 
bit longer -- so i would definitely be interested in meeting sometime in or 
around WWW9

oh, and since the call is for an hour and a half, i'll have to drop off 
early, as i have a VICUG NYC executive committee meeting at 5pm EST

gregory.
