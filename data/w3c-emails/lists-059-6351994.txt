Please look over this and see if you think we are on the right track. I would
like to be able to send this to the Interest Group for review by Friday (with
more content if people have it) in order to meet our original goal of having
a new version of the NOTE available by CSUN.

That images require alternative text and usually a long description as well.
I have not been able to properly provide alt/longdesc, with the result that
the current draft may be held to fail level-A WCAG conformance, which is a
pretty pathetic effort.
