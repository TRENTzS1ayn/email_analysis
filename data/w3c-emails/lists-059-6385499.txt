I don't like the idea of sub-checkpoints. If you know what you
want specifically for conformance, create a checkpoint for it. If you
don't really know what you want, leave the checkpoint vague and clarify
in the techniques document. The ATAG 1.0 has few checkpoints and they
are high level. If more concrete checkpoints are required, add them as
first-class checkpoints. 

If a checkpoint is so high level as to not be useful, make it a
Guideline.

If possible, I would like all the guidelines to use the same model:
guidelines/checkpoints/techniques. I don't know what a level
of subcheckpoints adds. It may confuse readers further.

Up to now, I was under the impression that people wanted everything
in one document (e.g., sample information is available in the techniques
document and in separate documents). You might split along the following
lines:

 - General techniques, list of resources, links to other techniques
documents
   (this would be the "main" techniques document).
 - Content techniques
 - User interface techniques
 - Sample implementations
