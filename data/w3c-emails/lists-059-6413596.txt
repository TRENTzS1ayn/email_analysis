Ian,

Sub-checkpoints is possibly a misnomer, in conversations I've had with
potential implementors of the checkpoints, they frequently ask "what is
meant by this for my application, can you be more specific?" The goal for
the guidelines was that they have good longevity, that we don't need to
change or update them every six months. Therefore they needed to be
somewhat independent of present technologies. The techniques are a
technical note and are therefore much easier to update. So the criteria I
described would explain " what does this mean right now in a practical
sense with the technologies under development." It would also be more
explicit for people who don't have the context or the background
information needed to fully understand the intent of the checkpoint. The
criteria would not add new requirements or even new information, they would
simply be more explicit.
