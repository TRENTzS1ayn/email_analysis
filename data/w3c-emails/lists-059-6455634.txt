aloha, charles!

as recorded in the minutes for today's telecon,
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/meetings/8mar00

you stated, in my response to the suggestion that the final draft of 
conformance reviews are passed by the manufacturer

quote
CMN I think the reviews are useful, but I don't want to avoid publishing in 
case someone doesn't like it - evaluation and criticism is a common 
activity everywhere except police states, but developers can often provide 
further information, or even make improvements.

what i meant was that the manufacturer would be pointed to the draft, asked 
to comment on it, and have a deadline in which to do so...  any factual 
errors would be corrected before the draft was finalized, and any 
additional comments from the manufacturer would be incorporated into an 
appendix...

that way, the manufacturer is made part of the loop, but the turning of the 
loop isn't dependent upon the manufacturer...

still, i do like phil's idea of getting online reviewers to consider ATAG 
as a criterion for their reviews -- is this something we could possibly get 
EO to assist us with?
