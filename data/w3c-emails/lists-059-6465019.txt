  as recorded in the minutes for today's telecon,
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/meetings/8mar00
  
  you stated, in my response to the suggestion that the final draft of 
  conformance reviews are passed by the manufacturer
  
  quote
  CMN I think the reviews are useful, but I don't want to avoid publishing in 
  case someone doesn't like it - evaluation and criticism is a common 
  activity everywhere except police states, but developers can often provide 
  further information, or even make improvements.

  what i meant was that the manufacturer would be pointed to the draft, asked 
  to comment on it, and have a deadline in which to do so...  any factual 
  errors would be corrected before the draft was finalized, and any 
  additional comments from the manufacturer would be incorporated into an 
  appendix...
  
  that way, the manufacturer is made part of the loop, but the turning of the 
  loop isn't dependent upon the manufacturer...
  
  still, i do like phil's idea of getting online reviewers to consider ATAG 
  as a criterion for their reviews -- is this something we could possibly get 
  EO to assist us with?
