What we can gain is the ability to have a level of abstraction that makes the
guidelines applicable to a broad range of tools (by comparison to WCAG/UUAG
which are relatively heavily focussed on HTML in a desktop environment)

At any level, the details of how to satisfy the requirements for a particular
technology are going to be much more fluid than the requirements themselves.
However, providing techniques that will satisfy the checkpoints (or an
identified subset of them for a given technique) without being the only
possible satisfaction seems valuable.

  If a checkpoint is so high level as to not be useful, make it a

  If possible, I would like all the guidelines to use the same model:
  guidelines/checkpoints/techniques. I don't know what a level
  of subcheckpoints adds. It may confuse readers further.
