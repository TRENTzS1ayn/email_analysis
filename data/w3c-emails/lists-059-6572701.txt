Up to now the decision of the working group has been that we want everything
in one document. The benefit of having a Techniques note and a continuous
process is that we can change that decision if it no longer serves the
purpose.

I would propose that the primary way of spliting should be by the technology
addressed - most producers of image editing software are not going to care a
lot about HTML source editing software, and vice versa (although there are
some places in the guidelines where these two things have the same
requirements and interacting techniques, such as management of alternative
content).

  lines:
  
   - General techniques, list of resources, links to other techniques
  documents
     (this would be the "main" techniques document).
   - Content techniques
   - User interface techniques
   - Sample implementations
