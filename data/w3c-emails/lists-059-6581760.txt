CMcCN:: "...the primary way of spliting should be by the technology
addressed..."

WL: Does the "technology addressed" shift? "Save as HTML" considerations
might be addressing anything. Since the developer of an SVG tool might
be making something to present text (Heaven forbid!) or the designer of
a tool to enable a site to publish songs with animated illustrations
could use SMIL/other technologies the division might prove difficult. If
we are dividing to make the book weigh less or be less daunting then
let's discuss it at greater length because there may be benefit in
presenting stuff to an HTML-editor developer that she might not make
immediate use of but which would elucidate the overall problem for.
There should be a way to decide which "divisions" to make and permit a
filter of some kind to enable the ATAG user to select only those she
deems appropriate?
