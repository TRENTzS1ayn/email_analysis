Hmmm. You're quite right. I advocate using map. I am not sure if I will still
have to use the DIV-based classes to get around browser bugs - I'll have a
play with it and see what I learn.

Thanks for the feedback

  Charles,
  I noticed the template
  (http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WAI-AUTOOLS-TECHS/templates/cmnMain.html) does
  not use the MAP element to indicate the navigation bar, but instead it uses
  a DIV with a CLASS="navbar".  In the past you have argued that this was the
  wrong technique, that MAP was the most appropriate markup, even though MAP
  did not render ALT text in main stream browsers like Explorer and Navigator
  when images were turned off.  
  
  Are you now advocating for using CLASS="navbar" or do you think MAP is
  still the right technique?
