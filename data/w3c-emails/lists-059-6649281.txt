Rick,

The process of converting inaccessible HTML to accessible HTML can't be 100%
automated. It will require some human intervention to make decisions.

"A-Prompt" is a tool under development that tries to automate the process as
much as possible. For more info, check out the A-Prompt site:

Regards,
Chris
