---------- Forwarded message ----------

Feel free to pass this along to anyone appropriate:

My name is Colin Birge, and I'm the new program manager for accessibility
within Microsoft Office.  I'm working closely with Heather Swayne to define
the position and its role.  This is a very new role for me -- I don't even
have my office yet! -- and so I'll be doing more listening than talking at
the upcoming meeting.  I appreciate your patience.
