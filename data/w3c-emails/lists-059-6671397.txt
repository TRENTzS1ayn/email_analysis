I will probably not be able to make the meeting tomorrow/today.

A reminder that there is no meeting next week, becuase we will be meeting fae
to face at CSUN (well, most of us will. If you can't make it, please send
your input to the list early to get a chance for debate).

If you are planning to come to CSUN and have not registered, please do so
urgently. Registration will close this Friday. See the Home page for meetings
an agenda details.

CHeers
