Rich,

as well as Aprompt there are other tools which will help an author meet the
requirements. Some of the requirements are things which cannot be fully
automated (for example, a computer is generaly bad at describing the function
of an image within a page, or describing a complex image).

There are authoring tools such as HoTMetaL and HotDog 6.0 that provide
support for authors to make content accessible. The working group would like
to hear of any that you find particularly good, and if possible have reviews
of them.

There sare also a number of authoring tools where it is possible to make
content acessible so long as you are aware of the requirements. There are
unfortunately some where even this is very difficult or impossible.

Regards

Charles McCathieNevile

  A question:
  Are there any tools available to web authors that will take web page code and
  make it "accessible" to those with disabilites, such that it meets the W3C
  requirements?  Meaning, are there any tools that automate the process of meeting
  these guidelines?
  Thanks,
