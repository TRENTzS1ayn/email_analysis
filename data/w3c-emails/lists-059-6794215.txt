Hi Marjolein,

hope you had a good time in Boston - it's a long way to go otherwise *grin*.

A lot of the group is at the CSUN conference (including me) and replies might
be slow this week. I'll have a look through and try to get some
response/ideas back in reasonable time, but if anyone else can beat me to it
it would be a good thing (TM, Pat. Pend., ...)

Thanks for the feedback. This is what we need to get the document more useful
to the people it is supposed to help.

Did you look at the referenced documents, which in many cases are the
applicable standards and conventions?

cheers

Charles

  Last week I visited Allaire for the first time, and met many people I'd known so far only by email.
