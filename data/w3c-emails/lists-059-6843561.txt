Normal time and place - 4pm US eastern time, phone +1.617.258.7000

I hope I will be able to get an agenda online later today, but there are a
few issues arising from the face to face such as confirming what we want in a
charter ('cos we need to do that), when we would like to change our
teleconference time and what suits people and what we can get (mostly list
stuff but we can mention it) and some real content and relationship to other
groups and conformance evaluation issues

Regrets to the list as always please

cheers

Charles
