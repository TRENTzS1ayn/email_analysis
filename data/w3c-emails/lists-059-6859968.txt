Forgive the dumb question but I have trouble working out the time difference now. As of last weekend, we're on "Summer time" (Daylight savings time?) - we moved the clock one hour ahead in the Netherlands (and most of Europe).

Same in Boston - or is there a 7-hour difference now instead of 6 hours?

Cheers,
