There is a joint meeting for Tuesday July 11, 2:30 pm Boston time (1:30pm US
central, 11:30 US West Coast, 4:30 am Melbourne, 8:30 pm Western Europe, and
so on for your particular area)

Karl Dubost, the W3C conformance manager (who begun work on Monday) has
agreed to join us for the call, so one of the major agenda items will be to
discuss what the two groups are doing with conformance testing and what Karl
is thinking about (his role is brand new for W3C).

An agenda will be published shortly at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/meetings/11jul00 - if there are other agenda items
(AERT is also on the agenda) please post them to at least one of the lists.

cheers

Charles McCN

for Jutta and Len and Wendy and Daniel and anyone else who is responsible for
all this too.
