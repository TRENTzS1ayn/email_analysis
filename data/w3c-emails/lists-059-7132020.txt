This definition appears to be going back to the idea that the user must
dismiss a dialog in order for the recommendation to be achieved.  I disagree
with this definition of prompt.

Proposal number whatever, fulfilling my action item from the last meeting.

Prompt:

In this document prompt means to suggest, urge, encourage. Prompting does
not
depend on the author to initiate it, but it is intiated by the tool,
although
it may be user-configurable.

Prompting is more than checking, automatically correcting, or making
documentation available as required in checkpoints for guidelines 4, 5 and
6.
It requires some kind of response (minimally, dismissing the prompt)
although
required prompting may be satisfied as one of several questions asked of the
author at the same time, provided the required prompt is clear and obvious.

Note that this definition may not be the meaning first associated with the
term "prompt" in software development.
