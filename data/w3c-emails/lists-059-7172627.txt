http://www.siliconvalleydigitaldivide.net/index.html exemplifies one of
the things I just posted about: how much easier it is to propose than to
produce. The key phrase on this "major looking" effort is at the bottom
- "Funded by the Packard Foundation, this site will grow into a "Network
of Networks" for all of the organizations and individuals working as
regional stewards of Silicon Valley's future."

Also the heading "The Internet Portal to events, activities and efforts
for bridging the Digital Divide in Silicon Valley" (which incidentally
isn't even text!) joins the footing under a general category sometimes
called "bullshit".

I wish this were a satirical Website so I could laugh instead of
cry/rage over it.
