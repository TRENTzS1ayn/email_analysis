I wanted to let working group members know that I no longer will take part
in AU conference calls on a regular basis. Heather Swayne is taking the lead
for Microsoft, which is a good thing for the group because she works with
the Office team.

I'll be on hand for any call that Heather can't make, and also for joint
calls with the ER group. In addition to ER, I'll continue being a part of
the Content working group and will be a backup to Tim Lacy in the UA group.
