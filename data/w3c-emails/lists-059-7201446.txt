I think a face-to-face is a good idea and have no problems with either of
the dates suggested.

There have been a couple of possiblities raised:

Ottawa, 5 or 6 October (This depends on a number of other W3C timing issues)
Nashville, mid october

How do people feel about either of these? Are we ready for a meeting,
overdue
for one, nowhere near it? Are these good locations, or does someone have
another proposal (offer of hosting...)
