We have a meeting this afternoon - +1.617.252.7000

Agenda question  is whether we are going to have a face to face meeting and
where. Reminder that since W3C process requires 8 weeks notice of meetings we
need to get this organised pretty quickly if we are looking at October - so
we need dates, places, and hosts.

Also, we welcome Matthias Mueller-Prove from the Adobe GoLive team (the ue
should be a u-umlaut, but I don't have that in this keyboard setup) to the
working group. People who were at the face to face in Amsterdam will have
met Matthias already.

I will also briefly discuss the move to database-backing for the reviews
page, and when we can expect a testing document draft (soon I hope :-)

Please send regrets to the list.

cheers

Charles
