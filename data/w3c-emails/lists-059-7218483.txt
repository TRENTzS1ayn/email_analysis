Hi Charles,
on your new PowerBook press Option-U followed by another 'u'. This 
enteres a '?'.

Hello everybody,
talk you soon,
Matthias

>Also, we welcome Matthias Mueller-Prove from the Adobe GoLive team (the ue
>should be a u-umlaut, but I don't have that in this keyboard setup) to the
>working group. People who were at the face to face in Amsterdam will have
>met Matthias already.
