As everyone should be aware, the WCAG group has started the process of a
revision to WCAG. As I understand it, this will eventually lead to a document
which has more ofr less the same requirements (unless there is some clear
need to change them, which they will be looking at) with more information on
non-HTML, and hopefully better adapted to the needs of users like ATAG. Which
means that at some point the techniques for relative priority, and the ways
of testing those checkpoints, will be simplified.

Until the new version is a Recommendation I think our techniques have to work
on the old one (since the guidelines refer to it) but it is a good idea if we
keep track of the development of the new, and where appropriate comment to
the WCAG group.

Note that one of the opportunities of our meeting in Bristol is to work with
the WCAG group on the new draft at this early stage.

Cheers

Charles

  2. Do we want to structure the evaluation process using the WCAG as 
  the primary order with the ATAG as the secondary order or the 
  reverse. The advantage of using the WCAG or a list of possible 
  element types as the primary order, is that we can skip the section 
  if the tool doesn't allow the authoring of that type of element. Or 
  do we want to generate a new order that anticipates the new WCAG.
