Hi there,
I'm a simple ordinary run of the mill web searcher.   I'm sure that people who know all the jargon understand what you mean but if I have to plough my way through all the various pieces I'm going to get disheartened and give up.   I'd like a simple easy to follow version of what to do and what to use (and what it does) to enable me to make my website user friendly to all disabled people.
Please help!!!!!!
