VMvE:: "I'd like a simple easy to follow version of what to do and what
to use (and what it does) to enable me to make my website user friendly
to all disabled people."

Everything is simple. Nothing is easy.

The delusion that most authoring tools provide is that you can just mock
up a site and put it through a magic scanner that converts it not only
to the arcane language of the Web, but makes it accessible. This just
isn't so.

As you do more of this stuff, just as when you first started to use a
computer then a word processor, then the internet, etc. the process is
one of learning and growth in which you begin befuddled (by acronymic
jargon) and become consulted by others who are starting up the path
you've taken.

As consumers you represent ask authoring tool vendors to provide ever
more accessibility using their products, the efforts of the developers
will begin (already have) showing up on the market. Meanwhile just keep
chasing links to arcane issues like HTML, CSS, XML, RDF, DOM, Dublin
Core, etc. persistently and joyfully. The brain aerobics alone will make
it worth your while.
