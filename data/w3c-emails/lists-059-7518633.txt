     As I feared, since I wasn't able to start the evaluation this week, I'm 
going to have to put it off indefinitely. I'd say "indefinitely" than "for 
good" because I would like to try to do it (or perhaps some other program) in 
the future. But some things have come up now that will preclude my doing the 
evaluation any time in the forseeable future.
     If it was a case of there not already being an evaluation (by Gregory) for 
HomeSite, I would've tried much harder to get it done. But with that, and the 
fact mine would've only been a partial evaluation (covering only the accessible 
writing capabilities, and not the accessibility of the program itself), I kept 
putting it aside as other stuff I had to see about came along. So I figure the 
best thing to do is request it be dropped as an official action item, and I'll 
just try to do it on my own when I can.
