Interactive things.

Add a form control.

Priority 1: 

Can you specify an explicit label? (1.1) 
 
Does the form work without scripts or applets (client-side) for processing?
(1.3, WCAG 6.3)

Is there a check for this? (4.1)

Is there help on how to fix it? (4.2)

Is it documented how to add a label to a control? How to group controls?
(6.1)

Can you edit all the properties of the control? (7.3)

Do template examples of forms work without scripts or applets? (1.4 and 3.3
WCAG 6.3)

Is the control validly coded? in a valid way? (2.2)



Priority 2:

Is it obvious how to the tasks for the P1 checkpoints? (5.2)

Is it done using the normal tool interface? (5.1)

Does the form control work according to W3C specifications  (2.1)

Are you prompted to add labels to form controls? (3.2, WCAG 12.4)

If there are scripts to handle the forms, do they have device-independent
triggers? (1.3 WCAG 6.4, 9.2, 9.3)

Are the above 3 features checked for? (4.1, WCAG as above)

Is there help to fix them? (4.2, WCAG as above)

Are they included in documentation (and examples)? (6.2)

Are they present in prepackaged examples / templates? (1.4, 3.3 WCAG as
above)

If there are scripts, does the tool preserve them where it doesn't recognise
them? (4.3)

Priority 3:

If the code does not conform to W3C specifications, does the tool inform
you? (2.3)

Notes: 

1. I have not included things that are listed "until user agents" from WCAG

2. 1.4 and 3.3 seem completely redundant with each other.

3. 4.4 seems to be covered by 4.1

I still need to look at scripts and applets. I have essentially only
considered an HTML (or perhaps Xforms) form control here.


Cheers

Charles
