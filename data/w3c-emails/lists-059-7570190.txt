So in terms of evaluation process (guideline 7 aside), it seems that the
question to be asked is something like:

Does the tool have either a means to detect and notify the author of
instances of markup being misued to convey structure (ex. FONT changes
used instead of header elements for headings) and suggest corrections or
at least allow the author to manually modify this misused markup? (ATAG
4.5)

(Most tools will pass this if they have notepad mode.)

Cheers,
Jan
