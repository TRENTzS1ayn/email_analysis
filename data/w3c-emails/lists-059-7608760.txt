Well, most tools allow the modification of markup if they have a source or
structure editing mode. But if it is only availabe in that way then they will
fail 5.2, and cannot get ot double-A until they provide something that
matches the rest of the tool operation (this of course doesn't apply to
Notepad itself - that fails many other checkpoints though).

The detection stuff is really a matter for AERT - authoring process
techniques are what we need to have techniques for. Does anyone recall the
beginning of teaching word-processing, in the late 70s and the 80s? Stuff
like using styles in authoring was a big topic then (as well as argumetns
about whether it was better to write everything and then clean it up, or
clean it as you went, or some combination... which I recall being a
discussion that was seeking a non-existent grail).

Cheers

  So in terms of evaluation process (guideline 7 aside), it seems that the
  question to be asked is something like:
  
  Does the tool have either a means to detect and notify the author of
  instances of markup being misued to convey structure (ex. FONT changes
  used instead of header elements for headings) and suggest corrections or
  at least allow the author to manually modify this misused markup? (ATAG
  4.5)
  
  (Most tools will pass this if they have notepad mode.)
