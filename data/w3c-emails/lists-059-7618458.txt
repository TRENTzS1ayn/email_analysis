Yeah, I know this is several days late, but hey, I tried to warn you guys. :-)
Part of the reason it's late is, I wanted re-read both the ATAG and WCAG 
documents in order to refresh myself with them. When I do things off the top of 
my head, I have a tendency to leave stuff out.
Having done this just a little while ago, I confirmed something I had noticed 
before in the WCAG doc. Most of the emphasis is on images, sounds, and such. 
Text itself has only a small section, and most of the checkpoints and 
techniques end up being related to other topics that others in the group are 
doing, such as style sheets, and tables. It seems that in order to meet the 
WCAG standards for text, all a tool needs to do is provide attributes that call 
CSS, allow use of the LANG attribute, and perhaps warn if using tables.
As to the ATAG doc, in regards to writing text, an authoring tool should meet 
the following guidelines:

All Checkpoints in Guidelines 1 and 2
Checkpoint 3.2
All of Guideline 4 (though I don't think it should "fail" if doesn't meet 4.4)
Checkpoint 5.2 (even though it is listed as Priority 2)
Checkpoint 6.1

All other Guidelines and Checkpoints I believe are outside the scope of my 
assignment, as is ALT text for images, sounds, movies, etc.
This kinda short, but as I said, when it comes to text, there really isn't 
much in the WCAG document.
