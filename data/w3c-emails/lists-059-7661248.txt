Jan, thanks for the minutes. (I read them on my new WAP phone. makes for an
interesting perspective - I haven't tried using it to author content yet, but
hopefully I will be able to do that by te f2f in Bristol.)

A couple more thoughts:

It would be good to lok at the checkpoints and see which of them are sinple
(i.e. there is one test to satisfy) and which are complex. For example, I
think that 7.6 "Allow the Author to search within editing views" is simple -
you just answer the question.

4.1 (and the other relative priority checkpoints), and 5.1 (ensure everything
is part of the look and feel) are complex - you need to test mutliple things.

But 1.1 is in between. For example, if you can edit source, you meet 1.1. If
you can't then you need to test for a number of different things that you can
do in HTML, or whatevber type of content the tool produces (this might be
easiest for image editors where there isn't much that can be done).

What I am wondering is how we determine what needs to be tested for a given
type of tool. Maybe by describing it and seeing if we agree.

Cheers

Charles
