Hello,

Here is the updated version of the image part.  I have added a number of
things:
1. Image map equivalent alternatives to the list of things the evaluator
needs to look for.
2. A section to explain what equivalent alternatives are.
3. Priority levels to the EAs and P1, P2 and P3 versions of the same
questions so that the relative checkpoints will work.

Have a good weekend,
Jan
