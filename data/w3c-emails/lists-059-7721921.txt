Hi folks.

Sorry not to be around much - I have had a major family problem. I am now at
the Hong Kong W3C/WAP meeting, so will probably not make the meeting
tomorrow, but would like to publish the information we have gathered for
testing this week, at least as a draft. I'll send a seperate note about
agendas and so on.

Charles
