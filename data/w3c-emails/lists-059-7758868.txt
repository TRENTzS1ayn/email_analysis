I have started my "review" process with Sausage Software's Hot Dog 6.1.
Because my initial impression is that I'm somewhat overwhelmed by what
they've done, I would like to start by urging that if any others on the list
are at all comfortable working on Web sites using what is essentially a
full-bore HTML editor, please download this thing as it's as if Charles'
talks with them produced a product that works pretty much as if it were
written by the ATAG WG.

I have only scratched the surface, but so far it's remarkable. I have the
same feelings I do about Bobby, there's a lot of "prompts" that seem a bit
much, e.g. every instance in which <ACCESSKEY>, <LONGDESC>, <TABINDEX>, or
<NAME> isn't used gets flagged and this is a pretty full list since most of
these are in my experience rarely used and sometimes not supported by
browsers. There's a structure view and I have no way of knowing if it or
other stuff works with screen reader, but it's there.

Lots of stuff in the help file (don't yet know if it's only in the special
"accessibility" section?) and quite on the mark about reasons for doing all
this.

Sorry not to have formal points but I've just started on it and I found it
"intense" enough to warrant recommending that if you are able to use this
sort of editor (it has no wysiwyg editing facility in this version) in which
you must view the results and not edit in that view, download it from
