Hi All,

I think I am pretty satisfied with my draft of the Images (including
Image Maps) part of the Evaluation Procedure.  However, I would like to
see how the format extends to some of the other sections.

Charles: Can you send me the complete list of sections (multimedia,
text, styling, etc.)

Which of the these are taken already?

Cheers,
Jan
