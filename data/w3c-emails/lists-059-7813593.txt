I'm not sure who posted the issue:

>Are applets being considered as multimedia?

I would like to recommend that "interactive multimedia", which is
multimedia that has hot spots that can be selected, receive focus, etc. be
considered in a separate area - such as "interactive multimedia".   Since
not all applets employ multimedia clips I don't think of applets as being
considered multimedia.  Multimedia (video and audio) is or can be added to
applets to end up with interactive multimedia, while from the other point
of view there are existing multimedia clips that are enhanced with
programming behind it to end up with interactive multimedia.

Also, the role of the user agent and/or special plug-in and/or "player" for
that multimedia type needs to be considered.
