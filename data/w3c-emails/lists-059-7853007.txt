Hello,

I'm one of the staff contacts for the HTML Working Group, so I will clarify
the issues.

Unfortunately there's a bunch of editorial errors in this appendix.
I have pointed them out [1] and those errors will be fixed in the
next edition.

This is editorial error, and actually those are not dropped, as
pointed out by [1].

After long discussion, the object element has finally been included
in XHTML 1.1.  Steven Pemberton, the chair of the HTML WG, posted
the clarification to the www-html list [2].

Note that the HTML WG is committed to re-engineer the object inclusion
mechanism in XHTML 2.0.
