Hi,

I have made a pretty major change to the images evaluation draft.

I have broken up the document by adding evaluator instructions (such as
"Insert an image") after which, the questions related to that action are
listed by priority (rather than having the main grouping be by
priority).

So the breakdown would now be:
1. Major functional area (images, multimedia, etc.)
2. Functional task(inserting an image, editing text properties)
3. Priority level

I have also taken out the P2 relative items since there are no P2
equivalent alternatives.

Also, the second section, relating to image editors, is not converted
yet.  I want to get feedback first.

Cheers,
Jan
