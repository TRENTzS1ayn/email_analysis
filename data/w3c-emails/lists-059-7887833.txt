Jan,

I like the way you have chopped up the document - this seems like a good
model to work with.

I think we should take the test files out of the document and have them as
linked test cases, but I will do this when I put this together with the other
things that we have.

Also, I am not sure that a percentage result is very useful, since the same
score can apply to tools that are very different.

I am thinking that it would be good to split this also into stuff that is
essentially help information (definitions, technology-specific
information) and stuff that is evaluation procedures.

cheers - keep up the good work

Charles
