Hi folks.

The workshop has now finished, but a lot of what went on is interesting to us
I think. In particular there was interest in work on single-authoring for
multi-modal environments - essentially what we are involved in - and on
integrating small devices and voice interfaces, and what that means in terms
of authoring.

There will be another workshop on similar topics in Bristol just before our
meeting there - it may be worth attending that if people can. (I believe some
people are already signed up for it). That workshop will be even more
focussed on authoring...

I would like to talk about the Hong Kong workshop at the next au
meeting. (action me put it on the agenda ;-)

cheers

Charles
