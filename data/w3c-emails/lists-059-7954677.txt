Folks, there is a proposal to have a general meeting of working groups for
three days in february, in Boston. It owuld provide an opportunity for face
to face meetings, and also for spending time with other groups or group
members to look at inter-group coordination issues.

How many people would be interested in this possibility for a face to face
meeting, and to talk to people from other groups (assumng that they are going
to be there too)?

What kind of format would be useful? (ordinary WG meetings, presentations by
WGs, informal meeting time, plenary session, other...)

I would like to discuss this at the next meeting on Tuesday.

Cheers

Charles
