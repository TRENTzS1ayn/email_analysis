Subject: W3C Workshop Bristol hotel reminder

This is a reminder to all registrants for the W3C Web Device Independent
Authoring Workshop to be held in Bristol UK, 3/4 October. A limited
number of rooms are reserved at the following two hotels until the
deadline shown:

Bristol Marriott Royal Hotel:11 September
Posthouse Forte:25 September

It can be difficult to find accomodation in the Bristol area at short
notice, so it would be advantageous if you could make your reservations
in plenty of time.

For further details see the workshop web page at:
