I have had a preliminary look at this work, but it would be interesting to
evaluate it as an authoring tool (conversion really). It is designed to make
text versions of SVG graphics.

With the summer over, I'm happy to release the work on a student we
had here in Sophia, working on an SVG-to-text converter, using RDF
statements to help with the inherent graphical semantics.
