                         INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
  UNIVERSAL ACCESS IN THE INFORMATION SOCIETY

                               Published by Springer

                             1st Issue: February 2001

Universal Access in the Information Society (UAIS) is an international,
interdisciplinary refereed journal that solicits original research contributions
addressing the accessibility, usability, and, ultimately, acceptability of
Information Society Technologies by anyone, anywhere, at anytime, and through
any media and device. The journal publishes research work on the design,
development, evaluation, use, and impact of Information Society Technologies, as
well as on standardization, policy, and other non-technological issues that
facilitate and promote universal access. Paper submissions, in English, should
report on theories, methods, tools, empirical results, reviews, case studies,
and best practice examples, in any application domain and should have a clear
focus on universal access. In addition to the above, the journal will host
special issues, book reviews and letters to the editor, news from Information
Society Technologies industry, and standardization and regulatory bodies,
announcements (e.g., conferences, seminars, presentations, exhibitions,
education & curricula, awards, new research programs) and commentaries (e.g.,
about new legislation).
