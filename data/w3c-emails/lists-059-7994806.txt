I have an action item to do something about how an "evaluator" would rate 
tools for their handling of matters of text (content).

First I tried to find something to hang a hat on in ATAG to no avail 
("simple" isn't in there and "clear" only as part of "clearly" in the 
glossary) so just off the top of the head I'd have to say that we haven't 
given developers any cause to take special pains to "prompt" authors to 
write clear and simple text. Of course it could be argued that we demand 
that they obey all the WCAG, but that's a little vague.

So: should an authoring tool urge authors to write clear, simple prose? Who 
knows, and more importantly: who cares? You can urge in one hand and 
defecate in the other and see which fills fastest.
