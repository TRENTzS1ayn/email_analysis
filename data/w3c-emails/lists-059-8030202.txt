Hello all,

Here is the next version.  This includes a draft process for image
editors.  It is still not totally thought out.  If we are going to apply
our guidelines to image editors, I think we will need to suggest ways of
storing EAs outside text tracks as well as produce a tool that can view
all the image formats concerned as well as text track and separate EAs.

Cheers,
Jan
