My proposed feedback on the plenary session is 

- we would like it to happen
- we are likely to be there
- we want a facility to have our own meeting
- we want a general plenary where working groups briefly present their work
- we want plenty of opportunity for talking to other working groups or
    members of them

Is this OK or is there something that should be added / removed?

If I get no comments I plan to send this back on Friday as our initial
response.

cheers

Charles McCN
