Well,

I have glued together most of that has gone to the list with the glossary and
references from the techniques document, and formatted it as sort of a second
chapter of the techniques document (more or less).

http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/ATAG10-EVAL

It is very rough, there are no glossary links, the table of contents is
mostly not there, but there is something to read. I will continue to work on
it over the next few days, cleaning up the formatting and link the glossary
etc. But please review it and think about what kind of structure direction it
needs...

The first thing that occurs to me is that we might want to seperate out the
different types of tools. WCAG is seperating techniques along different
(types of) markup languages - this might be a good way of matching
it. Eventually we would like to be able to call a database to provide just
the stuff we want, but a first cut at that is still going to be defining a
few specific views, and we will still need to work out which ones they should
be.

cheers

Charles McCN
