"Tracking related work in other working groups, commenting on and 
integrating it as appropriate;"

WL: Perhaps get across the idea that in addition to their work affecting 
ours, the converse might also happen. Accessible Authoring = Device 
Independent Authoring = Usability Authoring and all that?

"Evaluations of how authoring tools conform to the Guidelines"

WL: Is it clear that this refers (if it does/should) to the class of 
authoring tools as well as to individual members of that class?

"Commitments from significant authoring tool developers to implement the 
Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines in ... releases."

"Implementation of the Guidelines in a range of Authoring Tools"

WL: The first of these is less important than the second - almost of no 
practical importance. Commitment without Implementation is called in the 
industry "Vaporware".

" The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines rely..."

WL: I wonder if "depend" is more like the relationship?

"...the group may trial the use..."

WL: *Please* don't convert "trial" into a verb.

"The Working Group communicates with the public through the Working Group 
home page and general W3C communication mechanisms."

WL: And via Education & Outreach?
