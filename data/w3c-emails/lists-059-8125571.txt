WL: I fear this is a little naive. Chat rooms are quite "noisy" in some 
non-audio sense and as to "other problems" - the grass may seem greener on 
the other side, but if previous experiences with the "medium" of chat rooms 
is any indication, they are pretty high on the "worthless, frustrating" 
list - at least for a certain old geezer. Of course if this is a decidedly 
minority view the effort will be made and I'll do my best to take part, but 
I'd rather depend on sending email back and forth! There's probably some 
idealized video conferencing hookup with full VR accompaniment, but for the 
moment...
