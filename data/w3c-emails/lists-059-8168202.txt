     Well I host our monthly HWG Town Hall meetings on our IRC server, I used 
to host a weekly astronomy chat on Delphi, and have participated in some other 
IRC chats in the past. So I'm not as "naive" as you think. Chat room "noise" 
can be a problem in a general interest chat, but in a room for a specific 
purpose, like this would be, noise would extremely low, if non-existant. And as 
Charles pointed out, a deaf person, or one with speech problems would be better 
able to participate.
