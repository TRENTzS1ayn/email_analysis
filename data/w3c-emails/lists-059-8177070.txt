Yes, I realised that. The value of doing it over elements specified by
xpointers is that you can also have a checksum for the particular elements,
so you can figure out which of those are different, break the document down
and up again keeping as much as is still fine.

Cheers

  Good approach... at least for fixed web pages, or for reporting on the

  Problem comes in if page has changed.  You do spot that via the hash (or do 
  you mean checksum?).
  
  But if a page does change, it would be useful to retain as much information 
  as possible, not just say that the RDF no longer applies.  One way to do 
  this is to make sure all elements have unique id's that do not get 
  changed.   Or, if a checkpoint refers to a regions of a page, with many 
  elements, that section should be wrapped in a <span> with a unique id.
  
  Still have a problem if regions overlap instead of being nested.... hmmm... 
  can  xpointer specify regions between two elements?
