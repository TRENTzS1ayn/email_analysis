Hi folks.

I have put a new techniques draft in place at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WD-ATAG10-TECHS-20000918/ for your perusal,
enjoyment, and review. There are some techniques added and I have put a note
in the status and "how the techniques are organised section" linking the
evaluation document - that would be a good thing to get some review on too.

Another thing to look at is what parts of the techniques need work and would
make good work items for then face to face meeting in Bristol. Reminder -
please register...

We should publish a new Public Techniques draft soon with at least an initial
version of the evaluation stuff - it's a W3C process requirement to publish
regularly, and it is supposed to be on the TR page (which means review by the
Interest group first).

cheers

Charles
