And if someone simply re-arranged the elements you could still find the 
originals... and without using id's, since you've got a hash of the checksums.

Yes. Neat.

Only suggestion is would be to cannonicalize whitespace before doing 
checksums.  E.g. replace all white space with exactly one space and omit 
whitespace between > and <  .

Yes, I realised that. The value of doing it over elements specified by
xpointers is that you can also have a checksum for the particular elements,
so you can figure out which of those are different, break the document down
and up again keeping as much as is still fine.

   Good approach... at least for fixed web pages, or for reporting on the

   Problem comes in if page has changed.  You do spot that via the hash (or do
   you mean checksum?).

   But if a page does change, it would be useful to retain as much information
   as possible, not just say that the RDF no longer applies.  One way to do
   this is to make sure all elements have unique id's that do not get
   changed.   Or, if a checkpoint refers to a regions of a page, with many
   elements, that section should be wrapped in a <span> with a unique id.

   Still have a problem if regions overlap instead of being nested.... hmmm...
   can  xpointer specify regions between two elements?
