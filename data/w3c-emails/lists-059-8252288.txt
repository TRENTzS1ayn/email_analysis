Charles,

Your notes say that

What did you have in mind for assertions that involved multiple elements, 
especially non-contiguous elements?  For example, if there's a server side 
image map there should be equivalent text links, but they don't have to be 
next to the image map (e.g. they may be at the bottom of the page).  I 
guess you'd write an assertion that included all the elements and if any 
one of them changed the assertion would be withdrawn?

Another case: when tables are used for layout, the document must make sense 
when linearized. Similarly, if CSS positioning is used, the elements must 
make sense when read in the order they appear in the HTML.   In this case 
you'd have to withdraw the assertion if any of the elements changed, or 
their order changed, or anything was inserted in their sequence, or 
positioned into their bounding box, right?

Hmmm.  When tables are used for layout you could simply write the assertion 
against the whole table.  But you'd still need to reference individual 
elements when CSS positioning is used.
