http://rdf.pair.com/checker.htm might be a useful framework for people who 
want to know what checkpoints a particular variety of tool must conform to 
for various levels. The rows could just as easily be things like "image 
editor", "save-as-html word processors", etc. This is in a very early 
stage. If anybody salutes this just suggest row titles and applicable 
checkpoints and I'll make one for that purpose.
