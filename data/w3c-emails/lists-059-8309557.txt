Hi Everyone,

The format I have been playing with for the images part of the
conformance evaluation process involves telling the evaluator to perform
a number of test tasks depending on the domain of the application. After
each task, the evaluator is asked a number of yes/no questions
addressing the accessibility issues related to the task.

This type of process lends itself well to a form-based Web tool that can
lead the user through the process, compiling the results as it goes. The
tool can ask the evaluator to perform a task and provide two choices
(done, not possible). If the evaluator selects "done" then the
associated questions are asked, otherwise the questions are skipped and
the next task is presented. In this way, the evaluator only needs to see
the questions related to the domain of the tool.

If we decide to do this, we should continue to work on the document
version as the specification for the automated tool.  After the document
is done it should be very simple to convert it into a form-based wizard.

Cheers,
Jan
