     No one ever said it was an "either or" proposition. I was just thinking 
given some of the phone noise problems we've had on occasion, it might be 
better to try something else once in awhile. And I personally never thought of 
suggesting this as a "replacement" for F2F meetings.

     As far as I know, TTY requires both ends of the conversation to have one. 
Someone would have to type in on one end, and read back what the person wrote 
on the other. It would be doable on a teleconference, but unless someone 
volunteers to do this, it'll cost someone some money somewhere. Same thing with 
voice relay. An online chat eliminates the middle man, as it were.

     No system is perfect, and use of one over another inevitably discriminates 
against someone at some time. My problem is F2F meetings. I can't travel, so I 
can't attend any of those. But they're only quarterly, so my non-attendance 
isn't a problem (I hope, anyway). In that vein, we might want to consider chat 
conferences instead of telephone as a once in awhile thing. Maybe one meeting a 
month, or every third meeting. Certainly no more than every other meeting, for 
the reason's Gregory has outlined. But I do think we should try it at least.
