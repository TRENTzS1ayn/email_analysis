aloha, FRED!

first of all, sorry for calling you frank -- i just suppose that i 
associate you, fred, with frankness... (whew! i think i wriggled out of 
that one gracefully!)

fred wrote, quote:
As far as I know, TTY requires both ends of the conversation to have one. 
Someone would have to type in on one end, and read back what the person 
wrote  on the other. It would be doable on a teleconference, but unless 
someone volunteers to do this, it'll cost someone some money somewhere. 
Same thing with voice relay.
unquote

what differentiates that scenario from the necessity of having a translator 
at a face2face meeting?  that's a default part of WAI registration forms, 
so it seems to me that if the WAI can make quote special unquote 
accommodations at F2F meetings, they should also be able to do so for 
teleconferences...  i for one am not always at my computer when i call into 
a telecon, nor do i always have the capacity to get online -- this is an 
especially important consideration for those whose functional limitations 
precludes (at least at present) the use of a computer, or of a chat or IRC 
facility...

therefore, i renew my call for either charles or one of the other ATAG 
editors to ping some deafness/hearing loss groups to ascertain the facts 
about TTY and relay systems, rather than let us speculate on that which we 
have little or no personal experience...

fred then stated, quote  An online chat eliminates the middle man, as it 
were. unquote

what chat type facility cuts out the middle man, when you are forced to 
rely upon a middle man (in this case, adaptive technology) to interact with 
the chat facility...  does the WAI/W3C have the resources to build an 
interoperable, accessible chat facility?

fred also sagely observed, quote No system is perfect, and use of one over 
another inevitably discriminates against someone at some time. unquote

agreed...

fred also stated, quote
My problem is F2F meetings. I can't travel, so I can't attend any of those. 
But they're only quarterly, so my non-attendance  isn't a problem (I hope, 
anyway).
unquote

it is my understanding that no final resolutions are made at F2F meetings 
for the precise reason you outlined -- the inability of WG members to 
attend; what the face2face meeting provides is a different kind of forum 
for the intensive discussion of a set agenda; any resolutions arising from 
an F2F are posted to the list for all WG members to comment upon before 
they become finalized, so while you are missing out on an interesting facet 
of the WG dynamic by your inability to attend F2F meetings, as well as the 
opportunity to get to know one's fellow WG members on a less formal basis, 
you're not missing a chance to air your opinions on the topics being 
discussed at the F2F

fred concluded with the proposition, quote
In that vein, we might want to consider chat conferences instead of 
telephone as a once in awhile thing. Maybe one meeting a month, or every 
third meeting. Certainly no more than every other meeting, for the reason's 
Gregory has outlined. But I do think we should try it at least.
unquote

i'm certainly up to trying it, but only if it is conducted under the same 
constraints that bind F2F meetings, as there are documented accessibility 
problems that would confront current WG members if chat conferences were to 
be held, whereas there is (to my knowledge) currently no member of the WG 
who is precluded by a functional limitation from participating in a 
teleconference...  i'm not advancing that as a reason for not investigating 
alternative means of communicating, but i think it far more practical for 
us to deal with concrete realities rather than theoretic 
contingencies...  that being said, i do think it incumbent upon us to query 
deafness/hearing loss organizations to ascertain how their members 
participate in non-deafness/hearing loss related fora, so that, when we are 
fortunate enough to attract a member who is deaf or has a profound hearing 
loss, we will be able to accommodate them as soon as they join...  and if 
that necessitates a transcriber, so be it -- that's what "reasonable 
accommodation" is all about...
