Might as well record some other comments...

I am planning to remove the Amaya samples and put the notes into the
evaluation document, unless people would like to have some references to
real-world implementations in the techniques (and actually say so...).

More templates would be good. I will try to revive my gallery template
(designed for a database-backed application)

Under 2.1 I think it is worth listing specs we have and speccs in
development, as well as a pointer to the TR page where the latest information
exists. I am not sure if the list is too big or not though.

The WCAG references for 3.1, 3.2, could use some filling out.

Checkpoints 1.4 and 3.4 could use some filling out and references to ER and
other review work.

  Sorry dude,
  
  yeah, I will take that up with Ian again. I don't know how he does it for the
  WCAG stuff, but what is done for ATAG is a lynx dump (much less than ideal
  ;-). Yes, the plain text and other versions do get second class treatment,
  but this is a reasonable thing to get right.
