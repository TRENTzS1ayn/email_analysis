The User Agent group would like us to commit  to reviewing their Last Call
draft (second last call) on either or both of the timeframes 
  19 October - 9 November or
  1 - 22 November.

There will be at least one new draft in between now and then.

so...

who can commit to reading the document in the first week of either period,
and sending comments to this group (so the group can decide what we think) or
commit to reading it in one or other period and sending comments as an
individual?

For the record, I will read it in the first week of either review period, and
bring comments to this list for discussion. But it will be more useful if
others have read it too ;-)

cheers

Charles

Hello,

The User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (UAAG 1.0) became
a Proposed Recommendation [1] on 10 March 2000. As a result
of that review, the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 
Working Group [0] has revised the document substantially to 
clarify conformance requirements for each checkpoint. To rebuild
consensus around the document, the Working Group intends 
to send a revised version of the document back to last call. 

I have two goals in sending this email:

1) Document review commitments from dependent Working
   Groups.

2) Determine whether our proposed schedule fits the 
   schedule of those Working Groups.

While we will welcome review from all interested
groups, we request review from the following groups:

  WAI Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines
[others snipped]
Please indicate your commitment to review the document 
and if so whether either or both of the following 
three-week review periods fit your schedules:

  19 October - 9 November
  1 November - 22 November

Please indicate your commitment to review prior to 9 October.

The latest version of the document is the (public)
1 September Working Group draft. This document represents
a lot of our efforts, but we expect it to change at least
twice before entering last call.
