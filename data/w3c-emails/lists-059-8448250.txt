  WL: Perhaps get across the idea that in addition to their work affecting 
  ours, the converse might also happen. Accessible Authoring = Device 
  Independent Authoring = Usability Authoring and all that?

CMN It is made explicit in the statements of dependencies where particular
ones ahve been identified in either direction.
  
WL
  "Evaluations of how authoring tools conform to the Guidelines"
  
  WL: Is it clear that this refers (if it does/should) to the class of 
  authoring tools as well as to individual members of that class?
  
  "Commitments from significant authoring tool developers to implement the 
  Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines in ... releases."
  
  "Implementation of the Guidelines in a range of Authoring Tools"
  
  WL: The first of these is less important than the second - almost of no 
  practical importance. Commitment without Implementation is called in the 
  industry "Vaporware".

CMN COmmitment to implement is valuable in demonstrating that these are a
worthwhile set of guidelines to have, and in generating response about what
is easy / hard / difficult / missing. It is also useful to get commmitment to
put them in purchasing policies, as most manufacturers have to sell product.
WL  
  " The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines rely..."
  
  WL: I wonder if "depend" is more like the relationship?
CMN I don't think it matters.
WL  
  "...the group may trial the use..."
  
  WL: *Please* don't convert "trial" into a verb.
CMN changed.
WL  
  "The Working Group communicates with the public through the Working Group 
  home page and general W3C communication mechanisms."
  
  WL: And via Education & Outreach?
CMN E&O is a general W3C communication mechanism for Accessibility related
stuff. Besides which there is relatively little done by E&O on authoring
tools.
