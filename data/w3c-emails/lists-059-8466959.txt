Hi, my name is CJ. If you do not write programs in Perl then I didn't mean to 
send this to you, and I apologize.

I am the Webmaster of lovepoems.net and I am trying to find someone who can 
create a perl (cgi) script, so that my visitors can look up the poems they 
have submitted in the past. Currently all I am able to do is leave their 
poems up for about 2 weeks then I put them into a database which only allows 
them to view their poems randomly.

I have put up the <A HREF="http://www.lovepoems.net/perlhelp.shtml">details</A
> of what I need on my site:

http://www.lovepoems.net/perlhelp.shtml

If there is anyway you can do this for me, it would be really helpful to me 
and my visitors ...I will pay for it.

thanx for your time, CJ
