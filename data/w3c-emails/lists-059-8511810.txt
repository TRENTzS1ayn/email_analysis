All,

Can't make it for this meeting, we're all still in "big crunch mode" here
(I'm working 12-16 hour days...). What doesn't help is that I'm having a lot
of problems with my internet connection as well (doesn't help my
productivity), which is why I could not even send regrets for last week's
meeting - sorry, I was very much off-line. I've installed a new network card
now which hopefully will make thing a little more stable.

Cheers,
Marjolein
