Sorry, I was talking a lot so they're pretty rough.

JT: We need to decide on tasks and find gaps.

JR: Jan explains his message sent just before meeting.

JT: Questions?

WL: It is a good idea to break out the core stuff and then have the
techniques for different languages, etc. THere would actually be 2 docs.

JT: That's new. We used to just talk about different views.

WL: Look at WL's checker (explains it's use).  Propose the same for
toole evaluation project.  So labels are "if your are designing a table
editor" instead of "are you using tables".

WL: In tool evaluation version we would put different kinds of tools for
each row.

JT: Will make the document more readable.

JR: Might be a problem if one doc is required.

GR: Not a problem if its just a search tool.

WL: It's just a big time saver.

JT: We do have to set out usable document structure.

JT: OK what face to face tasks are there.

JT: 1. Identify redundant techniques?

WL: Positive comments

JT: 2. Clean up classifications for each checkpoint.

JT: 3. Cleaning up the examples so they are really examples.

WL: We need examples from other companies.

JR: What about MS's blue underline.

LG: We do some stuff. Already sent examples.

JT: OK, we also need to determine the views.

JR: So that's basically asking what types of tools there are.

JT: Yep.

JR: Maybe we should do it as authoring components that can be built up
into different type of tools.

WL: That fits in with my tool.

JT: Other issues?

JT: What about the evaluation document?

WL: We need a big table that specifies who needs to look at what areas. 
So the user only needs to look at the things applicable to the tools
being tested or evaluated.

JR: that's done for image.

JT: Would also like to extend evaluation structure to the other content
types that we are evaluating for.

JR: Some of the tests in the structure are based on relative P
checkpoints so they should extend across all contnet types.

JT: We need to ensure that we have all content types agreed upon.

JT: anything else to do?

WL: We only have a day and a half.

JT: OK that's it.  We have lots to do.
