aloha, again!

i know that i've already given y'all my ha'penny's worth, but now that i 
think of it, there isn't much difference between braille on the keypad 
connected to a touch screen kiosk without voice output and an alternate 
means of input (such as chording the keypad or using something more 
technologically sophisticated), and a user agent/browser/authoring tool's 
browser-emulation mode which exposes ALT text, but limits the real estate 
accorded for the rendering of the ALT text to the absolute measurements 
defined by the author _for the graphic_ -- ALT text is meaningless (at 
least in the GUI environment) if it can't be expanded (what's the old rule 
of thumb, if you can't see it, it ain't there?)

the user MUST have control over the way that ALT text is rendered (i.e. 
size, font, foreground and background colors, etc.) so that it is displayed 
in whatever manner best suits that individual user -- some, for example, 
may want the same rules they've defined/set for the display of elements to 
be inherited by any ALT text contained in that element,  while others may 
want to distinguish ALT text from other text in a way that is meaningful to 
them -- whether the rendering is being performed by an authoring tool or a 
user agent; otherwise, a lot of people are only seeing part of the picture, 
as it where, especially as i do not believe it to be a common behavior for 
user agents to expose ALT text in a ToolTip if image loading is turned off 
onMouseOver of the partially exposed ALT text ...
