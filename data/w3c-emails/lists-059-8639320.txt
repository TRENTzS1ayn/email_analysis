I have drafted a list of the proposed tasks we came up with during 
the teleconference. Please send additions or proposed 
amendments/clarifications to the list.

Thanks Jutta

For Techniques Document:
1. Clean up organization of document so that information is in 
appropriate sections. Under each checkpoint there would be the 
following sections:
a) Clarification of Requirement- for information that is not an 
actual implementation technique but a clarification of what is 
required by the checkpoint. This information may be a good candidate 
for transition to the next guideline revision.
b) Suggested Implementation Techniques
c) Example Implementation Techniques
d) Reference material
Part of this task is to identify checkpoints that are missing 
information and to work out a scheme whereby we identify whether a 
technique is sufficient to meet the checkpoint or whether it only 
contributes towards meeting a checkpoint.

2. Reduce Redundancies
Where the same technique is used in several checkpoints link to a 
single description of the technique.

3. Insure that examples are actually examples and not comments on 
Amaya compliance.

4. Determine what the views will be (identify the types of authoring 
tools or the types of content to being authored). Determine what 
portions of the overall document fit into each of the views.

5. Create a compressed tree-structure-like view of the document as 
per William's example for better on-line readability.

For Evaluation Document
1. Extend structure used in image section of evaluation document to 
other content types.
2. Identify content types not yet covered  and draft evaluation 
process for the missing content types.
