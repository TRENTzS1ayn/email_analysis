I need more items for the leftmost column. From the top:

ATAG is a link to the Guidelines Document
Checklist is a link to the List of Checkpoints Document
Techniques is a link to the Techniques Document
Key jumps to a brief explanation
Each table item jumps to the appropriately prioritized checkpoints and on 
each line the underlined number of the checkpoint links to the correct 
place in the Guidelines Document and each "T" icon links to the appropriate 
technique.

That's enough for an old person fixin' to fly to London so he can visit 
Porlock (and Bristol on the way).
