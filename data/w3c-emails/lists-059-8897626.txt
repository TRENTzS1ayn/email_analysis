First, I think the whole group joins me in expressing our condolences to
Jutta and Charles. Our thoughts were with you and we missed you at the
meeting.

Minutes are not available yet - will take a couple of days, but in summary we
did some good work on both parts of the techniques document (the techniques
and the evaluation techniques), decided that we would try to produce a new
Recommendation as soon after WCAG 2.0 as possible because that looks like
making things a lot simpler and it would be a shame not to make use of it,
and had some good discussion in general.

Thanks to everyone for their hard work at the meeting, and thanks to Libby
for her ahrd work on the day, and to Dan and Nicky as well for their help in
organising the hosting.

I hope everyone who was travelling arrives safely home - talk to people next
week.

Charles
