The proposal is available at: http://www.w3.org/2000/10/12-ATAG-AERT.html

This fulfills my action item to write up the discussion from the AU WG f2f 
last Saturday.

I propose that we discuss this at the join AU and ER meeting on 
Tuesday.  The questions that need to be answered:
1. Do people agree this is a good direction to move in?
2. If yes, who needs to do what to make it happen?
3. What communication mechanisms need to be in place for the ERT WG to feed 
info into the document if it is being maintained by AU WG?  What will AU be 
relying on ERT to do?

Other questions?
