VETERANS
Severe market conditions in all technology markets awakened Italian 
tech investors to the perils of tech investing. A severe market 
correction brought our NM market index down -8.4% points with peaks 
of -30%  . Blood was all over the market .

FREEDOMLAND lost an additional  -12% and later in the week was 
suspended from trade pending further enquiries into the company 
accounting practices and allegations of fraud.

All other NM companies lost ground with some burning a large portion 
of their  market cap.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS

UMTS (3G mobile telephony)
The  date for the license auction  has been set for the 19th of October, 2000

One of the weaklings among the licensee candidates, TU MOBILE, a 
hastily assembled consortium, was flunked by the government , due to 
lack of financial  coverage, leaving only 6 companies bidding for 5 
licenses.

The question we have is: if there are 5 licenses to be granted,  and 
only 5 bidders (if one takes into account ongoing merger talks 
between some of the contenders) what kind of auction is it? It sounds 
more like a cartel  situation  to us! Regarldess of what TLC 
Minister  CARDINALE says

OTHER TLC NEWS
INFOSTRADA , as widely  anticipated, went to ENEL , the utility 
giant, which will merge it with WIND,  to create the 2d largest fixed 
and mobile telephone operator in Italy - The price:  22 billion 
lire,  or slightly short of Euro 11 billion big fat potatoes for 
GENT' s  VODAPHONE!
