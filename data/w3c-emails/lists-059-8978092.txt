We have been asked by the GL group, using this mapping as a guide, to produce
a draft of the techniques that actually looks at which of these things can be
checked by a tool. I think that this is a work item that to some extent
crosses both groups - and relates to the proposal for AU to take over most of
the EART editing stuff.

Hello,

At the face to face meeting I took an action item to map the checkpoints 
from WCAG 1.0 to the checkpoints in WCAG 2.0.

I used a table to format my results, however if you use tablin to linearize 
it it should be readable.  When linearized, the WCAG 2.0 checkpoint is a 
paragraph followed by a list of WCAG 1.0 checkpoint(s).  Let me know if 
there is a better way to do this.

table version: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2000/10/checkpoint-mapping.html
linearized version: 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2000/10/checkpoint-mapping.html,tablin

The issues that I identified while doing this exercise:
- There are 5 WCAG 1.0 checkpoints that do not have a clear home.
- There are 2 WCAG 1.0 checkpoints that were given a home but it's not 
clear they belong there.
- Inheriting checkpoints from WCAG 1.0 will be tricky.  It might be best to 
only prioritize technology-specifics.
- Several WCAG 1.0 checkpoint priorities are under debate, how or will we 
handle?
- There are redundancies in WCAG 1.0 checkpoints.  WCAG 2.0 seems to resolve.
- Might be some redundancies with WCAG 2.0 checkpoints.
