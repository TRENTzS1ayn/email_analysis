You'll need to define what it means to be "checked by a tool".  Although 
it's possible for a tool to determine failure to pass certain checkpoints 
(e.g. absence of ALT text), it's only rarely possible for any tool to 
determine, by purely automatic means, that a page passes a checkpoint (e.g. 
is the ALT text correct?).

Human judgment is needed in almost all cases. On the other hand, a tool can 
help supply that judgment.

In other words, for each checkpoint there's the questions:

- Can an automatic check produce any true negatives?
- Will that check show all true negatives?
- Can an automatic check produce any true positives?
- Will that check show all true positives?
- Is there any tool that can aid human judgment when human judgement is 
needed?  And how much help does it give? (This is a -    - subjective but 
important consideration).

You'll need to decide what "can be checked by a tool" means.
