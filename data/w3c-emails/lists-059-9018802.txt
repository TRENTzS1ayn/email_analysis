Folks, this is a first-come, first served thing. So the sooner we settle on
what we want, the better.

I propose that we ask for a meeting at for one day, to work on
techniques (including evaluation techniques), and theat we don't mind which
day.

What groups do we want to meet with? In principle I think it would be good to
meet with all groups working on a language (MathML, Voice working groups,
SVG, SMIL, Style groups, XML/HTML groups, ...). Does anyone have a more
concrete suggestion?

Cheers

Charles McCN

Chairs,

The W3C has organized space for a five-day All Group Meeting for 26 
February through 2 March 2001 to be held at the Royal Sonesta Hotel in 
Cambridge, Massachusetts. Ten meeting rooms have been reserved for Monday, 
Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday to accommodate WG face to face meetings. 
Wednesday has been reserved for a Plenary.

We have negotiated a guest room rate of $130 (plus tax) with the Royal 
Sonesta. Because we have reserved 90% of their prime meeting space, they 
expect meeting participants to reserve guest rooms with them. If we don't 
meet the guest room block minimum, we may lose some of our meeting space, 
or the cost of the space will significantly increase. We ask that Chairs 
help us in conveying the importance of booking a room at the Royal Sonesta. 
The guest room rate is economical in comparison with many other local hotels.

Since the 8 September email, we have received responses from 12 groups 
stating they would hold their face to face meeting in conjunction with a 
W3C Plenary (see responses below). There is meeting space available for 8 
more groups. Groups will be assigned meeting space on a first-come, 
first-served basis.

Please send us the following information regarding your group needs by:
         ********* 26 October 2000**********

1. Two Day Preference: Mon/Tues or Thurs/Fri. (Feb. 26-27 or March 1-2)

2. Will your group be flexible about the meeting days:
      If you choose Mon/Tues; would Thurs/Fri be acceptable?

3. The number of people in your group that will attend the f2f meeting _____

4. Will folks in your group attend the Wednesday Plenary?

5. What other W3C groups, specifically, would your group like to meet?

6. Are there other groups with significant membership overlap with yours which
       should NOT be scheduled on the same days?

    NOTE: We will do our best to avoid overlap, but we cannot guarantee it.

All groups are expected to attend the Wednesday plenary. Groups are 
encouraged to meet with other W3C working groups throughout the day. We 
plan to have hallway space and possibly other smaller meeting rooms during 
the plenary for groups to meet and exchange ideas.

Please note that we may not be able to offer every group their preferred 
seating plan. The size of your group will determine the seating arrangement 
(either U-shape or schoolroom). We will not be able to confirm seating 
plans until we have received input from 20 groups.  Details regarding 
connectivity and audio visual will be sent at a later date.

In order to arrange appropriate space, we need your answers to the above 
questions by
THURSDAY 26 OCTOBER at the latest.

We look forward to your receiving your email and input.
