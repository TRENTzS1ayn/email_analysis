I think that Voice, SVG, and DOM are more important to work on than XHTML
or SMIL, since we have techniques for the latter.  We need to get ahead of
the curve.  We need to put requirements on the new working groups to
provide us with authoring scenarios that support accessibility while they
are still working on the language/markup.  They should be able to create
the scenarios [techniques] with guidance from the existing ATAG guidelines.

I also think we need collaboration with internationalization on tools being
developed for translation and collaboration with CC/PP on tools that will
transcode or add meta information for CC/PP cable browsers and servers - so
that we both know where they will benefit accessibility.
