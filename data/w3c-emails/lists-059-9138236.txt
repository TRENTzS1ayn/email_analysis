Jan,

thanks for this - it's a good piece of work.

How about we have the following categories:

+ Things you need to do to meet the checkpoint (these can be fairly general)
+ Techniques to do this (which should say how much of it they do)
+ Things which are good to do although they go beyond the requirements of the
    checkpoint.
+ References

These probably need to be sorted (where applicable) by tool type and
priority.

For example to meet checkpoint 1.1 in a level-A tool, all that needs to be
done is to provide source editing (and meet checkpoint 1.2 Preserve all
accessibiltiy information, which can be done by not messing up the source).

But for a WYSIWYG tool this will not conform to 5.1 and 5.2, so the tool
cannot get to double-A. A source editing tool can use this technique to any
level.

Cheers

Charles
