We need volunteers to take on the task of editing sections of the 
techniques document. The benefits of volunteering include prestige, 
credit, experience,  respect and appreciation from your fellow group 
members. Is there anyone within the group that can take on a section. 
Charles and I can brief you on what's required.

Thanks
Jutta
