TELECOMMUNICATIONS

UMTS (3G mobile telephony)
As we anticipated last week, the UMTS auction is proving to be a big 
headache for government which was expecting as much as  Euro 25 
billion from it . It looks like it will have to cut its appetite in 
half since the auction was suspended on request of BLU, the weakest 
of the 6 bidders. If BLU calls it quits, the game is over, since 
there will be only 5 bidders left for 5 licenses.  BLU is likely to 
pull out due to shareholder squabbles between BRITISH TELECOM and the 
BENETTON family . The latter has been pushing BT to increase its 
stake in the consortium without success.  BENETTON is not willing to 
bleed to death on UMTS and hence BLUE appears in serious difficulties.

All  this was a known fact much before the auction was launched by 
the government. The decision to start the auction with 6 bidders for 
5 licenses,  knowing that at least one of the six was very likely to 
pull out after only a modest increase over the base price, looks like 
a blunder Italian style, if not worse.  If the auction is not 
declared invalid, we predict that it will become the subject of fraud 
investigation,  besides being at the center of political controversy 
for months to come.

The only decent and intelligent thing the government can do is scrap 
it and start-over again.
