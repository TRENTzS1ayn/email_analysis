transmissions.  This might be used e.g. to check if the LANG attribute 
should have been used in an HTML page, although that application is not 
mentioned in the patent (it was filed in 1994, before LANG was defined: cf 
http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/html/rfc1866.txt).

This patent was originally assigned to AT&T.  It may have been transferred 
to Lucent.
