Fulfilling Jutta's action item from teh previous meeting...

Yes, we could base our techniques on WCAG 2. But that would not be directly
helpful to people trying to conform to ATAG since the ATAG 1.0 explicitly
requires conformance to WCAG 1.0

We received the checkpoint mapping for the draft from WCAG (see mesage from
me titled "Checkpoint Mapping beteween WCAG 1.0 and WCAG 2.0" at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/2000OctDec/0018 for
details) so we could fairly mechanically change the techniques that are
assigned to a current WCAG checkpoint. But I think we might as well hold off
until WCAG 2 is around last call, since otherwise we will end up trying to
maintain two version of the document, and have to reorder every time WCAG
changes their draft.

Cheers
