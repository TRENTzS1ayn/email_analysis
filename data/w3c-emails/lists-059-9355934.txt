The source document used to generate ATAG and the Techniques is now publicly
available at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/sources/atag-src.html

There is also an XSLT which will generate a table of contents for it (and the
link magic) available at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/sources/toc.xsl

I need to move some more stuff into that place over the next few days, but
anyone intersted in editing a document can have a look at that and try to see
9or ask) how it becomes the various techniques documents plus the ATAG
document itself.

Cheers
