Hello all,

1. As promised, this is my first effort at adding the AERT to checkpoint
4.1 of the AU techniques.  This is a relative guidleinbe so it refers to
WCAG 1.0.  So far only Guideline 1 (Checkpoints 1.1-1.5) of WCAG are
done.

2. I've also fixed up a number of other things throughout the AU techs
document.

3. The underlying structure (links, divs, etc.) are a shambles right
now.

Cheers,
Jan
