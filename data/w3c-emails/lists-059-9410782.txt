Our next joint ER AU meeting is
Date: Tuesday 7 November 2000
Time: 2:30pm - 4:00pm Boston time (1930Z - 2100Z)
Phone number: Tobin Bridge, +1 (617) 252 7000

I believe it's our turn to do the agenda.  Here's 2 items.  Please feel 
free to add items... especially AU folks if there's something you wanted to 
cover.

1. Machine-readable web site evaluations.  Over in ER we are working on a 
standard machine readable way to describe accessibility of a web 
site.  This would include referencing  specific segments of the 
site.  There's some recent posts on the ER mailing archives.
     - description of alternatives
     - latest thoughts from ER and reactions/contributions from AU

2. Comments on Jan's incorporation of AERT into the AU spec.

If there are no more items this meeting may end before 4 (boston time)
