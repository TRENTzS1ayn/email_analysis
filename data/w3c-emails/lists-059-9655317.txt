Hi,

Here it is. The AERT is completely integrated with the structure of the
AU techniques for ATAG checkpoint 4.1.  As I discussed today, there are
still many places that ER group needs to look at adding, editing or
removing techniques.

ALSO, for the AU group, I have done a lot of updating to Appendix A (the
part that explains prompting and alerting). Some of the images have
changed as well so I will try and get this on a server soon.

Let me know what you think.

Cheers,
Jan
