Amplification re the difference between the guidelines concerning the tools 
themselves and their documentation: just as metadata is data about data so 
documentation is a "metatool" - a tool essential to the 
installation/use/analysis of the subject tool. Rather than have a separate 
"document for documentation accessibility" we can decide that the 
documentation for a tool that is accessible must meet a higher standard of 
conformance because it forms a particularly insidious barrier to the use of 
the tool, particularly for newcomers and PWDs.

Even should such books as "Home Page Writer for Dummies" come out and be 
generously linked to suitable slide shows, multi-media presentations, etc. 
the responsibility for maximally accessible documentation should be 
emphasized by requiring it to be Triple-A conformant - IMO.
