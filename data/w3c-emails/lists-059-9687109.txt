Hi,

Unfortunately Jutta will be unable to make the call today so she asked
me to chair.

The agenda will be:
- Continued discussion of the integration of the AERT into the AU
techniques. (my draft integration is in the archives at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/2000OctDec/0093.html
- Discussion about possible new version

So the meeting may relatively short.

Cheers,
Jan
