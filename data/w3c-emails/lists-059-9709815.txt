aloha, y'all!

ugh!!! these technology stains are the worst! they just WON'T come out--at least not of their own volition...  which is to say that i'm not on the AU telecon because i'm still on the phone with a technical support person, so i'm emailing y'all to inform you that, regretfully, i will miss/am missing yet another teleconference...

i have been slash am attempting slash will continue to attempt to get back into the swing of things WAI-wise, but due to my continued false starts, half-starts, mainly in the area of connectivity as well as getting my existing equipment to work properly (which mainly means getting on speaking terms with it) and setbacks (i had to send one system back to the vendor and reorder it)--efforts which have consumed not only most of my spring, summer, and fall, but which have led to an even greater strain on my already limited physical resources--i have had no choice but to concentrate on getting my technological and connectivity problems resolved as comprehensively as possible, in order that i will be able to resume some semblance of a normal life, which means missing telecons while i attempt to get better answers to my technological impasses than the paltry excuse for tech support i heard last weekend, when i was informed that the sole reason i was experiencing the problems i had ca!

lled to report and for which i was seeking solutions was that i was using Windows, which is--according to the enlightened individual with whom i spoke--not intended for use by the blind...

oh well--at least my verbosity setting hasn't been restored to its factory default....

gregory.

PS: for the time being i only have limited access to email, and only through a web-based interface which endows me with (in the loosest sense of the word) access to the account from which this post originated: <oedipus@hicom.net>
