Hmmm. This comes squarely under the rubric of checkpoint 7.1 - make sure the
tool is accessible. So I guess the answer is to do a survey of the different
materials for doing that, and see what they say...

  The question of priority assignment in matters concerning the documentation

  I submit that it is quite permissible for us to, if we so choose, to
  recognize the important difference between the guidelines concerning the
  tools themselves and the documentation one must endure in order to
  install/learn/use said tools. Although for all users these latter
  activities are hoop/hurdle/barrier/nuisance there is a sense in which for
  PWDs the barriers presented completely preclude the ultimate experience of
  the tool proper. Many other users have access to features within the tools
  whose installation will be merely inconvenient but because in many cases
  the mere act of uninformed/misinformed installation can cause cyberfatality
  the inconvenience rises to the level of *DANGER - THIS MAY KILL YOUR
  SYSTEM* because their setup is both rare and fragile.

  Further the absence of criteria for reading level considerations also
  precludes access to documentation for a great many people who aren't
  strictly covered as "disabled".

  In the light of this I propose: in regard to the documentation for
  Authoring Tools (the UA can do what they want to, of course) we make it a
  priority 1 requirement that access to the documentation demands that these
  documents be Triple-A conformant. If they are not, then that means that the
  tools package itself cannot even be Single-A conformant, which IMO is
  fair/just/proper.

  Obviously this cannot be retrofitted into ATAG 1.0, but there may be time
  to debate/resolve/include it in our next version. If it's possible to make
  a version 1.x then I think we should consider it for that.
