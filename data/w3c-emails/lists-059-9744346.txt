What we say at the moment is "do what they say". It may be that what "they"
say is sufficient, in which case we can rest easy and be grateful. If not, we
need to make an explicit exception, which is a genuine full blown issue
(although I agree with you, that documentation is really really important)
that we need to look into.

Without demonstrating that there is something wrong with existing
specifications for making tools accessible I am loath to just add a
requirement that I think properly belongs in those other specifications.

Cheers

  Actually I'm more interested in what *we* say rather than what *they* say.
  The question is still: "Can it be the case that the needfuls for
  documentation can make it a higher priority than the document for which it
  is the skeleton key?"
