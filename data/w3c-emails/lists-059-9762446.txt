In reviewing the issues to be discussed it became clear that the most 
important thing to accomplish right now is to continue to work on the 
techniques and evaluation document. Could everyone spend 2:30 to 4:00 
reviewing, adding to or authoring a section of the Techniques or 
Evaluation document and send your additions and comments to the list. 
We will discuss these during next week's teleconference.

Thanks Jutta
