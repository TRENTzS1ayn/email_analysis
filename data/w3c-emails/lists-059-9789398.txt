aloha, y'all!

here it is, 2 weeks on from our last meeting, and again i find myself, at the commencement of the AU telecon, on the line with a technical support person, attempting to get things straightened out with my recalcitrant technology...  i had originally thought that i would be able to participate in today's telecon, as health considerations forced me to miss the joint PF/ER face2face meeting which is currently underway in Washington, apparently it is true what they say about the best laid plans of mice and men...

gregory.
