This is an issue that crosses the three WAI groups so I am not sure where to
send it (it came from the interest group).

My take is that "difficult" means that there is a significant difference in
the efficiency of a person with a disability performing a task and a person
without a disability, that can be removed by meeting the checkpoint.

Something in the order of two to five times as much work / time required.

But that's a really rough guess - we have never agreed on it in a group so
far as I know...

thoughts?

Hi
This extract from an email sent by me to a person
involved in suggesting changes to legislation here in
NZ, all comments welcome!

'I am unsure at this stage what to suggest in terms of
whether to suggest adopting "A" or "AA" compliance.
Clearly I favour "AA" from principal and would like to
see this adopted, however, I am not sure how strong
the argument is for "AA" compliance in terms of 'law'.
One of the problems I have is that I don't fully
understand all the priority 2 guidelines in terms of
'what are the REAL CONSEQUENCES to people using the
various user-agents of non-conformance to priority 2
guidelines?'
Does the information really become inaccessible or is
accessibility simply 'dfficult'?
And what does 'difficult' mean?'

Regards
Graham Oliver
