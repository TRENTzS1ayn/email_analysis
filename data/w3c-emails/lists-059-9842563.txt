I have started to publish the bits of the source documents that sometimes
work.

They are at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/sources - there is a source document
that I ned to do some work on to get it XSLT happy, and the first XSLT that I
am trying to work over.

It currently (when I haven't added a bug) generates a version of the
guidelines that has a bunch of missing cross-references and things. I will
work on it over the weekend and hope to have a few different views available
by the meeting Tuesday

cheers

Charles
