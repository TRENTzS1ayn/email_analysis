I have updated this. There are now samples that show a rough draft of
techniques specific to audio / video (including image) tools, and a few other
"improvements". Still to do includes incorporating Jan's work on including
AERT within this structure, and the evaluation of tools stuff, and a bunch
more cleanup and tying loose ends.

cheers

  I have started to publish the bits of the source documents that sometimes
  work.

  They are at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/sources - there is a source document
  that I ned to do some work on to get it XSLT happy, and the first XSLT that I
  am trying to work over.

  It currently (when I haven't added a bug) generates a version of the
  guidelines that has a bunch of missing cross-references and things. I will
  work on it over the weekend and hope to have a few different views available
  by the meeting Tuesday

  cheers
