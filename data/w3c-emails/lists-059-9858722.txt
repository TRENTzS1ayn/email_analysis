For those of you with W3C member access, the final schedule is available
at: http://www.w3.org/Member/allgroupoverview.html

Hopefully it will be made public. Or something. Anyway, the details for us...

We are meeting Thursday and Friday (1-2 March)  at the Royal Sonesta Hotel
5 Cambridge Parkway
Cambridge, MA 02142 USA
Telephone: +1 617.806.4200, Reservations: +1 617.806.4255
Meeting Code: MIT-W3C (quote this for the discounted rooms)

Discount Rate: $130 (plus tax) available until Friday, 26 January 2001,
5:00 pm EST. We are trying to get this extended to aturday for those of us
who will not be able to travel Friday night without walking out on half a
meeting.

Hotel Reservation Details
A block of rooms have been reserved at the Royal Sonesta Hotel at a
discount rate of $130 (plus tax) per night, single/double occupancy. The
discount rate will be offered from Sunday, 25 February through Thursday, 2
March 2001. High speed Internet connections are available in guest rooms
for a flat rate of $10.00 per night. (Laptop computers must be 10baseT
equipped.).

The W3C will host a reception Wednesday evening, 28 February from
18:00-20:00 at the hotel. Beverages and light hors d'ourvre' will be
served. We encourage folks to take this opportunity to meet working group
members from other W3C working groups.

Transportation Details
Logan International Airport is the closest international airport to the
meeting site. The Royal Sonesta Hotel is located three miles from Logan.
The travel time between the airport and the hotel (meeting site) will vary
between 30 minutes to one hour depending on traffic conditions. Taxi fares
will range between $18.00-$28.00. If you can walk a few hundred yards, the
Hotel is close to Lechmere station on the Green line of the "T" - the Boston
subway system. The airport is pretty easy by T - take the courtesy shuttle to
the station, buy a token (USD 1) and take the inbound train to Government
Center, then the Lechmere trolley. Total time about half an hour. On leaving
the Station pass under the tracks, and to the big shopping center. The Hotel
is between it and the river. (There have also been two Authoring Tools
meetings there, so people who have been around a while will know all this.)

Please Note: All events will take place at the hotel. There is a large
shopping mall across the street so you will not need a car during the week.
There is a major road construction project going on in Boston called the
"Big Dig." For this reason, we recommend taking a taxi or public
transportation rather than renting a car. If you prefer to rent a car, all
major car rental companies have locations at Logan Airport (Avis, Budget,
Hertz, etc.).

cheers
