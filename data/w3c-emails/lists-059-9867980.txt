We will not have a meeting again this year - please instead spend some time
looking over the techniques material posted and send agreement / suggestions
to the list. I am in the process of integrating the work Jan did with the new
sources documents, and we should generate a new public techinques document in
the New Year.

Jutta is not available on the 2nd January, I can be. Please indicate whether
you are available or not by Wednesday, as we need to let ER know the date of
our next joint meeting.

cheers

Charles
