Blackboard, Inc is planning a new release of their course management
product
towards mid-year.  Included in the enhancements and upgrades was the
following,

"Accessibility enhancements:  All system images will have alt tags,
and
instructors will be able to add alt tags to uploaded images in the
content
creation areas of the software.  Framesets will be appropriately
titled
and will have meaningful content describing the functionality of the
frame
layout.  Data tables will be optimized for use with screen readers."

At least they're trying.
