I hesitate to speak for Heather, but in her absence, the time is do-able
here in Pacific time; however, at glancing at her schedule she may have
conflicts with this time, at least on Mondays/Wednesdays--Tuesdays look
like a 30 minute conflict (at the last 1/2 hour).  I don't know if these
are times that she can adjust or not.  She'll be back and able to speak
for her own schedule next week.

When did you need to make a firm decision?
Thanks!

Liddy has been admirably getting up at 2am on a regular basis to join 
our call. I don't think we should continue to ask her to do that. I 
would like to find an alternative time that works for everyone that 
regularly attends the teleconference. This needs to take into account 
European time, Australian time and both east and west coast North 
American time.

How is everyone with 4:00pm EDT on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday? This 
would make it 6:00am in Australia and 9:00 pm in Europe. Or does 
anyone have an alternative suggestion?
