The Character Model for the WWW is a very important foundation document for Web media.

 Character Model for the World Wide Web 1.0
 http://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/

The Second Last Call for this document ended 31 May 2002, but as the Internationalization group were expecting WAI comments, they are not beyond handling comments that we get in late-but-soon.  I owe Misha word on whether he should expect comments from us [with fixed extended due date] or that he should not.

If there is anyone in the AU group who has already reviewed this draft, or on thinking about it would have a work interest in ensuring that making the Web safe for all the languages of the Earth hasn't somehow broken something on which disabilty access hangs, please let me know by 21:00Z Friday so that I can keep the line open to i18n.  You should tell me your expected date for when you will have read the document and responded.  You may use the public comment form or email, but please Cc: w3c-wai-pf@w3.org or let me know you have commented  -- or let me know that you read it and have no comment.
