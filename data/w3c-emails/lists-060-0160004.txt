Now that I have a few legal documents with my married name on them it
time to change my name with Microsoft, which means my email address will
be changing.

I have been informed that my old address (HSwayne@Microsoft.com) will
stop working sometime tomorrow (June 26th).  Microsoft will not forward
any mail sent to the old address.  Please update your contact
information with my new email address and alias HeatherB@Microsoft.com.

Heather Swayne Burns
Lead Program Manager
Microsoft
