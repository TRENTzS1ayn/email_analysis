Guess it was good to look at the options:

some have phone and fast Internet connection
some have phone OR Internet connection
some have cell phone and Internet connection

some type fast and easily
some don't
some can't

some pay nothing
some pay

All in all, looking at the group, this suggests that we go with the 
phone and someone writing minutes?

I'm happy with that.
