I am not sure what is happening about this but as a not very 
important member of the AU group, I am inclined to go to the IMS 
meeting in Sydney on this occasion. It is really too late and too 
expensive for me to arrange to go to France now.

The IMS meeting will have a good group in Sydney, including tools 
developers, and I think we can anticipate some good work being done 
for the main cause. I am looking forward to the day when these groups 
work more closely and collaboratively (thanks my private hope!).
