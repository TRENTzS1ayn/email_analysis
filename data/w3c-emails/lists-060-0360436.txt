Yep, I think this is pretty cool.

Couple of comments:

The 'direct' and indirect' editing bit seemed confusing to me, and I think
that talking about "WYSIWYG" editing modes makes more sense.

I also think that what we currently call "markup editing tools" are more
obviously "document editing tools" (for example Front Page, Word,
Dreamweaver, Amaya) or in some cases code editing tools (e.g. HomeSite,
Dreamweaver 4, asWedit, Hotdog). Are the code editing tools in the same class
as programming tools? I think that the essential difference is that
programming tools create something dynamic, but I am not sure if that is
important - it only applies as a criterion in a handful of WCAG checkpoints
and for 7.2

So I propose that we consider changing the way we use these two categories
(markup/document editing and programming/code editing).

cheers
