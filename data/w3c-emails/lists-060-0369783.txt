re: "direct" & "indirect" editing

I debated with myself about introducing new terminology. But "indirect"
seems cover some cases that WYSIWYG does not:

1. Programming environments that make heavy use of graphic objects
rather than raw code during editing (ex. IShell)

2. Multimedia sound and haptic editors that have visual representations
that differ substantially from the final sonic or haptic version.


re: markup/document editing and programming/code editing functionality

This is quite sticky. At the implementation level it is difficult to
separate editing of markup from editing of code, but I keep coming back
to one thought - "surely, the techniques we want to provide tools that
help the author create markup are different from the techniques we want
to provide tools that help the author create code which, in turn, is
capable of producing content". Let's put this on the agenda of a
conference call.

Cheers,
Jan
