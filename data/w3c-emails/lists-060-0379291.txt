I am not sure if the techniques for editing markup and the techniques for
editing code are different or not - I agree that this should be explored a
bit before we decide on it.  But I think that the techniques for an author
who is editing in a WYSIWYG environment tend to be pretty different from
those for an author who is editing the underlying markup. Initially I was
going to propose just splitting what we currently call markup editing (and I
confess that I think of as document editing) techniques into two, but then I
wondered about the relationship to code editing techniques.

I can see your point about the "direct/indirect" thing. Maybe at some stage
we will come up with a really obvious way to describe it, so I guess we can
leave it in for now.

  re: "direct" & "indirect" editing

  I debated with myself about introducing new terminology. But "indirect"
  seems cover some cases that WYSIWYG does not:

  1. Programming environments that make heavy use of graphic objects
  rather than raw code during editing (ex. IShell)

  2. Multimedia sound and haptic editors that have visual representations
  that differ substantially from the final sonic or haptic version.


  re: markup/document editing and programming/code editing functionality

  This is quite sticky. At the implementation level it is difficult to
  separate editing of markup from editing of code, but I keep coming back
  to one thought - "surely, the techniques we want to provide tools that
  help the author create markup are different from the techniques we want
  to provide tools that help the author create code which, in turn, is
  capable of producing content". Let's put this on the agenda of a
  conference call.

  Cheers,
  Jan
