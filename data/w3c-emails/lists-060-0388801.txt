I think the distinction between editing code and content editing in a 
WYSIWYG editor is a bit artificial because in many cases we have a 
WYSIWYG editor with the code visible and flip between the two - I 
think we should recognise that DreamWeaver, for one, has a huge 
market and this will therefore be a VERY common practice -....

I am not sure of the best way to do this either....

but i still think the functionality approach is a good one
