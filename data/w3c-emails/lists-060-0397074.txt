Actually Dreamweaver is one of the few editors that has a serious WYSIWYG adn
Code editing tool, and that only really in the latest version. Many code
editing tools have no WYSIWYG editing facility - just a browser preview.

In plenty of cases, of course, there will be tools that do more than one
functionality. But I am not sure how many...

  I am not sure of the best way to do this either....

  but i still think the functionality approach is a good one
