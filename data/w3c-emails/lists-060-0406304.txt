I was trying to draw attention to the situation in which the content 
developer probably doesn't see a difference in the functionality - 
you are alerting me to the fact that is is not relevant, in as much 
as the techniques are for the developer of the tools, not the content 
developer - and that might be the answer.

So maybe it doesn't matter....
