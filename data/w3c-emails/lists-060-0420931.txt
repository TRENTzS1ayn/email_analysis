If we are to use seperate pop-up windows, announced from source link
by means of the title tag on the <a> element, 
with a clear announcement on the pop up window as to how to return
to the original window (i.e. to close down the pop up),
are we still up for a AA rating.... OK, simply, is it accessible.

Or

Should we be avoiding them altogether?
