belated regrets from Phill.

But some input regarding some of the items discussed:

Meeting in France:

Is the W3C Technical Plenary in southern France, February 25 - March 1 2002
still on?
Is this the best URL http://www.w3.org/2001/07/allgroupoverview.html?
     ATAG & EO are listed as meeting, UAAG, GL, PF, etc are not.
     Phill plans to attend if both ATAG & EO are meeting.

WWW2002:

Phill plans to attend if part of panel or paper presentation - so far no
confirmation from www2002.
Phill could represent IBM in proposed tools panels.

Dublin Core:
Phill currently has issue with them regarding duplicate or confusing
standard for document language which conflicts or at lease duplicates with
html lang= attribute.

Nothing new to report on IBM portal tool.
