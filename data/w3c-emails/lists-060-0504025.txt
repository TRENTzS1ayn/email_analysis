Our next teleconference will be on January 28th since we are meeting 
on an every-second-week basis. I will send an agenda for the meeting 
mid-week next week. In the meantime does anyone have suggestions 
regarding the timing and location of the next face to face meeting 
(we will most likely cancel the meeting on the 25th of February). 
Also please pipe in regarding the categorization of tool 
functionalities discussed on the list.

Thanks Jutta
