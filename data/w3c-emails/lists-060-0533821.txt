Hi folks,

the way that the word "content" is used is really important to a number of
specs, and there are different definitions used across the different WAI
specs. Please look at the thread on wai-xtech about how to define this term -
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/wai-xtech/2002Jan/0002 - and ensure that
the result on that thread will work for ATAG Wombat and our techniques in the
future.
