The IMS work has developed with the idea of a learner info profile 
(LIP) that helps with the organisation of the learning objects. One 
aspect of this that relates to the learner's accessibility needs is 
proposed to be added to the standard LIP.

At the meeting we shared with the IMS Accessibility WG, back in 
October, we discussed this idea. There were some comments from 
members of the WCAG WG and later, some from members of the ATAG WG. 
As the document is in draft form, and not yet public, I would like to 
ask you, or relevant others, to let me know if you have the time and 
are willing to review this bit of the profile and offer comments. I 
will then send you the draft. (Please forward this to others who 
might be interested.)

We would rather not have the draft made pubic yet.

Liddy
