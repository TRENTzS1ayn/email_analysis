I am not sure that this is language that drops straight into the document, but
the elevator speech I have queued up on this is roughly as follows:

<two-liner>

To know that the ALT text for something is wrong, it usually suffices to notice
that the ALT attribute has not been declared at all.  To know that the ALT text
is right, it takes reviewing it in a view that communicates the flow of a
speech rendering as it passes through the text to be inserted.  In context, and
without layout artifacts which distract from the flow of how it will be read by
the screen reader.

</two-liner>

<more flabby blather>

The trick is to get an author, most likely a full-vision individual with highly
developed visual focus for web design, to grok the verbal flow that one would
get in speech rendering.  Usually all this takes is an alternate visual
rendering that presents the text in a fashion that reflects the reading flow. 
The Lynx layout, or the text view in Home Page Reader are conspicuous
examples.  <unverified>It is probably not necessary that people shut their eyes
or hear the text read to get the point.</unverified>  Common blunders include:
inserting an ALT that creates a stammer, which reproduces text that will appear
just before or after the ALT anyway; and saying 'link' as the first word in the
ALT text of an image link.  The latter is not good because the screen reader
will know that a link is a link from the markup and will tell the user that by
saying 'link' just before reading the link text.

</more flabby blather>

Possible techniques:

a) [If editing in a three-panel display of synchronized views: outline view
down left column, full graphical formatted view in upper right pane,
Fixed-text-size 'text view' in lower right.]
Pop the author to the text view to cue them to insert the text in that view.

b) simplified version of this: popup ALT text capture is not into a bare
textEditBox but rather to an insertion point inside a [five-line?] fragment of
a text view centered on where the ALT will fall.

c) emulate TV crawl.  Crawl (b) onto the screen in a one-line full-width layout
rectangle and pause for entry when the ALT-insertion point gets front and
center.

Possible document includes:

Home Page Reader screen shot.  Amaya screen shot.  

Actually, I think that it takes a tightly coupled one-two punch:  "How to write
good ALT text" stuff fit for authors and "How to help authors write good ALT
text" extensions of the discussion for tool builders.  The latter to be
consumed in the company of the former.  Simply having a hyperlink,
unfortunately doesn't suffice to get people to read something else.

Whoever writes this up should please revisit Alan Flavell's ALT text page, and
mine, too which is at

 affective messaging and effective mode-crossing (desc example) 
 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/wai-tech-comments/2001Aug/0001.html

And probably the section of Mike's book that deals with this.
