Liddy,

I'm still trying to get DC to fix a problem with the language meta tag.
<HTML lang="en-US"> is very redundant with the <meta scheme="rfc1766" name
="DC.Language" content="en-us"/>

Who in DC can help fix this?

Authors, tools, and ATs are confused which to support.

Phill and Charles

DC has just OK'd the new DC Accessibility IG and I am about to launch
that - so that will be the perfect place for this discussion.

The aim of the DC Accessibility IG is to work on Accessibility
metadata - with the pay-off that will come from being part of one of
the most effective standard movements...DC is starting to be
everywhere.

stay tuned!


Liddy
