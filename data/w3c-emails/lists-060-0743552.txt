This from the niso (DAISY talking book standard), a response to the
submission. 

It is unclear what the rationale is for which elements have a lang
attribute, which have an xml:lang attribute, and which have neither. 
(AQ: XML experts advised us that usage patterns for "xml:lang" and "lang"
were still in flux but that "lang"would generally be most suitable for our
application.  We used "xml-lang" in the DTBSMIL DTD since the SMIL
specification on which our DTD was based used it.  As to which elements were
assigned one of these attributes, that choice was made during the design of
each DTD, based on input from our European and Asian contributors, who kept
an eye on internationalization issues.)


lang, xml:lang, how should they relate?
