[I am sure whatever Mike comes up with will be good.  However, until that
emerges from the crush of work, here is try #2:]

** short -- motivation

Speech flows.

You have to know
 how an ALT will go with the flow,
or you don't know if it's good.

** long -- technique

The user has the ALT read to them in a stream of talk (think radio).  

  A lot of 
    the phrasing
    implicit in
    the layout
  is lost.

So the author must understand how their ALT will come across in context.

The author is cruising along in visual engagement with their task and product. 
They have been thinking intensely about the layout for the content.

The tool has to get the author _out_ of the box of perceiving the content as it
is structured by the layout, so as to recognize the more streaming, fluid
structure that is in effect in reading.  It is the latter that governs the way
the ALT text will be understood by the eyes-free user.

To achieve this change of perspective, an alternate layout of the text view
with some material from both before and after would seem to be the
cost-effective technique.  It's easier to feed the eyes something reflecting
the flow as it comes across in the user's ears than to get the author to ignore
their eyes.

So the resulting dialog is both a) WYSIWYG - self checking by the author and b)
in tune with the reading flow.

Bash the input dialog into something that evokes the linear flow of the speech
rendering, and the author will intuit how to do the right thing.

That's the basic concept.

** further details and metaComments

This still takes some footnotes.  There are non-obvious tips about how the user
agent works that should somehow be integrated in what the author gets told. 
Things like [not guaranteed to be perfect]:

Screen reader will say "link" for links, don't repeat this.

Punctuation works.  If you need to introduce a pause for phrasing in the text
readout;put a colon, semicolon, comma or period at the end of the ALT or []
around it.

I appreciate the power of succinct sentences.  On the other hand, I don't think
there is a one-liner that captures what one has to tell the tool developer
here.  It is third order stuff.  

There is the page content under work.  There is how the author will percieve
the content, and how the user will perceive the content.  There is the tool
manipulation of the content that is required to get the author out of their
incumbent and natural topology into the topology that the user will apply, in
order to grasp what text fits.  The tool builder has to design to is a
requirement which is three times removed from the web page structure.  This
formal structure of the web page is what the toolsmith is herself mired in. 
Prying her out of _that_ geometry is no mean feat.  It takes some careful
step-by-stepping to get the concept across.
