I contacted a number of you earlier to discuss the possibility of 
cancelling the AU face to face meeting on February 25th in France 
because of a conflict with the IMS Accessibility meeting occurring in 
Sydney on the same day. A number of AU members belong to the IMS 
working group. The IMS meeting has now been cancelled.

Consequently we will be holding the AU meeting on the 25th and 26th. 
It will be a working meeting with very specific tasks related to the 
techniques. I will not be able to attend but Jan will be chairing on 
my behalf. It is likely that some of the IMS members who are not now 
going to the IMS meetings will attend to discuss harmonization of 
specifications.

Please contact me if you have questions or concerns.
Jutta
