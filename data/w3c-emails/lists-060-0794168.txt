So I am not sure why it matters to tools that these things are redundant. If
they don't know which is relevant to a particular instance (and in some
environments that is already known) they can readily include both, based on
an authoring interface that just asks for the language (and doesn't require
the author to know which particular encodings are being used anyway).

  Liddy,

  I'm still trying to get DC to fix a problem with the language meta tag.
  <HTML lang="en-US"> is very redundant with the <meta scheme="rfc1766" name
  ="DC.Language" content="en-us"/>

  Who in DC can help fix this?

  Authors, tools, and ATs are confused which to support.

  Phill and Charles

  DC has just OK'd the new DC Accessibility IG and I am about to launch
  that - so that will be the perfect place for this discussion.

  The aim of the DC Accessibility IG is to work on Accessibility
  metadata - with the pay-off that will come from being part of one of
  the most effective standard movements...DC is starting to be
  everywhere.

  stay tuned!


  Liddy
