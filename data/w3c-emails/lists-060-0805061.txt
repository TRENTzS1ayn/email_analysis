I think we can do useful work and this is a good arrangement. I am 
wondering if, as the W3C meetings could include IMS people, we should 
aim for having the AU meetings AND the IMS meeting - so 25/26 for 
W3C, 27 for W3C plenary and 28/1 for IMS? I think that if we can get 
some of the IMS folk working with us on techniques, that would be 
great! It should be really helpful to them too.

I have written this in response to questions from Cathleen.
