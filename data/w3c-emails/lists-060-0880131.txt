Relatives are nice and all, but sometimes they can overstay their
welcome. So it is with the ATAG Relative Priority Checkpoints.

Attached is a proposal to kick them off the couch where they haven't
been doing much (i.e. the main ATAG techniques list) and put them to
work (in a new appendix, organized by WCAG checkpoint and better suited,
I think, to the production of high quality relative priority
techniques). This reserves the main techniques page for more general
techniques that are not tied to a single WCAG checkpoint.

Thoughts? A potential problem is that this may make generating the
techniques draft from the source documents more complicated.

Note: All the details of the proposal are only worked out down to WCAG
1.5.

Cheers,
- Jan
