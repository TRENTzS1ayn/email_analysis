Couple of comments on the document:

1. I would like to reference the document, because despite the fact that it
is only a draft, and that needs to be made clear, I think that it is already
a useful document covering an important topic. Why is it not to be referenced
under any circumsatnces?

2. I don't think it is correct to say that the ATAG reviews are not
up-to-date, although they may not be in some cases, and may not be complete
reviews. On the other hand I think it is important to point out that these
reveiws are not intended to be an exhaustive or even a particularly set, and
are only done by the group for indicative purposes to help in assessing the
group's own work and important directions to take.

In other words the group expects these to be accurate, but not exhaustive or
complete.

cheers

  AUWG, EOWG,

  For Monday, 11 February 2002, AUWG meeting, part of the meeting's agenda
  will concern the EOWG draft resource:
           "Selecting and Using Software for Web Accessibility"
           http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/impl/software4

  (FYI this is part of an implementation planning resource, the latest draft
  of which is at:
           http://www.dartmouth.edu/~shorton/eowg/implementation/10jan2002.html
  also viewable in its "collapsed" format (but currently with older content),
  which will be the first format people arrive at if going to the suite:
           http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/impl/ )
  (Note -- the links & back-links between versions are not up to date)

  For EOWG members, a reminder that this is a joint meeting with AUWG today,
  at their regular meeting time, which is:

           12:00 p.m.(noon) US Eastern Standard Time
           Telephone: +1.617.761.6200
           Conference number: 2894

  The EOWG is interested in AUWG's feedback about the "Selecting and Using
  Software..." resource. EOWG plans to circulate this document shortly for
  broader feedback.

  - Judy
