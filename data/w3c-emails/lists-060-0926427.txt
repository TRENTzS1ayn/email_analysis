I had better not say much about my relatives here, but with regards to the
proposal...

Actually I think this would provide a good way of reading the techniques in
terms of working out new techniques, or how to explain existing techniques
better. In terms of what is required for implementing a tool I don't know
whether either method is better or not.

cheers

  Relatives are nice and all, but sometimes they can overstay their

  Attached is a proposal to kick them off the couch where they haven't
  been doing much (i.e. the main ATAG techniques list) and put them to
  work (in a new appendix, organized by WCAG checkpoint and better suited,
  I think, to the production of high quality relative priority
  techniques). This reserves the main techniques page for more general
  techniques that are not tied to a single WCAG checkpoint.

  Thoughts? A potential problem is that this may make generating the
  techniques draft from the source documents more complicated.

  Note: All the details of the proposal are only worked out down to WCAG
  1.5.
