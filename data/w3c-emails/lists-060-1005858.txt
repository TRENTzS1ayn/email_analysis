http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG-wombat/ I read in detail this morning in preparation for the joint AU/EO meeting.

Intro Paragraph 4 (p4): ...use of sound is not practical ... 
?even with a headset/earphones? 
?Where no text-to-speech is available? 
?explicitly those who are deaf?.

1.3 Like your use of conformance claims "Double-A" and "Triple-A", 
that should probably be picked up in other guidelines.

Nits: different date/version forms in first <ol>, first two <li>
second with /010530  should be 20010530.

Yet a different date shows up in the following example.

2. Guidelines

Guideline 1.

1.1.  third entry (see also)

1.2. At minimum...):Accessibility  needs a space.

Guideline 2

2.1 Use the latest [approved] version of W3c Recommendations

Guideline 3

3.1.  two places reference collated text transcripts without
pointer to glossary, where it is described not thereunder
but under transcript.

3.3 At minimum .... Only an alternative that has been explicitly
associated with an object may be offered as a default entry for the 
author to approve. Some image formats (SVG) include descriptions. 
Those descriptions may be inappropriate for current use of image.

Guideline 4 

P1 Why plurals? authoring tools...  
P2 Uses singular.

4.1 Awkward bolding. Why interruptions in <strong>...</strong>.

Guideline 5

5.2 ...are among the most obvious ...  That is a judgement call,

Rationale:  ...as possible.  So is that a judgement call.

More advanced implementations example: reorder:
if ... notify the author of syntax and spelling errors while they work,
then ...

5.3 
At Minimum, when there [are both] an accessible and a less ...
at least as XvisibleX exposed ... -- not always "visible".

Guideline 7 P3  Should DOM be mentioned to support the editing view?

7.2 At minimum...by the tool, including their attributes and values.

Extra break after  See also

Glossary  

Conversion Tool   transforms content (not convent)
Move it after "Check for"

Element   Should now include XHTML.

?Element Type?  what can be offered as choice by an authoring tool,
including the attributes for it.

Presentation Markup.  After final sentence do you need to say anything
about use of presentation tables to achieve layout, the common way.

References

Add XHTML.

Why is UAAG10-TECHS mentioned, but not UAAG? UAAG should be meaningful
for the designers of authoring tools.
