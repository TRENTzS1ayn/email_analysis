So was there any action items from the call other than the agenda for the
face to face? None were listed but seemed that one or more were alluded to:

1.  Is more from AUWG needed for EOWG to point to or not?

2.  Is EOWG & JB going to include more software/tools in policy materials
or not?

And a question about the discussion:
Who's strategy [WAI?, EO?, AU?, W3C?] is it not to mention commercial
products?  Vendor neutral doesn't have to mean no vendors does it? Does
market neutral [1] mean only mentioning free products?
