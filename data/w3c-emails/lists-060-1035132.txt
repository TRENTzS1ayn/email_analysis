Feedback from the call was helpful.

More is welcome.

Change requests were logged at:
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/impl/changelog.html#20020211
but you're right, during the AUWG/EOWG joint meeting, we also discussed the 
need for EOWG to emphasize more strongly the importance of considering 
software in our various implementation support materials. I understood the 
group's reaction to support that change.

It relates to some policies of the W3C Communications Team. It does not 
necessarily mean no mention of products or of vendors. I think that this 
document raises enough questions to merit getting a consult from them on 
this, which I'll do.
