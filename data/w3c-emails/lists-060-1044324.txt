EOWG had discussed this approach, and felt that if EOWG did not provide 
some clarification in advance about what to expect when people found the 
AUWG page, that people would come away frustrated and/or angry. This is 
what our previous experience has been with sending people to the AUWG area 
to look at reviews; they came back very frustrated. So EOWG felt it would 
be helpful to have some initial clarification in the EOWG documents. At the 
same time, additional clarification in the AUWG document would certainly 
help also. But finally, my impression is that some updating of the AUWG 
reviews is now happening, and this issue may be less of a concern in the 
future. There was considerable interest in EOWG discussions in having more 
information to point to in the AUWG area, to the extent possible.

We had tried not having it in the introduction, and felt that this left the 
reader with no clear concept of what ATAG was about. At the same time, most 
users of this document would not have the technical capability to evaluate 
authoring tools against the ATAG guidelines, so it may be self-defeating to 
make those into a checklist. But we can brainstorm various solutions for 
this concern during the EOWG meeting (today or later).

Can you explain more how you envision a three-column layout here? What in 
which columns?

Also, what do you see moving into the intro? We've already moved things 
around a fair amount, so not sure which piece should move where now.

EOWG will discuss options & see where we get. Thanks for the suggestions.
