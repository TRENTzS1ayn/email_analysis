New technique:
Enable the author to output furhter content as  metadata that can be used to
construct an accessible version of the output. For example, when producing
image formats that do not include the ability to include alternative
information, , use Dublin Core emtadata toincorporate desciption, title
information, or foaf metadata to identify people depicted in images. See also
the technique about including information within image formats.
