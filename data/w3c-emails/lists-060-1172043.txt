       In 1999, Macromedia Inc. and IBM's Lotus Development Corporation entered                
       into a strategic partnership to bring web-based learning into the                       
       mainstream and create the industry's most comprehensive online teaching                 
       and learning solutions.                                                                 
                                                                                               
                                                                                               
       Under the agreement, Lotus purchased the Macromedia Pathware business and               
       rights to distribute Macromedia's industry-leading authoring products:                  
       Authorware, CourseBuilder for Dreamweaver, Dreamweaver, Director                        
       Shockwave Studio, Fireworks, and Flash.                                                 
                                                                                               
                                                                                               
       The acquisition unites two leading technologies, Lotus LearningSpace and                
       Macromedia Pathware, in a single unified platform called LearningSpace                  
       4.0. LearningSpace 4.0 is one of the leading platform for managing,                     
       tracking, and reporting web-based learning. LearningSpace 4.0 is AICC                   
       (Aviation Industry Computer-based training Committee) compliant.
