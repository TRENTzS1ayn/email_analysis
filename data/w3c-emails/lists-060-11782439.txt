IMPORTANT ORDERING INFORMATION

We can guarantee Christmas delivery for the first 75 sets ordered with "D.D.S.' 
and the first 75 sets ordered without "D.D.S."

We can probably fill all other orders by Christmas, but the bulk of the shipment 
is arriving by boat and may not be here, and clear Customs, before Christmas. 
So, order early for Christmas delivery.
