       In 1999, Macromedia Inc. and IBM's Lotus Development Corporation
entered
       into a strategic partnership to bring web-based learning into the
       mainstream and create the industry's most comprehensive online
teaching
       and learning solutions.


       Under the agreement, Lotus purchased the Macromedia Pathware
business and
       rights to distribute Macromedia's industry-leading authoring
products:
       Authorware, CourseBuilder for Dreamweaver, Dreamweaver, Director
       Shockwave Studio, Fireworks, and Flash.


       The acquisition unites two leading technologies, Lotus LearningSpace
and
       Macromedia Pathware, in a single unified platform called
LearningSpace
       4.0. LearningSpace 4.0 is one of the leading platform for managing,
       tracking, and reporting web-based learning. LearningSpace 4.0 is
AICC
       (Aviation Industry Computer-based training Committee) compliant.
