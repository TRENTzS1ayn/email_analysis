Hi,

In my opinion, the face to face meeting in Cannes was very productive. I
will be putting the minutes together and updating the group home page by
Monday. I will try and get a draft version of the Techniques with
changes out by the end of next week.

If anyone has pieces of minutes that they have not already sent to me,
please do that soon. Also, please check your action items when the
meeting minutes are posted on Monday.

Cheers,
Jan
