Jan,

    a(checkpoint#)- t(technique#)  =(or~)  w(WCAG checkpoint#) (space)
Priority Level

Where:
    a=atag
    u=uaag
    w=wcag
    p=priority
    t=technique
 
    a(checkpoint#)- t(technique#)  =(or~)  w(WCAG checkpoint#) (space)
Priority Level

    a3.2-t1=w5.2 P1
    a1.3-t2~w2.1 P1
    a6.4.1-t2=w3.2 P1

    But for ATAG 1.1, which is not relative, it would be:

    a1.1-t3

(in the main guidelines this could be used as:
    a3.2=w5.2  P1)


I think the use of lowercase letters makes the numbers easier to
determine, but that is just me. Stuck with uppercase for Priority Level
because that has been used all along.  What do you think?  This
convention could then possibly be used across all WAI  checkpoints and
technique docs.

Happy jetlag recovery.................Katie
