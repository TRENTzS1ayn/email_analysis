Dear Sir, 

I will like to solicit your help in a business preposition which is by nature very confidential and a Top Secret I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one worried and apprehensive but I am assuring you not to worry as all will be well at the end of this endeavor. 
I am Mr.John O.Aboh, And I am one of the Executive irectors of First Bank PLC my partners and I have decided to seek your help in transfer of a huge sum of money requiring maximum confidence 

THE PREPOSITION:- 


A foreigner Late Engineer Mark  who was an oil merchant and contractor with the Federal Government of my country until his death on board with the ill fated Kenyan Airways bus{A310300}. 
Engineer Mark  was our customer at the First Bank PLC and had a balance of US$32.2million which the bank now expects his next of kin to claim as the beneficiary. 

We have made valuable efforts to get his people and to no avail as he had no known relatives due to this evelopment our management and our board of directors are making arrangements for the funds to be declared unclaimed and subsequently paid into the federal government purse and to avert this negative development. 
Me and my colleagues have decided to look for a reputable person to act as the next of kin to late MR Mark  so that the funds will be released and paid into your account and this is where you come in. 

All documents to aid your claim will be provided by me and my colleagues and for your help you will be getting a % of the total sum.
