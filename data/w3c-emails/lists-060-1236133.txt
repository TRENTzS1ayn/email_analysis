Hello all,

I have published a new working draft of the ATAG techniques that
includes the changes we made at the face to face. The draft is at:

http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/2002/WD-ATAG10-TECHS-20020308/

Section 3.2, 4.1 and 4.2 are still quite rough, so perhaps the telecon
on Monday will help clear up some of the issues.

The Issues list is not yet updated. I hope to have that done on Monday.

Cheers,
Jan
