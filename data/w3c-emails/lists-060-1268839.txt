In general - well done Jan. it looks very good. And the inclusion of 
info wrt education will be very useful, I believe, so glad we have 
managed that.

  For example, if an authoring tool for designing on-line courses 
(courseware) a prefabricated chat facility that the instructor can 
drag on to their page, this component must comply with all the 
techniques for accessible output (guidelines 1-6) and accessible user 
interface (guideline 7).

THE AUTHOR HAVING CONTROL OVER the raw markup or code of the output 
format.

FOR CONSISTENCY WITH WHAT FOLLOWS. BTW,  I ASSUME THAT ACCESS TO CODE 
IS IRRELEVANT UNLESS IT COMES WITH CONTROL OVER CODE???



WOULD IT BE HELPFUL IF THE DEFINITION
Tools for converting content from one format to another. This 
includes tools for changing the format of images, for conversion of 
other document formats to XHTML, and tools for importing document 
formats.

Recommendations (see WCAG10 11.1). For example, use MathML for 
mathematical Web content and XHTML, MathML, and DOM scripting to 
implement a dynamic-interactive spreadsheets.

Provide a preview mode that displays alternative content. Although 
this can give authors a clear understanding of some problems very 
easily, it should be made clear that there are many ways in which a 
page may be presented

this MAY QUICKLY give authors a clear understanding of some problems 
[DELETE very easily], THEY  [DELETE it] should be WARNED [DELETE made 
clear that] there are many OTHER UNPREDICTABLE ways in which a page 
may be presented

WHEN DEALING WITH THIS
Short Text Labels (for alternate text, titles, etc.): These types of 
alternative equivalents require only short text strings from the 
author, so the prompts for them may be best located as text boxes 
within property dialogs, etc. An important consideration is that the 
function of the object (decorative, button, spacer, etc.) will be 
important to the instructions given to the author on what to write. 
The object function may be prompted for or discovered by automated 
heuristics.
WOULD IT BE HELPFUL TO HAVE TWO BITS - ONE CHOSEN FROM A CONTROLLED 
VOCAB THAT SAYS WHAT THE FUNCTION OF THE OBJECT IS, AND ANOTHER THAT 
IS THE TEXT TO BE TYPED IN??? MAYBE THIS IS A MATTER FOR WCAG??? BUT 
IF THE FUNCTION WERE DECLARED, WOULDN'T THE TEXT BIT BE MORE EASILY 
TESTED? AND SOMETIMES MORE EASILY GENERATED AUTOMATICALLY? SO A 
TECHNIQUE IS TO HAVE A PULL-DOWN LIST OF THE FUNCTIONAL VOCAB.

Transcripts of Audio or Video: The author should be prompted for the 
location of a preexisting transcript of the audio or video. Failing 
this, one will have to be created. Although transcript writing is an 
involved process for long media files, tools might include simple 
transcription writing suites (with built-in media players) for short 
media files.

Audio Descriptions of Video: The author should be prompted for the 
location of a described version of the video. The recording of 
traditional video descriptions (that are encoded into the video file 
where silent periods occur in the original soundtrack) is an involved 
process that the average author is probably not equipped to 
undertake. However, technologies are becoming available that allow 
the audio description files to be stored as an externally and played, 
at the user's option, while the original video is automatically 
paused.

location of the alternative content. If this fails, the tool might 
start the author off by stripping the problematic element (table, 
dynamic content, etc.) from a copy of the content.
