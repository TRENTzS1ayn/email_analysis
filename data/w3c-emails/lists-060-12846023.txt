Sir/Madam,

I am PRINCE AZU ZUBBY the Chief Accountant of the
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) headquarters 
in Lagos , Nigeria. I reliably got your contact from 
Nigeria Chamber of Commerce. 
I have no reason to doubt your honesty and credibility 
hence I make this proposal to you. Please, treat with 
utmost confidence and excuse me for the embarrassment 
this letter might cause you as we have not met or known 
each other before.

I have the mandate of my colleagues in office to solicite 
for your assistance for a deal we want to execute, My 
Corporation (NNPC) awarded a contract of US$86,700,000.00 
(Eighty - Six Million, Seven Hundred Thousand U.S 
Dollars) to a Foreign firms to supply Rig & Drilling 
Equipment for Kaduna Refinery here in Nigeria but because 
of my position, this contract was over invoiced to 
US$115,300,000.00 (One Hundred and Fifteen Million, Three 
Hundred Thousand United State Dollars). The origina the 
contractors that executed the project, now we are
left with the over- invoice sum of US$28,600,000.00
(Twenty Eight Million, Six Hundred Thousand U.S.
Dollars Only).

All arrangements have been concluded on how this money
would be moved. Our constraints lie on the fact that
we required a foreign firm or individual account number 
where the money will be paid into; whose owner will be 
portrayed as a contract beneficiary of fund.
Infact this is why I am writing you this letter.
NOTE:- There is no risk involved as we have taken care, 
loopholes covered.

As a civil servant, we are aware that some financial
assistance would be required to conclude this job, we
are prepared to give as much as 35% of the total sum
to whoever that is willing to assist, while 60% of the
total sum will go for me and my colleagues. To this
effect, 5% would be earmarked to cover all the expenses 
(Local and International). This is because the process 
would pass through some Directors in the Ministry of 
Finance and Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).
These officials might require some tips to facilitate
payment without delay since they are not aware of the
deal.

Please, should you be willing to assist, we shall require 
the following information to enable us put claim mediately. 
Your bank name, Address and Account Number, Fax number of 
the Bank where the money will be transferred into.

But should you not be in a position to assist, this deal 
has to remain a secret till the end of time. It is 
important I mention that the officials involved in this 
transaction are top Government Functionaries who have 
put in years of service to this Country. For the 
maintenance of personal integrity and prestige of all 
persons involved in this transaction, you are implored to 
exhibit utmost secrecy throughout the duration of the 
transaction. You are strongly advise to avoid discussing 
this You may open a separate bank account in any Country 
for this purpose if you wish. All arrangements of this 
transfer for this quarter payment for the year, 
2002 has been properly organised and further action awaits 
your immediate response. Hurry and send to me the Account 
Number where the money will be transferred into, so that we 
can start to process for the approval of this payment.
