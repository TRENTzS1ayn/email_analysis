I am assuming that the two cases we are talking about are "live production" -
such as webcasting an event as it happens - and synchronous collaborative
authoring, where two or more people are engaged in working on the same
document interactively.

In many cases this is the same thing we are already talking about, with a
timing constraint of sorts. It is no good to go back afterwards and fix
everything, but it is possible in both kinds of cases that one person is
specifically responsible for a given type of content.

For example, the people who provide voice commentary for TV coverage of an
event are rarely the people who provide the real-time captioning, nor is
their voice commentary used as radio commentary - since the needs of the
audiences are different, there are different commentators. On
http://www.cricinfo.com there are real-time streams of text commentary, and
often of radio commentary as well (and sometimes even of video with
commentary!).

In the case of synchronous collaborative work, it might be helpful to think
of a meeting. Many of us in this group have been at meetings where there were
people simultaneously providing sign language or text interpretation of
voice, voice descriptions of images, etc.

So I guess one of the things we need to look for is tools that support
generating content in formats that can handle a variety of concurrent forms
(things like SMIL and SVG spring to mind), and techniques that tools can
apply to enable the joint or solo production of those forms concurrently.

Lots of shortcuts for things people need, or use often.

(On the other hand, I have no idea what you should call this stuff)
