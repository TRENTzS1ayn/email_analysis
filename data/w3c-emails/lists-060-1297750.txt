yes
In the WG meeting this am we were wondering what to call this kind of 
thing. Carlos said that 'real-time' authoring did not work very well 
for him. We tried synchronous, instantaneous, etc .. and it is still 
open, i think.

I think that Charles' ideas here are going to be useful to explain 
what we are talking about, whatever word/s we choose.
And we are in need of techniques, so this input is helpful.
