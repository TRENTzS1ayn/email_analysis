Liddy.........I like 'live', that is a instance/context specific word
that works in my mind (from a US point of view).........so.......though
they seem a mouthful..............

In general use:

'live' authoring
Or
Real-time/live authoring
Or
Live real-time authoring


For Synchronous and Asynchronous specific use:

Synchronous 'live' authoring 
or 
Synchronous Real-time/live authoring
Or
Live real-time synchronous authoring

AND

Asynchronous 'live' authoring 
or 
Asynchronous Real-time/live authoring
Or
Live real-time asynchronous authoring

Thinking about it, I am tempted to suggest that as we use synchronous 
and asynchronous for communication, we should do the same for 
authoring but with the explanation that this means 'real-time' or 
'live' authoring...
