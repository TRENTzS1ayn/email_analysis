Hi,

With regard to Liddy's edits:

- All changes judged to be editorial have been incorporated into the
next working draft.

- Non-Editorial Changes:

--- Overview -----------------------------------------

> Tools for converting content from one format to another. This includes
> tools for changing the format of images, for conversion of other
> document formats to XHTML, and tools for importing document formats
> AND DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND SERVERS.

JR: Doesn't "Content Management Tools" cover DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
AND SERVERS?

--- imp1 ---------------------------------------------

> When generating a natural language translation of text, produce the
> simplest and clearest possible use of the new language. [T????] @@CMN
> Proposal@@
> SEEMS TO ME TO NEED SOME BETTER WORKING - 'THE SIMPLEST AND CLEAREST
> POSSIBLE' !!!  I THINK THE AIM IS TO SUPPORT, EG  PEOPLE WHO NEED
> LITERAL AS OPPOSED TO METAPHORIC OR POETIC TEXT BUT THIS NEEDS TO BE
> SPELT OUT MORE CLEARLY, I THINK.

JR: Can you propose new text?

> 1.3 - I THINK THIS SHOULD BE
> Ensure that when the tool automatically generates CONTENT OR markup

JR: This is already an issue. Does the group agree?

--- imp2 ---------------------------------------------

> I THINK
>   If the tool produces inaccessible markup, whether it is valid or
> not, see ATAG10 4.1 for checking techniques.
> IS TRYING TO SAY
>   If the tool produces VALID markup, see ATAG10 4.1 for ACCESSIBILITY
> checking techniques.

JR: How about: "Even if the tool produces valid markup, see ATAG10 4.1
for ACCESSIBILITY
checking techniques.

--- imp3 ---------------------------------------------


> Provide a preview mode that displays alternative content. Although
> this MAY QUICKLY give authors a clear understanding of some problems
> [DELETE very easily], THEY  [DELETE it] should be WARNED [DELETE made
> clear that] there are many OTHER UNPREDICTABLE ways in which a page
> may be presented

JR: OK, but I used "less predictable" instead of "unpredictable".

> WHEN DEALING WITH THIS
> Short Text Labels (for alternate text, titles, etc.): These types of
> alternative equivalents require only short text strings from the
> author, so the prompts for them may be best located as text boxes
> within property dialogs, etc. An important consideration is that the
> function of the object (decorative, button, spacer, etc.) will be
> important to the instructions given to the author on what to write.
> The object function may be prompted for or discovered by automated
> heuristics.
> WOULD IT BE HELPFUL TO HAVE TWO BITS - ONE CHOSEN FROM A CONTROLLED
> VOCAB THAT SAYS WHAT THE FUNCTION OF THE OBJECT IS, AND ANOTHER THAT
> IS THE TEXT TO BE TYPED IN??? MAYBE THIS IS A MATTER FOR WCAG??? BUT
> IF THE FUNCTION WERE DECLARED, WOULDN'T THE TEXT BIT BE MORE EASILY
> TESTED? AND SOMETIMES MORE EASILY GENERATED AUTOMATICALLY? SO A
> TECHNIQUE IS TO HAVE A PULL-DOWN LIST OF THE FUNCTIONAL VOCAB.

JR: Good idea - for WCAG.

> However, technologies are becoming

> and played, at the user's option, while the original video is
> automatically paused.
> DOES AUTOMATICALLY PAUSED WORK HERE? SHOULD IT BE ACCOMPANIED BY
> SOMETHING ABOUT MAKING THE VIDEO USER CONTROLLED?

JR: What about "However, technologies are becoming available that allow
the audio description files to be stored separately, to be played only
if requested by the user."
