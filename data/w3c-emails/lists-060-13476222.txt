Hello WAI Education & Outreach WG Member,

WELCOME: 
This message welcomes you to the mailing list for the W3C WAI Education &
Outreach Working Group.

You are on this based on either your reply to the EO WG Call for
Participation, or your indication during the March 21, 1998 meeting of your
interest in participating in the EO WG.  

PLEASE ACKNOWLEDGE:  
Please reply directly to me at jbrewer@w3.org (rather than to the list) to
acknowledge that you've received this, or to let me know if you're on this
in error.

CHARTER:  
The charter for the EO WG is at http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Charter .  I'll be
adding some notes to reflect some parallel activities under the WAI-TIDE
(European-funded) portion of the WAI.

MEMBERS:  
I've put together a list of EO WG members at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/EOWG-members .  I expect some additional members
over the next month or two.  Please check your name & info on the list.  

MINUTES:  
Minutes from the EO WG meeting on March 21 in Los Angeles are posted at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/EOWG-min-9803 .  

MEETINGS:  
We're rather spread out, geographically, which should make it interesting
to have real-time meetings.  We may not be able to have phone meetings at
times that are convenient to all, or we may need to rotate times.  Please
include in your message to jbrewer@w3.org your availability at either of
these two times for a first phone meeting: 
* Wednesday, May 27, 10:00 a.m. - 11:30 a.m. US EDT
* Thursday, May 28, 10:30 a.m. - 11:30 a.m. US EDT

UPCOMING BUSINESS:
Please be on the lookout later this week for materials on this list for
review & comment.

Thanks, and looking forward to working together.

Regards,

Judy
