All of us (I believe) spend some time every day sending polite little
emails to webmasters with various accessibility implorations:

1) your site is wonderful, congratulations.
2) your site would be very helpful if it were slightly revised to
reflect the WAI guidelines.
3) your site is a disgrace and is probably actionable under federal law.

The first and third of these are only rarely used but the second is so
frequent that it would be very helpful for us to compose a "boiler
plate" email that could easily be sent by entering an email address at
the EO page.  This could also provide a repository for listing the sites
targeted and their responses as well as providing a medium for
volunteers who usually appear to help willing webmasters make their
sites accessible.

Since the wording of this oft-repeated message is crucial to the success
of the E&O undertaking, I would like to have someone less abrasive than
me write it <sheepish grin>.

Love.
