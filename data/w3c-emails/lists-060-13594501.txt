[Thread starter]

One of our "deliverables" is to develop a comprehensive list of events
which we need to have a Web accessibility presence at.

List would include Web/Internet events, disability community, research
community, government, etc.

I think we should annotate the list with at minimum:
- key audiences attending
- submission dates for calls for papers, etc
- is someone already covering the event or do we need to arrange coverage
- other?

Please look at this page for starters: 

www.interport.net/~kitch

...and here is a note from Kitch about her page:

"Don't forget to look at the section called "Past 1998 Conferences".
Instead of removing conferences that have already taken place, I decided to
start archiving so we know where to submit next year."

This isn't a comprehensive list, and there are many more out there.  We can
bounce it out to the WAI IG for additional comment once we get it more
developed, but this is for starters. 

Can you please:

- reply to this thread with pointers to additional lists?

- comment on how we should best organize this to help plan coverage?

Regards,

Judy
