Another deliverable is a policy reference listing.  

Within the US, there are 4 or more laws or related policies that somehow
relate to Web accessibility.  I can pull together a reference listing for
those, but need pointers to policies outside the US.

In the US:
- Section 504 of the Rehab Act (indirectly)
- Section 508 of the Rehab Act (still somewhat indirect)
- ADA, particular via US DOJ opinion on Web accessibility
- Section 255 of Telecommunications Act (although it doesn't address Web as
much as it might...)

In Canada, what are the relevant laws, regs, policies?

In Australia, my understanding is New South Wales has stringent guidelines,
federally less so but still general guidelines?

In Europe, different countries have different levels of requirements, and
there is no EU-wide requirement yet?

Asian countries, any requirements to date?

If you have information on these, please send pointers so we can compile
them.  Let me know if you have a particular interest in hunting some of
this down.  

Thanks

Judy
