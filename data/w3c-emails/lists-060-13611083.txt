[thread starter]

Following our last meeting I talked to some developers of interactive CD's
& Web sites.  At this point I'm leaning more towards prioritizing a
pre-whacked Web site ahead of the CD, which was the gist of comments in
last meeting.  

Would appreciate suggestions on content.  This would be for a packaged Web
site explaining & instructing & demonstrating Web accessibility, that
companies or organizations could grab, pull behind their firewall, and
customize if they wanted to, but still leaving W3C/WAI identity.

Content:

- multiple starting points (some for managers, other for technical people,
other for non-technical staff who write basic pages, etc.)
- comprehensive index, lots of options all visible up front
- reference materials including business case, guidelines, sample code,
policy requirements
- self-instructional modules to introduce/ help implement page author
guidelines
- demos of good & bad design
- demos of voice browsing, access technologies etc where possible
- design samples for accessible pages
- evaluation & repair tools
- WAI project reference description
- reference links for more info
- other?

Questions:

Comments/critique on content?

Suggestions how to make it highly attractive, usable, updatable?

- Judy
