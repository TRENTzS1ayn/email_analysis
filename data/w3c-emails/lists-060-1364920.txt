I think Heather has captured some of the nuances .... and shown how 
hard it is to come up with a good solution - the most telling point 
is that people will want to choose how their computer/software treats 
them - and they will probably choose for it to be silent unless they 
are convinced they are getting helpful advice from it ...   but the 
difference is broadcast vs interaction surely?  and then we might 
ask, how reasonable is it in real time interaction to determine if 
there are accessibility needs not being met? guess this is not what 
we want users to have to do?
