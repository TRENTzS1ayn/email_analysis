I gathered a bunch of pointers while looking for European specific
events (without much success may I say, most of it in US centric).

> - comment on how we should best organize this to help plan coverage?

I think we need to cover both
 - the "specialized" conf, like CSUN, TIDE, or even WWW conf, whose
 audience are the assistive technology and disability geeks, and
 where we can assume people are aware of the issues and just need to
 be kept up-to-date with recent WAI development.
 - the "generic" conference, like Networld+Interop, Seybold, CeBit,
 for Web designer, ISP, etc, where people really need to be presented
 with the situation as if it was new to them.

The people covering the first set of events need to be as close as
possible to the WAI project (ideally W3C staff). The second set can be
done by different speakers, based on more stable materials.

Event of particular importance are I think things like (as seen on Yahoo)
  NetMedia 98 - an annual Internet conference which aims to bring
  journalists up-to-date on developments in digital media technologies
  
Because it has the potential of dominoing to the entire community of
Internet users.

Also of importance are the specialized Mobile Computing/PDA conf,
which could draw in more support from people that otherwise might not
see the relation between Web accessibility and them.
