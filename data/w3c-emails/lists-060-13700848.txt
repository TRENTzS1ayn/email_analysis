Thanks. :)

It's nothing yet; it's something I wrote up quickly and I needed
response about if it's useful, and what needs fixing. :)  It's a
very rough draft, and thus could probably use a rewrite on every-
thing.

I was writing it with the target audience of "people who do web
authoring but don't know HTML 4.0 from CSS2 from a hole in the
ground" -- i.e., most Guild members :), and the people I work with
at Claremont Graduate University.

Good point. :)

Yeah, I agree, smaller is better. :)

I like this.  I always write a lot and distill it down, because it's
easier to cut out when editing -- for me, at least.

Good point.  My goal is to reach behind the authoring guidelines
and reveal the core building blocks on which they're based; that
way someone who is knowledgable can form their own "internal
guidelines" in the same way the WAI groups write them -- by knowing
what the principles are, and applying them to specific cases.

Thanks for the feedback -- do you think this document is worth
working on and refining?  Or is this a backwards approach (well,
yes, it _is_ a backwards approach) that should be set aside for
now?

[Is this the appropriate list to discuss things like this, by the
way?]
