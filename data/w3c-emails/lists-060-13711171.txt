Hello EOWG Members,

Please accept my apologies that our planned call for tomorrow, Thursday
June 18, 10:30-12:00 US EDT needs to be cancelled.  

Our next scheduled call is Thursday, July 2, 10:30-12:00 US EDT.  (We
cannot meet next week due to the W3C Advisory Committee meeting in Geneva.)
 Please look for additional information, threads, & agenda on this list in
the meantime.

Judy
