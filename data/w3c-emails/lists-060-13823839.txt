Greetings,

The relevant legislation in the UK is the Disability Discrimination Act.  
It is being phased in, and the part that would seem to apply to making sites
accessible will go live in October 1999.

The best reference I've found so far for this is at:
http://www.open.gov.uk/ndc/update.htm.

This is off the main site for the National Disability Council, which gives
useful general background to the legislation:

Peter.

   >In the US:

   >- Section 508 of the Rehab Act (still somewhat indirect)
   >- ADA, particular via US DOJ opinion on Web accessibility

   >In Canada, what are the relevant laws, regs, policies?

   >In Europe, different countries have different levels of
