  JR: Can you propose new text?

Given that I have an action item marked against me for this text, let me
propose the following:

  When translating text from one language to another (e.g. French to
  Japanese) produce text which uses simple grammar and common vocabulary.

  JR: This is already an issue. Does the group agree?

I agree with Liddy.

  JR: How about: "Even if the tool produces valid markup, see ATAG10 4.1
  for ACCESSIBILITY
  checking techniques.

Works for me.

  JR: Good idea - for WCAG.

I think that this also applies directly to ATAG and authoring interfaces,
which need to work out how to seperate a short functional equivalent from a
fuller description, and make it clear to that autthor what is required.
