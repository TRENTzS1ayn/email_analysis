Sorry about ducking out of that.  I was stuck with a no-win
situation -- the gardeners are supposed to come on Friday,
when my wife stays home in the morning, not Thursday.  This
is because the dogs need to be in the house while they're
doing our yard.  Of course, if the dogs are in the house,
they will then bark at the gardeners, making it very hard
for anyone to have a phone conversation. :-p

I figured the best thing to do was just wait and see what
comes out of the meeting on this list, especially since I
tend to not be awake enough for these "morning" meetings to
participate. :) I'm an evening kinda guy.

Hope everything else went well.  Lemme know if there was
anything in particular that I should be doing.
