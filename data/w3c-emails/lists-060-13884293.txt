Hi Jim,

Uhhh... that's a lot of cross-postings.  

The WAI EOWG is going to be pulling together a whole bunch of different
kinds of resources.  Let's please use the Education and Outreach Working
Group mailing list and meetings as a first round of compiling, vetting, and
getting these resources into shape, before sending out a broader call.

When we do send out a broader call, sending to w3c-wai-ig should suffice,
since the great majority of other WAI WG participants are members of the
WAI IG list, and if people aren't, it's to cut down on non-essential mail.

One of the first resources to build into Kitch's list would be the resource
that Chuck Letourneau has offered, which is quite extensive.  He re-sent it
to Kitch and to the EOWG list last week.

Also, I thought you or Kitch had said something about maintaining a
separate page from her additional one, that could be used to compile
information more tailored to WAI purposes?  

- Judy
