To complement Geoff's evaluation as agreed, I looked at these using
pwWebSpeak, LYNX under UNIX (V2.8.2) with Vocal-Eyes screen-reader,
and IE3.02 with Window-Eyes

Whilst pages which say they "use style-sheets", such as (www.w3.org/)
/style/ and /stylesheets/core/ are perfectly readable, I had no success in
getting to the sample documents using the form at
/stylesheets/core/preview/.    In all cases, whether I selected a
stylesheet, or none/default, submitting the form simply resulted in the same
page (i.e. the page with the form on it) being returned.

The form itself was dealt with by LYNX and IE3 in the normal way, though
pwWebSpeak didn't recognise all the selections.

I may be missing something, but the issue seems to be that I don't have
access to those sample documents at all via this route.

Peter.
