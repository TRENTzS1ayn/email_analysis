Hello WAI EOWG,

No meeting today, July 9th.  

Our next meeting will be next week July 16, standard time: Thursday, 10:30
to 12:00 noon US EDT.

Preliminary agenda for July 16th:
- review of reference card format
- review of compiled events calendar
- review of draft one-page flyer
- review of deliverables listing/priorities/owners
- discussion of bulletin
- update on powerpoint conversion options
- summer meeting schedule

Please post materials to this list when ready for review.  Thanks.

No meeting today because:
- too many cancellations/ INRIA bridge unavailability/ materials not yet
ready for review.

Apologies for the change in schedule.

See you next week.

Regards,

Judy
