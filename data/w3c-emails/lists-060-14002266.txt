Made most of edits from yesterday's call, just haven't plugged priorities
into the index list yet.

PRIORITIES: At today's meeting we reviewed priorities of items on the
deliverables list. If you weren't on the call, please take a look at
priorities and comment to me or to the list.

LOCALIZATION: We also need localization review. That's the question of what
parts are most critical for developing local or translated versions of.
Comments to JB or to the list.

OWNERS: If there's something that leaps out at you that you want to do and
that isn't claimed yet, please send me mail.

Thanks

- Judy
