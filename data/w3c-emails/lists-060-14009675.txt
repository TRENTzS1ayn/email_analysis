Kitch and I are working on the submission form, we need some input. Please
comment on **new item** and see explanations and questions in (stuff).

This is based on what I sent before

To All,
A conference listing site (http://www.interport.net/~kitch/eo.html) has been
established in order to keep up with the many conferences that are related
to WAI activities. The listing would also be a good place to track WAI
presentations and presence at conferences. Please submit postings to Kitch
Barnicle at kitch@afb.org or Jim Allan at allan_jm@tsb1.tsbvi.edu

Note: Coverage refers to whether there are web accessibility presentation
being conducted, or if general WAI information or presence is needed. This
field will include "see above" for presentations scheduled for the
conference; or "needed" meaning there is currently no WAI or Web
accessibility presence at the conference and it is needed.

(we need to clean this up to make it more clear--need to establish some
guidelines on what is needed and who will do what...thoughts? and <from
Kitch> "who will whether coverage is "needed". Maybe we need 3 levels of
priority (yikes!)  high - very important for some to present on wai
activities,  medium - it would be nice.... low -  well, if you're in the
area drop on by.... :)"
