The follow scenario samples/drafts are by Marja-Riitta Koivunen following
some discussion among Marja, William & me -- these are just to start some
brainstorming on how to focus these, we realize these will need more work.
(This was an action item handed to EOWG from User Agent Guidelines Working
Group.)

Direct accessibility and universal design scenarios
Marja-Riitta Koivunen

1. Sara is preparing a business report while she drives to work. She uses
her car's computer to open the report she has been writing and to search
for additional information to complete her report. Sometimes her whole
attention is on driving and she needs to ask the computer to stop and go
back a couple of sentences. She searches additional info by saying things
like, read me the next ten links in the document, go to the next link
connecting to a Xerox PARC site, find a picture about MIT, or find a
paragraph talking about Marvin Minsky in the middle of  the document. She
can also search a certain place on a page by saying the 3rd paragraph or
the second title or the two thirds point of the document. Sometimes she
hopes the browser could allow her to mark a heavily used place in a
document and attach a name to it just for her own purposes, but that is not
possible yet. Her computer interrupts at various intervals to advise her of
route adjustments to avoid traffic congestion. 

2. Jeffrey is in the second grade at the local public school. They have a
small class with both hearing and deaf students. Jeffrey is exited about
dolphins and decides to do his homework assignment about their natural
life. He goes to web to search some documents with the search engines and
finds some really nice multimedia material. He looks at the video clip
where the dolphins are jumping and reads the captioning synchronized to the
video. The captioning is usually always turned on in his browser at home,
but when he uses it from other places he needs to customize the browser
manually or extract the settings by giving an address to his settings web
page. The communication of the dolphins in the video gets Jeffrey really
interested. He clicks the video to get more information on that subject but
is not happy with the information offered to him. Therefore he stops the
video for a while to go back and see the whole captioning text in one
window. In this way it is easier for him to reflect the new issues and go
and search additional information from the web. He founds videos that show
the waveforms of the audio sounds while playing the sounds. Jeffrey smiles,
this will be great addition for his presentation tomorrow.

3. Henry needs to find a restaurant for a his date tonight. He picks Ruth
up from her home in Brookline and discusses with her shortly what they
would like to try this evening. Ruth is blind so she always carries with
her a hand held palmPC with GPS capabilities. GPS helps enormously when she
is walking in unknown areas of the city and trying to find places.
Furthermore, the palmPC is often a good icebreaker as most people are very
exited about it. Henry and Ruth decide to search for restaurants within 6
miles from their current location and sort them according to the cuisine.
The palmPC offers it's own data base of services and Ruth has added couple
of more links to pages with restaurants in different areas. The query looks
through all the data and creates a table as a result. Ruth asks it to list
the found cuisine types and number of restaurants in each. As the Chinese
restaurants are mentioned Ruth asks to stop for a while and filter them
out, as they have been in so many of them lately. The rest of the data they
run against Ruth's favorite RDF based  restaurant rating page expanded with
her own ratings to see where they can get good food with reasonable prices.
The new nearby French restaurants looks like a good choice and they ask the
palmPC to guide them there.

4. Maria is a freelance technical writer for electronic media working
mainly at home. She decides to buy a scanner for her computer mainly to OCR
pages. Maria goes to web to look some info from the electronic net stores.
She has trouble seeing as she is getting older. Therefore she uses audio
reader with the visual info still turned on as it helps her to orientate.
She asks the computer to go through the categories in her bookmarks list to
find links to the stores she has saved earlier. She goes to one on the
stores and asks the browser to find a page from the site containing search
function. In this way she can immediately go and search for a list of
scanners offered by the store without listening a lot of info. She marks
couple of interesting scanners with a new annotation feature that lets her
create links directly to any objects within a web page by using DOM and
XLL. Then she goes to Altavista to search comparison articles of scanners.
She finds a good article with a comparison table. She first listens the
features, then the article writer's positive and negative comments and then
orders the table according to the costs. After making her decision she goes
to an intermediate net store site to search all the prices and stores that
carry the scanner. As a results she gets yet another table that she
navigates through with arrow keys and settles for a store she has used
before. She fills in the order form which is easy as the reader stops and
waits for her fill-ins before continuing reading.

5. William is a keen netsurfer. He has had quadriplegia since he was ten
and the net gives him a lot of possibilities chatting with other people and
changing opinions. Now he is exited as he is getting old enough to vote for
the first time. Naturally, he wants to do it by himself on the net. He
takes voting very seriously searching information on the candidates
opinions, asking questions from them and attending videoconferences with
live discussions between candidates and voters. He also looks information
on pending legislation and commentaries on proposed government projects or
regulations. Technically the most difficult part in the voting process is
the identification of a person and still keeping the vote anonymous. The
actual voting is easy. William first registers to vote by using voice
recognition to fill-in a form. As return he gets a special non-tractable
code that he can use once at the actual voting. At the actual voting
William is given a page with the candidates numbers, names and pictures
with a link to additional info. When William selects a name the info of the
person is shown once more and  the system asks for acceptance. William
replies happily YES and sees immediate feedback thanking for giving his vote.
