some discussion among Marja, William & me -- these are just to start some
brainstorming on how to focus these, we realize these will need more work.
(This was an action item handed to EOWG from User Agent Guidelines Working
Group.)

>Direct accessibility and universal design scenarios
>Marja-Riitta Koivunen
>
>1. Sara is preparing a business report while she drives to work. She uses
>her car's computer to open the report she has been writing and to search
>for additional information to complete her report. Sometimes her whole
>attention is on driving and she needs to ask the computer to stop and go
>back a couple of sentences. She searches additional info by saying things
>like, read me the next ten links in the document, go to the next link
>connecting to a Xerox PARC site, find a picture about MIT, or find a
>paragraph talking about Marvin Minsky in the middle of  the document. She
>can also search a certain place on a page by saying the 3rd paragraph or
>the second title or the two thirds point of the document. Sometimes she
>hopes the browser could allow her to mark a heavily used place in a
>document and attach a name to it just for her own purposes, but that is not
>possible yet. Her computer interrupts at various intervals to advise her of
>route adjustments to avoid traffic congestion. 
>
>2. Jeffrey is in the second grade at the local public school. They have a
>small class with both hearing and deaf students. Jeffrey is exited about
>dolphins and decides to do his homework assignment about their natural
>life. He goes to web to search some documents with the search engines and
>finds some really nice multimedia material. He looks at the video clip
>where the dolphins are jumping and reads the captioning synchronized to the
>video. The captioning is usually always turned on in his browser at home,
>but when he uses it from other places he needs to customize the browser
>manually or extract the settings by giving an address to his settings web
>page. The communication of the dolphins in the video gets Jeffrey really
>interested. He clicks the video to get more information on that subject but
>is not happy with the information offered to him. Therefore he stops the
>video for a while to go back and see the whole captioning text in one
>window. In this way it is easier for him to reflect the new issues and go
>and search additional information from the web. He founds videos that show
>the waveforms of the audio sounds while playing the sounds. Jeffrey smiles,
>this will be great addition for his presentation tomorrow.
>
>3. Henry needs to find a restaurant for a his date tonight. He picks Ruth
>up from her home in Brookline and discusses with her shortly what they
>would like to try this evening. Ruth is blind so she always carries with
>her a hand held palmPC with GPS capabilities. GPS helps enormously when she
>is walking in unknown areas of the city and trying to find places.
>Furthermore, the palmPC is often a good icebreaker as most people are very
>exited about it. Henry and Ruth decide to search for restaurants within 6
>miles from their current location and sort them according to the cuisine.
>The palmPC offers it's own data base of services and Ruth has added couple
>of more links to pages with restaurants in different areas. The query looks
>through all the data and creates a table as a result. Ruth asks it to list
>the found cuisine types and number of restaurants in each. As the Chinese
>restaurants are mentioned Ruth asks to stop for a while and filter them
>out, as they have been in so many of them lately. The rest of the data they
>run against Ruth's favorite RDF based  restaurant rating page expanded with
>her own ratings to see where they can get good food with reasonable prices.
>The new nearby French restaurants looks like a good choice and they ask the
>palmPC to guide them there.
>
>4. Maria is a freelance technical writer for electronic media working
>mainly at home. She decides to buy a scanner for her computer mainly to OCR
>pages. Maria goes to web to look some info from the electronic net stores.
>She has trouble seeing as she is getting older. Therefore she uses audio
>reader with the visual info still turned on as it helps her to orientate.
>She asks the computer to go through the categories in her bookmarks list to
>find links to the stores she has saved earlier. She goes to one on the
>stores and asks the browser to find a page from the site containing search
>function. In this way she can immediately go and search for a list of
>scanners offered by the store without listening a lot of info. She marks
>couple of interesting scanners with a new annotation feature that lets her
>create links directly to any objects within a web page by using DOM and
>XLL. Then she goes to Altavista to search comparison articles of scanners.
>She finds a good article with a comparison table. She first listens the
>features, then the article writer's positive and negative comments and then
>orders the table according to the costs. After making her decision she goes
>to an intermediate net store site to search all the prices and stores that
>carry the scanner. As a results she gets yet another table that she
>navigates through with arrow keys and settles for a store she has used
>before. She fills in the order form which is easy as the reader stops and
>waits for her fill-ins before continuing reading.
>
>5. William is a keen netsurfer. He has had quadriplegia since he was ten
>and the net gives him a lot of possibilities chatting with other people and
>changing opinions. Now he is exited as he is getting old enough to vote for
>the first time. Naturally, he wants to do it by himself on the net. He
>takes voting very seriously searching information on the candidates
>opinions, asking questions from them and attending videoconferences with
>live discussions between candidates and voters. He also looks information
>on pending legislation and commentaries on proposed government projects or
>regulations. Technically the most difficult part in the voting process is
>the identification of a person and still keeping the vote anonymous. The
>actual voting is easy. William first registers to vote by using voice
>recognition to fill-in a form. As return he gets a special non-tractable
>code that he can use once at the actual voting. At the actual voting
>William is given a page with the candidates numbers, names and pictures
>with a link to additional info. When William selects a name the info of the
>person is shown once more and  the system asks for acceptance. William
>replies happily YES and sees immediate feedback thanking for giving his vote.
