Oh, noo! Several people have pointed out that Easter Monday is a 
holiday in many countries. How many people are actually available on 
April 1st? If we have enough confirmed participants we will hold a 
teleconference, if not we will shift it to April 8th and resolve 
issues on the list in the mean time.
