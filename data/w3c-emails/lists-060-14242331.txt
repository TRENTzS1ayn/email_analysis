Discussion version of a reference card: length of alt text

I suggested that an alt text should be restricted to 5 words to avoid
having to provide an explanation about the problems of placeholders
overlapping alt text. I thought that it would take up too much space if we
attempted both to  explain the problem and outline various solutions.

of the picture and include it in the alt part of the <img src> tag.
 (If you have specified height and width for your image placeholder,
 please make sure that it doesn't hide the alt text). alt is used like this:
