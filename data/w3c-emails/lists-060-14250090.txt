Stella: "In a similar way, is there a need for both a print and on-line
version of a Quick Reference Guide?"

WL:: Although I personally see no need for a print version, it seems
that if proper use is made of CSS that there could be such for those
cases when one needed to have something made at Kinko's when needed. 
The idea of chopping down a bunch of trees isn't too appealing although
to take something home from a conference might be OK.  It just seems
that for anyone to have any use for this they would have to be able to
get it from the Web anyhow.

I believe Stella's "suggested content" is fine and because of our medium
it can be honed at will.

As to her question: "is the guideline "Supply text versions of visuals"
unclear, or unhelpful because it deliberately omits any technical
details?" I defer to the judgement of whoever wants to use the guideline
to judge what's appropriate for the intended audience.  I like *terse*
but sometimes it just doesn't quite seem likely that there is much
chance that it has the possibility of having a likelihood of getting the
opportunity of working out - if you take my meaning.
