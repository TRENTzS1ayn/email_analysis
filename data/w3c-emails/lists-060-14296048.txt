Re: Quick reference card agenda item for audio call on 13th August.

I don't want to clutter the list by submitting the updated draft versions
of the basic overviews and guides that I have created. If you will be
participating in the audio conference call then please email me by 17:00 US
EDT on 13th August, and I will send the text files.
