Hi Stella,

Please feel free to go ahead and "clutter up" the EO list with your drafts
-- that way we'll all have the drafts before the meeting, without chances
of missed e-mails, and we can see each other's comments.  Some folks who
can't be on the call may want to comment as well.

Everyone in the EO Working Group has agreed to be reviewing postings
(http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/charter.htm#commit).  A lot of the list traffic
in the coming months will be reviewing drafts of each other's work, so we
might as well dig in.  

Thanks,

Judy
