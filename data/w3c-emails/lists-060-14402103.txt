I'm afraid I started an interesting thread on the Computer Book Publishing
listserve and the subject of the ADA mandating Web sites be accessible has
come up.

I remember someone talking about a court ruling where the judge found that
an organization must make their Web site accessible. Can anyone cite the
case for me??
