Hi B.K.,

That was me, citing US DOJ OCR _opinion_, Sept 1996, ADA Title II and Title
III entities need to have their Web sites accessible, not a court ruling,
listed in National Disability Law Reporter Sept 1997 issue.  ADA itself
passed in 1990 and so pre-dates Web.  

Policy area of EOWG to be organized & available in draft within the next 2
weeks or so, in the meantime can go to WAI Interest Group archive linked
from http://www.w3.org/WAI/IG and look for mail from Jan-March 1998 sent by
Cynthia Waddell, which lists & discusses the ruling.  Or I'll send a better
pointer later this weekend.
