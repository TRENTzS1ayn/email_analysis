blindness is to be found in the recently published 'The Epidemiology of
Eye Disease' edited by Gordon J. Johnson, Darwin C. Minassian and Robert
Weale, Chapman & Hall Medical, London, Weinheim, New York, Tokyo,
Melbourne, Madras, 1998.

I'm sending this to you by snail so that you can have a quick look at
Chapter 1. "Prevalence, Incidence and Distribution of Visual Impairment";
if you're satisfied with this as a basis we will then have to interpret it
by produce economic bloc figures by age; we can then apply these to market
data.

I am also sending you by snail EU data on disability. This is more vague
in some ways than the eye stuff but more useful in market terms. I
thought, in any case, you might like to take a quick look at "Approach to
IT and Communications Industry into the Needs of People with
Disabilities"; it's not formally published yet so don't quote it but as
the tables are not primary material you can quote them.

Both of these are mine so please send them back when you've finished with
them.

Yours



KEVIN CAREY
