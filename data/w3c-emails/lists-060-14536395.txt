To:w3c-wai-eo@w3.org

I opted for a 200 word limit as a reasonable version of the request for a
"very concise format" (see minutes of 13 August EOWG meeting
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/980813_EOWG_Min).

Please suggest amendments, or additions, to the text with this word limit
in mind.

We can be fully comprehensive in a document of this length. The present
topics attempt an 80:20 overview of the commonest problems and relatively
straightforward solutions.

I envisage that the first few words of each paragraph will be emphasised;
probably in bold for a print version. Geoff Freed suggests that in on
on-line version, the first sentence of each paragraph could link to the
relevant section of the Page Authoring Guidelines.

This card is up for discussion at the conference call on 27 August.
Following comments from this list, I will make any agreed amendments to the
text before posting a 'final' version on 26 August.

Best wishes - Stella
