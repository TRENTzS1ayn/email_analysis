Hello everyone,

I apologize if you have already discussed this topic. 
Is the EO group trying to keep track of press coverage?
It might be nice to be able to refer developers to 
a page with links to articles, or at least to those
articles which the group feels cover the topic of
accessibility well. I came across an article in the 
Computer Shopper this morning. It included links 
to several other articles on accessible design.

Below is the link to the Computer Shopper article of August 1st.
