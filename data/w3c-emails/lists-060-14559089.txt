Hello all,

I have the opportunity to start injecting WAI guidelines into Web
curriculums. Let me know of anything I can do to help get such guidelines
out. These include the World Organization of Webmasters national
certification standard, (endorsing such curriculums as Berkeley University
etc.), Northeastern University, Merrimack University, Stanford, and other
organizations teaching Web developers including Virtually Wired.

Keep me posted.
