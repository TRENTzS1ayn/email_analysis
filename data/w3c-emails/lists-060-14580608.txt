[here's Stella's latest draft]

Title: Basics of Accessible Web Design
Author: Stella O'Brien
Version: 3
Status: draft
Date last modified: 20 August 1998
Audience: general; html beginners
Purpose: overview of typical access problems; suggests how problem may be
addressed
Format: very concise (see minutes of EOWG meeting, 13 August 98)
Word count (exluding document information): <200

Maximise your audience. Some users can not see or hear your site's
graphics, sounds, or moving images.

Supply text versions of visuals. People who can not see them need to know
the content or purpose of a picture or display. Well-written text
alternatives provide this information.

Make text easy to read for users with vision impairments. Keep the
background simple and use a high contrast colour for the text.

Make pages easy to skim for all users. Make the main text clear, short, and
relevant. Provide an organised framework of summaries, headings, and lists.

Provide easy navigation and useful link names. Navigation is easier for
users when there is constant access to information about their current
position. Meaningful link names give a clear idea of the content and
location of a link.

Accept input by people who can not use a mouse. Support keyboard access or
voice control. Supply a list of text links for clickable regions in images.

Test the accessibility of the web site for different types of users. Use
several browsers, in various ways (e.g., with graphics loading turned off),
and with alternative input (e.g., keyboard).

Get more information. For more detailed guidelines see ***.
