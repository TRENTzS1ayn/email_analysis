Are these the sort of examples Daniel was suggesting?  I could live with
something like this. Note that not all the statements (in the 200 word
version)
can be assigned meaningful short examples.

Maximise your audience. Some users can not see or hear your site's
graphics, sounds, or moving images. (Use ALT, OBJECT)

Supply text versions of visuals. People who can not see them need to know
the content or purpose of a picture or display. Well-written text
alternatives provide this information. (Use ALT, TITLE, LONGDESC)

Make text easy to read for users with vision impairments. Keep the
background simple and use a high contrast colour for the text.

Make pages easy to skim for all users. Make the main text clear, short, and
relevant. Provide an organised framework of summaries, headings, and lists.

Provide easy navigation and useful link names. Navigation is easier for
users when there is constant access to information about their current
position. Meaningful link names give a clear idea of the content and
location of a link. (E.g. "Get this Important Information", not "Click here")

Accept input by people who can not use a mouse. Support keyboard access or
voice control. Supply a list of text links for clickable regions in images.
(Use ACCESSKEY, TABINDEX)

Test the accessibility of the web site for different types of users. Use
several browsers, in various ways (e.g., with graphics loading turned off),
and with alternative input (e.g., keyboard).
