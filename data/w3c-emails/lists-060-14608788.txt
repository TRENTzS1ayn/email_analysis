Maximise your audience. Some users can not see or hear your site's
graphics, sounds, or moving images.

Supply text versions of visuals. People who can not see a picture or
display need to know their content or purpose. Well-written text
alternatives provide this information.

Make text easy to read for users with vision impairments. Keep the
background simple and use a high contrast colour for the text.

Make pages easy to skim for all users. Make the main text clear, short, and
relevant. Provide an organised framework of summaries, headings, and lists.

Provide easy navigation and useful link names. Navigation is easier for
users when there is constant access to information about their current
position. Meaningful link names give a clear idea of the content and
location of a link.

Accept alternative input by people who can not use a mouse. Support
keyboard access or voice control. Supply a list of text links for clickable
regions in images.

Test the accessibility of the web site for different types of users. Use
several browsers, in various ways (e.g., with graphics loading turned off),
and with alternative input (e.g., keyboard).
