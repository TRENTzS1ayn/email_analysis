Please submit and agree amendments and comments to the reference cards by
5pm EDT on Tuesday 1 September. I will then

1 be able to integrate the new material and submit a version to the list OR

2 put together a list of points on which people can express a preference

for consideration on Wednesday, before the conference call on Thursday 3
September.
