Stella asked me to give a little more context on my earlier message:
during the EO call yesterday, I mentioned that in my opinion the short
reference cards as they were needed to get some examples added to each
section, to help following thru a bigger document.

Those concerns were not really shared by other participants, in fact
people on the call tends to believe we should avoid technical jargon
as much as possible.

I'm of the opposite view: a little bit of technical jargon will help 
make the cards more useful/practical.


===========================
 
My version of the short card.
 
Basically adding short pointers to real/pragmatic things, so that the
reader get some context when digging in the PA Guidelines.
(I actually edited the text a little bit here and there, but I can
resubmit that to Stella based on her version later)
 
 
Maximise your audience. Some users will not see or hear your site's
graphics, sounds, moving images or choice of layout (text-based
terminal, braille output, webphone access, etc).
 
Supply text-only versions of visuals (e.g. using HTML ALT for image,
TITLE for Frame, etc). Text is the only format that can convey the
meaning or purpose of a picture or display thru all media (print,
speech, braille, large screen, small screen) **
 
Make pages easy to skim for all users. Provide a simple and organized
framework of summaries, headings, and lists (avoid complex FRAME or
TABLE)
 
Provide easy navigation and useful link names. Navigation is easier for
users when there is constant access to information about their current
position (e.g. use H1 or H2 for real heading, not for changing font size)
 
Test the accessibility of the web site for different types of users. Use
several browsers, in various ways (e.g., with graphics loading turned off),
and with alternative input (e.g., keyboard).
 
 
 
** I think this sentence ("Text is the only format...") is very
important and should be present somewhere in the card regardless of
using my ideas for adding examples or not.
