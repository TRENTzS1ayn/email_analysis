This usually doesn't make a difference in HTML but as a developer, I've found
that having the elements be in CAPS and the attributes lowercase makes it a
heck of a lot easier to edit an HTML document by hand. As David mentions at
the
top of the document, many people still write HTML by hand. In order to easily
distinguish actual content from the markup, having the elements be in CAPS are
important.

Thoughts?
