I like the business card layout, great job Harvey! 

Maybe it's my A4 paper, but they *almost* line up on side/side for me.

I like it too, but I wonder if the loss from 9pt to 8pt is acceptable.

Personally, I think 8pt is OK.

That's five line of leading text, which is probably OK to fit a small 
W3C/WAI logo and a couple of line of text.
 
I have rescaled a W3C/WAI logo at
   http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/cardlogo.gif
so that you can try placing it on the card.

The last two cards in 6pt are really too small when printed (they 
are already hard to read on my screen)


I think a sans-serif font (Helvetica, Geneva, Arial) would be better
at these small sizes.

I think the referenced URL at the end should be blue, to mimic what
most people gets on their screen for HREF.
