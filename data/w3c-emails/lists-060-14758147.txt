Thanks for the suggestion.

I carried out a spot of user-testing on the html guide and found
that people preferred examples to be more realistic. The guide
currently uses descriptive values to indicate the role of markup,
e.g. 

  <h1>An important heading</h1>

versus

  <h1>The effect of climate on ecological diversity</h1>

I suspect that mixing the commentary text with the example markup
may confuse people. I hope to revise and extend the guide as soon
as I can get some time free. Unfortunately, this may take a while
as things are pretty hectic for me right now.
