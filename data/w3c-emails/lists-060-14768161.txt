We used this convention for the HTML 4.0 spec. However, when editing
by hand, it is much easier to use lowercase through out. My HTML
tidy utility [1] makes it trivial to change your mind though. 

The next generation of HTML will be written in XML which is case
sensitive. The HTML working group will have to formally decide which
case to adopt. My expectation is that lower case will prevail.

    Tidy is a tool to fixup markup errors and tidy up
    sloppy editing into nicely layed out HTML.
