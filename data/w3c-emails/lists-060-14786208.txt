Timescales preclude a well designed set of questions: please try and answer
the questions and points below.

1 Do you support the notion of a reference card which fits onto a business
card?
YesNo

Comment:

2 Would a business card format be intended for
a) a general audienceYesNo
b) a more specific, sophisticated audienceYesNo

Comment:

3 If WAI EO could only afford one format for the reference card, should it be
a) the business card sizeYesNo
b) a longer, more 'pocket-size' cardYesNo

Comment:

4 Because of the size constraints, should a business card version
a) cover the current spread of issues which more closely conforms
to the PAGLYesNo
b) concentrate only on 3 issues (plus introduction and 'Get more
information' sections)  YesNo

Comment:

5 Based on the current content of the reference cards, if the business card
version were to address only three issues, what would they be? I assume
that everybody would agree on 'text versions of visuals' etc. but which
other 2 items would you include? Would the 'text versions of visuals' be
expanded to cover visuals; applets; complex displays (charts, graphs etc.);
icons etc.?

Comment:

6 The content of the reference cards is consciously written in a plain
English style, and it avoids the use of html terms (partially because of
the writing style; partly to avoid quick obselescence).
a) should we retain the plain English?YesNo
b) should the cards refer to html terms?YesNo
