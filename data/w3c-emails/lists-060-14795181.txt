yes

general and sophisticated have different meaning depending on the
context.

the audience is people writing HTML pages, whether by hand or using
tools. This is not people on the HTML working group, or people
implementing HTML browsers or HTML authoring tools, nor it is for
people just browsing the web.

Both are valid, but since I prefer the word count to be under whatever 
fit in 8pt on 2 sides of a business card, I prefer business card, not
a folded thing. If we decide that we need more words than can fit in
8pt on 2 sides, then I would be OK with a 4-side folding card.

Why 3 ? we have versions in 9pt with 5 issues.

I don't understand why you say 3, where 5 seems fine.

yes and yes.

Comments: 
  - IMO the writing style needs to be a minimum technical, because the 
    audience is a minimum technical and we're asking to understand
    technical things eventually. It's not for managers or users
  - HTML, in its current form or in its future XML form, is going to be with
    us for several years.
