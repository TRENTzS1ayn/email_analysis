SMO: I am not confident that *any* of the current versions provide the
level of detail that for which some people have expressed a preference.
Reducing the number of issues would allow more space for covering issues in
greater depth (as indicated in the body of question 5).

SMO: See response to 4. And, the EO group, as yet, has not agreed the
number of sections or an appropriate level of detail. During the last
conference call some participants argued that some material should be
restored from the previous, longer versions (e.g. access to audiovisual
material).
