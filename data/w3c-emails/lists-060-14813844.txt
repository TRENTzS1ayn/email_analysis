1 Do you support the notion of a reference card which fits onto a
business card?  YES

2 Would a business card format be intended for
        a) a general audience                  
        b) a more specific, sophisticated audience      
YES YES

3 If WAI EO could only afford one format for the reference card, should
it be...
BUSINESS CARD

4 Because of the size constraints, should a business card version...
HE GOT 5 ON THERE, INCLUDING HTML REFS.  THAT'S GOOD!

5 Based on the current content of the reference cards, if the business
card version were to address only three issues, what would they be?
NOT AN ISSUE - 5 ARE ON THERE.

6 The content of the reference cards is consciously written in a plain
English style, and it avoids the use of html terms...
THIS IS ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO EDUCATE re HTML, THUS HAVE PLAIN ENGLISH
AND EITHER A DIFFERENT FONT OR COLOR FOR THE HTML REFERENCES.
