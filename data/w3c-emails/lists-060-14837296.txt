Hi,

Since I might not be able to keep myself awake for the eowg call
tonight, I'm posting this to the list.  (Speaking of the time, this
would be a bit of problem for me when the daylight saving is over as
it will be between 1:00am and 2:30am for me.)

The call for papers for INET '99 is out now and the abstract is due 16
Oct.  This is also the deadline for the panels, tutorials and poster
sessions proposals.  Submitted abstracts and proposals will be
reviewed by the program committee.

Regarding INET '99, Mike Burks, the chair of disability access special
interest group of the Internet Society (ISOC) is planning to put
togather a panel or tutorial on the Internet accessibility and has
asked me for help.  I could represent W3C/WAI if it is suitable, or I
could be there just as one of visually impaired computer
users/researchers otherwise.

Detailed information about the ISOC and INET can be found at:

     Cheers,
Max
