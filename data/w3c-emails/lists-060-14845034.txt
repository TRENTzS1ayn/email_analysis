 Yes

Comment: There is no way to make a similarly useful portable version in any
alternate (print) format.  But if the target audience is clearly sighted
people
with good vision, then I have no objection.  The card is good for distributing
at conferences as memory joggers.

2 Would a business card format be intended for
a) a general audience Yes
b) a more specific, sophisticated audience No

3 If WAI EO could only afford one format for the reference card, should it be

b) a longer, more 'pocket-size' card Yes

Comment:  At a presentation, I would rather hand out something readable and
slightly detailed than either the full guidelines or a business card.

4 Because of the size constraints, should a business card version
a) cover the current spread of issues which more closely conforms to the PAGL
No
b) concentrate only on 3 issues (plus introduction and 'Get more information'
sections) No

Comment: or as many priority 1 items as will fit best.

a) should we retain the plain English? Yes 
b) should the cards refer to html terms? Yes 
>
Comment:  plain English, in close association with HTML terms may help explain
the function of HTML to beginners. 

Hopeful, but not convinced, that my comment are not oxymoronic (or just
moronic).
