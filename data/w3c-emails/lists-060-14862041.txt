Dominique, some comments on

> Conception of Web pages
> White Book about accessibility (first draft)

What does "White Book" means ?

Is this like a White Paper ?
 

I like the Introduction a lot.

HTML is for structural and semantic, CSS is for layout.

Maybe you can just say HTML and CSS whenever you say HTML.

Not really the purpose of DIV, but I guess that's fine for this
audience.

ALT dlink on which element ? not the IMG since it has its own alt ?
You mean when Dlink is itself an image. Unclear.

No need for complicating the picture...

This is one important aspect that I think we ought to mention
somewhere on the business card or on any short version we produce in
EO.

It's delicate to start reviewing tools in such a paper.

But we still have to decide how to use it anyway...

Also mention lynxit service.


On a side note, I'd like to know how much of your text we can reuse in
other articles/papers.
