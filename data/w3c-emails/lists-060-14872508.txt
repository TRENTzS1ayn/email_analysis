Last week a web-site raising was held in Austin, Texas. The project was
called Accessibility Internet Rally. It paired non-profit organizations and
web development groups in the area. The sites were planned in one day,
developed the next day. Judging was primarily based on accessibility (52%)
other areas included functionality, aesthetics, and appropriateness of the
site to the organization. This might be a good model for bringing
accessibility issues to the forefront in a meaning full manner. A follow-up
survey of the web site developers concerning lasting implementation of
accessible design is planned.
