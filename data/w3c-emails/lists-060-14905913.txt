I'm sorry, but some of the wording below puzzles me. For example:

"Having an accessible Web site means that your site can be used by millions
more people around the world, and that it will also work better for
everyone -- for instance people with mobile devices, lack of audio output,
or low bandwith."

1. Doesn't the fact that a site that can be used by "millions more people"
imply that it must also work better for everyone? I understand the point
you're trying to make -- accessibility benefits everyone, regardless of
ability or situation. But somehow the current wording seems awkward. I
think there are two statements enveloped in one and that's making it a
little harder to understand. Perhaps something similar to:

"Having an accessible Web site means that your site will perform (or
process) better for millions more people around the world including persons
with disabilities, people with mobile devices, users with low bandwith and
individuals without audio output."  

If there's room, you could make a bulleted list that includes the 4
population segments.

2. Shouldn't we add the word "the" before "W3C's" in the final paragraph?
Remove the comma after "techniques" or just make a small list. For example,
"ideas, techniques and tips for testing your site...."

Nothing critical --- sorry if I interrupted the workflow.

Regards,

Mike
