Having read Judy's first pass and Mike's first suggestion,  I find myself
leaning towards Judy's version.  It seems more "people-oriented" than Mike's,
which has the feeling of focusing on the technology.  However, I agree with
Mike that there is something slightly awkward about the phrasing.  I don't
have
a suggestion at the moment, but I'll bet this group can come up with
something.

Cheers!
Chuck
