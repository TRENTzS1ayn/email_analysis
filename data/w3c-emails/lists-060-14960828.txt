I thought Chuck's point involving the audience definition was very good
and valid. The terms I used below are fine for the technically oriented and
web administrator-types, not the average user or "personal web page
creator". I'm just now beginning to follow the discussion threads again and
my comments may not have been completely appropriate given my ignorance
related to the audience.

If we're trying to educate the average user, than using the term "work"
rather than "perform" or "process" is probably best. However, if the
audience is the average user, then I would be less inclined to include a
list of alternative uses -- likely this is not as important to the average
user.  Simply stating stating that "having an accessible Web site means
that your site will work better for millions more people around the world"
and leave it at that. The concluding statements directs them to additional
resources if they need/want more information.
