Hello all,

To reiterate what I committed to at today's meeting: 

I will look at the most recent versions of the reference card, including
opening and closing remarks; reorganize and edit the text (if necessary)
to squeeze out unnecessary words; and submit to this group, in a week or
two, a set of concise principles that will fit on a double-sided business
card.
