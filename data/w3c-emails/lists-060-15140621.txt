WAI EOWG Agenda Oct 1, 1998

Time: 
  11:00 a.m. - 12:30 p.m. US EDT 
Phones: 
  US: +1 (617) 252-1038
  FR: +33 (0)1 56 78 14 93

Agenda:
1. Updates/check-ins:
- WAI EOWG home page updated <http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO>. (Yes I know the
draft issues list is blank, I'll fix that later today)
- Missing minutes now available on WAI EO page, except for Aug 27th, for
which the minutes are gone due to a crash. If anyone has any form of notes
from that meeting, please send them. Note that the minutes now all have
indices up front so we can more easily find the topics covered in each
meeting.
- If you attended the Sept 17 meeting, please check for any significant
omissions and let me know; I was taking minutes under interesting
circumstances.

2. Review of one-pager flyer:
Note that this is not the flashy promotional flyer we discussed earlier
(still coming), but rather a basic single-sheet "pointers" list that has
been evolving for a few months. Feedback welcome. Document appended
(straight text) and attached (word 7).

3. Upcoming events submissions deadlines:
Any report from Jim (or Kitch)?

4. Question of accessible design consultants:
Getting more & more requests to recommend consultants. Thoughts on
developing a registry? How much work? How to control it? Wait until after
we've developed training materials, and we can vouch for people having gone
through trainings?

5. Bulletin draft for review
Check your mail again before meeting starts.

6. RNIB videos
Description, comments

[W3C logo] Web Accessibility Initiative

"The power of the Web is in its universality.  Access by everyone
regardless of disability is an essential aspect." 
 -- Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web

The World Wide Web offers unprecedented access to information and
interaction, particularly for individuals with disabilities who have had
limited access in the past. However, there are currently barriers on the
Web for people with visual, hearing, physical and cognitive disabilities.

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is committed to promoting a high degree
of usability for people with disabilities. Web accessibility solutions also
benefit other users such as those with mobile devices, low bandwidth, or
with no audio output.  W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), in
coordination with industry, disability organizations, research centers and
government, is pursuing accessibility of the Web through five complementary
activities:

*  Ensuring that Web technologies support accessibility
*  Developing guidelines for accessibility
*  Developing tools to evaluate & facilitate accessibility
*  Conducting education and outreach
*  Monitoring and engaging in research and development
