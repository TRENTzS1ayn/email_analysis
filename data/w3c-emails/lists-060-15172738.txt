I was just watching "The Web" on the Sci-Fi channel and Microsoft just ran
a commercial about how they're making computers accessible for the blind.
The used a gentleman named Peter Wong who was listed as a Microsoft
Engineer......interesting. It seemed like they were trying to vindicate
themselves rather than inform the public, however.

Thanks.
