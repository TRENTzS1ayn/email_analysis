At least it is press and, unfortunately, its more than anyone else has done
on a commercial.  I feel the public needs the shock affect and to see people
mainstreamed.  Overall, it is positive press.  Hopefully, other companies
will see the potential customers and dollar signs in their pockets and do
the same, for example, maybe IBM.

There is some additional information on the WAI IG where the member from
Microsoft mentioned they were doing five commercials that showed five people
using computers to help them.  It was interesting.  If anyone still has this
or can easily find it on the archive list, please post. It offers some good
insight.
