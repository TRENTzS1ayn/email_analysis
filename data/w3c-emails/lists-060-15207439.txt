Hi all,

I just got out of a press conference with the "V-Commerce Alliance" which
is a consortium working to make e-commerce applications and information
available for use through the phone. They gave a quick demo and it's
through voice-recognition technology. Companies like webMethods, Motorola,
Visa, and Dialogic are inolved.

This could bring up some great issues regarding Web Accesibility. They
claimed at the announcement that their technology is two-fold- part
Web-based and part voice-recognition..both combined into the system. Just
an interesting thought.

The Web site is http://www.v-commerce.com/ and I am in touch with the PR
managers for the group.

Thanks.
