Excellent start!

Don't understand the part about audio and relationship to Deaf.

"individuals who have" could be "users of".  "portable devices and slow
connections:" might be "portable or slow devices".  "contrasting" has
always seemed too vague to me, but I'm weird.  "Many people cannot use a
mouse. Duplicate imagemap hot spots as a list of text anchors. Ensure
that every link can be activated using keyboard commands."  perhaps "for
other-than-mouse use every link (esp. image hot spots) must be
accessible by keyboard (or voice) commands."

Looking good, Alan!
