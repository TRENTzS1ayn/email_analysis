WAI EOWG:

This is a report on discussion with Jutta Treviranus, who Chairs the WAI AU
WG and is also on the Program Committee for WWW8. I forwarded her all our
suggestions on accessibility in WWW8 and this is the status so far:

Based on the WWW8 /WAI coverage issues generated in WAI EOWG discussions
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/980813_EOWG_Min.html#5> and discussions at Brisbane:

1. Make sure the conference site & arrangements are accessible:
JT: facility is new but contractor is tight on money and hard to reach;
could be an issue.
+JT will check with fellow who oversees convention planning subcontractor
UPDATE: Jutta asks for conference preparation check-list for accessibility. 
UPDATE: Judy will e-mail reference info tomorrow.

2. Make sure the Web site is accessible:
JT: The contractor hosts the Web site, but the Program Committee is in
charge of it, and ATRC (Jutta's shop) has control of content and design, so
accessibility should be good.
+JT will double-check some of the old javascript they were given for forms

3. Get accessibility listed as a program category:
JT: not finalized yet
+JT will do, and also get it listed as a criteria to be addressed in every
single other presentation proposal
DETAIL: This is the language that Jutta has proposed: "Please comment on
accessibility and your topic. Are the technologies, standards or practices
you are discussing accessible to individuals who use alternative display or
control systems (e.g. people who have disabilities)? For more information
see URL: www.w3.org/WAI. [and there is a suggestion to Jutta to link
something from WAI home page which gives guidance to paper authors]

4. Mention accessibility in conference literature:
+JT will find out who's the contact on this, and how to get theme visibility
+JT will ask for an organizational chart and get contact names

5. Have a plenary/keynote focusing on accessibility; or mention it in
several keynotes:
+JT will check on plenary planning. Program Committee (which JT is on) is
handling that.
UPDATE: Program Committee welcomes our suggestions but must be received
today (Oct 7 or tomorrow Oct 8). We should e-mail suggestions directly to
the three WWW8 Conference Co-chairs.

6. Conduct a panel with different perspectives on accessibility (went well
at WWW7, would need different focus)
+JB will help with ideas

7. Have a focused workshop or tutorial, advertise in advance
+JT will do another tutorial (also will send materials from last one) 

8. Have demos available
+JT planning scheduled demos, less hassle, come see this one thing for one
hour, etc.

9. Also -- do something on developers' day
+Ian Graham planning something, Jutta will send info

10. Piggy-back a WAI meeting on WWW8
+JB bring up at WAI CG: Consider IG, EO, AU, PF, ER's?
+JB will call Murray directly
