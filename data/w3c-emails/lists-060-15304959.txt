Thank you all for your feedback. Here is the ante-penultimate version! I
like Daniel's idea about replacing the heading on Side 1 with the logo. 

It's down to about 175 words. 

Judy, does W3C have a graphic designer who can impart that "professional"
patina to the card? 

Here's the text: Full size mock-up is attached.

Guidelines for making your site accessible to people with disabilities 
and users of portable or slow web-devices

Photographs, images & animations 
Describe content or purpose within the <Alt="text"> attribute.

Page organization 
Use headings, lists and summaries to make pages easy to scan. 

Imagemaps 
Many people cannot use a mouse. Duplicate image-map hot spots as a list 
of text anchors. Ensure that every link can be activated using keyboard 
commands.

Face 2 starts here.

Tables
Avoid complex tables. Prepare a text-only page that describes the 
content of a table.

Graphs & charts 
Summarize content, or provide a long description.

Frames 
Label each frame with <TITLE> or <NAME>, and include a simplified version 
of its content within the <NOFRAMES> element.

Hypertext links  
Use descriptive hypertext links. Each link should make sense when read 
alone or out of context.

Audio 
Prepare audio descriptions, or link to a page that contains transcripts 
or descriptions. 

Evaluate accessibility 
Try different browsers; switch off graphics, sounds and animations; 
navigate via keyboard; use a monochrome monitor; use automated analysis 
tools.
