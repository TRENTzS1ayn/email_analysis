What I'm looking for is advice on whether we've covered what people think
should be covered or whether there are major elements which we have left
out. Comments on the allocation of time would also be welcome. Although a
lot of the footage will be in common on general points, the voice-over
script and actuality will be different, reflecting the two different
audiences.

Would be grateful for comments under subject line "TIDE Movies" by
15.x.98.

Yours


KEVIN CAREY
