You or anyone else in WAI are free to make any use you want of the 
Page Authoring Guidelines talk I presented September 23 at a Webmasters
of the World Birds of a Feather session.

They seemed to work OK, though they could well have been more dynamic.
Too much lecture mode though I did get intermixed Q&A. I did not 
produce any speaker notes, though I did amplify the slides as I gave 
them.

They are now on my site. The whole set of 42 htm slides in both a text and
as the powerpoint graphics is available. They included all the
points from sections A, B, and C of the 1998-09-18 version. Start at:

    http://www.tiac.net/users/bingham/accessbl/pa980918

They are also available pkzipped at 

    http://www.tiac.net/users/bingham/accessbl/PA980918.ZIP  (305,673 ch)

Please move them to the WAI site. I have identified the PA authors on 
slide 1 and myself as presenter. Also I'm on slide 42 and index.htm. 
These could be stripped. 

These were made with the PowerPoint '97 to HTML converter. The original

    http://www.tiac.net/users/bingham/accessbl/pa980918.ppt
 
is available that would simplify that adjustment. However, some folks
and mailers do poorly with the ppt slides. That and eight other ppt
presentations are mentioned there are all available as a single zip file:
