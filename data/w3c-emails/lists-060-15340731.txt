By the way (Harvey), I have included a TITLE on all (almost all) of my
<HR>'s.  So there! <grin>

A thought for everyone: I have also used deprecated HTML for positioning
images (<IMG ALIGN="right">, etc.)   I'm a baaad boy!  I will look at
revising them to use CSS where possible.  (e.g see sample one and the
sample about ASCII art in http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/a1s.htm)

But, while I hate not practicing what we preach, I suspect that ALIGN in
IMG will display the way I want on more installed browsers than CSS does.
Does this mean my layout concept should be changed?  Any suggestions?

And yes, I know, I haven't added the !Doctype declaration yet.  (Question
for Daniel: does the W3C Slidemaker slap that on automatically?)

In other words, these started out as quick prototypes for EO comment, but
are rapidly evolving into production slides.  Before Geoff and I go much
further we will work out the details.  You know what?  It really is easier
to build in accessibility up front that to have to retrofit.  Yikes! We've
turned into a case study for our own recommendations <grin>. 

Regards
Chuck
