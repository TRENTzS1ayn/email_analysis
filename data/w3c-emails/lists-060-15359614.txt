Here is the most recent version of the Reference card. Major changes 
since last week:

Layout:

- Each point is now numbered to enhance legibility.

- I switched to a sans-serif typeface. I concur with Daniel; at this 
small size, a sans-serif typeface does seem to be easier to read. Also, I 
shrunk the typeface size by one point.

Content:

- Whenever possible, I give the reason for the rule. E.g., "Some 
web-devices cannot render frames."

- Because I added explanations for the rules, I sometimes shortened the 
rules. However, I don't think the rules are any less clear.

All suggestions are welcome. There are a couple of lines I'm thinking of
knocking out, but I will wait for comments first. I'm especially looking
for feedback on the reasons for the rules. 

Full-size mockup attached. Text-only version follows:

World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) - Web Accessibility Initiative

Nine tips for making your site accessible to people with 
disabilities and users of portable or slow web-devices

1.Photographs, images & animations  Concisely describe the content 
or purpose of important images. Use the Alt="text" attribute.

2.Page organization  A consistent page layout helps people with 
visual and learning disabilities. Use headings, lists and summaries to 
make pages easy to scan.

3.Imagemaps  Many people cannot use a mouse. List imagemap hot 
spots as a menu of text anchors. Ensure that every link can be activated 
using keyboard commands.

4.Tables  Some web-devices cannot render tables. Prepare a 
text-only page that describes the contents of a table. Avoid complex 
tables. 
 
5.Graphs & charts  Summarize content, or provide a long description.

6.Frames  Some web-devices cannot render frames. Label each frame 
with Title or Name, and include a linear version of its content within 
the Noframes element.

7.Hypertext links  Descriptive links improve access for those who 
cannot see. Ensure that each link makes sense when read alone. 

8.Audio  For people who cannot hear, prepare audio descriptions or 
link to a page containing transcripts or descriptions.

9.Evaluate accessibility  View your site with different browsers; 
switch off graphics, sounds and animations; navigate via keyboard; use a 
monochrome monitor; use automated analysis tools.
