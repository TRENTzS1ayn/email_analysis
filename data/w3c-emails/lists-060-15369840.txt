Could you replace with the logos, so that we get a better idea of the
final layout ?

> Nine tips for making your site accessible to people with

I suggest removing "Nine" (the number is not important, so not need to 
mention it)

Other that that, here's a variation, not sure it's better:
 Tips for making your site accessible to people with 
 permanent or temporary disabilities.

> 1.Photographs, images & animations  Concisely describe the content 
> or purpose of important images. Use the Alt="text" attribute.

We've been using "important" with some specific meaning in the
Guidelines, related to the need for a *long* description, so I think
we should be careful here. Also, purpose or function is more important
that content, we need to put it first. Last, since images is one of
the list item in the heading, using it generically in the sentence is
not ideal.

I suggest: Photographs, images & animations - Describe the purpose or
content of all visuals. Use the Alt="text" attribute.

 
> 2.Page organization  A consistent page layout helps people with 
> visual and learning disabilities. Use headings, lists and summaries to 
> make pages easy to scan.

OK
 
> 3.Imagemaps  Many people cannot use a mouse. List imagemap hot 
> spots as a menu of text anchors. Ensure that every link can be activated 
> using keyboard commands.

I'd add "as a menu of text anchors (using MAP)", to refer to a real
HTML example without mentioning the technical term "Client side image
map". 
 
> 4.Tables  Some web-devices cannot render tables. Prepare a 
> text-only page that describes the contents of a table. Avoid complex 
> tables. 

I still think we're shooting ourselves in the foot by asking people to 
prepare text-only version of anything...
I'd rather see something like:

Tables - Some web-devices need to linearize tables. Avoid complex
tables or add header and cell scope information if needed.

>  
> 5.Graphs & charts  Summarize content, or provide a long description.

OK
 
> 6.Frames  Some web-devices cannot render frames. Label each frame 
> with Title or Name, and include a linear version of its content within 
> the Noframes element.

..and +if too complex+ include a linear...
 
Lynx does a perfectly good job with simple frameset by showing the list
of frame by their name and offer links to frame content.

> 7.Hypertext links  Descriptive links improve access for those who 
> cannot see. Ensure that each link makes sense when read alone. 

The rationales is weak, we need something explaining it's "for those
who navigate the page thru link only".

> 8.Audio  For people who cannot hear, prepare audio descriptions or 
> link to a page containing transcripts or descriptions.

OK
 
> 9.Evaluate accessibility  View your site with different browsers; 
> switch off graphics, sounds and animations; navigate via keyboard; use a 
> monochrome monitor; use automated analysis tools.

OK.
