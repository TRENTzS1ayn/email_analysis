Alan, 

You did a great job of incorporating as much advice as you possibly could
after last weeks meeting.  My only suggestion would be a reordering of the
points (if possible).  I suggest:

1.,3.,5.,8.,6.,4.,7.,2.,9.

This would make the card (more or less) reflect the organization and
ordering of the corresponding points in the full PA Guideline document.
Granted, I didn't try reordering them to see if they would actually fit on
the cards as nicely as the present ordering.

Regards,
Chuck
