        Reply to:   More EO slides


Chuck Letourneau has uploaded a sample of the WAI-EO presentation slide set, this time made with the W3C slidemaker tool.  Take a look at

http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/gid/overgid.htm

and let us know what you think.  Keep in mind that this is not a complete set-- the resize button won't work.  Chuck offers the following caveats:

==
At the moment, the presenter can start at "overgid.htm" to get at
the guideline/rationale set,  or at "overtec.htm" if he/she just wants to
go through the technique set.  Eventually, you will probably be able to
start at "oversam.htm" to just view the sample slides.  The goal of course
is to also have them linked vertically between levels.

We should be adding new material next week.  Chuck will be away from e-mail for the next few days.  You can send your comments to the list or to me directly at geoff_freed@wgbh.org.

Thanks.
geoff.
