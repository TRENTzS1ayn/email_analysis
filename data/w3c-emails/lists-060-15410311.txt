I suggest: Photographs, images & animations - Describe the purpose or
content of all visuals. Use the Alt="text" attribute.

GV: I WOULD CONCUR WITH THIS VERSION.

I still think we're shooting ourselves in the foot by asking people to
prepare text-only version of anything...
I'd rather see something like:

Tables - Some web-devices need to linearize tables. Avoid complex
tables or add header and cell scope information if needed.


I WOULD CONCUR HERE AS WELL.   THIS VERSION ALSO AGREES BETTER WITH THE
GUIDELINES.  (THERE ARE ALSO SOME TABLE TOOLS IN THE WORKS THAT MAKES THIS
VERSION EVEN MORE HELPFUL.)
