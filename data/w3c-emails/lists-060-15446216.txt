Because tables are commonly used and are hard to access for users of
screen readers and Braille displays, the point about tables cries for an
explanation as to why it is included on a tip sheet. Yet, I don't think a
tip sheet is the place to introduce readers to assistive technologies. 

How about this?

"Some web technologies cannot render tables." 

I suggest the expression "web technologies" instead of "web devices" 
because screen readers and refreshable Braille displays are both software
and hardware, and "device" doesn't capture that. 

I don't know whether this wording excludes other web-devices that have
trouble dealing with tables. What other devices are there? 

Two questions for the more HTML-savvy members of our group:

1. What makes a table "complex?" Or, when is a table "complex?" I don't
   understand the point. A "simple" two-column table is often impossible
   to decipher for a screen reader user. 

2. Which browsers support "header and cell scope information?" And 
   where can I read up on this subject?
