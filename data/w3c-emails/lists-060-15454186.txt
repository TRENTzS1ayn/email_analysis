We discussed complexity of table on the Guidelines list but never
reached a real conclusion.

The issue is the following: how we draw the line between work the
author has to do vs. work the browser can do.

For tables, I personally think putting it all on the author's hand is
too much asking and that user agents can easily make simple tables
accessible (look at lynx for the level 0 support: ignore the table
markup and print out the content as is).

None at that point I think.

You can read about that in the HTML4 spec
  http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/tables.html#h-11.4

or in the WAI HTML Access paper
