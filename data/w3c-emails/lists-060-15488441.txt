Latest version, incorporating many of the suggestions sent to me. 

Key changes: 

- No more references to things that are "complex" or "important." 

- New wording for TABLES. The key point seems to be that under HTML 4.0, 
tables can be made accessible. I describe what is needed. Unfortunately, 
no browser supports this now... 

- I changed "web-devices" to "web technologies." (A suggestion from Dena 
Shumila. Screen readers and Braille displays are not, strictly 
speaking, devices. They are software + hardware.)

Tips for making your site accessible to people with disabilities and users
of portable or slow web-devices

1. Photographs, images & animations  Concisely describe the purpose or 
content of all visuals. Use the Alt="text" attribute. 

2. Page organization  A consistent page layout helps people with visual and
learning disabilities. Use headings, lists and summaries to make pages
easy to scan. 

3. Imagemaps  Many people cannot use a mouse. List imagemap hot spots as a
menu of text anchors using MAP. Ensure that every link can be activated
using keyboard commands. 

4. Tables  Some web-technologies require the headers, scope and abbr
attributes to render tables. Always use these attributes. 

5. Graphs & charts  Summarize content, or provide a long description. 

6. Frames  Some web-technologies cannot render frames. Label each frame
with Title or Name, and include a linear version of its content within the
Noframes element. 

7. Hypertext links  Descriptive links improve access for those who cannot
see. Ensure that each link makes sense when read alone. 

8. Audio  For people who cannot hear, prepare audio descriptions or link to
a page containing transcripts or descriptions. 

9. Evaluate accessibility  View your site with different browsers;  switch
off graphics, sounds and animations; navigate via keyboard; use a
monochrome monitor; use automated analysis tools.
