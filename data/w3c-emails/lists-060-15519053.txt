Text-only version follows. The mockup is attached.

The points have been reordered, in accordance with peoples' wishes, but
mostly to make everything fit. Everything just barely fits now.

See the new TABLES point. Our collective version was too long to fit, so I
put on my alchemist's cap and started distilling and sublimating. How
close have I come to discovering the philosopher's stone and the universal
panacea? 

To those who happen to use laser or inkjet printer technology: I ask that
you print out the card. Is everything legible at this scale? It is small. 
I kept the same typeface size, but I had to shrink the spacing between
paragraphs, and in some cases, between lines and letters. 

If there are legibility concerns, let me know. There are a couple of words
that can be trimmed -- even if we prefer that they not be. 

Please get your comments to me as soon as possible. The next version 
should be it.

Alan

Quick tips for making your site accessible to people 
with disabilities & users of portable or slow web-devices

1 Images, photographs & animations Concisely describe the purpose or
content of all visuals. Use the alt attribute. 

2 Page organization A consistent page layout helps people with visual and
learning disabilities. Use headings, lists and summaries to make pages
easy to scan. 

3 Imagemaps Many people cannot use a mouse. List imagemap hot spots as a
menu of text anchors using the MAP element. Ensure that every link can be
activated using keyboard commands. 

4 Hypertext links Descriptive link names improve access for those who
cannot see. Ensure that each link makes sense when read alone. 

5 Graphs & charts Summarize content or use the longdesc attribute. 

6 Frames Some web-technologies cannot render frames. Label each frame with
title or name, and include a linear version of its content within the
NOFRAMES element. 

7 Tables Some web-technologies have trouble reading tables. Avoid using
tables to format text columns. Use the headers, scope and abbr attributes
to mark-up complex tabular information. 

8 Audio For people who cannot hear audio content, provide captions or
transcripts. 

9 Video Provide text or audio descriptions of video content. 

10 Evaluate accessibility View your site with different browsers;  switch
off graphics, sounds and animations; navigate via keyboard; use a
monochrome monitor; use automated analysis tools.
