I printed it and circulated it in the local staff here at W3C Sophia,
ranging from HTML guru to HTML savvy people.

What do we mean by summaries?  It would be better to convey the idea
of structure, maybe using table of content ?

I thought we decided to remove "Ensure that every link can be
activated using keyboard commands", which is really a browser
issue. Also it would give some air between the logos and the intro
sentence, which is too tight right now.

The sentence "List imagemap hot spots as a menu of text anchors using
the MAP element" didn't parse for most people, we need a different
wording, like: 
  Use the MAP element to provide imagemap hotspot text anchors.
 
> 4 Hypertext links Descriptive link names improve access for those who

One person was confused by "names", since he knew name is an HTML
attribute akin to URL, so he thought we were saying use URL with
meaningfull names (ala http://www.foo.com/SalesReport98.htm, instead
of http://www.foo.com/bar.htm)

> 7 Tables Some web-technologies have trouble reading tables. Avoid using

Someone said we should mention CSS there, not just say "don't do
that".
Another said these new attributes should be marked as such.


Related: when printed thru Word, I'm missing a bunch of letters in the 
card headings: "Ga p s" instead of "Graphs" for instance.

Any idea ?
