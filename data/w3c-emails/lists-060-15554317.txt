The card idea is very nice.  I like the idea of a very simple list.
But I am concerned that some of the key guidelines are not on here...
yet most people dont use those technologies so it is nice to have a list
without them.
and the value of a short simple list cannot be overstated.

a quandry.

What if we add something like


"see full guidelines at  http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH/ if you use
SCRIPTS,APPLETS,MEDIA or Advanced Web Technologies on your Pages."

to the card


it keeps the card simple - yet makes it cover the broader range of
technologies.
