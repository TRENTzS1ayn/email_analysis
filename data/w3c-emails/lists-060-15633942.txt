Hi Geoff...

I have finished posting a great whack of revisions.  To get a better idea
of how things will work, I have almost finished the A1 set.  

Starting at gid1-0.htm is the A1 Guideline.  There are four Technique
slides corresponding to  A1 (tec1-0.htm to tec4-0.htm).  There are seven
sample slides for the four technique slides (a1s1-0 to a1s7-0.htm) . I may
have to split some of the individual sample files even further to keep the
amount of info on one slide manageable.

So far, there are four master files: int.htm, gid.htm, tec.htm and a1s.htm.
 These are the input to the slidemaker program which generates the slides.

The index slide I created (http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/gid/) links to
both the slide sets and to the master files for convenience. Note that for
this testing, I have not copied the duplicate slides for alternate
resolutions... the change size bar will not work at the moment.

The logical sequence is to start at Index and choose to look at the
Introduction slides and continue on from there.

My only concern is that I don't yet have a good, quick way of
distinguishing the guideline slides from the technique slides from the
sample slides.  The simplest might be to indicate which set is which in the
HEAD <TITLE> element.  Or I could add some text to the slide counter at the
bottom (e.g. 2 of 7 would become Guideline set 2 of 7,  Techniques set 2 of
7, etc.).

Cheers!
Chuck
