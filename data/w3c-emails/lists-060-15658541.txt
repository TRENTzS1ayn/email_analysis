To All,

A conference listing site (http://www.interport.net/~kitch/eo.html) has been
established in order to keep up with the many conferences that may be
appropriate outlets for education and outreach activities. 
The listing would also be a good place to track WAI
presentations and presence at conferences. Currently we ask that people
submit 
conference listing to Kitch Barnicle at kitch@afb.org or Jim Allan at
allan_jm@tsb1.tsbvi.edu . However, we would like to automate the process as 
much as possible by creating a form that people could use to add
conferences to 
the list. Please review the proposed items for the "events-list submission
form" 
and let us know what you think.  Are we asking for the right information? 
As it stands now, the form mirrors the current format of the events page.

Thanks,

Kitch & Jim
