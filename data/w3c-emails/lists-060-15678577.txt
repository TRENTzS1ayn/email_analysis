WAI Page Author Guidelines Working Group:

You're invited to take a quick look at a WAI EO reference piece. For the
pilot version, we need feedback by Monday noon, Nov 9, US EST. It is
appended in text. If you want to see the Word mock-up, e-mail me. It's a
large file.

The WAI Education & Outreach Working Group (EOWG) has been working on a
"quick-tips" mini reference card for accessible page authoring. The idea is
to put very concise rendering of some high-priority guidelines onto a
business card, both sides, so that people can carry a reminder around. The
tag line at the end gives people the URL for /WAI for the "complete" Page
Author Guidelines & Techniques. 

WAI EOWG would like to print a pilot/test run of these early next week, for
distribution & feedback from W3C Member organizations at an upcoming meeting.

We would like your feedback on the language on the card before it goes to a
pilot run.

Do you like this? - why?

Not like this? - why?

Fear it will be misunderstood? - how?

Fear it will be misused? - how?

Comments please to w3c-wai-eo@w3.org. For more info on WAI EOWG work, go to

Thank you,

Judy

Quick tips for making your site accessible to people 
with disabilities & users of mobile or slow Web devices
1Images, photographs & animations  Concisely describe the pur-pose or
con-tent of all visuals. Use the alt attribute.
2Page organization  A consistent page layout helps people with visual and
learning disabilities. Use head-ings, lists and table summaries to make
pages easy to scan.
3Imagemaps  Many people cannot use a mouse. Use the MAP element to provide
imagemap hotspot text anchors.
4Hypertext links  Descriptive link text improves access for those who
cannot see. Ensure that each link makes sense when read alone.
5Graphs & charts  Summarize content or use the longdesc attribute.
 6Audio  For people who cannot hear audio content, provide captions or
transcripts.
7Video  Provide text or audio descriptions of video content. 
8Frames  Some Web technologies cannot render frames. Label each frame with
title or name, and include a linear version of its content within the
NOFRAMES element.
9Tables  Some Web technologies have trouble reading tables. Avoid using
tables to format text columns. Use the headers, scope and abbr attributes
to mark-up complex tabular information.
10Evaluate accessibility  View your site with different browsers; switch
off graphics, sounds and animations; navigate via keyboard; use a
monochrome monitor; use automated analysis tools.
