Nice web.

One comment: it's not clear that there are more technique slides for a
given guideline that just the first one hit this guideline slide, and
I came back to the guideline without reading some nice examples as a
result.

I think the link at the bottom of technique slides should not only
point back to the relevant guideline slide but also to the next
technique slide for the same guideline. No need for the previous
technique since the back button or the back arrow are available. In
fact this "next technique" link is just an indication that there is a
next technique, but we might as well make it a real link to it.
