My suggestion is that the message should be:
Validation before browser rendering tests.

Or change the last tip to: 
Evaluate youe site for accessibility. Run it through a validator, 
run it through a validator, run it through a validator, 
and take some other optional tests as well, such as Bobby, and rendering 
in some browsers/cofigurations.

The reason for this is that my Opera3.2 sometimes (yes, its random) 
calls this tip number 5 instead of 10. (in the HTML version ofcourse) 
That's what happens when a DIV that starts before <OL>
ends before  </OL>, or if you check your page in many browsers 
with images on and off, and Lynx, and a speaking browser, the big two, 
but not in a validator.
