I don't see in the card:

-for image maps, use ALT text for all AREA elements. (item 4 doesn't do it
for me)
-also, repeat links as text on page
-for images of text, put all text in ALT
- pausing or freezing of blinking, scrolling, etc. which is priority 1 in GL

I question how much we want to

- tell people to not use tables for format.  It's only priority 2 in
guidelines, and it allowed until "a majority of browsers in use" support
style sheets".  I'm afraid so many authors rely on tables that they will
rebel at card, with some justification.

- spend card space talking about "consistent page organization"  The only
people who would respond to that design their pages consistently already,
or at least think they do.

It confused me to jump from web technologies not rendering frames, to
labeling each frame with title or name, and then back to NOFRAMES

Quick tips for making your site accessible to people 
with disabilities & users of mobile or slow Web devices
1       Images, photographs & animations  Concisely describe the purpose or
content of all visuals. Use the alt attribute.
2       Page organization  A consistent page layout helps people with
visual and
learning disabilities. Use headings, lists and table summaries to make
pages easy to scan.
3       Imagemaps  Many people cannot use a mouse. Use the MAP element to
provide
imagemap hotspot text anchors.
4       Hypertext links  Descriptive link text improves access for those who
cannot see. Ensure that each link makes sense when read alone.
5       Graphs & charts  Summarize content or use the longdesc attribute.
 6      Audio  For people who cannot hear audio content, provide captions or
transcripts.
7       Video  Provide text or audio descriptions of video content. 
8       Frames  Some Web technologies cannot render frames. Label each
frame with
title or name, and include a linear version of its content within the
NOFRAMES element.
9       Tables  Some Web technologies have trouble reading tables. Avoid using
tables to format text columns. Use the headers, scope and abbr attributes
to mark-up complex tabular information.
10      Evaluate accessibility  View your site with different browsers; switch
off graphics, sounds and animations; navigate via keyboard; use a
monochrome monitor; use automated analysis tools.
