Alan wrote that validating HTML and using Bobby was not an either / or 
propsition, and explained why.

I agree, but it seemed to me that if they had to be prioritised I would 
suggest that validating HTML is the most important, and then bobby 
checking was probably more important than using a few browsers oneself - 
since it is easy to do this and still miss things.

Alan also suggested that we do not say ALT text describes the function. 
Again I agree. How about.

All images must have ALT text which performs the function of the image

At this stage the nit picking is important.
