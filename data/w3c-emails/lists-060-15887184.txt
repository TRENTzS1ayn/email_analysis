WAI EO, 

Daniel incorporated comments we received from the page author guidelines
mailing list. Lots of good comments. The result is at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/waicard

Please review and make any last comments by the end of the day today. I
will send it to the printer to run a pilot batch first thing in the morning.

Thank you.

Judy

>new 8. _Frames_ Some Web technologies cannot render frames. Label each
> frame with title or name and include a working hypertext start-page in

>
>old 8. Frames Some Web technologies cannot render frames. Label each

>old 9. _Tables_ Some Web technologies have trouble reading

>In general, I agree with Al and Charles that less is more and that we
