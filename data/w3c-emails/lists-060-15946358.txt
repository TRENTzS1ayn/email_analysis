WAI EO:

An update: the WAI QuickTips went to the printer and back last week. I'm
distributing a pilot version at the W3C AC meeting in Kyoto tomorrow. I put
up a page for feedback, linked from the WAI home page. 

Check out http://www.w3.org/WAI/Overview.html#Resources

The mailing list for feedback is wai-quicktips@w3.org.

Thanks very much everyone for your feedback.

I'll put up additional info next week on how to get copies of the pilot
version.

Judy
