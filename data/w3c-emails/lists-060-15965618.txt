WAI EOWG, Friday Dec 4, also our upcoming meetings:

Reminder that we have a WAI Education & Outreach Working Group meeting
tomorrow Friday December 4.

I note that there has been little European participation on the EO calls
recently. We were hoping that the time change, to earlier in the day, would
make it easier to participate. Are people having problems with the INRIA
phone bridge? The time? The agenda? Please email me or the list to indicate
if you plan to participate or if you want to raise any issues (particularly
the European members).

Time: 8:30 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. US Eastern Standard Time

Phones: 
+1 617 258 9741
+33 (0)1 56 78 14 92

Agenda:
- to follow

Upcoming meetings are:

- December 11 
- December 18 

Please remember that meeting information is posted on our EOWG home page,
at <http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/#Conference Calls:>

Regards,

Judy
