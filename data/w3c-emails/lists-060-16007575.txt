There is a fairly scrappy draft at
http://saltimbocca.srl.rmit.edu.au/tutorial/index.htm

The CSS bit is slightly better put together at

http://saltimbocca.srl.rmit.edu.au/css/index.htm

I have those drafts with me on a CD - If I have time I can bash them into
a neat shape, and add the stuff that never got finished (fixed links, etc)

They went off to get edited, and vanished, so the remaining drafts are all
that is left anywhere except on a broken disk :(

Cheers

Charles
