The recent thread of discussion on the IG list ("Aie it's HUGE",
starting at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/1998OctDec/0380.html)
demonstrates to me the need for a Content guidelines document that
would sit between the business card quicktips and the full blown
50 pages Recommendation. 

Many people on the IG list have argued that this is something EO has
to take care of.

I don't see it in the current list, unless it goes under the article
section.

What do people think ?
