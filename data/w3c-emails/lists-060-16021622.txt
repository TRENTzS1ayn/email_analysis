  I'm inclined to agree. This whole issue came up when I sent Kynn
Bartlett a copy of my powerpoint presentation that I am giving in 1/2 an
hour here at Builder.com Live. I am giving an overview of the "A" section
of the guidelines. Kynn went and looked through them on the Web and thus
saw it in its hugeness.

He has made some excellent points. People are not going to sit through
the guidelines, trying to learn every detail on their own. Perhaps
publishing these guidelines in some sort of book would be very helpful as
well.

More after my presentation.
