How about a booklet? Dena Shumila and I once produced concise "guidelines"
on accessible html, without examples, that were two or three pages long.
If I were doing it again, I would expand the business card by adding
several additional points -- perhaps the ones we had to drop in the
interest of keeping it short, and maybe -- MAYBE -- go into more detail.

Again, the danger is that some people might conclude that this is it as
far as accessibility is concerned. But again, if web designers were to
adhere to these principles, our jobs would be much easier.
