I wonder if <H1>, etc. will yield anything useful?

One problem is that whatever gets done as an "in between" document will:
take a lot of effort; be subject to the same quarrels; serve little
purpose.  

The truth is that the guidelines are a reference work and that their
size shouldn't be any problem since they should only be used from some
sort of index.
