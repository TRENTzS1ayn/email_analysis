We were talking about making available supporting materials to organization
to use for curriculum.  Would it be good to post a link to the presentation,
"Designing Web Sites for People with Disabilities"
www.eeicom.com/dcwebmasters/pwd.  This is a resource for both text and
video?

As Department of Labor  is having email problems with the XMAS attachments,
could you please send any correspondences to both addresses
rneff@moon.jic.com  and rcn@fenix2.dol-esa.gov\

Thanks, rob
