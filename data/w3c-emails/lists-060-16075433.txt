Today is the first time I printed the quicktips and the formatting was all
messed up.  Has anyone else had this problem? I tried in both color and
black and white.

I cringe to ask this and have put on my flak jacket and helmet as I feel I
am going to take a direct hit, but maybe we should ALSO provide a PDF
version.
