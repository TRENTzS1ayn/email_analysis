in stereo now...)

Robert, 

What were you trying to print it from? The "appearance" file? Here's the
scoop on that, but I guess I should add an explanation to the page itself.

The formating that makes it "look like" how it would be on a business card
is done with CSS. Most browser implementations of CSS still barely give a
reliable appearance on the display, and do not at all support consistent
print-out. This doesn't, & wasn't meant to be used to support print-out. 

So, we do need an alternative. Given the extreme problems that many people
have with PDF files, I think once this thing is available in the final
version, we should make it available in several alternative file formats,
including Word & PDF.

Judy
