COMNET is an exposition held in the US at several cities.  The web site is
www.comnetexpo.com and will be going up shortly - not sure when?  The next
COMNET is in Wash DC.  Conferences are 25-28 January and Expositions are
26-28 January.

I called and spoke with Mary Otto, 800.545.3976 and asked if there is anyone
discussing WAI.  She referred me to Bill Laberis, bill@laberis.com, who is
responsible for the conferences and expos.

From my conversation with Mary, I do not think anyone is discussing W3C's
WAI EO.  This conference is geared toward networks.  However, Track 1 is
"Enterprise Intranets and Networked Applications" discusses "making sense
and order form intranets and extranets".  Thinking we may be able to present
the WAI, show PWDs using the different browsers, and discuss what they need
to consider in designing intranets and extranets.  Other ideas?

This may be a long shot for us to get in there, but I ask Judy if she would
take this under consideration.  She could always make a call and speak with
Bill and make a contact.  If there is a way for us to get in some capacity
on short notice, I think we should consider this.  Even if Judy cant make
it, we have several options:
1. Several of us could do our presentation on how to design web sites for
PWDs
2. Al Gilman is local and we could ask him for ideas and support
3. My apologies for not remembering the name of the gentleman that presented
to PBS, but this is another option.

The trick is to make a presentation that is inline with COMNET's Goals.
What do you think?

On another note, is anyone tracking the expos and determining if we should
participate and to what capacity.  This is a great marketing technique.

Also, FOSE is a huge web and software expo for government at the Wash DC
convention Center this winter or early spring.  Has anyone from the W3C
contact FOSE to present.  If not, I can locate the point of contact?  Is
anyone tracking PC EXPO in New York?
