I do not know if anyone has seen this, but we know TV ON THE WEB because
they taped our presentation and placed it on their web site for free.  They
have a separate section for Accessibility.  Go to
http://www.tvontheweb.com/channels/able/index.html
Select C4 Foundation was started by Berry Cuffee , see the text transcript
in the C4 area.

There are other areas here:
1.  Blind/Visually Impaired Able Online
2.  Mobility Impaired Able Online
3.  Deaf/Hard of Hearing Able Online

This is a great resource and we may be able to use Berry or at least ask him
to help.  He is a trained actor, was a stand in for Wesley Snipes and on his
way to a great acting career.  He has connections and has worked with
Christopher Reeves.

DING! DING! DING!  I recommend we approach Barry and ask for his inputs and
thoughts.  What better opportunity for him and us.  He may be willing and
able to bring this to the attention of other people!!!!  Shall we start a
dialog?
