My apologies for the interruption and leaving the discussion, but all the
cubicles were being judged and everyone was playing the XMAS music and full
of cheer.  If I asked them to quiet down, I would have been perceived as
"Ebinezer Scrooge",  so I opted to not subject the teleconference to this
boisterous crowd!

I do have two questions:

1.  Did anyone receive a previous email this week where I asked the
addressed Font Face and Size and their applicability to the quick tips and
page authoring guide.  If not, I can resend.

2. Before we started the discussion, a gentlemen from the UK mentioned they
were doing research on Fonts. My apologies, but I cannot remember who that
is? Can you please email me.

Here are two resources:
a. Human Factors International, http://www.humanfactors.com/ has many Phd
types on staff and have done a lot of current research. Let me know if you
need a contact.  I have read their newsletters and find them to be of
interest.
b. Bureau of Labor Statistics, www.bls.gov  has done a lot of research, see
http://www.bls.gov/opbhome.htm.  I have two papers here that may be of
interest and need to find them.  Since I have been at Department of Labor, I
have been amazed at how much research Bureau of Labor Statistics has done.
