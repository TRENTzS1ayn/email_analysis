Please go to http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/one/  to see the changes.  The
"slide enlargement" feature is no longer implemented in this set.  

There have been significant updates to the format of the curriculum slides.
 Many link problems and some display problems have been resolved.  Further
changes to the navigation system will be along soon.  I have added some
sections to the Introduction as well as the W3C copyright statement to the set.
