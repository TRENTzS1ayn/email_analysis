Suggested order

1. Intro -- Tim's piece 

2. Latest news item teaser with date (to show site changes)

3. Mission -- brief, mention start and end time frame.
   Make separate from

4. Index/menu
    Authors
    User Agent builders
    Site evaluation and repair
    Training materials

5. WAI IPO: 
(bullets in there look like titles, even though they follow the
material describing them. Instead, I suggest that the lead to each
part start with run-in containing <A href="URL">...</a>
for them?)

I'd not set off the Technology stuff from the general and educational
stuff preceding it. Some general and education is technical! 

I dislike using underline for anything other than to indicate an HREF. 
The color-blind may not make the distinction.
Just omit the stylesheet entry for "tech", and the attributes 
class="tech" three places on H3:
    <H3 class="tech">...</H3> 
used on Technology development, Guidelines, and Tools. Styling just to be
different shouldn't conflict with familiar patterns of use.

6. You Can Participate
    
I feel that the title "Stay Informed, Get Involved" are passive ideas, 
as if done for the reader. They also presume the reader is already 
informed.
How about "Learn more by participating", or Learn and participate"

Omit reference to WAI Monthly Bulletin, or when and if there is one,
put it in menu.

7. History
As this grows, it may well be a pointer to a separate URL with the
set of accomplishments.

----
As a general observation, we should start using XML principles of complete
tagging (start and end tags). We might well precede each <H2...> and <H3 ...>
by a <DIV> and close each with </DIV> at the appropriate place.
Also, <BR/> and <IMG.../> indicate the close of otherwise EMPTY elements.
