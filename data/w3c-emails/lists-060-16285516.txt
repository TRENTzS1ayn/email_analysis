Pop-up Menus are becoming more widely used and we need to consider
addressing their use.  Lets start a thread to discuss the positives and
negatives for accessibility.  Please refer to a posting:

http://webreference.com/dev/menus/  and the caption states,"Sites with many
pages might find Universal Related Popup Menus to be an effective way to
organize a clear and structured navigation system."

Is there a proper use, such as ensuring the tool bar is used in the new
window?
Should these be addressed in the QUICKTIPS?
