Apologies to everyone who had difficulty getting onto the bridge. We 
are trying to sort out what caused the problems.

If you have topics to bring up with Education and Outreach during the 
face to face meeting please send them to the list.

Phil will be sending the draft dependencies document to the list 
before the face to face meetings.

Matt will send detailed logistics regarding the Linz meeting to the list.

Thanks
Jutta
