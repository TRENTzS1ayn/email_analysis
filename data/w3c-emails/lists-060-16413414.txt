This is a great summary of WAI. Thanks, Judy for pulling it
together.

Navigation: Tab order. Repeat arrows at bottom, for when I have
large type so have to scroll down to see it all, then scroll back
up to get to the "next" arrow. The W3C and WAI logos appear first
in the tab order, so always have to be skipped over. You could
use TABINDEX to reorder. [I note that in the Page Content Guidelines the
icon order is "next", "prior", "top".]

Even if stylesheet-driven, I believe a user rule with an declaration marked
important should override the corresponding author declaration.
 [Size has some inconsistent behavior in 
Netscape Navigator 4.51. Some state memory on size may be
part of caching.]

Slide 2:   "advance forward" is redundant. ?Mention size cycling?
You mention "third link, or right arrow. Why the third link?
It is the fifth link now I believe.

I wish page-up, page-down keys could be used with these, as part
of our guidance to always provide keyboard equivalents to mouse
actions. [They do work in Powerpoint.]

Also, we should have text equivalents for icon-only actions.

Slide 5: Of course, population is aging, second by second. Average age is
increasing.

Slide 11: Add links to SMIL, MathML

Slide 12: "addresses accessibility of user agent user interface and
rendering of accessibility information" 

How about omitting "user agent", as it is subject in the containing bullet.

Authoring Tools   
Audience is developers of any means to produce web pages. 
WYSIWYG editors would not be my first-listed. Some instances
of such give no or negligible control over what is generated
for the web, and are among the worst offenders. Does "generation
tools" include dynamically custom-generated material? 

Slide 13. I'd like a link to Bobby, even though it isn't a
W3C site. [I note it is repeated with link on pg 16.]

Since only one sub-bullet under the last two bullets, coalesce?

Slide 14: Who takes responsibility for WAI Q&A?
[Often Q&A answers have pointers to more detailed explanations.
Our discussion didn't suggest that you were doing such.]
[assume that pointer to it will be on WAI home page.]

Mention Calendar of meetings and conferences.
 
Slide 17: 
Ensure that those preparing web pages are accessibility-aware.
Use training materials or call for experts to help present it.

Regards/Harvey
