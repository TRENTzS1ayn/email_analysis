I have added my comments to this - look for HB: and CMN:

On Fri, 2 Apr 1999, Harvey Bingham wrote:

  This is a great summary of WAI. Thanks, Judy for pulling it
  together.
  
  Navigation: Tab order. Repeat arrows at bottom, for when I have
  large type so have to scroll down to see it all, then scroll back
  up to get to the "next" arrow. The W3C and WAI logos appear first
  in the tab order, so always have to be skipped over. You could
  use TABINDEX to reorder. [I note that in the Page Content Guidelines the
  icon order is "next", "prior", "top".]
  
  Even if stylesheet-driven, I believe a user rule with an declaration marked
  important should override the corresponding author declaration.
   [Size has some inconsistent behavior in 
  Netscape Navigator 4.51. Some state memory on size may be
  part of caching.]

CMN:
The icons are not as self-explanatory as they could be. I also think that
"last slide" "table of contents" "next slide" is more useful ALT than the
titles, since it takes a while to figure out what the titles are, and with
long titls they go all over the page in a text browser.

HB:  
  Slide 2:   "advance forward" is redundant. ?Mention size cycling?
  You mention "third link, or right arrow. Why the third link?
  It is the fifth link now I believe.
  
  I wish page-up, page-down keys could be used with these, as part
  of our guidance to always provide keyboard equivalents to mouse
  actions. [They do work in Powerpoint.]
  
  Also, we should have text equivalents for icon-only actions.

CMN:
We do. But it is often helpful to put the text into the icon, as well as
into the ALT (see above about icons not being self-explanatory)

Slide 2:
Since it says it will be updated periodically, adding a date would be
good.

Slide 3:
The first list only requires a couple of words (like "the") to make it
proper grammar, which would be nice.

I would prefer to see civic participation emphasised a bit more - it is a
crucial reason for accessibility in areas where governments are serious
about being online.

Slide 4:
Visual disabilities gives a list of things which are usually badly done,
the others give lists of actual problems, which I prefer. for example,
lack of alternative content for graphics, framesets. Visual effects
produced by abuse of structure...

HB:  
  Slide 5: Of course, population is aging, second by second. Average age is
  increasing.
  
CMN:
Slide 6:
incorporating stylesheets is part of supporting device-independence and
does not need to be singled out here. I would say "...can Also:"

I would parenthesise the examples of mobile devices etc.

Slide 7:
This seems Very US-centric.

Slide 8:
We really address accessibility all the way from the design table to
legacy deployments and beyond. (But do we want to say that?)

Slide 9:
I would put this towards the very end, with some mention in slide 8.

HB:
  Slide 11: Add links to SMIL, MathML

CMN:
  There is a split between past work (eg HTML 4, SMIL 1, etc) and future
(design table) work (eg SVG, etc) which could be made a lot clearer here.
  
HB:
  Slide 12: "addresses accessibility of user agent user interface and
  rendering of accessibility information" 
  
CMN:
  There is a formatting inconsistency here - WCAG is bulleted but UAAG and
ATAG are not.

HB:
  How about omitting "user agent", as it is subject in the containing bullet.
  
  Authoring Tools   
  Audience is developers of any means to produce web pages. 
  WYSIWYG editors would not be my first-listed. Some instances
  of such give no or negligible control over what is generated
  for the web, and are among the worst offenders. Does "generation
  tools" include dynamically custom-generated material? 

CMN:
Agree, and yes it does

HB:  
  Slide 13. I'd like a link to Bobby, even though it isn't a
  W3C site. [I note it is repeated with link on pg 16.]
  
  Since only one sub-bullet under the last two bullets, coalesce?
  
  Slide 14: Who takes responsibility for WAI Q&A?
  [Often Q&A answers have pointers to more detailed explanations.
  Our discussion didn't suggest that you were doing such.]
  [assume that pointer to it will be on WAI home page.]
  
  Mention Calendar of meetings and conferences.

CMN:
I assume there will be more things linked here (because I want there to be
- grin)
   
HB:
  Slide 17: 
  Ensure that those preparing web pages are accessibility-aware.
  Use training materials or call for experts to help present it.

In general think this is a very cool resource.
