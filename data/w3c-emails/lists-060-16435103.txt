              CALL FOR PAPERS: IwC Journal

             "Interfaces for the Active Web"

        A special issue of Interacting with Computers,
 the interdisciplinary journal of human-computer interaction

          http://www.visualize.uk.com/iwc/activeweb
            http://www.hiraeth.com/iwc/activeweb

The General Editorial and Management Board of the journal Interacting
with Computers invites practitioners and academics to participate in
a special issue dedicated to interfaces for the active web.

The web is changing. Its pages are no longer static, but moving,
changing, interacting. Even as we watch, it is evolving from an
information repository into a distributed interface to a global
networked computational engine. But this change has its price. Can
users understand what they are seeing? What is the appropriate
technology? How do we ensure that the goals and objectives of our
highly dynamic and interactive sites are met?

To find correct answers to these, as with all design problems, we
must surely match the technology to the needs. Sometimes, for
marketing or image reasons this means using the newest technology
just because it is the newest and sexiest. But when functionality
and usability matter it is likely to mean using a blend of technologies
and often a socio-technical solution, involving, dare we say it, people!

This special issue of Interacting with Computers will focus on issues
surrounding the design, development and evaluation of dynamic interfaces
for the Web. Potential topics include (but are not limited to) the
following:

* Design approaches and techniques suitable for dynamic web content
* Usability studies regarding active web front-ends
* Client/server technologies and standards
* Database-driven approaches
* Emerging end-user devices (e.g. mobile and small-screen
  devices, web-phone, web-TV)
* Dialogue persistence and state
* Intelligence and knowledge-based support
* Web accessibility
* Multi-lingual approaches
* E-commerce solutions
* Software tool support
* Personalisation at the web interface
