I though the Quicktips were the best thing since apple pie.  Now i say the
Web Accessibility Initiative Overview is the best thing since the Quicktips!
I am impressed, people will be able to really use this and understand it!
Great message.

Here are my comments on Slide 6, 7 and 14.

Slide 6  Accessibility Contributes to Universal Design.
1.  Shouldnt this be reversed, 'Universal Design  Contributes to Universal
Accessibility?

2.  "driving, low bandwidth, noisy or noiseless environements, screen-glare"

From a cognitive perspective may want to move 'driving'  to the end and say
'while driving' .  Driving by itself may be confusing from a syntax
perspective.

Slide 7  Web Accessibility is a Requirement in Some Settings
1.  For USA, would like to see ADA pertains or covers 'whom' and
Rehab covers pertains or covers 'whom' (Not sure if 'covers' is the correct
term).

Slide 14,
1. Link to Quicktips

All slides.
1. Put buttons on bottom so people do not have scroll up to go back and
forth.
