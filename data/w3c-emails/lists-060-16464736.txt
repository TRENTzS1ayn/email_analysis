two things.

1.  TV ON THE WEB has volunteered in some capacity to tape or do live
footage with possible capitons using text captioning at FedWeb 99.  Not sure
of the details, but have presented this to Fed Web.  There is a universal
accessibility track and i hope we can get some of these taped.  more later
as this develops.  please do not distribute this info.

2.  The presentation on the 14th has a great line up.  Ray from Prodworks,
Dave Poehlman on JFW, Joe Roeder  on WinVision, TV ON THE Web (Jeff Pledger)
will show the Kennedy livecast from CSUN so hearing assistive technology
will be in there,  Lynx may be demonstrated and I will show Bobby and W3C
HTML Validator.

TV ON THE WEB is checking their schedule to see if they can live cast this
with streaming text.

3. I just added this.  My apologies for missing the meeting.
