I had an earlier comment on Slide 6 and would like to clarify some more.


'driving'  could be changed to
a.  while in the car.
b.  in the mobile office.  This could be at home, traveling , in the hotel,
or anywhere
c.  in the mobile office or when away from the PC.
d.  while traveling.  To mean out of the office

just brainstorming.  these just dont sound right but they are close.
