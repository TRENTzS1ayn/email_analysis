IS everyone in the EO on the IG?  Is there anyone that is not?  Here is a
copy from the IG.

I am still waiting for the day when one page can be read by all.  as a
designer , manager, generally concerned about access, and trying to create
accessible sites, i am waiting for standards.  The content guidelines will
be a start, but i want to see a test configuration that details the minimum
browsers that the W3C supports.  We need to give the design community
metrics they can afford to implement.  When i say metrics, i mean one
graphical browser, one text, ont screen reader.  we need to get designers
and their managers buy-in and to tell them that there are over fifty
browsers that the community can use and need to test is ludicrous.

should we consider applying the same standards to browsers in the web
content guidelines as we do to requirements, for example:  Lynx, pwWebSpeak,
Netscape 4.5, IE 4.2, Opera, webtv, JFW would be a Priotity one and double
A.   Categories for browsers would be Graphical, Text, Voice, Screen
Reader - any other categories.

There has to be a phyiscal test standard.  We have started this with the Web
Content Guidelines, lets add a minimum browser test!  Could the Web
Characterization committe provide input as to the most popular browsers and
update the list on a quarterly basis?
