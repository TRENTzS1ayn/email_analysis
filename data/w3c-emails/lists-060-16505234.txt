Unfortunately, if Netscape cannot find a stylesheet when it looks for one,
this problem arises (in a number of Netscape 4.x versions). The solution
is to ensure that you do not refer to a stylesheet which is not there.

(At least that's the only thing I have found to work, and so far it has
always worked for me)

  On the pages with no css no problem.  Once he landed on a menu using css
  and clicked on a link, that link did not work.  He used other computers in
  his library but with same netscape and same problem.  
  
  We removed the css and he was ok.  
  
  Anyone had a problem like this?
  
  He also said since they went to the Netscape 4.5 that they have been unable
  to access the main NY Public Library web.
