Tagging acronyms and abbreviations would be very kind. I generally try to
spell out anything less commonly understood than WAI (within the W3C) or
USA in more general contexts. I don't suppose that is feasible here. Sigh.

  Here is a comment on slide 8.  This slide says, "major sponsors include: US
  NSF, US DOE NIDRR, EC TIDE, Government of Canada, IBM/Lotus, Microsoft "
  
  Do we need to add the accronym tag and suggest this should be written as,
  "major sponsors include: U.S. NSF, U.S. D.O.E.  "  What about the other
  Acronyms?  I would even consider spelling out NSF and DOE.  Periods need to
  be used on acronyms, because if the pwWebSpeak and other browsers are not
  set up to read "US" as United States, it will read it as 'us''; it will try
  to pronounce 'NSF" and will pronounce 'DOE" as the female deer, 'doe'.
  
  I remember the first time i used pwWebSpeak to test the site at Dpetartment
  of Labor, the accronym 'DOL' was pronounced doll!
  
  Also, may want to look elsewhere on the slides where we use accronyms.
