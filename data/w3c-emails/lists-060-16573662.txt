I am writing to comment on the Agenda's item 4) Exploration of "templates"
idea in lieu (at least temporarily) of demo sites - look at "W3C Core
Styles" <http://www.w3.org/StyleSheets/Core/>  is it possible for us to do
something similar for accessiblity?

Rob>As I am learning CSS, the following would be helpful to me and possibly
others.
1.  I reviewed the W3C stylesheet at <www.w3.org> and did not understand
some of the descriptive objects used.   I would suggest that a when the six
or so example stylesheets are made they would show line item examples of
each style used and why that term was used.  Something similar is already
being sone in the W3C CSS examples.  But i would go further and base the
entire page on the examples used in the actual stylesheet.  This would be
for dense people like me who sometimes need a hammer over the head to
understand - big hammer.
3.  Need to show examples of different margins and how to change this.
4.  Example of relative versus absolute call out to a stylesheet
5.  No repeat on background images.
6.  Both types of positioning.
7.  Show a couple with various tables designs and one without.
8.  Lie's W3C CSS book is very good and if they were to take bullets out of
there, that would be good.

If anyone could do this soonest, this would really help my learning curve
<smile>.
