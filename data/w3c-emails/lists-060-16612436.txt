WAI EOWG Meeting Agenda, Friday, April 9, 1999

Time: 8:30 a.m. - 10:00 a.m. US EST
Phone bridge: US: +1 (617) 252-1038

Agenda:

1) Outreach & Updates

2) Draft for review: Reference note on "Functional and Technical
Requirements Related to Web Accessibility"
- document to review is at
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/WAI-access-profiles-19990409>
- please note that this is a partial draft -- the first section
(description of different types of disability, with some examples of
functional requirements) needs extensive review; the second section (a list
of some types of assistive technologies) needs to have their
technical/compatibility requirements spelled out) and the third section (an
adaptation of Marja's "scenarios" material from an earlier draft at
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/WAIscenarios.htm> has yet to be incorporated.
- please review the "functional & tech requ" document for:
* are the descriptions of disabilities and functional limitations clear?
* is the use of disability terminology acceptable?
* will the discussion of disability types & functional issues carry across
different cultures and languages reasonably well?
* is the approach on discussion of assistive technologies useful?
* etc.
- given the lack of lead time for reviewing the document prior to the
meeting, we will walk through the document during the call; however any
prior- or post-meeting comments are always welcome.

3) Discussion of status of other deliverables that are important as
supporting resources for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.
- basically, over the next several weeks we will be wrapping up a number of
things that have been in development. Today's piece should be one of the
last influxes of raw/new material for a while. Anyone working on other
pieces that have not yet made it to the finish line, please review what is
needed to complete these -- thanks.

4) Upcoming meetings.

Regards,

Judy
