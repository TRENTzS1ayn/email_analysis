I am trying to be politically correct and could use some advice. Here is the
statement, 

"If the coin above is bouncing, you're ready to view all the graphical maps
and other visual aides in this section. Enter the 50 State Quarters Program!

If the coin isn't moving, you may download the free Shockwave Flash plug-in.
If you do not want to install the Shockwave plug-in or are seeing-impaired,
you can still enjoy the site, but will not be able to view graphical maps
and other visual aides.  You are still able to report where you found a
state quarter and view geographic information in text format."
Is see-impaired politically correct? and is this stated well?  Thoughts?
Sorry for the global email but trying to get as many opinions as possible.
