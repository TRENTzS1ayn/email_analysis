AC:: "A disability is a consequence of design flaws in the environment."

WL: I think I'm in love with this as the first thing in the Note.  This
way we could discuss the problems with Web design instead of starting
from "intellectual impairment" etc.; e.g., the problem with a mouse is
that people using single-switch computers can't access stuff that
depends on "mouseover" and it doesn't really matter why someone is using
a single-switch computer or chooses not to use a mouse because they're
power users (which is in a certain sense a disability).
