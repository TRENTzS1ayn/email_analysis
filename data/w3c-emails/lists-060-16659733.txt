I would just leave it as "if you don't want to install the Shockwave
plugin, you will be able to report where you found ..."

It doesn't really matter why people don't use it. I'd also put the how to
do it by text first, and then offer a fancy version, but I think that's
just personal preference.

  "If the coin above is bouncing, you're ready to view all the graphical maps

  If the coin isn't moving, you may download the free Shockwave Flash plug-in.
  If you do not want to install the Shockwave plug-in or are seeing-impaired,
  you can still enjoy the site, but will not be able to view graphical maps
  and other visual aides.  You are still able to report where you found a
  state quarter and view geographic information in text format."
  Is see-impaired politically correct? and is this stated well?  Thoughts?
  Sorry for the global email but trying to get as many opinions as possible.
