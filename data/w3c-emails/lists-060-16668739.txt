AusWeb99 Delegate Vacancies

Due to cancellations we now have some vacancies available for delegates
wishing to attend the AusWeb99  conference. An early bird rate will be
given to those delegates who register now. If you would like to register
please contact spower2@scu.edu.au (Ph: 02-66203932) for a fax back
registration form.

AusWeb Roadshows - Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane

For those of you who have not made it to the full AusWeb99 conference in
Ballina this year we are offering a one day Roadshow series with partner
organisations: the Information Industries Board, Sunrise and  Uniserve
Science.

Brisbane 21st April
Melbourne 22nd April
Sydney 23rd April

The basic one day program in each city will be a keynote, several paper
presentations and in the afternoon the choice of a tutorial. Individual
city programs are available via the conference home page
http://ausweb.scu.edu.au

If you are in Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane this is your opportunity to
sample some of the AusWeb99 program without leaving home. We hope you will
come along and perhaps bring a colleague or co-worker and introduce them to
AusWeb. If the program is successful we will expand it to other capital
cities and regional centres in 2000.

Thanks,
The AusWeb team.
