It is a trivial issue, but there is a very large group of computer
programmers (probably larger as a proportion than among general users) who
prefer to use a command line (keyboard-based) environment than a
'point-and-click' User Interface). However it would be a fair observation
that the proportion of these people is significantly lower in User
Interface Design than in other areas. I personally believe that this is a
result of marketing priorities, since it has been widely accepted for the
last decade or so that graphical User Interfaces are more 'user friendly',
at least in the 'mass-market'.

(I am not a touch typist. But I do prefer to use a keyboard interface for
all common tasks, and find it frustrating when there isn't one.)

  I also notice that mouse users are usually non-typists.  Computer
  programmers are not usually typists.  They find the mouse easier than
  learning good touch typing.  Hence they design the interface for their
  touch typing disability.
