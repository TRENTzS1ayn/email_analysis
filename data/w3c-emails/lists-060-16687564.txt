The mouse is easier because there is a simple mental model to learn: see,
point and click and you don't have to load your memory so much as you can
usually see what is available. With typing UI's the user needs to remember
the commands and keys to use. Touchtyping ability helps of course by
automating the search of characters in the keyboard and making typing faster.
