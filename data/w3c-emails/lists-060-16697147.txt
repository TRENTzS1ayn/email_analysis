I don't believe that making a general statement of who a law applies to,
when we have that information, makes the page US-Centric, as long as we
don't just do that for the U.S.

>Are rehab act and ADA specific to US? 

Those particular laws are, yes; they are not international laws. 

>What does ADA and Rehab mean in other countries?  

Several other countries have "DDA's" -- Disability Discrimination Act --
see the policy page. These laws are not necessarily any more specific to
info tech than is the ADA, so it is only when there is a specific policy
interpretation in place relating to info tech that the bearing on the Web
is clearer. With regard to the Rehabilitation Act, I'm not aware of other
countries that have the _specific provisions_ regarding access to
information technology such as Sec. 508.

>Can we add other intiatives.

Such as...? Purpose of this page is for laws & policies, so if you are
aware of others, let me know.
