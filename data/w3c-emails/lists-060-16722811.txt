WAI EOWG

There will be no meeting of the WAI EOWG this Friday, April 16, 1999. 

Documents that group members are working on will be ready by next Friday's
discussion, April 23, but this week's time seems better spent preparing
materials related to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

See you next week,

Judy
