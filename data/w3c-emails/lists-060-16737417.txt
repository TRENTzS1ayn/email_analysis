Alan, my wife will be hanging around for some days, and if you have the
time she would probably be really keen to have an insiders tour. I presume
I will be a bit busy. Sigh. But a get-together of some kind would be cool.

  Jutta is organizing an event for Saturday night for all the W3C people in
  attendance (about 40!), but I would be happy to organize a small event
  (brunch or supper at my place/at a restaurant, or whatever) for EOWG
  people at another time. (Thursday or Friday night? Sunday morning?)
  
  If anyone is interested in getting an insider's tour of Toronto and
  environs, let me know. If I lived in California, I would brag that I was a
  tour-guide in Atlantis in a previous reincarnation. But because I live in
  Toronto, I will simply say that I really like giving visitors a taste of
  our neighbourhoods, haunts, routes, architecture, art, geological wonders,
  and culinary delights.
