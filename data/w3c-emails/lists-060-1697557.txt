> PJ: Still working on the dependencies document.
>
> PJ: Will be in Linz.
>
> PJ: On this telecon would like to discuss how dependent we are on WCAG
2.0.
>
> JT: One of dependencies is their prioritization scheme - they may be
prioritizing at the technique level, rather than the checkpoint level.
>
> JR: It will mean a modification of the meaning of Rel. Priorities.
>
> LN: Won't this be problem for UA as well?
>
> JT: UA is not as dependent.
>
> JT: MM attends WCAG meetings so you probably knows more.
>
> PJ: Will we be meeting with WCAG?
>
> JT: May be able to get an hour...but it may have to be at lunch or dinner.
>
> EO Meeting
> JT: End of July EO is meeting in Toronto. Are there specific things we
should tell them?
>
> PJ: Some people have questionned the way Checkpoint 7 is included. Should
we just be focussing on 1-6 for purchasing.
>
> JT: This would be a very sensitive isssue.
>
> JR: Still would like to explore putting Guideline 7 in a separate
document.
>
> PJ: Maybe we should point to Section 508.
>
> LN: 508 is a US standard. It's useful but...
>
> JT: There are European and Australian standards.
>
> DG: Other standards will leap frog US 508 and so we should keep other
options open.
>
> [Heather Swayne, Matt May e-mail - can't connect to telecon]
>
> JT: There could be two guiding principles - 1 - that the tools produce
accessible markup and 2 - that the tools be accessible.
>
> PJ: We should also point them to our new tools section.
>
> JT: OK
>
> PJ: Proposals in the EU to adopt ATAG Priority 1 and WCAG Priorities 1,2.
