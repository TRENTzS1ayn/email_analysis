Charles,

There do seem to be parallels between ATAG and XAG and these should be
investigated - but ATAG does go further than XAG in specifying the
relationship between tools and authors.

By the way:

An interesting side effect of the reordering proposal is that it helps
to explain why we were having such trouble coming up with
categorizations for our implementation techniques...
...we were trying to categorize techniques written at differing
conceptual levels.

For example:
- Tier 1 (enable accessibility) techniques are probably most
appropriately divided by FORMAT TYPE (i.e. "consider using SVG for
graphics"), whereas
- Tier 2 (support accessibility) techniques are probably most
appropriately divided by the TYPES OF ACCESSIBILITY PRACTICES ("i.e.
here's how to prompt for or repair short labels vs. long text
descriptions"), whereas
- Tier 3 (integrate accessibility features) techniques are most
appropriately divided by the USER INTERFACE METAPHOR employed (i.e.
"here's how to integrate prompts of different kinds into a text-based
editor vs. a WYSIWYG editor"). 

Perhaps this will lead us to a different categorization scheme for each
"Tier"?

Cheers,
Jan
