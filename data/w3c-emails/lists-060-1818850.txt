Matt,

Thanks for providing the raw count. A quick and dirty analysis shows
that:

In the worst case scenario (0% efficiency), each technique would apply
to every category, so the categories mean nothing:

   # of icons = # of techniques * # of categories

In the best case scenario (100% efficiency), each technique would belong
to only one category, so:

   # of icons = # of techniques

So, for the whole document:

> Markup Editing Tools: 96
> Multimedia Creation Tools: 75
> Content Management Tools: 78
> Programming Tools: 55
> Conversion Tools: 6

# of Techniques: 106
BEST CASE = 106 Icons
WORST CASE = 530 Icons
ACTUAL = 310 Icons (~52% efficiency)
*EFFICIENCY = 100% - (ACTUAL - BEST CASE)/(WORST CASE - BEST CASE)

But some guidelines are more efficient than others:

> G6:
> Markup Editing Tools: 12
> Multimedia Creation Tools: 12
> Content Management Tools: 12
> Programming Tools: 12
> Conversion Tools: 0
> None specified: 2

# of Techniques: 12
BEST CASE = 12 Icons
WORST CASE = 60 Icons
ACTUAL = 48 Icons (~25% efficiency)

> G7:
> Markup Editing Tools: 23
> Multimedia Creation Tools: 12
> Content Management Tools: 10
> Programming Tools: 7
> Conversion Tools: 0
> None specified: 1

# of Techniques: 28
BEST CASE = 28 Icons
WORST CASE = 140 Icons
ACTUAL = 52 Icons (~79% efficiency)

Unfortunately much of our efficiency is provided by the fact that the
Conversion Tool category is used just 6 times. Leaving out this
category, the efficiency scores are:

All techniques: 38%
G6: 0% (all techniques apply to all 4 categories)
G7: 71%
