Charles,

Sorry for the confusion. I am NOT saying that a technique is less
"useful" if it applies to more than one category (in fact it's possibly
more useful). I AM trying to measure the usefulness of the
categorization scheme we have chosen. In other words, "is the
categorization scheme making divisions among the techniques that are
useful for tool developers". Here are two examples of what I mean:

1. An efficient categorization scheme is male/female (it is ~100%
efficient in dividing people).

2. An inefficient categorization scheme is "people who drink
water"/"people who eat bread" (it is inefficient because so many people
fall into both categories)

If, as we have with ATAG, the efficiency of the categorization scheme is
low we may want to look at whether it is worthwhile to keep it. Of
course, my reordering proposal mentions that we might want to use a
different categorization scheme for each tier - to increase the
efficiency - but this may be too complicated.

Cheers,
Jan
