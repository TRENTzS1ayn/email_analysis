I propose that we remove this checkpoint under Guideline:  Integrate
accessibility solutions into the overall "look and feel":

Ensure that the functionalities for checkpoints 3.1, 3.2 and 4.1 are
always clearly available to the user [Priority 1]

I think the intent of the checkpoint is well covered by another
checkpoint that we already have (we can change its Priority if
necessary):

Ensure that all functionality (prompts, checkers, information icons,
etc.) related to accessible authoring practices is naturally integrated
into the overall look and feel of the tool. [Priority?2]
