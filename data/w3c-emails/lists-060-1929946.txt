Hi folks,

I am against the proposed change. I think that the more limited set of
features being always available (not just integrated somehow) at a higher
priority level is something that we should keep.

Having the accessibility checking in front of the user is a good thing for
helping users to remember to use it, and not give up because they had to look
in a menu or four to find it.

Cheers

Chaals
