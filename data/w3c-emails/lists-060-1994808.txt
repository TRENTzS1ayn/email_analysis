A new working draft of Wombat and the first draft of Wombat techniques have
been posted for review. We will begin discussion of these drafts at the AU
conference call on Monday afternoon.

In addition, there is a new draft of the ATAG 1.0 Implementation Techniques
document. The working group had agreed to publish the draft with and without
the icons representing which technique is relevant to which types of tool,
and this is the only difference in the drafts below. Please evaluate the two
documents to help determine how this information can best be captured, if at
all.
