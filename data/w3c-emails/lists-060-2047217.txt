Hello all,

During the call on Monday, I brought up the fact that some of the
techniques for ATAG 1.0 lack a techniques number and someone else on the
call reminded us that not all the techniques have been categorized.

Here are my suggestions (Note: only the first few words of the
techniques in question are included).

Since the last technique in guideline 7 is T0315, let's start at T0400.
