Jan wrote aht seemed like a good proposal for how to adapt to WCAG 2
confor,ance in its curent state, and asked for feedback.

I think it is a good proposal. (I am less convinced that we should change the
references - it may be useful to be able to publish an intermediate version
of wombat as ATAG 1.X before WCAG 2 is a recommendation.

But  i can't think of any place we have references to specific wcag
checkpoints in the guidelines anyway, so it should still be easy to do.

cheers
