Hi,

I am wondering if we need to renumber the guidelines and checkpoints for the
tiers. I think there is some value in having continuity between the ATAG 1
guidelines and the Wombat ones, even if they are presented in a slightly
different order. (The numbering is really a way to refer to them, and they
don't necessarily have to be in order. It depends how easily confused tool
developers are).

Cheers

Chaals
