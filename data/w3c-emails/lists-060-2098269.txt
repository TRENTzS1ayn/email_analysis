Hi,

I agree that having to re-number the checkpoints from one version to
another is a negative. But, the purpose of the re-numbering is really to
help developers see how the different guidelines build on one another,
which I believe is a positive. Anyhow, the group's decision to move the
guideline on making the tool itself accessible to the front of the
document already necessitates re-numbering, since starting the document
with guideline 7 would be quite odd.

Cheers,
Jan
