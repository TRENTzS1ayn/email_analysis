I have reworded the priorities section using Liddy's comments to try and
make the definition of "Relative Priority" more clear.

Thoughts?

Cheers,

1.2 Checkpoint Priorities

The overall goals of this specification are the following:
That the authoring tool be accessible;
That the authoring tool produce accessible content by default;
That the authoring tool encourage the creation of accessible content.

Each checkpoint in the specification has been assigned one of the
following priority levels to reflect the importance of the checkpoint in
meeting these goals:

[Priority 1]:
This checkpoint is essential to meeting the goals. 

[Priority 2]:
This checkpoint is important to meeting the goals. 

[Priority 3]:
This checkpoint is beneficial to meeting the goals. 

[Relative Priority]
This checkpoint requires a high-level authoring function (e.g. checking
markup accessibility) that depends for its specific requirements on the
checkpoints of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0
[WCAG20]. The priority of this checkpoint is relative because its effect
on the goals is determined by the extent to which its required authoring
function meets the WCAG 2.0 checkpoints. Specifically, the required
authoring function may meet each of the WCAG 2.0 checkpoints at one of
four levels: not met, minimum (most important requirements met), level 2
and level 3 (least important requirements met). The relative priority
level reflects this as follows:

Relative Priority - Level "A": The checkpoint satisfies all relevant
WCAG 2.0 checkpoint requirements to at least the minimum level.

Relative Priority - Level "Double-A": The checkpoint satisfies all
relevant WCAG 2.0 checkpoint requirements to at least level 2.

Relative Priority - Level "Triple-A": The checkpoint satisfies all
relevant WCAG 2.0 checkpoint requirements to at least level 3.

For example:

ATAG checkpoint 5.1 has a relative priority. The checkpoint requires
tools to check for accessible content as defined by the requirements of
WCAG 2.0. This means that if the tool checks for minimum and level 2
requirements of several WCAG checkpoints, but only the minimum
requirements for the rest, the tool would receive Relative Priority -
Priority 1 - for ATAG checkpoint 5.1.

Note: The priority level for each checkpoint has been chosen based on
the assumption that the author is a competent, but not necessarily
expert, user of the authoring tool, and that the author has little or no
knowledge of accessibility. For example, the author is not expected to
have read all of the documentation, but is expected to know how to turn
to the documentation for assistance.
