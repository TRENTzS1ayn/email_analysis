Members of the working group (and interested readers of the list):

In preparation for our face to face meeting, could everyone please 
review the Wombat draft guideline document and the techniques 
document and create a list of issues (concerns, recommended changes, 
etc.) with/without proposed resolutions. Please send your list to the 
listserve by September 17th. We would like to hear from every group 
member whether you are coming to the face to face or not and will nag 
those who don't send in their views.

The documents to review are:

Thanks
