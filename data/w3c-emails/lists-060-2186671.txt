Hi,

For the information of those participating in the Vancouver AUWG
Face-to-Face, Ethernet (rather than wireless) connections will be
available.

BTW: I have not yet heard from some of those who expressed interest in
attending regarding the hotel accommodations. Please let me know by
Thursday.

Cheers,
Jan
