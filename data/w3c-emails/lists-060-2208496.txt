Here's my list of issues for the Vancouver F2F:

List of Issues for Wombat Guidelines

- criteria for a checkpoint being not applicable should be made more
explicit.
- authoring tool definitions should be looked at to see how repair tools
fit in. 
- "minimum" requirements need to be thought of in the context of the
evaluation techniques. 
- "advanced" may be too cumbersome 
- "rationale" should encompass most of the "notes" under checkpoints 
- are we going to require some level of checking beyond providing a
manual? 

List of Issues for Wombat Techniques

- need to finalize categorization scheme? numbering?
- can we expand prompting appendix to a discussion of how to integrate
prompting, checking and repair. 
- we need to look at how implementation techniques connect with
evaluation techniques.
