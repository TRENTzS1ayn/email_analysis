For people attending the Face to Face meetings in Vancouver...

Please be in the lobby of the Sheraton Le Soleil Hotel at 8:00 am
Wednesday to meet the shuttle van, which has been arranged to take us
from the hotel to the venue on the UBC Campus (~15 minutes travel time).

If there are any other questions please contact Matt May or I.

Cheers,
Jan
