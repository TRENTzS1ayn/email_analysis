Perhaps the most important thing we need to get out of the way is the
definition of an authoring tool that we started at the F2F. Here is the
text as it stands. I'll have a go, but perhaps others could also send
comments to the list:

1.1 Definition of Authoring Tool

In these guidelines, the term "authoring tool" refers to the wide range
of software used for creating Web content, including:

- Editing tools specifically designed to produce Web content (e.g.,
WYSIWYG HTML and XML editors);
- Tools that offer the option of saving material in a Web format (e.g.,
word processors or desktop publishing packages);
- Tools that transform documents into Web formats (e.g., filters to
transform desktop publishing formats to Web publishing formats);
- Tools that produce multimedia, especially where it is intended for use
on the Web (e.g., video production and editing suites, SMIL authoring
packages);
- Tools for site management or site publication, including tools that
automatically generate Web sites dynamically from a database, on-the-fly
conversion tools, and Web site publishing tools; (e.g. learning
management tools) - Tools for management of layout (e.g., CSS formatting
tools).
- Combinations of the above???
- Content aggregators???
- Real-time content creators (chat tools, etc.)???
- Services
- Collaborative Agents
