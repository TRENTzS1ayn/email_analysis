For those of you who have undertaken to come up with "success criteria"
for the checkpoints, the attached file may be of interest. It is the
evaluation template that I originally put together for ATAG 1.0, except
that it has been roughly re-organized into the new ATAG 2.0 structure.
This document includes some background and testing text that may prove
useful in the formulation of the new "success criteria".

Cheers,
Jan
