During our next teleconference on October 7, we would like to review 
the success criteria for each of the checkpoints. Could everyone who 
committed to complete a set of success criteria please send them to 
the list prior to the call.

The commitments were as follows (according to new guideline numbering):

Guideline 1 ( New Accessibility of Tool): Phill
Guideline 2 : Jan
Guideline 3 : Jutta and Matt
Guideline 4 : Liddy and Doug

Think of the success criteria as the completion of the statement:
"You know you've met this checkpoint when..."

Thanks Jutta
