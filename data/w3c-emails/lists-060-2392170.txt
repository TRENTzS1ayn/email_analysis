OK, except where the UA/browser maps the mouse event to the keyboard event.
For example, onMouseClick is mapped by IE, Mozilla, etc to the enter key,
so the enter key and/or the mouse fire the same event.  I found the issue
that when adding a redundant device event, such as onKeyPress, two events
get fired causing all kinds of havoc on the server.

So, it's only a few cases where this isn't handled by the UA and not the
author/content, which is also per UAAG.
