MINUTES for AUWG Teleconference (Oct. 7, 2002)

JR: Jan Richards
JT: Jutta Treviranus
LNG: Lou-Nell Gerrard
BR: Bob Regan (Macromedia)
PJ: Phill Jenkins

Agenda

1. success criteria for checkpoints
2. publication update.
3. other

JR: What do people think of the success criteria submissions so far. One
thing that jumped out at me was the use of the term "average author".

BR: Would like more concrete success criteria.

BR: Instead of leaving "Average User" to developers it might be best to
define it on the standards end.

JR: Should we require user testing.

BR: The term "average author" almost requires user testing.

[JT joins]

JR: Some of the requirements are "output oriented" - depend on the
resulting markup rather than any particular tool functionality.

LNG: Who would be responsible for this user testing? developers? W3C?,
etc.

JR: I suppose, whoever wants a conformance statement for a tool has to
pay.

BR: Writing policy that requires user testing is problematic.

JT: We are not writing policy.

BR: He always views W3C standards as policy - since they tend to be
pointed to by governments and other organizations.

BR: user testing raises issue of (1) what happens to smaller developers
(could they afford it), (2) what constitutes a valid test. - would we
need to write verification standards.

[PJ joins]

JT: We have evaluation techniques to handle testing conformance.

JR: We need to put normative statements conformance statements in the
guidelines, while non-normative conformance stuff can go in the eval
techniques.

PJ: SMIL actually has a test suite.

JR: SMIL can do they because that standard is machine readable - unlike
ATAG.

JT: Prompting is so varied - it is difficult to come up criteria for all
the different types of prompting for different types of tools. What do
we want - certain outcomes.

PJ: Does not like the term "average author" - what about just "author"

PJ: Some statements can be negative "Having a code view is not
enough..."

---

Homework (due for the next conformance call - Oct 21):

PJ: Will take over Guideline 3 Success Criteria from JT.

JT: Will take over Guideline 2 Success Criteria from JR.

JR: Will take over Guideline 4 Success Criteria from LN.

BR Will take a look at Guideline 3 Success Criteria and forward comments
to the list by Oct. 15.
