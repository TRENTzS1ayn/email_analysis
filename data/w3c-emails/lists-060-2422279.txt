Hi,

For my Oct. 7 action item, I've made some changes to the first draft of
Guideline 4 success criteria that Liddy put together (I have also made
minor changes to some of the rationale). The new text, along with
Jutta's first draft of criteria Guideline 3 and my text for Guideline 2
are in a new draft of the ATAG 2.0 document (attached).

Please take a look.

Cheers,
Jan
