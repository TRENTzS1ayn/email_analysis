Yes, I agree these are 3 separate topics and need 3 separate checkpoints in
ATAG 2.0

[1] ATAG 1.0 Checkpoint 3.2

http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-ATAG10-20000203/#check-help-provide-structure
[2] ATAG 2.0 Checkpoint ?

If a new checkpoint 3.2 were to handle:

(1) Creating structured content,
(2) Separating information from its presentation, and
(3) Ensuring device independent control.

It might be more clear to break these topics out into three separate
checkpoints.

Cheers,
Jan
