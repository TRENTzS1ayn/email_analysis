By splitting 3.2 "Help the author create structured content and separate
information from its presentation" into 3 separate checkpoints:

(1) Creating structured content,
(2) Separating information from its presentation, and
(3) Ensuring device independent control.

we'll end up with 11 checkpoints under Guideline 3.  Is that too many?

One proposal is to move the last two checkpoints on documentation:

3.8 Document all features of the tool that promote the production of
accessible content.

3.9 Document the process of using the tool to produce accessible content.

to Guideline 4, before checkpoint

4.4 Ensure that creating accessible content is accessibility solutions are
a naturally integrated part of the documentation, including examples.

which seems to naturally fit in a progression about documentation.

Guideline 4 could then change to

Integrate accessibility solutions and documentation into the overall "look
and feel"
