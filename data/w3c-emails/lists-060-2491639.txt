Here is my submission for yesterday's action item (note: I have changed
wording throughtout the checkpoint):

---

3.1 Prompt the author to provide equivalent alternative information for
non-text content (e.g., captions, auditory descriptions, and collated
text transcripts for video). [Relative Priority - See Implementation
Techniques for applicable WCAG checkpoints.] 

RATIONALE: This checkpoint is intended to result in typical tool users
providing equivalent alternatives for all non-text elements (including
alternate text, captions, auditory descriptions, collated text
transcripts for video, etc.). Different tools will accomplish this goal
in ways appropriate to their product and their users.

TECHNIQUES: Implementation Techniques for Checkpoint 3.1, Evaluation
Techniques for Checkpoint 3.1

SUCCESS CRITERIA:

1. The authoring tool reminds the author to provide equivalent
alternatives for each instance of non-text content.

2. The reminder is made available to the author at least once prior to
completion of authoring,

3. Non-text content with pre-existing equivalent alternatives are exempt
from this requirement, if the function of the content is known with
certainty and is matched by the stored alternative (see Checkpoint 3.X).
