Jutta has asked me to go ahead with the planning of the AUWG
Face-to-Face meeting in Toronto, Canada on December 11 and 12, 2002.

We have made some advance bookings at a great Bed and Breakfast at the
edge of the University of Toronto campus
(http://www.madisonavenuepub.com/madisonmanor/). Unfortunately, we are
only able to hold the reservations until Wed., Oct. 30, so please let me
know your attendance plans ASAP.

If you would prefer something more "hotel-like", Toronto offers many
choices, including:

Delta Chelsea

Park Hyatt
http://parktoronto.hyatt.com/property/index.jhtml

Of course, regardless of where you plan to stay, please let me know if
you will be attending. We should have a regististration page up shortly.

Cheers,
Jan
