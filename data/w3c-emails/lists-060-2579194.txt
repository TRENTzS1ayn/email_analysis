We are involved in a project that is proposing a Community-built content
strategy in Australia, where communities would build themselves communities
of interest arounf a new proposed addressing infrastructure like
http://www.nsw.au, www.sydney.nsw.au, www.LocalCommunity.sydney.nsw.au where
NSW is a State of Australia.

Would this list be able to recommend a quality portal building software,
designed to be hosted on UNIX that enables tiered level of administration to
users in these communities.

Naturally, I hope the involvement of this list in defining use of portals by
broader interest groups may have some good bearing on the best solution.

Director
