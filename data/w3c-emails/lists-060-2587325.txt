Giles,

It's nice to see that your organization is taking authoring tool
accessibility into account. Although our group is not able to recommend
specific products, we do maintain a list of conformance reviews at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/2002/tools

I don't think that any portal builders are listed, but we would be
interested to hear what you end up finding.

Cheers,
Jan Richards
