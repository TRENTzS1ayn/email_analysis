where we are referring to the WCAG we need to say content but I still 
think we need to move into working more openly and explicitly on all 
content - the word content does not nec. achieve this, unfortunately.

it whereas appropriate means if you think you want to use it - or

yes - I was struggling to find a word that would do - I was thinking 
of unpredictably - perhaps... - or not anticipated
