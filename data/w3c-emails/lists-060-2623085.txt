Hello all,

Due to an unforeseen number of timing conflicts experienced by our
working group members, Jutta and I have decided to CANCEL the Authoring
Tool Accessibility Working Group face-to-face meeting that was to be
held in Toronto next month.

We will next meet in the new year at a time and place to be chosen by
the group.

If you have any questions please contact me.

Cheers,
Jan
