Agreed - let's talk about this on the next call.

Your full comment was:
"I think the integration you want is achieved by having this
introduction. When people are trying to implement the guidelines, I
think it helps a lot if they can work on bits - so I am not sure there
is the problem you have suggested."
...I'm just not sure to what it refers.

"Relevant" seems fuzzier to me than "appropriate".
ex. "SVG is appropriate for encoding blueprints" vs. "SVG is relevant
for encoding blueprints"?

What about: "While ensuring the accessibility of automated output
provides a solid foundation for accessible content, without proper
supports authors, will likely act in ways that undermine these
measures."

"Request"?
