re Matt's comments...
I think I agree with these too - except for

Guideline 3, first sentence:
Liddy's suggestion: "While ensuring the accessibility of automated 
output provides a solid foundation for accessible content, authors 
often act ideosyncratically."
My attempt: "While ensuring the accessibility of automated output 
provides a solid foundation for accessible content, authors often can 
introduce accessibility issues on their own."

delete 'on their own' I think, and maybe have 're-introduce'???

Liddy.
