On yesterday's WAI-AU teleconference, I announced the formation of a
temporary "Task Force" to examine the issue of User Prompting.

The User Prompting Task Force will meet in Toronto, Canada on Wednesday,
Dec. 11, 2002 between 1:00pm and 5:30pm ET.

At this point, the task force consists of Jutta Treviranus, Phill
Jenkins, Liddy Nevile, Matt May, and Jan Richards, however other working
group members are free to join us either in person or via
teleconference.

An agenda will be compiled shortly, but we anticipate that the task
force will focus on:
(1) ATAG 2.0 checkpoints 3.1-3.4, all of which deal with prompting or
guiding the user in some way.
(2) A review of the definition of "prompt"
(3) A plan for refining our user prompting techniques.

Details for joining via teleconference will be available shortly. For
information on joining the Task Force meeting in person, please contact
me directly (see contact info at the end of this posting).

Cheers,
Jan
