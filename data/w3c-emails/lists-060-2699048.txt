Here are the most recent drafts for internal review. We have a few 
items to be ironed out before sending this out for a wider review, but 
I think this is a large step forward. I'd like to make a first public 
WD of these documents next month.

Checkpoint and Guideline numbering has been updated.
I added a detailed table of contents and links at the top, per our last 
call.

Issues:
3.3 has no supporting text.
A small handful of checkpoints have little or no success criteria.
Techniques for 3.1-3.3 have not been separated.
Some checkpoint numbers may be mismatched.
A number of issues are marked in red boxes throughout the document.

Our next conference call is on 16 December. Please read and review this 
document and bring your issues to the list and to this call. Thanks, 
and thank you to all who have given their input.
