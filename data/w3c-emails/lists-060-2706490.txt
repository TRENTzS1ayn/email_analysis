Hello all,

At our Vancouver F2F, we decided to look at making ATAG20 independent of
the current WCAG version, so that it will remain up to date regardless
of whether WCAG proceeds directly to v2.0 or puts out a v1.0
(Second Edition) first and will remain up to date if and when WCAG puts
out future versions.

I propose the following mechanism for achieving this independence:

(1) In the ATAG20 Guidelines, all instances of "WCAG10" or "WCAG20" in
the definition of Relative Priority and in the checkpoints will be
changed to the more generic "[WCAG]".

(2) Update the ATAG20 Guidelines "References" section (see attached #1).
The added "[WCAG]" section would briefly explain that ATAG20 is
independent of WCAG version and include a link to a new Note:
"References to WCAG" (see attached #2).

(3) The "References to WCAG" Note is a short document that the AUWG
would update each time a new version of WCAG comes out. It would have
sections for each version of WCAG. Within these sections, are
sub-sections that explain (1) how to interpret "ATAG20 Relative
Priority" for that version of WCAG and (2) which WCAG checkpoints in
each version are applicable for each ATAG20 Relative Priority
checkpoint.

(5) While the separate ATAG20 implementation techniques would be needed
for each version of WCAG (i.e. ATAG20 Implementation Techniques for
WCAG 1.0, ATAG20 Implementation Techniques for WCAG 2.0, etc.), these
documents are likely to be largely similar to one another.

Please send questions or comments to the list.
