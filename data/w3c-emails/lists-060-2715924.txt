  Subject: Making ATAG independent of WCAG version


  Hello all,

  At our Vancouver F2F, we decided to look at making ATAG20 independent of
  the current WCAG version, so that it will remain up to date regardless
  of whether WCAG proceeds directly to v2.0 or puts out a v1.0
  (Second Edition) first and will remain up to date if and when WCAG puts
  out future versions.

  I propose the following mechanism for achieving this independence:

  (1) In the ATAG20 Guidelines, all instances of "WCAG10" or "WCAG20" in
  the definition of Relative Priority and in the checkpoints will be
  changed to the more generic "[WCAG]".

  (2) Update the ATAG20 Guidelines "References" section (see attached #1).
  The added "[WCAG]" section would briefly explain that ATAG20 is
  independent of WCAG version and include a link to a new Note:
  "References to WCAG" (see attached #2).

  (3) The "References to WCAG" Note is a short document that the AUWG
  would update each time a new version of WCAG comes out. It would have
  sections for each version of WCAG. Within these sections, are
  sub-sections that explain (1) how to interpret "ATAG20 Relative
  Priority" for that version of WCAG and (2) which WCAG checkpoints in
  each version are applicable for each ATAG20 Relative Priority
  checkpoint.

  (5) While the separate ATAG20 implementation techniques would be needed
  for each version of WCAG (i.e. ATAG20 Implementation Techniques for
  WCAG 1.0, ATAG20 Implementation Techniques for WCAG 2.0, etc.), these
  documents are likely to be largely similar to one another.

  Please send questions or comments to the list.

  1. "WCAG" in ATAG 2.0
  The Authoring Tools Accessibility Guidelines version 2.0 (ATAG20) refers to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) without specifying a version number. This allows ATAG 2.0 to remain in effect as new versions of WCAG are released. 

  The purpose of this document is to provide a bridge between ATAG 2.0 and the most current version of WCAG. This includes:

    1.. Scheme for determing conformance of Relative Priority ATAG 2.0 checkpoints. 
    2.. Links to techniques for Relative Priority ATAG 2.0 checkpoints. 
  Note: When performing an ATAG 2.0 conformance assessment for an authoring tool, you must always specify the version of WCAG that was used to determine conformance of the Relative Priority ATAG 2.0 checkpoints.

  2. Versions of WCAG
  WCAG 2.0 - W3C Working Draft
    Relative Priority Scheme:
    WCAG 2.0 establishes four conformance levels for each of its checkpoints: not met, minimum (most important requirements met), level 2 and level 3 (least important requirements met). The ATAG 2.0 relative priority level reflects this as follows:

      a.. Relative Priority 1: The ATAG 2.0 checkpoint satisfies all relevant WCAG 2.0 checkpoint requirements to at least the minimum level. 
      b.. Relative Priority 2: The ATAG 2.0 checkpoint satisfies all relevant WCAG 2.0 checkpoint requirements to at least level 2. 
      c.. Relative Priority 3: The ATAG 2.0 checkpoint satisfies all relevant WCAG 2.0 checkpoint requirements to at least level 3.

  WCAG 1.0 - W3C Recommendation
    Relative Priority Scheme:
    WCAG 1.0 establishes three priority levels: Priority 1 (most important requirements), Priority 2 and Priority 3 (least important requirements). The ATAG 2.0 relative priority level reflects this as follows:

      a.. Relative Priority 1: The ATAG 2.0 checkpoint satisfies all relevant WCAG 1.0 Priority 1 checkpoints. 
      b.. Relative Priority 2: The ATAG 2.0 checkpoint satisfies all relevant WCAG 1.0 Priority 1 and 2 checkpoints.
