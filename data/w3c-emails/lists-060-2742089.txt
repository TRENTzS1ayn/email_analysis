I would like to thank all of your for allowing me to have served on the
WAI ATAG for a short time. Due to a job responsibility change here in
Adobe, I will no longer be driving the Accessibility Initiative and
therefore will not be able to participate in ATAG any longer. A
replacement has yet to be named, but if Adobe wishes to continue to
serve on this working group, Chuck Myers will notify you of a
replacement on a future date.

Thank you again for all your support, and I wish you the best on the
continued success of WAI.

Best Regards,
Doug Grude
