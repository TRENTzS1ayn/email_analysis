See attached a zip file.

Contains:
1. A proposed re-working of Guideline 3
2. A proposal for techniques for Guideline 3 that includes much of the
material from the the old User Prompting Appendix.
3. An MS word file containing a quick analysis of the applicability of
various versions of ATAG to WCAG 1.0 and WCAG 2.0. More on this tomorrow
at the meeting (1pm ET).

Cheers,
Jan
