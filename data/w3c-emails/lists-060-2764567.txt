submitted to the full AU working group for amendments and a formal vote.

Agenda:

1. Recap of the history of user prompting checkpoints in ATAG.
2. Jan's proposal for one "user assistance" checkpoint. (see Dec. 10
mailing)
3. Discussion
4. User prompting and Implementation Techniques
5. User prompting and Evaluation Techniques

Cheers,
Jan
