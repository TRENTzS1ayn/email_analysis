The User Prompting Task Force met on Wednesday, Dec. 11 and decided to
recommend the following proposal:

(1) That checkpoints 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 in the most ATAG 2.0 recent
public draft be removed.

(2) That a new checkpoint be added in their place ("3.1 Prompt and
assist the author to avoid accessibility problems when they add or edit
content. [Relative Priority]")

(3) That a minor change in the ordering of Guideline 3 be made so that
the checkpoints for checking and correcting will now be numbered 3.2 and
3.3.

See the following posting for more details of (roughly) how the
guidelines and techniques would appear if the proposal is accepted:
