I must send regrets for this telecon (my wife is sick, and need to pick up 
my daughter at this time).   Per item #2 on agenda, I have just completed 
an exhaustive review of success criteria (with respect to objectivity) of 
ATAG WD of March 14 (as requested by Matt May, in conjunction with my NIST 
project leader Lynne Rosenthal), and have found some issues, which I will 
this week summarize to the AUWG list.   In this task, it would help me to 
know the purpose of the success criteria in the document.  They are not 
mentioned explicitly in 1.3, so what is their importance?    Are they meant 
to convey "minimum basic functionality
requirement that is normative" (second bullet under checkpoint subtext 
bullet of 1.3)?  Is "success criteria" terminology used in other WAI specs 
or QA Framework documents?   I believe they use other terminology.  Any 
help would be appreciated.
Thanks and best wishes, Tim Boland NIST
