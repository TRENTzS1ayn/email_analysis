Tim, some additional comments:
1. Create common format for expressing success criteria: OK, is there a
proposal? e.g., authoring tool must *action verb* ...
2. Terms: Many are different because they are different, however they
should be defined as being different or consistent term used.
3. "Accessible" not defined: propose that accessible term be removed so it
is not circular.
4. Subjective words: agree we must remove them. e.g. quickly, easily, etc.
replace with "one step", or two keystrokes, etc..
5. Technique language vs Criteria language: Should be fixed when 1 is
applied.
6. Ensure semantics of criteria unique: Good question to ask, but don't
agree that all are dups. See Jan's reply.
7. Version of WCAG: level yes, version no. Let's try to make the level of
WCAG non normative so it can change in future without updating document.

I agree with the call discussion today that we should use these points as a
methodology in reviewing the success criteria once we get the meat
(substance) or as we complete the substance of the criteria written.

Attached is an html document which summarizes comments on evaluating ATAG
WD success criteria for objectivity (as I was requested to do by Matt
 May).  Comments welcome.
