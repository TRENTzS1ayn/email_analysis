Hi everyone,

As a way of reviewing the ATAG 2.0 public draft, I tried applying it to
Kung-Log, a Mac OS X tool for blogging.  You can find my review at:

      http://www.maccessibility.com/archive/000544.php

I will be sending some comments on ATAG 2.0 itself soon -- the attempt
helped clarify some of the sticking points in the current draft when it
comes to application.
