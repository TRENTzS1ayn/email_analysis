Sometimes when looking at these kinds of things, it's helpful to toss
everything up in the air and reshuffle the parts back into a new
order.

Therefore, on the heels of my review of ATAG 2.0 (posted earlier
to this list) comes a reshuffling of ATAG to parallel the structure 
being
developed in the WCAG 2.0 draft.

By using the same structure in WCAG and ATAG (as done in 1.0), we
can make things easier for developers to understand -- especially as
ATAG depends on WCAG in a number of ways, so all readers of
ATAG will be familiar with WCAG's structure.  This is not to say that 
the
current structure is poor or should be replaced, nor does this strawman
proposal intend to denigrate the work of those who have worked on
developing the guidelines document before now! :)

Attempting to emulate the structure of WCAG in ATAG led to some
interesting results.  ATAG 2.0-20030314 checkpoints fell quite
naturally into the three-tiered structure of WCAG, simplifying the
number of checkpoints to twelve.  Meanwhile, Guideline Four
simply ceased to exist, becoming integrated into the other three
checkpoints.

Guideline One had the clearest parallels with WCAG 2, as the five
WCAG guidelines (perceivable, operable, navigable, understandable,
and robust) helped to clarify the specific checkpoints in ATAG 2.


Well, enough build-up -- here you go, the strawman proposal.  Feel
free to rip it to shreds.  Note also that I changed some things around
in wording; none of this is anything I'm wedded to.
