Kynn,

Thanks for the comments and suggestions. It's always good to get a 
fresh perspective.

It would be good to discuss your suggestions during a teleconference. 
Will you be joining the June 2nd teleconference at 4pm. ET? Could you 
present a synopsis of your reviews and suggestions during that call?

Thanks
Jutta
