Hi All,
 
If you do decide to have your F2F here, those who need to can
crash at my home, are welcome to do so. NOT fancy, but the price is
right. I would be able to attend if you do have it here. The Government
contract that I am on (IMPACT Center at the US Dept of State) will be
squeezing into a spot at the Dept of Educations Accessibility booth at
eGov.


Some logistics info for eGov:
