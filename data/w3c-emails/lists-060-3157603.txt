Chris, is there a newer of more completed list of "test files" that you
and/or Michael have been working on that are publically or privately
available?
                                                                                                            
                                                                                                            
   The Access Tool Reviewer (ATR, http://www.aprompt.ca/ATR/ATR.html) is software created by Chris Redpath  
   at the University of Toronto to assist in the evaluation of evaluation and repair tools. The ATR         
   includes over 250 files (http://www.aprompt.ca/ATR/GetAtr.html) keyed to the techniques of AERT. For     
   example, the 12 files associated with Technique 1.1.1 that present various instances of invalid alt      
   attributes. The first of these files (1-1-1-f1.html) consists of exactly one IMG element with no alt     
   attribute.  The idea is to use the ATR with its files to structure the evaluation of evaluation and      
   repair tools.
