Today's AUWG call we will be devoted to work done by Kynn Barlett on
ATAG 2.0.

In addition to the URL for Kynn's re-ordering proposal sent out with the
minutes
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/2003AprJun/0021.html)
I would also suggest that everyone read Kynn's review of the current
ATAG 2.0 draft, as it provides some background on his thinking.

Cheers,
