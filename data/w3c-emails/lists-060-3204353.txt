I am looking forward to welcoming everyone to NIST this Friday and Saturday. I
will be waiting in the NIST North lobby starting at 7:30 am Friday with 
your badges.
Network access should be available both days (have been working on this). What
are your restaurant preferences for Friday night? (The tab will be on me.)
Also, there are several restaurants within walking distance of NIST North for
Friday lunch, and close to the NIST campus for Saturday lunch.
Please let me know if there's anything else I can do.
Best wishes.

Tim Boland NIST
