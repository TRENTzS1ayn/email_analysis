From an RNIB mailing list.
 I know Lisa is keeping a watch, but for the rest of us.
Pity the actual document in in pdf though.

You may be interested in the European Union Council Resolution of 6th
February 2003 entitled "eAccessibility - Improving Access of People with
Disabilities to the Knowledge Based Society", which calls on the member
states and Commission to (amongst other things):

* promote a more coordinated approach by the key players involved in
eAccessibility and in the application and development of technology,
standards, legislation, and education.

* promote common methodologies with regard to the use of the WAI (W3C
Accessibility Initiative) guidelines.

* promote feedback on standardisation activities and their impact on "real
life".

* consider the provision of an eAccessibility mark for goods and services
which comply with relevant standards for eAccessibility.

* promote the aim that proposed Design for All curricula are developed by
educational authorities.

* ensure that multimedia materials and the use of ICT in education do not
create new barriers.

* ensure that eAccessibility becomes a regular part of all education
programmes of vocational schools of any level, e.g. web masters,
multimedia authors, and software developers.

I've summarised what I think are the important aspects of this call.
