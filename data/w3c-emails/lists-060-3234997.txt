Hello,

The next AUWG conference call will take place at the regular time:
  Monday, June 16 at 4:00 pm ET
  (617) 761-6200 ext. 2894#

Agenda:

(1) As our F2F was this weekend and people may still be traveling, this
will likely be a short meeting. Today's meeting will include a short
update and action item review from the meeting.

(2) Scheduling for this summer's teleconferences.

-----

Please send regrets or agenda additions to the list.
