Hello all,

There is a proposal to switch our regularly scheduled teleconference to
this coming Monday (at our usual time) and then every two weeks from
then. i.e.:

June 23
July 7
July 21
August 4
...

If anyone has an objection to this change please let us know by 5pm ET
tomorrow (Wednesday).

Cheers,
Jan
