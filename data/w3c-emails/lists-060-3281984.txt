Per my action item, I propose adding a sentence in 1.5 of the June 6 ATAG
draft (after the "conformance level bullets") as follows:

"In the above, "meeting the checkpoints" means satisfying all of the success
criteria associated with that particular checkpoint."

I may want to add after the sentence above "To satisfy a particular success 
criterion is to
pass all the tests associated with that success criterion in a test suite 
(to be developed)."

I also propose adding a sentence to the end of 1.5 as follows:

"Satisfying certain success criteria may involve usability issues and as 
such may
require integrating aspects of usability testing."

I may want to add after this sentence above  "The success criteria where 
these issues apply will be noted
in the document."

Comments welcome.  As mentioned earlier, I think the whole issue of 
conformance to ATAG merits further discussion.

Best,
Tim Boland NIST
