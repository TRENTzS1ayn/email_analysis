Here is my action item for checkpoint 2.7. I was to add to the 
rationale and success criteria to explain why authoring tools should 
not mess with namespaces they don't understand.

Original 2.7 rationale:
Markup that is not recognized by an authoring tool may have been added 
to enhance accessibility.

Changed to:
Markup that is not recognized by an
authoring tool may have been added to enhance accessibility.
Also, newer XML-based languages, such as XHTML 1.1, allow
authors to include multiple languages in a single document, via
namespaces. In the future, documents may contain metadata, including
accessibility information, in another namespace. Authoring tools must 
not
strip this information when it is encountered.

Success Criteria:

1. All well-formed markup is preserved.

2. The author is queried for their consent before any unrecognized 
markup is removed or changed.

Added:
3. The tool does not interfere with content in namespaces it is not 
able to process.
