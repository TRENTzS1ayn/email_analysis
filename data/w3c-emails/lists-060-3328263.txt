My action item for 4.3 was to replace "accessibility related
functionalities" with a list of the relevant functions.

1. Accessibility prompting, checking, repair and documentation functions
must not contrast with other comparable functions in terms of:
  - visual design (design metaphors, artistic sophistication, sizes,
    fonts, colours)
  - operation (degree of automation, approximate number of mouse
    clicks or keystrokes to accomplish task)
  - complexity (amount of author instruction required), or
  - flexibility (configurability of the functionality and its features)

Note. Two examples of comparable functions are (1) an accessibility
checker and a spelling checker and (2) a prompt for an accessibility
related label and a prompt for a document title.

---

ed. Note: I removed Success Criteria (2) because it was not checkable.

P.S.: We need to update the Table of Contents.
