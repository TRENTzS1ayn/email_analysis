Hello,

There was a brief CG discussion about Checkpoint 2.2:

2.2 Use the latest versions of W3C format Recommendations when they are
available and appropriate for a task. [Priority 2] 

At the AUWG-F2F at NIST, we talked about allowing any format that had a
techniques document for WCAG. It turns out that the WCAG group will not
be posting any more non-W3C techniques documents. So, we need to decide
if we will simply accept a third-party techniques document (at some URL
or other). 

Since the WCAG group is grappling with the same issue, Wendy suggested a
joint teleconference. AUWG's next call is June 7 at 4pm.

Cheers,
Jan
