For one of my action items, I have attached a document that includes
explanatory text for the new section headers as well as revised
explanatory text for all the other guidelines and section headers. The
goal was to "tersify" as William says. 

NOTE: I have organized the document as a table with the old text on the
left and the new text on the right for comparison. Anything important in
the old text that is specific to a particular checkpoint should be moved
to the checkpoint itself.

Cheers,
Jan
