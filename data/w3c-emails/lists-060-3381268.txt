New explanatory text for 1.5.

Notes:

- I added the word "rendered" to second success criteria since all tools
allow unrendered equivalents to be searched
- Do we also mean to imply searching non-text equivalents in external
files (i.e. LONGDESC content?

1.5 Ensure the authoring interface allows the author to search within
the editing views. [Priority 2]

Rationale: Search functions facilitate author navigation of content as
it is being authored by allowing the author to move focus quickly to
arbitrary points in the content. Including the capability to search
within text equivalents of rendered non-text content increases the
accessibility of the search function.

Success Criteria:

The authoring tool MUST have a search function for every editing view. 
The author MUST be able to search for text within text equivalents of
RENDERED non-text content. 
The author MUST be able to specify whether they wish to search content,
markup, or both.
