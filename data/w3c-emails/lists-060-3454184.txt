Attached is a file which indicates some other areas of possible liaison 
(from the CSS
charter) to consider (it seems that the AUWG could have dependencies with
a potentially large number of groups within W3C, as well as possibly with
activities outside of W3C).   Will think on this subject more for AUWG 
charter.
Also included is info on test suite documentation for the AUWG to consider.
Thanks and best wishes, Tim Boland NIST
