To assist the AUWG in getting through Candidate Recommendation (CR phase),
I propose we add to the AU charter a deliverable and add a note on the
dependencies with other working groups on their test suites:

4.1 Deliverables to be produced

   Minutes ...
   ATAG 2.0...
   Techniques...
   ... semi-annual revisions of techniques ...
      ... consist of implementation detail ...
      ... include examples ...
      ... include techniques for evaluating the conformance ...
      ... include ... AERT
      [NEW] The techniques should include a test suite for evaluating the
      conformance of HTML & CSS authoring tools, either as a separate
      document or part of the same  document.  Test suites for other
      formats, such as MathML, SVG, etc. will be the responsibility of
      other working groups.  A test suite could include for example: Web
      pages with know accessibility errors that authoring tools could check
      for, inform the author about, and assisting in correcting.
   Evaluations ...
   End of charter report ...
