Hi,

I have just noticed that we have left out links to the draft note we
agreed on at the Vancouver F2F. The purpose of the note is to be an
external definition of "Relative Priority" for both versions of WCAG
(1.0 and 2.0).

I have attached an updated version of the draft note to this message.

Note: I think that the change to a unified checkpoint 3.1 has made it
unnecessary to list, in the note, which checkpoints are applicable to
which relative priority checkpoints  (since now they all are).

Cheers,
Jan
