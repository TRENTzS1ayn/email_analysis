Comments on the charter:

- Check all references to ATAG 1.0 to see if they should be "ATAG 2.0"
or "ATAG 1.0 and/or ATAG 2.0"

- In 5.2, we list some of the format groups. Do we have dependencies on
just this subset or on all W3 format groups? Having dependencies on
almost every other group in W3C seems a bit much. Perhaps what we have
is our own job to do, with input from these other groups, rather than
Dependencies with capital "D"'s.

- In 13.3 change:
related to the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 
to:
related to the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines

Cheers,
Jan
