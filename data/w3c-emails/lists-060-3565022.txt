Hello,

On today's AU teleconference there was general agreement to hold our
next AU Face-to-Face meeting at the end of the CSUN conference in Los
Angeles:

http://www.csun.edu/cod/conf/index.htm

In the past, one and a half days has proven to be a reasonable amount of
time for these meetings. Those on the call agreed that Saturday (22
March 2003) was most convenient for a full day meeting. This means we
could hold the further half day meeting on either Friday (AM or PM) or
on Sunday (AM or PM).

Please let us know your preference, as soon as possible, for the half
day meeting:

__ Friday AM
__ Friday PM
__ Sunday AM
__ Sunday PM

Cheers,
Jan
