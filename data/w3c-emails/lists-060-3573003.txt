Howdy. 

Great to speak with you today. Here are some initial comments on the techniques doc.

Guideline 1
First, what is the distinction between 'conventions that are essential to accessibility' and conventions that are 'important to accessibility'. Is this defined in terms of features required for the creation of accessible content (add alt text as a simple example) or more general features of the tool that are essential to using the tool (such as saving a document). 

Second, a simple point. Under point 4 of 'Following Standards', the doc reads, "Use standard system indirections and APIs whenever possible." Do you mean 'indications'?

Third, given the topsy-turvy world of accessibility api layers, some discussion of when self voicing applications are appropriate would be helpful. 

Fourth, in several places, the techniques document requires configurability with respect to color, size, sound. Should these options be configurable from within the authoring tool or is it enough to ensure they interoperate with the accessibility options of the operating system? For example, should Dreamweaver offer a high contrast setting or should we ensure Dreamweaver interacts well with the various high contrast settings of the operating systems it supports?

Cheers,
Bob
