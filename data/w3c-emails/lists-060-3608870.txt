Hello,

As per my action item from the last call (Jan 27), here is a list of
what I see to be the most pressing work items. I suggest that once the
group has agreed on a fairly complete set, we can each volunteer for a
few them out and then return with them completed to the next F2F. Of
course we can use the list and the telecons to discuss any trouble we
run into along the way.

Cheers,
Jan

DRAFT LIST OF WORK ITEMS

ATAG Guidelines:

- Completing the "Definition of Authoring Tool" section
- Adding the version-independent WCAG referencing mechanism (JR & MM)
- Adding to and editing the "Success Criteria" statements
- Adding to and editing the "Rationale" statements
- Making sure the Glossary is up to date - involves cooperation with WAI
Glossary work
- Making sure References are relevant and complete

ATAG Techniques:

- IN GENERAL: All CP's need to be examined to ensure that they support
the "Rationales" and "Success Criteria" in the Guidelines.
- Final decision on the form and role of the Authoring Tool
FUNCTIONALITY Categories
- Removal of Appendix A, once the material it contains has been properly
integrated into the techniques for 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.
- Techniques for GL 1 - Appear quite complete although there are some
concerns. See
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/2003JanMar/0019.html).
- Techniques for GL 2 - Seems fairly solid - CP's 2.5 & 2.6 need extra
attention as they are relative.
- Techniques for GL 3 - CP's 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 still need lots of work.
The rest of the checkpoints are fairly solid, although 3.8 also needs
some attention.
- Techniques for GL 4 - CP 4.1 needs techniques, CP 4.2 needs to be
looked at some more, the rest seem fairly solid

- [NEW IDEA] Perhaps an Index into the techniques?
