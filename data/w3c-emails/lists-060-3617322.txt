I will not be able to attend the CSUN meeting unfortunately, but I will be 
in Cambridge for the W3C technical plenary all week and hope to see many of 
you there.  BTW, NIST could host a face-fo-face meeting of the WAI-AUWG 
later this year, if the working group members would want.  If there is 
consensus interest from the WG, just let me know some dates and I'll see 
about reserving a room.

Best wishes, Tim Boland NIST
