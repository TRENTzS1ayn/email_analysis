To: WAI-AUWG<w3c-wai-au@w3.org>


So as not to conflict with CSUN sessions on Friday, or the WAI IG
meeting on Saturday afternoon, we propose that the March 2003 F2F be
held on:

Sunday (23 March 2003): 8:30 to 16:00 PST

At: Los Angeles Airport Marriott (LAX Marriott) in Los Angeles, CA

In addition, we would also like to schedule an AUWG working dinner on
Saturday evening (22 March 2003).

If any Participant in Good Standing (http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/members)
objects to this meeting, please respond no later than Tuesday, 4
February 2003. If no objections arise by that date, an agenda and
registration instructions will be sent to the list.

We would also like to schedule a brief presentation on the work of the
AUWG at the WAI-IG meeting, which is scheduled for Saturday (22 March
2003) from 14:30-18:00.

Cheers,
Jan
