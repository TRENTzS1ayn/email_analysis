Hello,

I have made a start at reviewing the ATAG 2.0 Glossary for internal
consistency and consistency with the WAI glossary. The results of the
review are attached in two files:

(1) The review worsheet:
ATAG20_Glossary_Worksheet.html

(2) A draft of how the ATAG 2.0 glossary would look if all my
suggestions were followed:
