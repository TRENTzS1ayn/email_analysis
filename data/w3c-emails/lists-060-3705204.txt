Hello,

In my previous email I suggested some changes to the wording of many of
the guidelines and checkpoints in ATAG 2.0. This email repeats these in
a condensed form:

The changes are always very MINOR and mostly have to do with lining up
the exact words used in the glossary. The two changes not glossary
related are marked with a comment.

Note: the words between the "*...*" are linked to that glossary entry.

====

Guideline 1: Ensure that the tool is an *accessible application*

Checkpoint 1.1: Ensure that the authoring interface follows all
operating environment conventions for an *accessible application*

Checkpoint 1.2: Ensure that the authoring interface enables editing of
all element and object properties as required for an *accessible
application*. 

Checkpoint 1.5: Ensure that the authoring interface enables keyboard
navigation of editing views via the document structure. 
[JR: this was changed from accessible navigation to be more specific]
====

Guideline 2: Ensure that the tool is designed to produce *accessible Web
content*

Checkpoint: 2.3: Ensure that the author can produce *accessible Web
content* in the markup language(s) supported by the tool. 

Checkpoint: 2.4: Ensure that the tool preserves *accessible Web content*
during transformations and conversions.

Checkpoint: 2.5: Ensure that any Web content automatically generates by
the tool is *accessible Web content*

Checkpoint: 2.6: Ensure that all pre-authored Web content for the tool
is *accessible Web content*. 

===

Guideline 3: Support the author in the production of *accessible Web
content*

Checkpoint 3.4: Do not automatically generate *equivalents* or reuse
previously authored *equivalents* without author confirmation, except
when the context in which the original object is being used is known
with certainty.
[JR: I also cleaned up the end of the sentence a bit].

Checkpoint 3.5: Provide functionality for managing, editing, and reusing
*equivalents* for multimedia objects.

Checkpoint 3.6: Provide the author with a summary of the degree to which
*accessibility problems* are present.

Checkpoint 3.7: Document all features of the tool that promote the
production of *accessible Web content*.

Checkpoint 3.8: Document the process of using the tool to produce
*accessible Web content*.

===

Guideline 4: Integrate *accessible authoring practices* into the overall
"look and feel"

Checkpoint 4.4: Ensure that creating *accessible Web content* is a
naturally integrated part of the documentation, including examples.
