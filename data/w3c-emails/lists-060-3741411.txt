To this point, there have not been any comments on the Glossary review:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/2003JanMar/0031.html

If you have any comments on my proposed changes to the Glossary or to
the wording of almost every one of the guidelines and checkpoints in
ATAG, please send them to the list.

Cheers,
Jan
