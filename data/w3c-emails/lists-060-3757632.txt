Trying out latest mozilla, with an image, I note the following:

1. alt text creates a popup on ie6, nil on mozilla.
2. title creates a popup on both.
3. longdesc with text content has no impact on either.

All the reading is pushing alt as the correct solution.
I'm confused why, when mozilla, netscape 7 and ie6 all appear to favour
title attribute as the widest applicability.

Any clarification please.
