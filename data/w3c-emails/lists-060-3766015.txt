Solution to what?

There is some debate as to whether producing a toolTip for alt attributes is
a. An out and out bug.
b. A design flaw.
c. An out-dated idea.
or d. An okay thing to do in the absence of anything that has a stronger
"right" to be a toolTip, such as the title attribute.

There is general agreement though that toolTips aren't alt's primary purpose
(that being a matter of fact, rather than for debate).

alt is for ALTernative text to an image, or a mapped portion of an image.

title provides additional information about any element.

longdesc links to a document describing the image itself (you're wrong about
it having no effect on mozilla, it's used in the image's properties).
