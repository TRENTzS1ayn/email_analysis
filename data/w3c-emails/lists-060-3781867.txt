I must send regrets for the telecon today, as I have a conflicting 
meeting.  I am working on a document which will indicate generic technical 
test suite principles (after looking at similar materials from UAWG and CSS 
WG), as well as authoring guidelines for those wishing to submit tests.  I 
have an action item to do this from WCAG WG last week, but in principle 
could be applied to AUWG as well.   I am also assisting as needed on 
creation of test suite process documents along with Phill Jenkins of 
IBM.  NIST reps met with Matt May and Wendy Chisholm to develop/coordinate 
NIST input to WAI testing activities.  More follow-up is expected this week.

I also attended a glossary meeting on Friday Mar 7 in Boston in conjunction 
with technical plenary activities; the meeting was chaired by Wendy 
Chisholm.  I will shortly write up some notes on that meeting.  The first 
part of the meeting was devoted to general requirements of a glossary in 
W3C.   As a result of this meeting a public W3C glossary mailing list will 
be set up,  Wendy will send out the "official" notes from the meeting, and 
there will be a BOF at the upcoming WWW conference in Budapest on the 
subject.  The second part of the meeting was devoted to WAI-specific 
glossary issues.  There is a rather extensive glossary on the WAI site 
(which may be said to include both WAI-specific and non WAI-specific 
terms).   There was some discussion about reorganizing this glossary for 
efficiency purposes, as well as limiting its size.  Also under discussion 
were a series of modifications to WAI glossary requirements document.   I 
was not able to attend the final part of the meeting.

Best wishes, Tim Boland NIST
