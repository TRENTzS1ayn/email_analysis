Hi all.

ATAG 2.0[1] and the Techniques for ATAG 2.0[2] have been published to 
the W3C's Technical Reports page[3]. This represents the first public 
working draft of the document, which means we are now soliciting 
comments from both within and outside the working group.

I have added these documents to the reading list[4] for the 
face-to-face meeting this Sunday.

Thanks to all of you who have commented and contributed to the ATAG 
document. I look forward to a productive meeting in Los Angeles. (Not 
to mention a high of 75 degrees and the Marriott pool... <g>)
