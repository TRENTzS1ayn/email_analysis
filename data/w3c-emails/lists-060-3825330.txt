I have an action item to propose an authoring tool definition as well as
a system for organizing the techniques for the upcoming F2F. The
attached file contains this proposed definition along with updated
screenshot examples.

Download and unzip the file, then launch:
Definition of Authoring Tool (Draft 2).html

I believe that we can use the same categories to do the technique
organization.

Cheers,
Jan
