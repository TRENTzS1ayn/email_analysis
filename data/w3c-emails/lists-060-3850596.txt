Hello,

I have attached a zip file that includes an ATAG 2.0 draft
(Overview10.html) with the changes made during the recent F2F in Los
Angeles (plus a few of my own edits marked with "@@"). The rest of the
files in the zip archive are required for the examples in the authoring
tool definition.

For the next call, could everyone in the group please look at:
1) The Rationales for each checkpoint
2) The definition of "Authoring Tool"
3) Anything labelled with "@@".

Hopefully, on the next call we can quickly lay these issues to rest.

Cheers,
Jan
