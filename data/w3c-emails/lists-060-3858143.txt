As discussed in several teleconferences recently, we would like to 
hold an ATAG face to face meeting during the WWW2003 conference in 
Budapest. A number of the group members will be at the conference 
anyways and we want to take this opportunity to work further on the 
documents.

We will probably not be able to get official meeting space but given 
that the group will likely be small, we will upgrade an existing room 
to a suite and meet in the suite. The scheduling of the meeting 
during the conference is therefore quite flexible. Could those of you 
who will be in Budapest or who might be able to go to Budapest for 
the ATAG meeting send me your travel and availability schedule so we 
can set the date of the meeting.

Thanks
Jutta
