Hello,

Attached is my final action item arising from the Gaithersburg F2F. I
used the "Creating Your First Website in Dreamweaver" chapter of the DMX
help as a model, since it shows how developers already describe
workflows in their documentation.

At the moment, the sample workflow is still quite sparse, but I think it
provides a way forward. It does include an instance of a workaround in
the "tip".

Comments?

Cheers,
Jan
