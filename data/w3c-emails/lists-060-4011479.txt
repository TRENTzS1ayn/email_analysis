Hello,

On yesterday's CG call, Jon Gunderston elaborated on a proposal he has
made to hold one or more workshops in order to publicize the UAAG work
and generate interest for future work:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2003JulSep/0023.html

The suggestion was made that our group (AUWG) might benefit from
participating in such a workshop, in effect making it a Web Tools
accessibility workshop.

Thoughts?

Cheers,
Jan
