I read the workshop e-mail:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2003JulSep/0023.html

and I agree both groups would benefit, but the real need is to crisply
identify the purpose of the workshop.  I assume it would actually be a "W3C
workshop" with position papers, etc. [see note 1], but Jon's e-mail suggest
more of a conference session.  If it's more of an education and outreach
session to developers, then I don't think it really replaces the f2f need
of our charters.  If it's more of a W3C workshop with position papers, then
I would be more inclined to support it.  Both could occur at a conference
along with informal birds of a feather sessions.  Some seggestions for the
W3C style workshop "Accessibility and Web tools":

- my product's support of UAAG/ATAG and strategy for future support.
- my company's strategy for support of UAAG/ATAG
- my company's vision for support of accessibility (more broad than
UAAG/ATAG)
- my view of the industry's support of uaag/atag (comparison, research)
