Hi folks,

as part of my new job I have collected up some preliminary ideas for using
the semantic web to support accessibility. I will be at the face to face
meeting in Seattle to discuss this a bit (and anything I can contribute while
I am there on Saturday), but thought I would send along a pointer:

some preliminary ideas, at
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/reports/w3c_note_sw_accessibility/#L2730

Note that these are not WAI-endorsed, just suggestions from the semantic web
side of the fence about things that might be useful. The goal is to look at
which ones you find interesting, and expand on them with things like sample
implementations or guides for developers on implementing them.

Cheers

Chaals
