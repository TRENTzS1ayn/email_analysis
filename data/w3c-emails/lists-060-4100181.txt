Hi Tim,

I've attached something that you, as well as others on the group, may
find useful.

It is an updated version of my "Conformance Assessment Template" with
all the changes made since the NIST F2F and some basic integration of
the success criteria.

Tim: I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on my proposed changes
to some of the success criteria:

Cheers,
Jan
