A link to the doc in PDF format is on the STC site at
http://www.stcsig.org/sn/PDF/SC4_WG5%20N0660%20ISO_PRF_TS_16071.pdf
Section 7 covers the guidelines and includes OS (i.e., sticky keys) and
application requirements.  There is a notion of core, primary and
secondary.

This e-mail will start a thread on the discussion of the appropriateness of
using it (vs IBM Software Accessibility Checklist) for ATAG 2.0
For example, the status of the ISO standard, timeline for adoption, etc.
will follow.
