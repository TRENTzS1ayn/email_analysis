If the structure and organization of WCAG and ATAG documents could be 
similar as much as possible, I believe it would aid in ATAG-WCAG 
cross-referencing, as well as in increased acceptance of the documents by 
the larger communities (easier for novice readers to use and understand the 
two sets of documents).

Thanks and best wishes,
