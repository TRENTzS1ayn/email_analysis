Regarding my action item from yesterday's meeting...

I actually could not locate our latest wording, but had another go at 
it. Here is a draft checkpoint wording and some rationale. Can anyone 
give input into the success criteria and suggest edits/additions to 
this wording?

Checkpoint:
Ensure that accessible authoring practices are integrated into the 
overall workflow when an author develops Web Content.

Rationale:
Accessible design as an afterthought or separate process is much more 
onerous and therefore costly than when accessibility is considered 
from the start. If the authoring tool supports a workflow in which 
the author considers accessibility before and/or during the authoring 
process it is more likely that accessible authoring practices will 
become a common practice.

Thanks
Jutta
