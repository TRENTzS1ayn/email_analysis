Here are the particulars of the joint call this Friday:

Friday, 24 October
4:00pm-5:30pm/20:00-21:30 UTC
Number  to call is: +1.617.761.6200, conference 2894 ("AUWG")

Agenda:

1. How ATAG and WCAG reference each other.  Where does WCAG reference
ATAG?  Where does ATAG reference WCAG?  What is needed in the organization
of the documents to make the references as straight-forward as
possible?  What can we do in WCAG to decrease the complexity of ATAG's
relationship with WCAG (relative conformance)?  How WCAG promotes 
ATAG compliant tools as the best way to produce accessible content.

2. Scope of the documents. Basically, ATAG covers the process of generating
the content and t thus includes Content Management Systems (CMS), authoring
tools, etc.  WCAG covers the end result of the authoring process (thus does
not cover CMS).  However, what about web applications that generate
content?  ATAG and WCAG could produce a shared techniques document
"techniques for application that generate content" that would refer to both
ATAG and WCAG checkpoints.

3. The suitability of requirements to use W3C recommendations.  ATAG 1.0
only discusses producing content for W3C formats.  WCAG 1.0 says only use
W3C formats.  How should the 2.0 versions of WCAG and ATAG reference W3C
technologies?  In WCAG 2.0 we had checkpoint 4.3 (this has evolved since
this was published) [2], although all of Guideline 4 [3] relates to
technology.

4.  Development of test suites - How do we coordinate development and
reuse?  How do we design a test suite that is beneficial for both ATAG and
WCAG?  What will be the differences between our test suite needs?  We also
need to coordinate with UAWG and QAWG.

5.  If we have time -- Metadata in WCAG  and any other topics that are
raised.

NOTE from WCAG: AUWG should be aware that the WCAG WG recently adopted a new
organization  of the document and we will be talking from this perspective
[4].  We are
moving towards 3 levels of conformance (which should help address issues
raised during the AUWG F2F in September in Seattle).  This is part of the
1st agendum.
