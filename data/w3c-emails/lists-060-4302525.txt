We had discussed the possibility of a meeting together with the ATIA 
conference http://www.atia.org/conf_2004.html. ATIA is quite firm 
that they do not want any meetings to overlap with their events if we 
plan it through them. I already have an IMS meeting scheduled for 
Saturday afternoon and Sunday (January 17th and 18th). Several people 
in ATAG are unavailable prior to the ATIA meetings. This leaves two 
options, to plan our meetings in Orlando but not through ATIA or to 
hold the meetings on Monday the 19th and Tuesday the 20th. Monday is 
Martin Luther King day.

What are your thoughts?
Can you suggest another venue and possible sponsor?

I am pursuing one other possibility but would like to hear back from 
the possible sponsor before I suggest it.

Thanks for your input.

Jutta
