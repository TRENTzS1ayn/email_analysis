Hi, I'm going thru the latest ATAG WG trying to group the success criteria 
according to the
conformance levels A,AA, or AAA to see how the criteria look and read in 
preparation for possibly
developing some sort of test plan.  I noticed:

Checkpoint 2.2 - This is listed as priority 1, but it refers to WCAG; 
should it be relative priority instead
(to be consistent with other relative priority items that refer to WCAG)?

Checkpoint 3.1 - This is listed as relative priority, but WCAG is only 
mentioned in the rationale; the term
is not mentioned in the success criteria or in the checkpoint itself (as it 
is with 2.2, for example).  I
assume that the accessibility problems mentioned in #1 of the Success 
Criteria refer to WCAG, but
perhaps it should be explicitly mentioned in #1, as "accessibility problems 
according to WCAG"?
I know the glossary definition of "accessibility problems" refers to 
WCAG2.0 in the second sentence,
but it is an oblique, non-normative kind of reference.   Should we require 
in terms of testing that the
accessibility problems mentioned be defined by WCAG?

Thanks and best wishes, Tim Boland NIST
