Hi Tim,

re: Checkpoint 2.2: I see what you mean. Does a format need to be able
to meet WCAG Extended checkpoints if the tool is only planning to meet
ATAG for the WCAG-core checkpoints (Note- the terms Core and Extended
may be changing in WCAG)?

(Also I notice that the Table of contents is wrong for this checkpoint)

re: Checkpoint 3.1: Good point. Perhaps: "Prompt and assist the author
to create content that conforms to WCAG". If we were to do this, we
would probably asl want to do the same with 3.2, which might be
rephrased as "Check for and inform the author of content that does not
conform to WCAG" and 3.3, which might be "Assist authors in repairing
content that does not conform to WCAG".

Cheers,
Jan
