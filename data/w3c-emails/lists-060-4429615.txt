The group will decide the dates and we can offer it for all the July
month
We are able to host in every day of July month: the hotel also offer 32
rooms with a special price for partecipants (this year 50 euros instead
120 euros per room). For July also we are able to have the new meeting
room.

Concerning Roberto's offer for hosting a meeting in Venice in July, I
have
just come across the following July event:

ICCHP 2004: 9th International Conference on Computers Helping People
with
Special Needs
July 7-9, 2004, Universit? Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France
Pre-Conference July 5-6, 2004

Just mentioning it in case it affects scheduling.

Sorry I regrets for this meeting.
For the point 1) i've wrote in the list that we are able to host the F2F
in Venice in July 2004, where we have host last July the F2F of the WCAG
Working Group.

I will study in this week the new internal drafts and I will post my
suggestion :)
