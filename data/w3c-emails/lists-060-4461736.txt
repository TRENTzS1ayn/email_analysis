Additional Note:
In success criteria for checkpoint 3.8 reference is made to "meeting 
requirements of WCAG" but checkpoint is listed as "priority 2" (maybe 
should be relative priority instead?) .  Just a note (fyi in context of 
discussion at last telecon) for the future when the concept of relative 
priority is reviewed.

Best, Tim Boland NIST
