As per my action item, here are the ATAG technique work items. Please
volunteer for them on the list. If I've missed something, please post it
to the list.

==========================


More work:

(1) - Update techniques for guideline 1 (consider how 1.1 should be
organized if either the IBM software guidelines or the ISO document are
adopted, review the rest, asking what needs to be dropped or added?)

(2) - Update techniques for guideline 2 (review all checkpoints, asking
what needs to be dropped or added?)

(3) - Update techniques for guideline 3 (review reliance on WCAG
numbering in 3.1, review the rest, asking what needs to be dropped or
added?) => I WILL VOLUNTEERS FOR THIS ONE.

(4) - Update techniques for guideline 4 (add techniques for 4.2 (4.3,
a.k.a 4.X still does not have success criteria yet), review 4.1 and 4.4,
asking what needs to be dropped or added?)

(5) - Take a wide of the document. Is it well structured? Is it easy to
use? What is missing?


Less work:

(6) - Update the references (Go through the document and adding or
correcting references as necessary, update and repair the references
page)

(7) - Maintain the glossary (Ensure terms are up to date, keep
synchronized with glossary in guidelines, both glossaries need to
develop with an eye on other WAI and W3C glossaries)
