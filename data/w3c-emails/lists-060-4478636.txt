I'd like to take item 5 and item 7. The way I work, 7 follows 5. I will look
at stuff and invariably find the small, but important stuff that needs
correcting and stuff. 

I think, too, that others will naturally come across small items that relate
to what I am doing. In that case, they can just drop me a line and I will
take care of it.

What is the deadline on this? 2 weeks is slightly hairy!!

Subject: ATAG Techniques Work Items - Please Volunteer



As per my action item, here are the ATAG technique work items. Please
volunteer for them on the list. If I've missed something, please post it
to the list.

==========================


More work:

(1) - Update techniques for guideline 1 (consider how 1.1 should be
organized if either the IBM software guidelines or the ISO document are
adopted, review the rest, asking what needs to be dropped or added?)

(2) - Update techniques for guideline 2 (review all checkpoints, asking
what needs to be dropped or added?)

(3) - Update techniques for guideline 3 (review reliance on WCAG
numbering in 3.1, review the rest, asking what needs to be dropped or
added?) => I WILL VOLUNTEERS FOR THIS ONE.

(4) - Update techniques for guideline 4 (add techniques for 4.2 (4.3,
a.k.a 4.X still does not have success criteria yet), review 4.1 and 4.4,
asking what needs to be dropped or added?)

(5) - Take a wide of the document. Is it well structured? Is it easy to
use? What is missing?


Less work:

(6) - Update the references (Go through the document and adding or
correcting references as necessary, update and repair the references
page)

(7) - Maintain the glossary (Ensure terms are up to date, keep
synchronized with glossary in guidelines, both glossaries need to
develop with an eye on other WAI and W3C glossaries)
