Hello everyone,

Here are the action items with volunteers so far. This is first come
first served, so please volunteer ASAP on the list or to me personally.
If I've missed something, please post it to the list.

I propose a deadline of Dec. 1, with a progress update on the Nov. 17
conference call.

==========================


More work:

(1) - Update techniques for guideline 1 (consider how 1.1 should be
organized if either the IBM software guidelines or the ISO document are
adopted, review the rest, asking what needs to be dropped or added?)
=> TIM BOLAND

(2) - Update techniques for guideline 2 (review all checkpoints, asking
what needs to be dropped or added?)
=>

(3) - Update techniques for guideline 3 (review reliance on WCAG
numbering in 3.1, review the rest, asking what needs to be dropped or
added?)
=> JAN RICHARDS

(4) - Update techniques for guideline 4 (add techniques for 4.2 (4.3,
a.k.a 4.X still does not have success criteria yet), review 4.1 and 4.4,
asking what needs to be dropped or added?)
=>

(5) - Take a wide view of the document. Is it well structured? Is it
easy to use? What is missing?
=> KAREN MARDAHL

Less work:

(6) - Update the references (Go through the document and adding or
correcting references as necessary, update and repair the references
page)
=>

(7) - Maintain the glossary (Ensure terms are up to date, keep
synchronized with glossary in guidelines, both glossaries need to
develop with an eye on other WAI and W3C glossaries)
=> KAREN MARDAHL
