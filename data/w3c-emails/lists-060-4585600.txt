Hi Tim,

For Checkpoint 3.8, I believe we intended to at least showcase ALL WCAG
practices (Level 1, 2, and 3) even if the authoring tools do not yet
actually support them with checking and correction, etc. It was
specifically made a P2 checkpoint, so that tools could still be single-A
conformant without meeting it. 

For Checkpoint 4.1, I think you may be right.

Cheers,
Jan
