Greetings,

Today, the QA Framework Specifications Guidelines were published as a
W3C Candidate Recommendation:
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-qaframe-spec-20031110/
"""The principal goal of this document is to help W3C Working Groups to
write clearer, more implementable, and better testable technical
reports. It provides both a common framework for specifying conformance
requirements and definitions, and also addresses how a specification
might allow variation among conforming implementations, both of which
facilitate the generation of test materials"""
Also, back in September, the QA Framework Operational Guidelines were
published likewise as a W3C Candidate Recommendation:
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-qaframe-ops-20030922/
"""A common operational framework for building conformance test
materials for W3C specifications is defined. It presents operational and
procedural guidelines for groups undertaking conformance materials
development."""
In both cases, the Candidate Recommendation period [1] will be used by
the QA WG to work in collaboration with other W3C Working Groups to seek
implementation of each checkpoints at least twice, as detailed in the
preliminary implementation reports:
* for specGL: http://www.w3.org/QA/WG/2003/10/specgl-implementation
* for OpsGl: http://www.w3.org/QA/WG/2003/09/ops-implementation
Also to be noted, the QA Framework Introduction was published as a W3C
Working Group Note (hence leaving the so called Recommendation track),
reflecting the decision taken by the QA Working Group, based on the fact
that this document does not bring normative content, and that it is more
or less finished (in the sense where it does not need the focus of the
Working Group)
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/NOTE-qaframe-intro-20030912/
"""An introduction, roadmap, and primer are presented, for a common
framework for enhancing the quality practices of the W3C Working Groups
in the areas of specification editing, production of test materials, and
coordination of QA efforts with internal and external groups"""
The Working Group is especially interested by feedback from other W3C
Working Groups, but as always, feedback, comments and suggestions are
welcome from anybody.
Thanks,
Dom
