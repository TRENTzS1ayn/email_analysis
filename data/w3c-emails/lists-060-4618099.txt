Hi Tim,

I made your changes. Does "presented" work? I suppose it will need to be
defined. Here is how it reads:

If the user begins a Web content editing session, performs edits that
introduce accessibility problems, saves and then exits an editing
session, then the tool must have, at some point during the editing
session, PRESENTED the user with relevant prompting,
checking, repair or documentation features.

Cheers,
Jan
