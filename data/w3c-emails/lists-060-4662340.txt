Hi

I want to mention that I am appreciative of the hard work and effort that
has gone into the existing ATAG documents. It's almost impossible to
maintain consistency when you have multiple authors so it's only natural
that some tidying up needs to be done. I hope I can do my small part by
doing some of that tidying!

Tim, Greg, Jan, or Liddy: if you have any great ideas for presentation
improvements while working on your area of the document, just pass them
along! Liddy, have you seen the QA docs:
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-qaframe-spec-20031110/ Look at the checkpoints
specifically. I forgot to mention them in our call today. I find some of
their presentation rather inspiring for our document. What do the rest of
you think?

Jan: You don't need to send me any style sheets after all: got them off the
ATAG 2.0 document: http://www.w3.org/StyleSheets/TR/W3C-WD.css along with
the built-in style info. I just wanted to make sure I maintained the basic
style as a starting point. 

Once I have something ready to illustrate my suggestions, is there a sandbox
where I can post the pages? I can also just post them on my own website
(www.mardahl.dk - I'll make an ATAG folder) but is that OK?

regards, Karen Mardahl
