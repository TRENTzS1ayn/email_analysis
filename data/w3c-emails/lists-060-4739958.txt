Hi Karen,

You were working from an older version of the references document. I had
proposed an updated version in:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/2003OctDec/0040.html

However, I think your edits make things more clear, so I added them in
to the new draft and have attached the result to this message.

The reason that this document is contained within its own document
(intended to be a W3C Note), is that ATAG 2.0, as a W3C Recommendation,
will be a normative document. If we were to say tools can use WCAG 1.0
or 2.0 (when it comes out) and the WCAG-WG instead puts out a v1.5 or in
the future puts out a v3.0, then our WG either needs to put out an
errata document or publish again. Instead, we can publish ATAG 2.0
referring to WCAG abstractly. Then all we have to do is update this
small note when future versions of WCAG are released.

On the other hand, if it turns out that our techniques (also a W3C Note)
are aimed a particular version of WCAG, we may end up having to update
our techniques if the WCAG-WG puts out new versions. In that case, the
WCAG references piece might as well go in the in the techniques.

Cheers,
Jan
