Kip,

Your understanding of the rationale is correct. Phil Jenkins 
suggested that we consider the ISO spec for the reasons you stated.

The reference will be in the Techniques document. If we have a single 
reference we will reword the checkpoint text. We will also make use 
of the reference in the success criteria.
