Hi 

As I mentioned at the last call, I won't be able to make it tonight - am
actually on my way out the door. I expect to have a sandbox up tomorrow or
Wednesday showing some of my ideas like a combined Glossary for ATAG 2.0
_and_ the techniques. I'll post the address when it is ready.

regards, Karen Mardahl

Technique Work Items

(1) - Update techniques for guideline 1 (consider how 1.1 should be
organized if either the IBM software guidelines or the ISO document are

=> TIM

(2) - Update techniques for guideline 2 (review all checkpoints, asking
what needs to be dropped or added?)
=> LIDDY

numbering in 3.1, review the rest, asking what needs to be dropped or
added?)
=> JAN

(4) - Update techniques for guideline 4 (add techniques for 4.2 (4.3,
a.k.a 4.X still does not have success criteria yet), review 4.1 and 4.4,
asking what needs to be dropped or added?)
=>GREG

(5) - Take a wide of the document. Is it well structured? Is it easy to
use? What is missing?

(6) - Update the references (Go through the document and adding or
correcting references as necessary, update and repair the references
page)
=> GREG

(7) - Maintain the glossary (Ensure terms are up to date, keep
synchronized with glossary in guidelines, both glossaries need to
develop with an eye on other WAI and W3C glossaries)
=> KAREN
