Roberto,

Conformance to ATAG is definitely not off topic for this list.

Since this appears to be the first regulation dealing with conformance to
ATAG, I wanted to ask a couple clarifying questions:

I was under the impression that a committee from the Ministry of Innovation
and Technology still had 120 days to develop the actual technical
standards.  Does that committee have to include compliance to ATAG 1.0, or
only consider it as input into in their standards?  In other words could
they omit it because, for example, they couldn't find any commercially
available authoring tools that comply?  Or could they, for example, include
provisions to adopt ATAG 2.0 when it becomes available with some sort of a
fast path review instead of adopting ATAG 1.0?

Ciao,
