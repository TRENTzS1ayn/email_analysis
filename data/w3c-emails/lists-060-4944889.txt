>Roberto,
>Conformance to ATAG is definitely not off topic for this list.
>Since this appears to be the first regulation dealing with conformance
to
>ATAG, I wanted to ask a couple clarifying questions:

I wanna explain well: I don't know if the regulation will apply the
ATAG, but the regoulation will receipt the european directives: in
eEurope2002/2002 and in the EU Parlament resolution of 13th June 2002
the EU ask to apply not only WCAG but also ATAG 1.0 for incentive the
use of tools that are accessible and that produce accessible contents: I
hope that this could be done, but I don't know if the government in this
regoulation wanna do this... I ask this because I need to know, as web
professional association that will be called to give an opinion to the
regoulation, if there are tools that conform to ATAG 1.0.
