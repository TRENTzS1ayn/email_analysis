Hi everyone,

In an effort to keep things moving along, here is a draft of the 
implementation techniques for guideline 4 with some additions including 
suggestions made on the last teleconference.

Please send your comments and additions to the list.

Note 1: some of the suggestions include changes to success criteria.

Note 2: many of the techniques so far need screen shots (I'm working on 
this). This need not be the case for additional technique ideas.

Cheers,
Jan
