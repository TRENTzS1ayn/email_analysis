Hi all,

We need to have a charter[1] available for review by the W3C management 
and Advisory Board in the next few days. Part of that is the new W3C 
Patent Policy adopted in February, which states that W3C deliverables 
are to be royalty-free. Please review the charter, particularly the 
paragraph below, and the Patent Policy[2], and respond with any 
questions, comments or concerns as soon as possible.

10. Patent Policy
This Working Group operates under the 5 February 2004 W3C Patent 
Policy[2]. To promote the widest adoption of Web standards, W3C seeks 
to issue Recommendations that can be implemented, according to this 
policy, on a Royalty-Free basis.
