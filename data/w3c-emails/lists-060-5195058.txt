Hi,

I've been doing some work on techniques for ATAG guidelines 3 and 4 in 
advance of Monday's call. I've posted what I have so far at:

http://jan.rcat.utoronto.ca/public/auwg/tech3.html
http://jan.rcat.utoronto.ca/public/auwg/tech4.html

Both are still drafts, but the techniques for GL4 is especially rough. I 
will be updating these periodically over the next couple of days.

We really need to get these finished, so, if you can, please volunteer 
to add sections by sending a message to the list.

Cheers,
Jan
