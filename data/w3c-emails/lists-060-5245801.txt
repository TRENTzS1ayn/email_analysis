Here are some additions or comments (ideas - not the wording as such)

Guideline 3:

3.1.2(15) Metadata

(new) (c) Check for DOCTYPE and refer to Help if user is unsure of which to
choose
(new) (d) Check that Metatags do not violate WCAG such as refreshing not
controllable by user.

3.1.2(17) Tabular structure

I would change what is currently in (d) to (my wording in CAPS):

(d) The tool can provide the user with a linearized view of tables (as
tablin does). For layout tables THAT CANNOT BE CHANGED TO VALID CSS DUE TO
KNOWLEDGE OR TIME CONSTRAINTS, this version can be offered as alternatives.

I don't like this really because I don't like suggesting the use of tables
for layout in any shape or form! Even my change can be open to misuse.
3.1.2(18) looks like it might have the potential to rectify the problem with
tables for layout, so maybe this sentence can be dropped?

3.1.2(20) non-text supplements to text
Bit puzzled by the mere existence of this bit. Is it really an issue? 

3.1.2(21) Other Information
(new) (f) Warn about adjacent links

Technique 3.1.3
(add to list) * no frames view

Technique 3.1.1??? (under Techniques for Success Criteria 2)

(new) If author turns off any regularly scheduled checks in the
configuration section, the tool must have a built-in method that cannot be
turned off. I.e. the author might not want to have any help throughout the
entire authoring process, but there should be one last check that cannot be
turned off.

Guideline 4:

Still don't like technique 4.3.4 - can it be clarified somehow?

regards, Karen Mardahl

Hi,

I've been doing some work on techniques for ATAG guidelines 3 and 4 in 
advance of Monday's call. I've posted what I have so far at:

http://jan.rcat.utoronto.ca/public/auwg/tech3.html
http://jan.rcat.utoronto.ca/public/auwg/tech4.html

Both are still drafts, but the techniques for GL4 is especially rough. I 
will be updating these periodically over the next couple of days.

We really need to get these finished, so, if you can, please volunteer 
to add sections by sending a message to the list.

Cheers,
Jan
