Hi Roberto,

Thanks for offering your help on this. The ATAG draft is fairly well
developed, so, unless anyone objects, you can probably get started.

Roberto:
Good... I've done it also for ATAG 1.0 for my book ;-)

Following the WCAG 1.0 CheckList I suggest this form (see it as the
table in the url:
http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/full-checklist.html)


Priority 1 checkpoints
1.3 Allow the display preferences of the authoring interface to be
changed without affecting the document markup.  [Yes] [No] [N/A]
2.1 Ensure that markup which the tool automatically generates is valid
for the language the tool is generating. [Yes] [No] [N/A]
2.2 Support formats that enable the creation of WCAG-conformant content.
[Yes] [No] [N/A]
...
...

Priority 2 checkpoints
1.4 Ensure that the authoring interface enables the author to navigate
the structure and perform structure-based edits. [Yes] [No] [N/A]
1.5 Ensure the authoring interface allows the author to search within
the editing views. [Yes] [No] [N/A]
2.4 Ensure that the tool preserves all unrecognized markup and
accessibility information during transformations, and conversions. [Yes]
[No] [N/A]
...
...

Priority 3 checkpoints
3.5 Provide functionality for managing, editing, and reusing alternative
equivalents. [Yes] [No] [N/A]
3.6 Provide the author with a summary of the document's accessibility
status [Yes] [No] [N/A]
...
...

WCAG Relative Priority checkpoints
2.5 Ensure that when the tool automatically generates content it
conforms to the WCAG. Yes] [No] [N/A]
2.6 Ensure that all pre-authored content for the tool conforms to WCAG.
[Yes] [No] [N/A]
...
...

ISO16071 Relative Priority checkpoints
1.1 Ensure that the authoring interface follows applicable software
accessibility guidelines. [Yes] [No] [N/A]
1.2 Ensure that the authoring interface enables accessible editing of
element and object properties. [Yes] [No] [N/A]
...
...

Every checkpoint is linked to the correct part to the document... for
example, 1.1 will link to
http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#check-use-system-conventions

If the group authorize me, I will start to do it.
