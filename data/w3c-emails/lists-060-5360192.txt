You have my blessings!! A good checklist saves time for the busy developer
and helps zoom in on the necessary details. I am sure that I am not the only
one that will look forward to your results!

regards, Karen Mardahl

Hi Roberto,

Thanks for offering your help on this. The ATAG draft is fairly well
developed, so, unless anyone objects, you can probably get started.

Roberto:
Good... I've done it also for ATAG 1.0 for my book ;-)

Following the WCAG 1.0 CheckList I suggest this form (see it as the
table in the url:
http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/full-checklist.html)


Priority 1 checkpoints
1.3 Allow the display preferences of the authoring interface to be
changed without affecting the document markup.  [Yes] [No] [N/A]
2.1 Ensure that markup which the tool automatically generates is valid
for the language the tool is generating. [Yes] [No] [N/A]
2.2 Support formats that enable the creation of WCAG-conformant content.
[Yes] [No] [N/A]
...
...

Priority 2 checkpoints
1.4 Ensure that the authoring interface enables the author to navigate
the structure and perform structure-based edits. [Yes] [No] [N/A]
1.5 Ensure the authoring interface allows the author to search within
the editing views. [Yes] [No] [N/A]
2.4 Ensure that the tool preserves all unrecognized markup and
accessibility information during transformations, and conversions. [Yes]
[No] [N/A]
...
...

<snip>
...

Every checkpoint is linked to the correct part to the document... for
example, 1.1 will link to
http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#check-use-system-conventions

If the group authorize me, I will start to do it.
