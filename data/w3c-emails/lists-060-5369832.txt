Two notes about the use of icons and images.
1. The icons are too small and are not resizable: this means that low
vision people have difficulty to see them and the images can cause
problems for cognitive or not-too-much tecnical users.

2. The [D] Link is not suggested... in WCAG Working Group for WCAG 2.0
we are "deprecating" it due that the screen reader found the same link
([D]) for a lot of images.
