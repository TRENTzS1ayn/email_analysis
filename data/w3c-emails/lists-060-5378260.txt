The WCAG Techniques Task Force is also working on presentation/linking
issues for their
techniques (how success criteria relates to one or more techniques, and
inversely, how a specific technique could map to one or more success
criteria).   Sounds like there may be some overlap.  Is it worthwhile to
coordinate the approaches of the two groups?

Roberto Scano:
Yes, I suggest to do this, eventually joing in a cross-meeting with the
Techniques Task Force.
