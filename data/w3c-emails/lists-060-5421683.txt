Hello,

A few of us are going to have an initial discussion about applying a 
combination of atag and wcag to web applications.  The call is scheduled 
for 11 a.m. pacific/2 p.m. eastern and I will send call-in information to 
people who respond to this message.  Please respond off-list.

The purpose of the call is two-fold:
1. bring together people from PFWG, AUWG, and WCAG WG for an initial 
discussion of techniques for web applications.
2. brainstorm and collect issues with web applications.  for example, refer 
to Mark Pilgrim's review of 
gmail.  <http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/04/10/gmail-accessibility>

The reason for the ad hoc call and lack of scheduling is that I'm 
presenting at WWW2004 next week and want to get some feedback before my 
presentation.

(This same message was sent to WCAG WG:

Best,
