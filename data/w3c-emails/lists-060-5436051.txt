Hi, I tried fleshing out a sample technique topic (3.1.2(18) - Style 
Sheets), and the
attached has a sample scenario and a few additional detailed 
techniques.  Is this
a reasonable approach?   If so I can tackle other topics?    If these 
techniques are
to be used in any way to satisfy conformance claims in the future, it would 
seem to
me that they may be "normative" in some sense..

Some questions when I was doing this exercise:

(1) How detailed should the techniques language be?

(2) Suppose the user specifies a request for prompting and assistance that 
the tool
is not able to satisfy?   Should there be some sort of negotiation involved 
then?

(3) Should the user be given the option to "ignore" any assisting messages and
still claim conformance (since the idea is that prompts/assists should 
promote a
positive attitude towards accessibility in the user , but the user already 
knows
about accessibility and doesn't want any extraneous messages?)?

Thanks and best wishes, Tim Boland NIST
