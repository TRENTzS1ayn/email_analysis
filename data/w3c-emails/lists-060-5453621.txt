Hi Tim,

Jutta responded to your questions, so I'll concentrate on your attached 
doc. The points made look very good. The only change I would make is to 
to move some of the points into other related sections (ex. "assistance 
on properly creating null alt-text to promote accessible content" 
probably makes more sense in 3.1.2(1): Short text labels).

Cheers,
Jan
