Delayed regrets for yesterday's call.

Yesterday was a national holiday and I was bike riding back to a 
phone as quickly as possible with my son, who as luck would have it 
fell and badly scratched a sizable skin surface in our haste.  I 
missed the call, he has a large number of bandages on arms and knees. 
My apologies to the group.
