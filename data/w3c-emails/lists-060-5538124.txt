Hi,

As Tim points out at the end of his message, maybe we do need a new 
checkpoint(!) that would be devoted to configurability. At the moment 
"configurability" exists in ATAG2.0 as a kind of note in checkpoint 3.1 
(technique 3.1.1) and as a small bit of checkpoint 4.4.

A new checkpoint under GL4 (where the rest of our meta-requirements 
live) could pull together some of these ideas in one place.

Reaction?

Cheers,
Jan
