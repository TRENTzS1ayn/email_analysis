Nope. Tim did it all - don't know what he needed me for! ;-) And I knew
you'd catch the typo when you entered it into the guidelines - if everyone
approves.

This text (which I assume Karen corrected) looks good. I just fixed a 
typo in the word "considering".

NOTE: These techniques are informative.  There are no claims made, 
implicit or explicit, that by following any of the techniques in this 
document any conformance requirements of the ATAG2.0 WD will be 
satisfied.  Rather, these techniques represent an illustrative sampling 
of approaches that might be useful in considering the subject of 
authoring tool accessibility."


Cheers,
Jan
