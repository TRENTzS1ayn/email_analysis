Hi everyone,

After giving some more thought to the configuration issue, I have put 
together an idea for a new ATAG checkpoint in Guideline 4. Like other 
checkpoints in GL4 it is a "meta-requirement" on the functions we 
already require in GL3.

It is very rough at the moment, but I wanted to throw it out for 
feedback. Make sure to look at the "Trickle down effects" noted at the 
bottom to see what the effect on the rest of the docs might be.

Comments? Questions?

===============================================================

ATAG Checkpoint 4.X: Ensure that accessibility prompting, checking, 
repair and documentation functions are configurable. [Priority 3]

Rationale: A configurable tool is more likely to be adaptable to the 
work habits of more authors.

Success Criteria #1: The configurability of functions related to 
accessibility prompting, checking, repair, and documentation must be 
equivalent to that of comparable functions in terms of number of options 
under author control and the degree to which each option can be controlled.

===============================================================

Trickle down effects in the rest of the ATAG documents:

- can remove "[3] configurability" from success criteria 1 of ATAG 
checkpoint 4.4.

- can remove paragraph 4 from Introduction to Guideline 3 (in Guidelines 
and Techniques)

- link to this checkpoint from Clarification area in Techniques for 
Checkpoint 3.1.

- can remove "This intervention may proceed according to a 
user-configurable schedule. " from success criteria 1 of Checkpoint 3.1.

- can use section on configurability in techniques for checkpoint 3.1 
could be used as starting point for techniques for this checkpoint (4.X)

- good place to gather minor configuration techniques from all over the 
techniques document.

===============================================================

Cheers,
Jan
