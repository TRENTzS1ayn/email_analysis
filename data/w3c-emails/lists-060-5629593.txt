Attached is a draft, extremely rough test plan for the ATAG success 
criteria, oriented towards the stated levels of ATAG conformance (WD 
references are given in the attachment). The document is meant to stimulate 
discussion and thinking. I have attempted to combine the WCAG and ATAG 
success criteria (as well as aligned conformance levels) in this exercise. 
The general approach is that there would be a publicly accessible form on 
which: (1) those knowledgeable about the tool (tool designer?) would enter 
necessary information about the tool , and from this knowledge (2) authors 
(testers?) would try out the claimed capabilities of the tool and report 
the results on the same (or aligned) public form. This would be 
"self-testing", with the marketplace determining the honesty and accuracy 
of what's on the form. I believe these steps might be what would be 
necessary to claim conformance to ATAG levels A, AA, or AAA.

Comments welcome.  Again, this document is meant to start a thread on 
developing an ATAG test plan and approach.

Happy new year to everyone,
Tim Boland NIST
