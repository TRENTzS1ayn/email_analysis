Tim,

This is an impressive piece of work

Some of the tasks for the author/tester are quite onerous and 
complex. Perhaps we could make note of where templates can be used to 
assist with the tasks.

Do you envision any moderation or aggregation and summary of this 
public process? Is there a critical mass of verification at which a 
tool designer can be certain of their claim?
