I can't make the meeting, but I would like to ask the working group to let
me know of any involvement at CSUN this year.  If you are making a
presentation, staffing a booth, giving a tutorial, etc. about ATAG,
authoring tools, or accessibility please let me know.

For example,
IBM Accessibility Center will have a booth in the Marriott (Phill Jenkins)
Presentation: Lessons learned from making 25 million pages compliant (Matt
King & Phill Jenkins)
more to come

If you are just going to attend this year with no speaking assignments, let
me know that as well.
