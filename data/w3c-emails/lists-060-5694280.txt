See earlier forwarded message below containing additional glossary terms 
needing definitions. I was asked to repost this message at the 1-12-04 AUWG 
telecon. Karen, I earlier attempted to send you this directly, but for some 
reason the message came back - great job on sandbox!

Best wishes, Tim Boland NIST
