As resolved in our teleconference in December, this is to confirm 
again that we will be holding a face to face meeting in Austin Texas, 
hosted by IBM on February 19 and 20, 2004.

A meeting page will be available through the working group web site 
in the near future.

We look forward to seeing as many of you as possible at this important meeting.

Thanks
Jutta
