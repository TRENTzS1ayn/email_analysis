Hello everyone,

On Monday's call I suggested that we might want to hold an extra meeting
this coming Monday (Jan. 19).

However, this will NOT be going ahead. As it stands, the next call will
be on Jan. 26.

--------------

In terms of the action items from the call:

- Matt and I are cleaning up the Issues page, which we plan to release
shortly (sorry for the delay).

- The ISO reference issue is being taken a bit further into W3C process
(we will report back as soon as we have a definitive answer).


---------------

- Although there will be no Monday call, I think it would still be
valuable for the outstanding technique pieces to be sent back to the
list on Monday or Tuesday (with whatever comments or proposed changes
have been made).

---------------

Cheers,
Jan
