I need to provide updates to the Glossary.

As I understand it, we should maintain the Glossary in the ATAG 2.0
document, then drop the Glossary in the TECHS document, and just have
pointers to the Glossary in ATAG 2.0. I also have some updates to the REFS
section. The cold and sore throat I have been battling all week seems to be
peaking today. I will provide this material tomorrow. Right now I can barely
think straight with all this sneezing! :-( I'll be fine for the phone call.

regards, Karen

What documents should each of us have reviewed prior to next
teleconference?

Also, do we have a list of issues?
