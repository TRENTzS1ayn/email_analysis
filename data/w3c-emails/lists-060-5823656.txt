Hi,

I can't make the Teleconference today.

Briefly, I do feel that ATAG2 needs technical clarification between the
various types of authoring tools clearly discerning which tools need to
comply with which guidelines.  I don't believe ATAG2 applies to each set of
tools in its entirety.  Probably a system of icons for each guideline would
suffice.  But this would also need another technical document to clarify and
qualify each guideline and how it applies.  If others agree, I guess this is
where I can contribute.

Also there seems to be confusion between the distinction and the difference
between references to Software Accessibility Guidelines and WCAG.  It's true
that both share the same principles, but their technical implementation is
often entirely different.

I'm trying to work on a decent technical article to address these issues.  I
would like to see more discussion on whether anyone feels or doesn't feel a
need to separate the various types of authoring tool.

Regards
Geoff Deering
