Hi team,
      We discussed this on the call today but would like to post to the
broader list as well.  We have the option to use space in the IBM Executive
Customer Briefing for our 2/19 ~ 2/20 Face to Face.  This is very nice
space, but it will require us participants to respect the "business casual"
dress code at the center.  This is a fairly low key dress code:  No jeans
or shorts, no T-shirts, and no sneakers.  My wardrobe for business casual
is a polo or golf shirt, Dockers pants, and "top sider" shoes.  This
example wardrobe is fine for women as well (that is, women don't need to
bother with a dress).

If we don't want to be contained by this, we have other space on the IBM
campus but it will be more pedestrian.  We will have projectors,
teleconference, and high speed internet in either case.

All of today's call participants were OK either way, with a preference
toward using the Briefing Center and accepting the dress code requirement.
Unless anyone raises a concern, I will proceed to book the meeting at the
Briefing Center at the end of the day Wednesday 1/28.  So please raise
concern before end of day Wednesday, thanks.
