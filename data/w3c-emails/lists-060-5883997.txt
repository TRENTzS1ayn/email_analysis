Hi team,
      We got a terrific rate ($90/night) on a very nice hotel in a great
location.  However, to get this rate, I had to hold the rooms with my own
credit card.  If you are coming to the Austin F2F and use this hotel, then
you need to get in touch with me for a reservation number.  You'll then
contact the hotel and transfer the reservation from me to you (using your
own card).  I tried to set this up to be more straightforward, but this is
the only way i could make it work.

I will need to release the unused rooms a few days before the meeting, so
please get in touch with me soon as possible if you want to take advantage
of this arrangement.
