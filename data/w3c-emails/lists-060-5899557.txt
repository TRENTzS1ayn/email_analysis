Hi everyone,

I have attached an idea for bringing together our two sets of categories: the 
tool types under the "definition of authoring tool" in the ATAG Guidelines and 
the tool categories we use in the ATAG Techniques.

The idea is still rough, but I'd like to hear what people think.

Cheers,
Jan
