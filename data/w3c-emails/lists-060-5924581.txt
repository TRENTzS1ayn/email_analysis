The wording in the most recent internal draft:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/2004/WD-ATAG20-20040120/#check-prefer-w3c
is quite good. However, in the interest of clarity, I suggest the following re-
wording:


2.2 Give priority to formats that enable the creation of WCAG-conformant 
content. [Priority 1] 

Rationale:
Some formats are "WCAG-capable", enabling the creation of web content that 
conforms to WCAG, while other formats may intrinsically preclude this 
possibility. Giving priority to WCAG-capable formats will increase probability 
that they are used.

Success Criteria:

When format selection is automatic, the selected format must be WCAG-capable.

When format selection is performed by the author, the most prominent format(s) 
must be WCAG-capable.

(A format is WCAG-capable when a WCAG techniques document that explains how to 
meet each applicable WCAG checkpoint has been published and explicitly 
referenced.)
