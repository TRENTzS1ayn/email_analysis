Great job!   While we're talking about definitions, I for my own education
looked up some of our terms in dictionary as follows:

Webster's II New Riverside Dictionary, 1996 -

typical - 1. exhibiting the essential traits and characteristics of a kind, 
class or group
              2. of or relating to a representative specimen:characteristic
              3. conforming to or being a type

use - 1. to put into action or service - employ for some purpose
         2. employ regularly
implication -> user - one who does the above

author - 1. someone who writes a literary work
             2. someone who creates or originates anything

tool - 1. an implement or machine used to do work or to perform a task
         2.  something regarded as necessary to the performance of one's 
occupational or
              professional tasks
         3. one utilized to carry out the designs of another


As we talk about glossary/definition issues, perhaps keeping the above in 
mind might
be helpful (as a kind of "reference" for perspective?
