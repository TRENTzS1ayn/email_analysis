Hi All,

Please remember that we are holding an extra teleconference today at 
the usual time.:
     4:00 pm ET
     (617) 761-6200 ext. 2894#

During the call we will work through the issues list (see summary 
below) and make sure that the Guideline document is ready for 
publishing to TR. We will also briefly discuss the revised charter.

Thanks
Jutta

AGENDA
1. Open Issues
2. Guideline preparation for TR
3. Charter Revisions
4. Other


Open Issues:

1. Definitions needed for a number of terms.
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/2004JanMar/0007.html)

2. Concept of "typical user" in success criteria may be unclear.

3. Concept of a "usability STUDY override" to normative requirements for
conformance (success criteria) still undecided (connected with idea of typical
user)?

4. Functional spec or usability-oriented guide? Is ATAG a document that
specifies programmatic requirements, or one that directs the outcome (related
to usability override)?

5. Where will Definition of Authoring Tool example images "live" (in the
guidelines or techniques) - currently they have been moved to the techniques?

6. Handling non-W3C formats - Rationale and success criteria of 2.2

7. There may be insufficient attention paid to Web-based authoring
environments

8. New editorial additions require group approval.
