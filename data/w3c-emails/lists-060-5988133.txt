I have attached an idea for bringing together our two sets of categories:
the 
tool types under the "definition of authoring tool" in the ATAG Guidelines
and 
the tool categories we use in the ATAG Techniques.

The idea is still rough, but I'd like to hear what people think.

1) I like it! It looks much better than the existing version! 

2) I vote

"See 1.1 Definition of Authoring Tool" where that title is an href.

As for Jan's work:
   
A) I attach my version with a couple of word changes along with a move of
the 4 functions to the right. I think they needed to be offset visually for
those skimming either online or printed copy.

B) In Code-Level Authoring Functions, not sure what is meant by "Author may
or may not control other aspects (e.g. code formatting)." Began to think of
structure vs. presentation, but I don't think that is what you mean.
Couldn't see anything in the existing version to clarify matters.

C) You're missing "Constrained Editing". Couldn't it be argued that it fall
in the new Content Management Authoring Functions? This type of editing uses
sharply defined templates. Don't know if I am on shaky ground saying this. 

D) You're missing "Symbol-Level Editing". Could this be placed under
Object-oriented functions? I think the definition might need a slight
change. Not sure.
