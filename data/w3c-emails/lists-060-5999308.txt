Get your votes in otherwise you are stuck with what Jan and I work out!! :-)

This is a reply to Karen's message 
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/2004JanMar/0026.html). 
I've changed the subject to help us track the issue.

====================================

ACCESSIBLE CONTENT - drop?

====================================

ACCESSIBLE METHOD - drop? 

====================================

APPLICABLE WCAG REQUIREMENTS (JR: "OR CHECKPOINTS")

KM: ??

JR: Those WCAG checkpoints that could reasonably to applied to the web
content 
produced by an authoring tool. A WCAG checkpoint is "not applicable" only if

the authoring tool lacks the capability to produce content that could fail
the 
checkpoint. However, the inability of an authoring tool to pass a checkpoint

does not make the checkpoint "not applicable".

KM CONCLUSION: Change Glossary term to APPLICABLE WCAG CHECKPOINTS and
definition suggestion (slight adjustment to JR's proposal:

Those WCAG checkpoints that could reasonably be applied to the web content 
produced by an authoring tool. A WCAG checkpoint is "not applicable" only if

the authoring tool <em> lacks the capability to produce content <em> that
could fail the 
checkpoint. The <em>inability<em> of an authoring tool to pass a checkpoint,
however, 
does not make the checkpoint "not applicable".
====================================

AUTHOR

For the purposes of this document, an author is a user of an authoring tool

(OK w/ KM, JR)
====================================

AUTHORING TOOL INTERFACE

KM: For the purposes of this document, this refers to the controls and
mechanisms of the tool used by an author to produce content.

JR: The means by which an authoring tool is operated by an author.

KM COMMENT: included "for the purposes.." because interface is such a common
word that anyone using ATAG is highly likely to know what an interface is.
Also felt this was borderline necessary. I like JR's def - but should the
"for the purposes of this document," be added?

====================================

CHECKING

KM: Checking refers to built-in mechanisms in the authoring tool that bring
accessibility problems to the author's attention through some form of
notification. Notifications can take various forms as described in ATAG
Checkpoint 3.2. Checking can be considered a reminder of corrections that
should or must be made.

JR: The process by which web content is searched for accessibility problems.

KM COMMENT: I question the word "searched". Makes it sound like it is
happening afterwards as a process unto itself. I regard the action as "live"
or real-time. My last sentence may be completely superfluous or inspire
someone to come up with another definition. 

How about this definition?
Built-in mechanisms or processes that notify the author of accessibility
problems as they occur during creation of web content.

(Should we include reference to 3.2 as in my first def.?)

====================================

DISCOVERABLE - drop?

====================================

EXCEPTION? - drop?

====================================

INFORMATION ICON?

Any graphic that an author can select to receive additional information.

(OK w/ JR, KM)
====================================

INTERFACE PRIORITY

KM: ??

JR: Do we still use this term? CP4.1 deals with the subject matter.

KM COMMENT: Dropped?

====================================

REPAIR (ING?)

KM: Repairing refers to correcting, completing, deleting, or replacing
whatever
elements are giving accessibility problems. Suggested methods for dealing
with repairs are described in ATAG Checkpoint 3.3.

JR: The process by which web content, identified as an accessibility
problem, 
is modified (corrected, completed, or deleted) so that no accessibility 
problem remains.

KM COMMENT: I like JR's def. Should we include the ref. to 3.3 as in my
suggestion?

====================================

TECHNIQUES

Informative suggestions and examples for ways in which the success 
criteria of a checkpoint might be satisfied.

OK w/ JR, KM
====================================

TYPICAL AUTHOR

A typical author is a hypothetical individual who possesses levels of 
authoring knowledge, tool proficiency, and experience with accessibility 
issues that fall at the mean of the levels measured from a large random
sample 
of actual users of an authoring tool.

OK w/ JR, KM. NOTE: this is in ATAG guideline 3.1, not 4.1 as mentioned in
the
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/2004JanMar/att-0033/Issues.ht
ml attachment to
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/2004JanMar/0033.html

====================================

WORKFLOW

The entire sequence of steps or tasks that are followed to produce a
deliverable.

OK w/ KM, JR
====================================

JR: NEW TERM

WCAG-CAPABLE

JR: A format is WCAG-capable when a WCAG techniques document that explains
how 
to meet each applicable WCAG checkpoint has been published and explicitly 
referenced.

KM: Hmmm. Slightly lost here. Not sure what is meant by "format". Are you
saying that this "format" is something that has the capacity or potential to
meet any WCAG requirements that are explicitly referenced in official WCAG
guidelines or techniques documents?
