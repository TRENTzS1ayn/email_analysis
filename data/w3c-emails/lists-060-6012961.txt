I believe "typical user" concept has been changed to "typical author". 
"Typical author" is now dealt with as a glossary item - issue #1 -
Definitions needed for a number of terms. 
Can we close this issue as a duplicate? 
Note: In the issue list
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/2004JanMar/att-0033/Issues.ht
ml there is a reference this term appearing in checkpoint 4.1. In the
20012004 version of ATAG 2.0, the term is mentioned under Guideline 3.1
only.
