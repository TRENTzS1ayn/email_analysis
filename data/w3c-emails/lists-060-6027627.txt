Hi Jan

I like your re-wording of 2.2, in general.

Technical question: Do you want the definition in parentheses included at
this point in the guidelines, or will the term "WCAG-capable" just have an
href down to the Glossary?

I guess what worries me about the definition of WCAG-capable is - I'm
worried there's a catch somewhere. Don't know why, just do! I just dived
into the CSS Techniques for WCAG 2.0
(http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-CSS-TECHS-20031219.html) and
could not find what I would call explicit references. I.e. checkpoints or
guidelines didn't match - you have to do a Find. I expect more from your
definition than the other docs can provide. Does that then weaken your
definition? Guess that is my real worry.

OK this is all just about prioritizing. If there are no WCAG-capable formats
available, then the available formats can be in any old order. The tool
simply cannot deal with 2.2 if it doesn't have a WCAG-capable format. Would
that then imply something about the overall accessibility of the tool? 

regards, Karen, the confused and puzzled! (Or maybe I am just pedantic and
dense?!)

Subject: Issue #6: Rationale and success criteria of 2.2



The wording in the most recent internal draft:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/2004/WD-ATAG20-20040120/#check-prefer-w3c
is quite good. However, in the interest of clarity, I suggest the following
re-
wording:


2.2 Give priority to formats that enable the creation of WCAG-conformant 
content. [Priority 1] 

Rationale:
Some formats are "WCAG-capable", enabling the creation of web content that 
conforms to WCAG, while other formats may intrinsically preclude this 
possibility. Giving priority to WCAG-capable formats will increase
probability 
that they are used.

Success Criteria:

When format selection is automatic, the selected format must be
WCAG-capable.

When format selection is performed by the author, the most prominent
format(s) 
must be WCAG-capable.

(A format is WCAG-capable when a WCAG techniques document that explains how
to 
meet each applicable WCAG checkpoint has been published and explicitly 
referenced.)
