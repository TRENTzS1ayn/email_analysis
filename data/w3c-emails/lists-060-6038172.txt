I'm afraid I was a bit dense. I do know what is being referred to by format
here. I still don't know what I think I about the definition! :-) I need to
try another thinking cap!

====================================

JR: NEW TERM

WCAG-CAPABLE

JR: A format is WCAG-capable when a WCAG techniques document that explains
how 
to meet each applicable WCAG checkpoint has been published and explicitly 
referenced.

KM: Hmmm. Slightly lost here. Not sure what is meant by "format". Are you
saying that this "format" is something that has the capacity or potential to
meet any WCAG requirements that are explicitly referenced in official WCAG
guidelines or techniques documents?
