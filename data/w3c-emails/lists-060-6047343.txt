Hi Karen,

Thanks for the comments. My comments are in-line:

OK

OK - except that the 8 examples are down to 6.

This was put in so that the definition would cover totally flexible text
editors such as textpad as well as tools that do some code formatting
(e.g. code indentation) but still allow complete flexibility of the
stuff that matters (i.e. the code itself).

Yes, that's what I intended.

I think this can be split over 1 and 2 in the new scheme - depending on
the amount of flexibility afforded to the author.

Cheers,
Jan
