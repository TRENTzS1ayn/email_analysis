Hi Karen,

You make some good points:

Actually, I was wondering about this - I put it in the glossary as an
afterthought. We could just do away with the new term and just sub the
definition in to both of the success criteria.

Right, we're not trying to ban any formats. We just want tool developers
to do make sure that for their tool's favoured formats, they have a
publicly available techniques document in hand before they move ahead to
other ATAG techniques that are going to require them to prompt,
document, check, correct, etc. content on the basis of that techniques
doc.

Cheers,
Jan
