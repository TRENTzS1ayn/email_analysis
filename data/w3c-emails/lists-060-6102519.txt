Why not just say that "applicable WCAG requirements" are those requirements
associated with the word "WCAG" whereever it appears in the text of any ATAG
success criterion?   The particular "WCAG" documentation referenced to find 
those requirements
is specified according
to "Resolving ATAG2.0 References to WCAG"  document.

Thanks, Tim Boland NIST
