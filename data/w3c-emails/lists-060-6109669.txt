Continuing the definition mulling from the AUWG Teleconference Minutes (Feb
2, 2004)
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/2004JanMar/0051.html 

ACCESSIBILITY PROBLEM:

We have:

Inaccessible Web content or authoring tools cannot be used by some people
with disabilities. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 [ WCAG20]
describes how to create accessible Web content.

I propose:

The inability to access web content or authoring tools, especially by people
with a disability. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 [WCAG10] and
2.0 [WCAG20] describe the requirements for making web content accessible.

*access* is meant to be a link (perhaps??) to the definition for access at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/Glossary/printable.html#A, which is
"To interact with a system entity in order to manipulate, use, gain
knowledge of, and/or obtain a representation of some or all of a system
entity's resources." And maybe the "especially by people with a disability"
can be dropped? It really doesn't matter who you are - if you can't get at
the info you need, you've got an accessibility problem.

I was a bit unsure about the longevity of this definition with links to WCAG
1.0 and 2.0. We only have a [REF] to the 2.0 guidelines. 1.0 is the TR.
Perhaps the link could be to the WCAG home page and say "The Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines Working Group has guidelines that describe..." and
sneak around the exact version that way?

Comments?? Jutta? Anyone?
