From AUWG Teleconference Minutes (Feb 2, 2004) 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/2004JanMar/0051.html 
I had this "to do"

ACESSIBLE CONTENT
Action: KM, JR: to mull relationship between "Accessibility", "Accessible 
Content", "Accessibility Problem"

This mail covers "Accessible Content"

I researched the WAI Glossary
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/Glossary/printable.html
the UAAG Glossary
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/REC-UAAG10-20021217/
WCAG 1.0
http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/
WCAG 2.0
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/

WCAG 1 & 2 don't have these terms in a glossary per se. You need to read a
lot to come to your own conclusion.
I came up with

ACCESSIBLE CONTENT: 

1) Content displayed by a user agent that is perceivable, operable, and
understandable.

1a) Content displayed by a user agent that is perceivable, operable, and
understandable by all users.

2) Content that is perceivable, operable, and understandable when displayed
in a user agent.

2a) Content that is perceivable, operable, and understandable by all users
when displayed in a user agent.

Version 2 allows for content perhaps not being perfectly accessible during
the creation process, but being accessible when completed. 
I wasn't sure whether to include "all users". The WAI Glossary has a def. of
accessibility that says "The art of ensuring that, to as large an extent as
possible, facilities (such as, for example, Web access) are available to
people whether or not they have impairments of one sort or another." "To as
large extent" seems to allow that it may not be 100% perfect at all times.
Thus, I didn't know if including "all users" became slightly restrictive in
some cases, or if excluding it would be too vague. Comments??

Perceivable, operable, and understandable have been stolen outright from
WCAG 2.0. I like these words. I left out robust, because I just felt it
could be left out here. Since 2.0 may be a longer time coming and 1.0
doesn't have these terms, can that give problems of any kind? They are
really nice words!

Comments?! Jutta? Anyone else?
