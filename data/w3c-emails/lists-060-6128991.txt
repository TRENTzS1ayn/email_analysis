Hi All,

A reminder of our regularly scheduled teleconference on Monday February 9th:
     4:00 pm ET
     (617) 761-6200 ext. 2894#

Since we will be addressing editing of the Techniques document during 
the upcoming face-to-face meeting we will concentrate on the 
remaining open issues that effect the Guidelines document during the 
teleconference.

AGENDA
1. Review of proposed new definitions
3. Remaining open issues (see below and minutes of Feb 2 meeting)
2. Further guideline preparation for TR
3. Charter Revisions
4. Other


Open Issues:

1. Definitions needed for a number of terms.
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/2004JanMar/0007.html)

2. Concept of "typical user" in success criteria may be unclear.

3. Concept of a "usability STUDY override" to normative requirements for
conformance (success criteria) still undecided (connected with idea of typical
user)?

4. Functional spec or usability-oriented guide? Is ATAG a document that
specifies programmatic requirements, or one that directs the outcome (related
to usability override)?

5. Where will Definition of Authoring Tool example images "live" (in the
guidelines or techniques) - currently they have been moved to the techniques?

6. Handling non-W3C formats - Rationale and success criteria of 2.2

7. There may be insufficient attention paid to Web-based authoring
environments

8. New editorial additions require group approval.
