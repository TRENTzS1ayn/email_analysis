I agree with keeping the definition of "accessible" broad enough to include all
users (and all user-agents) irrespective of the reason why they may have
difficulties with it. As a craftsman I don't care whether a user is disabled or
not, indeed it's none of my business, but I do care about whether they can use
what I build.

However the case of people with disabilities does go beyond our moral duty as
craftsmen and craftswomen to all our users and into the question of social
justice. For those business interests that do not have an immediate concern
with accessibility (the "uncoverted" so to speak) these two areas within
accessibility have different effects; neglecting some users and some
user-agents leaves them with a product that sucks, neglecting others can leave
them with a lawsuit on their hands (and rightly so).

As such I do think it is necessary to include the case of people with
disabilities in a definition of accessible content (and accessible tools, and
so on) though it may be useful to give other examples to emphasise that the
focus is not entirely on that case (the case of search-engine spiders is always
a good one for convincing those who are resistant to accessibility work that it
may be in their own interests to pay more attention to these concerns).
