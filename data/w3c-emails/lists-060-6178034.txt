Thank you for checking WAI glossary for these terms.  I still have a 
concern that some of these terms (although not yet in WAI glossary) may 
have explicit or implicit definitions buried in other WAI specs (or are 
applicable in other WAI specs), and where the terms are not AUWG-specific, 
I feel that we should get some input from other affected WAI working groups 
pertaining to our definitions (or statement that they have no interest in 
our definition of a particular term, or notification to them that we are 
talking about definitions for these terms), because I believe that the 
existence of common definitions that may reach across WAI WGs may become 
important when it comes time to indicate whether or not a specification 
applies for purposes of testing, for example, and it is better to resolve 
these issues now rather than later (not to mention that it emphasizes WAI 
coordination to everyone).

Thanks and best wishes, Tim Boland NIST

PS - Also, for definitions involving web content,  I feel we should refer 
to WCAG whenever we can..
