Since our guidelines are intended in part to guide developers in 
creating tools that result in the creation of WCAG compliant software 
I think it is very appropriate to use WCAG terms to define 
"accessible content." WCAG is undergoing many structural shifts but 
the terms you are using seem to have "sticking power." If WCAG 2.0 is 
not finalized in time perhaps we can define the terms within our 
document.

I think we probably need to state who it needs to be perceivable, 
operable and understandable to - ie. to more than the author.
