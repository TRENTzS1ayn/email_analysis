Very good point, Jutta. My suggestion distorted the previous definition. In
the meantime, I prefer Jan's proposal in his mail of 8. Feb. 
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/2004JanMar/0058.html)
where he breaks it into a tool problem and a content problem. My vote goes
to his 2 definitions!

regards, Karen

I think this definition refers more to the person having the problem 
than the problem that prevents access. When I look through the 
document we use the term not in the sense: "I'm having an 
accessibility problem with this content," but more in the sense, " 
this is a problem that is preventing access."
