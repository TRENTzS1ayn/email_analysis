OK. This is my re-working - as promised - of Checkpoint 2.2

*  *  *  *
2.2 Give priority to formats that enable the creation of WCAG-conformant
content. [Priority 1]
 
Rationale:
Giving priority to WCAG-capable formats will increase the probability that
they are used. 
A format is considered WCAG-capable when its developers have published a
WCAG techniques document with explicit references explaining how to meet
each applicable WCAG checkpoint. Some formats are "WCAG-capable" while other
formats are intrinsically not "WCAG-capable". 

Success Criteria:

1) When format selection is automatic, the selected format must be
WCAG-capable.
 
2) When format selection is performed by the author, the most prominent
format(s) must be WCAG-capable.
*  *  *  *

Then, in the glossary, we should have

Term: WCAG-capable
Definition: A format is considered WCAG-capable when its developers have
published a WCAG techniques document with explicit references explaining how
to meet each applicable WCAG checkpoint. Formats that are WCAG-capable
enable creation of web content that conforms to WCAG requirements.

*  *  *  *
Even though the term appears only in this one place, we don't know how
readers of our documents read them or hear of terms we use. This is a term
that could use explaining so I think it should be in the glossary so a user
isn't always forced to do a search in body text. Having our terms all nice
and neat in our glossary makes it easier to add them to the big WAI
glossary.

regards, Karen

Hi Karen,

You make some good points:

Actually, I was wondering about this - I put it in the glossary as an
afterthought. We could just do away with the new term and just sub the
definition in to both of the success criteria.

Right, we're not trying to ban any formats. We just want tool developers
to do make sure that for their tool's favoured formats, they have a
publicly available techniques document in hand before they move ahead to
other ATAG techniques that are going to require them to prompt,
document, check, correct, etc. content on the basis of that techniques
doc.

Cheers,
Jan
