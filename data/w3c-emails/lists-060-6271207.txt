Hi Tim

In general, I think your worries are being considered already. In the big
WAI glossary at http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/Glossary/printable.html, there are
source references for each term. Where different WAI groups have different
terms, they are both listed next to each other. In those cases, I think the
two groups could discuss merging definitions. It is a project that is being
worked on as far as I have understood, but with perhaps a lower priority
than other projects.

The situation you describe was the cause of my underlying confusion in
working out definitions, and I can only imagine others have felt the same.
Terms do need to be tracked down for consistency, and then when you find
terms are used with no real glossary for true clarity, the confusion
increases!

Just a little comment on this issue!

regards, Karen

Thank you for checking WAI glossary for these terms.  I still have a 
concern that some of these terms (although not yet in WAI glossary) may 
have explicit or implicit definitions buried in other WAI specs (or are 
applicable in other WAI specs), and where the terms are not AUWG-specific, 
I feel that we should get some input from other affected WAI working groups 
pertaining to our definitions (or statement that they have no interest in 
our definition of a particular term, or notification to them that we are 
talking about definitions for these terms), because I believe that the 
existence of common definitions that may reach across WAI WGs may become 
important when it comes time to indicate whether or not a specification 
applies for purposes of testing, for example, and it is better to resolve 
these issues now rather than later (not to mention that it emphasizes WAI 
coordination to everyone).

Thanks and best wishes, Tim Boland NIST

PS - Also, for definitions involving web content,  I feel we should refer 
to WCAG whenever we can..
