Hi all,

Please review this draft WG charter and send questions or comments to 
the list. We would like to propose this charter to the Advisory 
Committee as soon as possible.

One question has been raised:
Scope: Evaluation authoring tools for conformance to the guidelines
* is this too broadly stated? Are we going to evaluate tools as a group?

Please let us know any feelings on this, or any other comments on the 
draft.

Thanks,
m
