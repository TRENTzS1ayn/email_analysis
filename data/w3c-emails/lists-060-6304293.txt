You will recall that I reserved a block of rooms for the Austin face to
face meeting.  I will need to free these up no later than Tuesday 2/17 of
next week, at which point the available rate for rooms in that hotel will
go from something like $90/night to close to twice that.  So if you want
this deal and haven't yet acted, you have until Tue 2/17.
