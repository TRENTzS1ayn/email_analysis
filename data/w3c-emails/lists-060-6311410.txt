Evaluating http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/charter5-20040116.html as per Matt's
request:

I'll start with the question in Matt's mail:
<snip>
Scope: Evaluation authoring tools for conformance to the guidelines
* is this too broadly stated? Are we going to evaluate tools as a group?
<snip>

This line bothered me too, perhaps for slightly different reasons. No, I
don't think AUWG has the capacity to evaluate tools in general, but it
should be done while developing parts of the guidelines. I think it is
reasonable/sensible to have as a participation requirement. AUWG can of
course, promote and encourage evaluation. That is something else. Perhaps
the whole line can be rephrased as:

Promoting and encouraging the evaluation of authoring tools for conformance
to guidelines.

How does that sound? Also, "evaluation" had me thinking of "testing" all the
time, for some reason. BTW it is the effort needed in developing test suites
that make me concerned that there is not a lot of capacity for evaluation
mentioned in section 2.1 "Scope".

Try as I may, I cannot find anything else to comment on in this charter, so
that's it from me re: charter! (Unless someone else has issues to throw to
the group!)
