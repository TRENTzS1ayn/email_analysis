OK Jan, dropping "developers" is fine. After Monday's call, I began to think
it had been missing. Now... my first sentence, which you just changed by
removing developers plus a bit more, is also in the rationale. Shouldn't
that sentence be changed as well? Thus, your 

"A format is WCAG-capable when a WCAG techniques document that explains how
to meet each applicable WCAG checkpoint has been published and explicitly
referenced."

should appear twice in this section. Right?

regards, Karen

Karen,

I agree with your re-wording of the rationale.

But regarding the def'n of WCAG-capable, I specifically left out who
published the WCAG techniques doc. I just specified that one must exist
and it must be public. 

KM: A format is considered WCAG-capable when its developers have
published a WCAG techniques document with explicit references explaining
how
to meet each applicable WCAG checkpoint. Formats that are WCAG-capable
enable creation of web content that conforms to WCAG requirements.

JR: A format is WCAG-capable when a WCAG techniques document that
explains how to 
meet each applicable WCAG checkpoint has been published and explicitly 
referenced. (LAST LINE FROM KM's APPENDED) Formats that are WCAG-capable
enable creation of web content that conforms to WCAG requirements.

Cheers,
Jan
