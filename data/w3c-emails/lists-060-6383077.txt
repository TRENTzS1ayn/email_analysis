Hi All,

As announced on our Web site, and during last week's call this is a 
further reminder of the teleconference today:
     4:00 pm ET
     (617) 761-6200 ext. 2894#

Given the publishing moratorium in March we would like to prepare the 
Guideline document for publication to TR by February 24th. The agenda 
for today's call includes:

AGENDA
1. Any remaining definitions.
2. Resolution on user testing and functional specification vs 
usability-oriented guide (see 3 and 4 below).
3. Web-based authoring environments (see 7 below)
4. Charter Revisions
5. Other


Talk to you later today.

Jutta

Open Issues:

1. Definitions needed for a number of terms.
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/2004JanMar/0007.html)

2. Concept of "typical user" in success criteria may be unclear.

3. Concept of a "usability STUDY override" to normative requirements for
conformance (success criteria) still undecided (connected with idea of typical
user)?

4. Functional spec or usability-oriented guide? Is ATAG a document that
specifies programmatic requirements, or one that directs the outcome (related
to usability override)?

5. Where will Definition of Authoring Tool example images "live" (in the
guidelines or techniques) - currently they have been moved to the techniques?

6. Handling non-W3C formats - Rationale and success criteria of 2.2

7. There may be insufficient attention paid to Web-based authoring
environments

8. New editorial additions require group approval.
