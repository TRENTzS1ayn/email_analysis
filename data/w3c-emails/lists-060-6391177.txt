Hello everyone,

After last weeks teleconference, here is an updated list of the
outstanding ATAG terms (I'm trying to keep all 
the terms together so none get lost).

========================================================================
Terms dropped:
========================================================================

At Feb 2 Telecon
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/2004JanMar/0051.html):

ACCESSIBLE METHOD
DISCOVERABLE

INTERFACE PRIORITY

========================================================================
Terms agreed on:
========================================================================

At Feb 2 Telecon
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/2004JanMar/0051.html):

AUTHOR (No WAI glossary def'n):
For the purposes of this document, an author is a user of an authoring
tool

INFORMATION ICON (No WAI glossary def'n):
Any graphic that an author can select to receive additional information.

TECHNIQUES (No WAI glossary def'n)
Informative suggestions and examples for ways in which the success 
criteria of a checkpoint might be satisfied.

TYPICAL AUTHOR (No WAI glossary def'n)
A typical author is a hypothetical individual who possesses levels of 
authoring knowledge, tool proficiency, and experience with accessibility 
issues that fall at the mean of the levels measured from a large random
sample 
of actual users of an authoring tool.



At Feb 9 Telecon:
(http://www.w3.org/2004/02/09-au-irc.html)

ACCESSIBILITY
Within these guidelines, the concept of accessibility has two senses:
- *accessible web content* refers to the content produced by tools being 
accessible by people regardless of disability, and
- "accessible authoring tool interface" refers to the tools, themselves,
being 
accessible by people regardless of disability.
[NOTE: some of the old text could go in the introduction]

ACCESSIBILITY PROBLEM (WEB CONTENT)
Web content that fails to meet the requirements of the *Web Content 
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)*. 
[NOTE: issue of levels to be handled in the ATAG_REFS_TO_WCAG doc.]

ACCESSIBILITY PROBLEM (AUTHORING TOOL INTERFACE)
*Authoring tool interface* features that fail to meet the success
criteria of 
the checkpoints of ATAG2.0 Guideline 1.

ACCESSIBLE AUTHORING PRACTICE 
Web content modifications made by the author or the tool that increase
the 
likelihood of producing *accessible Web content*. 

ACCESSIBLE WEB CONTENT
Web content with no *Web content accessibility problems*.

ACCESSIBLE AUTHORING TOOL INTERFACE
*Authoring tool interfaces* with no *Authoring tool interface
accessibility 
problems*.

CHECKING
The process by which web content is evaluated for accessibility
problems. This 
applies to evaluations performed automatically or with assistance from
the 
author. The evaluation may be performed at specific times or be
performed on an 
continuous basis as Web content is modified. For more information on
checking, 
see ATAG checkpoint 3.2.

REPAIRING 
The process by which Web content is modified to solve accessibility 
problems. This applies to modifications performed automatically or with 
assistance from the author. For more information on repairing, see ATAG 
checkpoint 3.3.

WORKFLOW
The customary sequence of steps or tasks that are followed to produce a
deliverable.

========================================================================
Terms still to define:
========================================================================

ACCESSIBILITY INFORMATION
Any information that is necessary for an *accessible authoring practice* 
including, but is not limited to, *equivalent alternative information*.

=>Feb 9 Telecon Outcome: JR raised issue of another term:

ALTERNATIVE INFORMATION (Also: EQUIVALENT ALTERNATIVE) 
Content is "equivalent" to other content when both fulfill essentially
the same function or purpose upon presentation to the user. Equivalent
alternatives play an important role in accessible authoring practices
since certain types of content may not be accessible to all users (e.g.,
video, images, audio, etc.). Authors are encouraged to provide text
equivalents for non-text content since text may be rendered as
synthesized speech for individuals who have visual or learning
disabilities, as Braille for individuals who are blind, or as graphical
text for individuals who are deaf or do not have a disability. For more
information about equivalent alternatives, please refer to the Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines WCAG 2.0 [ WCAG20]. 

WCAG uses: "Media Equivalent" and "Text Equivalent"


====================================

APPLICABLE WCAG REQUIREMENTS (No WAI glossary def'n)

JR: Those WCAG checkpoints that could reasonably to applied to the web
content 
produced by an authoring tool. A WCAG checkpoint is "not applicable"
only if 
the authoring tool lacks the capability to produce content that could
fail the 
checkpoint. However, the inability of an authoring tool to pass a
checkpoint 
does not make the checkpoint "not applicable".

=>Feb 2 Telecon Outcome: TB to propose rewording: 

TB:
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/2004JanMar/0053.html)
those requirements associated with the word "WCAG" wherever it appears
in the 
text of any ATAG success criterion?   The particular "WCAG"
documentation 
referenced to find those requirements is specified according to
"Resolving 
ATAG2.0 References to WCAG"  document

JR response: I still think its important to say in the normative
document that 
only those WCAG requirements that can't be failed by a tool count as not 
applicable. (of course the reference to WCAG should go through the
"Resolving 
ATAG2.0 References to WCAG" document.

=>Feb 9 Telecon Outcome: Wait for TB.


====================================

AUTHORING TOOL INTERFACE (No WAI glossary def'n)

JR: The means by which an authoring tool is operated by an author.

=>Feb 2 Telecon Outcome: JR to add idea of display.

JR: The means by which an author operates an authoring tool and receives 
information on the state of the tool.

=>Feb 9 Telecon Outcome: JT to re-work.
