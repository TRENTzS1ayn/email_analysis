Driving directions to the IBM Briefing Center:
Turn left (west) out of airport and stay on access road for 1.1 miles until
you reach Hwy 183 North. Stay on Hwy 183 North for approximately 17 miles
and exit at Burnet Road. Turn right onto Burnet (North).  Follow Burnet
pass Braker and past Kramer. Take the next right. There will be a sign
indicating the Tivoli  Briefing Center. Follow the road to the center.
Park in the Briefing Center parking spaces and go into the Lobby.   I will
meet you there.  The Briefing Center is on the first floor to your left.
You may also take Mopac (Loop 1) North (fewer lights) instead of Burnet.
If you do exit at Braker and go east to Burnet; then go North.  Or exit at
Duval, go right and then go South on Brunet .

From the Renaissance hotel exit to Great Hills right and go under Research
(183). Take the access road North one light to Braker.  Go right (East)
over Mopac and follow the directions above from there.
