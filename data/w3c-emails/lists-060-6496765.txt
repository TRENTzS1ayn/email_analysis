I have made the following changes to the ATAG draft:

1.5 Relationship to ISO 16071

Additionally, this draft refers to an ISO document titled "Ergonomics 
of human-system interaction - Guidance on accessibility for 
human-computer interfaces" [ISO16071]. The ISO document contains 
guidelines relevant to software and operating system accessibility.

2.2 Checkpoint priorities

Each checkpoint in the specification has been assigned one of the 
following priority levels to indicate the importance of the checkpoint 
in satisfying the guidelines:
Priority 1
The checkpoint is essential.
Priority 2
The checkpoint is important.
Priority 3
The checkpoint is beneficial.
WCAG Relative Priority (Level 1, 2, or 3)
The importance of the checkpoint depends on the specific requirements 
of  WCAG and is therefore relative to priorities assigned in those 
guidelines.
ISO16071 Relative Priority (Level 1, 2, or 3)
The importance of the checkpoint depends on the specific requirements 
of ISO16071, and conformance is measured as follows:
  Priority 1
Conforms to all guidelines designated "application" and "core" in Part 
7.2 of ISO16071.
Priority 2
Conforms to all guidelines designated "application", "core" and 
"primary" in Part 7.2 of ISO16071.
Priority 3
Conforms to all guidelines designated "application", "core", "primary" 
and "secondary" in Part 7.2 of ISO16071.

Also, Relative Priority has been renamed "WCAG Relative Priority", to 
differentiate it form the new "ISO16071 Relative Priority".

Please review these sections and comment on them as soon as possible. I 
plan to have this posted in a couple of hours, and will not be able to 
edit this draft after that.
