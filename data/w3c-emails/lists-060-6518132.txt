A lot of point refer to ISO TS 16071.
In guideline 1, for eg: the success criteria is:

The authoring tool interface must conform to [ISO16071].

Question: ISO TS 16071 is a "pay-per-view" document, so this is a
"close" specification (u can access only if you pay). Do u think that
ISO can make it available also for free consultation?

Thanks to everyone for the hard work on this draft. We may be ready to
