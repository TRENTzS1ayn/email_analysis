I need some additional guidance in my Mar 1 AUWG telecon action item on 
suggesting steps for
Guideline 1.1 for those without ISO,   These steps would need to be somehow 
"equivalent"
to what's in the ISO document.   I don't want to violate the ISO copyright
requirements, and it's difficult to "paraphrase" the ISO document without 
seeming
to violate such requirements.   Do we want to encourage people to buy the
ISO document?   Please advise on a way forward with this.   If someone else
wants to take this action item over, it's fine with me.

Thanks, Tim Boland NIST

NOTE: The following is from "abstract" publicly available when considering 
whether to
order ISO document:

"ISO/TS 16071:2002 provides guidance on the design of accessible
  (work, home, education) software. It covers issues associated
  with designing accessible software for people with the widest
  range of visual, hearing, motor and cognitive abilities,
including those who are elderly and temporarily disabled.
ISO/TS 16071:2002 addresses software considerations for accessibility
  that complement general design for usability covered by ISO 9241-10
  to ISO 9241-17 and ISO 13407.

ISO/TS 16071:2002 addresses the accessibility of interactive systems.
  It addresses a wide range of solutions, including office applications,
  web pages and multimedia. It does not provide recommendations for
  the design of hardware.

ISO/TS 16071:2002 promotes increased usability of systems
  in combination with assistive technologies, when they are required.
It does not cover the behaviour or requirements of assistive technologies
  themselves (including assistive software)."
