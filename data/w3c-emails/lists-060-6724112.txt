Re: question raised at Mar22 AUWG telecon:

I asked our W3C QA person if QA Framework applied to non-normative 
documents in
support of normative documents and short answer is current QA Framework 
only applies
to normative documents but lighter QA Handbook in future may apply to 
non-normative
as well as normative.. (see earlier message to list on this subject)

Thanks and best wishes, Tim Boland NIST
