Greetings, you are now subscribed to a mini-list-serve for some fast-track
curriculum work on Web accessibility, as a follow up to our education &
outreach break-out meeting in Austin recently.

We decided there that we would do three things to try to get some
accessibility information into the upcoming HTML4.0/CSS2 texts:

(1) draft some chapters and/or curriculum modules which we could offer to
publishers;

(2) develop some demos of good & bad design regarding accessibility;

(3) develop contacts list for publishers of texts & start contacts with them.

In perusing my local computer store, I noted six texts on HTML 4 already
out; primarily the Samsnet (Laura LeMay; Oliver & Holzbschlag; Darnell et
al) and Sybex (Mack & Platt; Ray & Ray) series.  Most of these texts had
pointers to web sites for follow-up information, so all is not lost there.
References to CSS in these texts were quite limited.  Not yet on those
shelves were any HTML4/CSS2 texts from Fox Downing (Kervin, Foust, Zakour);
Que; IDG; or others.  

This is not a comprehensive listing, just to get us thinking.  We have a
contact at Addison-Wesley; please let us know contacts you may have with
other relevant publishers, and start threads on "chapters" and "demos" if
you have materials available.

Thanks,

Judy
