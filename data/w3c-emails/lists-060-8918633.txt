Sir,

I am MR ESE OGHENE a Ghanain.It is with my utmost sincererity
that I
am writing this mail to you.  I got your contact through the Who is
Who and I decided to contact you as most capable to handle this
business transaction.I was formerly an accountant general with the
former
late General Sani Abacha's company in Lome Togo.
Please you must keep this business as a top secret to your good self. 
During my tenure in office as the accountant general
to the late former head of state General Sani Abacha,
He deposited with my name the sum of Twenty three
million five hundred and fifty thousand United States
Dollars ($23,550,000.00) cash with the Global Security
company in Togo. Immediately I heard of his death, I
quickly took away the certificate of deposit which was
issued to me by the security company.  
I have gone for the money and was told by the managing
director of the Security Company that I can only
collect the money in their offshore office Abroad.
It was in this respect I wanted you to claim/collect
the money from the security company on my behalf and
we can use it for viable investments in your country
before I join you in your country as a future business
partner. I plan to invest this funds into a good
profitable business with you as my technical partner. 
As regarding my present condition of health and
financial position,I will not be in a better position
to travel out for now till I have fully recovered fromsickness. 
If you accept this my business proposal to you, I
would like you to indicate your interest by sending to
me the reply through my e-mail address. 
Your immediate response will facilitate this business
transaction and I look forward to having a goodbusiness relationship
with you.  
Best regards,
MR ESE OGHENE
