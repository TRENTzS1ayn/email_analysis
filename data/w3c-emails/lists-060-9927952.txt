Hello,
I represent an acquisition firm that purchases the e-mail subscribers of websites that go defunct.

We have access to several databases full of individuals who are double opt-in subscribers of newsletters andonline offers. We sell off these user bases at 10-15cents.

If interested, please let me know what category of interest you would like, and i'll let you know what currently available assets we have.

Thank You
