When we gave our presentation last week for the Federal Depository
Librarians, they asked for a synopsis to add to their published proceeding.
I have drafted an article and may try to find avenues to publish elsewhere.
This is the first draft and am asking if anyone has time to review.
Especially for legal accuracy.   I do need to better bridge some of the
concepts and paragraphs.  Would greatly appreciate any critical minds!  Is
there anything politically incorrect?

thanks, rob  and pls reply to both home and work.
