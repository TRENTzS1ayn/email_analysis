Advance Call for Papers 


5th ERCIM WORKSHOP ON 
"USER INTERFACES FOR ALL" 

Dagstuhl , Germany, Nov. 28th - Dec. 1st 1999 

Special Theme 
"User-Tailored Information Environments" 
http://zeus.gmd.de/5-UI4ALL-Workshop/call.html 


The 5th ERCIM Workshop on "User Interfaces for All" builds upon the results of
the four previous Workshops held at Heraklion, Greece, 30-31 October 1995;
Prague, Czech Republic, 7-8 November 1996; Obernai, France, 3-4 November 1997;
and Stockholm, Sweden 19-21 October 1998. 

The vision of User Interfaces for All advocates the proactive realisation of
the design for all principle in the field of Human-Computer Interaction, and
involves the development of user interfaces to interactive applications and
telematic services, which provide universal access and quality in use to
potentially all users. This user population includes people with different
cultural, educational, training and employment background, novice and
experienced computer users, the very young and the elderly, and people with
different types of disabilities, in various interaction contexts and scenarios
of use. 

This Annual European Workshop aims to consolidate recent work, and to
stimulate
further discussion, on the state of the art in user interfaces for all. The
emphasis of this year's Workshop is on theories, methodologies, techniques and
tools which contribute to the development of User-Tailored Information
Environments. 

Areas of interest, for which papers are solicited,include, but are not limited
to, the following: 

??? - Adaptable and adaptive interaction, user modelling 
??? - Intelligent user interfaces, guided or cooperative interaction,
intelligent agents 
??? - Computer-Supported Collaborative Work 
??? - Multilinguality, internationalisation / localisation of interactive
applications 
??? - Novel interaction techniques, multimedia / multimodal interfaces 
??? - Virtual and augmented reality 
??? - Dialogue design methodologies and approaches 
??? - Interface design assistance tools 
??? - Interface architectures and development tools, interoperability 
??? - Formal methods and languages for interaction specification and
verification 
??? - Ergonomics, Human Factors and usability issues 
??? - Evaluation techniques and tools 
??? - Sociological and economical issues 
??? - Novel approaches to information access and retrieval in large
information
spaces 
??? - Cognitive Factors in Design 
??? - User-Centred Design 
??? - Interface metaphors 
??? - Intuitive, seamless interfaces 
??? - Interfaces to wearable and ubiquitous systems 
??? - Information Visualisation 
??? - Support measures (e.g. standardisation) for user interfaces for all 
??? - Accessibility of information environments 

Solicited contributions: 
??? - long papers (between 10 and 15 pages), 
??? - short papers (between 4 and 6 pages); 
??? - poster presentations (1-2 pages abstract); and 
??? - position papers (between 4 and 15 pages). 

All papers will be peer reviewed. Accepted papers will be presented during the
Workshop and will appear in the Workshop Proceedings. 

Submissions should be done? electronically by e-mail to the local organizer by
