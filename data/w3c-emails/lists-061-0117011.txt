Is there a benefit to be able to link from any slide to the
Table-of-Contents slide for all the different sets (Introduction,
Guidelines, Checkpoints, Examples) as is allowed in the current button bar
near the bottom of each slide?

If yes, should this bar remain near the bottom of the page?
Also if yes, would it be useful to have a link to the current
Table-of-Contents up with the previous/next page buttons at the top? (This
could be either a similar sized button between the  previous/next page
buttons or an unobtrusive bar directly under the previous/next buttons)

If no, would it be sufficient to just have a link on each slide to the
Table-of-Contents of its own set?

Thanks,
Chuck
