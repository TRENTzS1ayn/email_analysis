Further thought: if this is to be a "handy navigator" for the WCAG
document (or if this is to form the basis for such an entity) then the
language should be exactly that of the doc; if it has another use (which
seems to be the case), it need not slavishly follow the original text.

In the latter instance it might behoove one to examine the order
selection of the CPs where they are classed by "function" and subclassed
by priority, instead of just going "by the numbers", since the numbers
themselves are arbitrary and CPs for some "function" or with some
priority might better be grouped some other way than GLsubCP where both
are ordered by the doc numbers.
