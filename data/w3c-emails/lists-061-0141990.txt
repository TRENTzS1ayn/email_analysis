We keep speaking of these as "slides" in the same wise as referring to
the use of a telephone touchpad as "dialing".  In their present form
they are only "cyberslides", not subject to the mechanical constraints
of the paradigm whence they spring.  This is in part the legacy of the
tool with which they were created, I suppose, but it may be part of a
mindset we'd best jettison.

I suppose ideally one would be able to select a navigation system but
that's going too far so I don't envy you the decision-reaching process.

Lots of luck in your show (and tell) biz career!
