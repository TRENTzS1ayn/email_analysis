This is such a tremendous effort. When the history of WAI is written, I
bet that Chuck and Geoff's slide show will be viewed as one of the group's
crowning achievements. 

I looked at the entire slide show last night, and noticed a couple of
typos (e.g., Usage:  Reference side: change "sectons" to "sections,"
remove extra period at the end of the following paragraph)... I liked what
I read, in general, but I began to wonder whether the text could be more
concise... the text was verbose in places... I thought that some ideas
could be expressed better in point form. And given that this is a slide
show, this would be entirely appropriate. 

How much of the Guideline section has been lifted from the "real" 
guidelines, and how much leeway do we have in editing the materials for
clarity and conciseness?
