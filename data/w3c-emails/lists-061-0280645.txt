I need help with the example for Checkpoint 6.1, or a better example.

The example I was going to use is at
http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/one/sam35-0.htm

The concept I am trying to get across is that with style sheets, even if
you "position" elements "randomly" on a page, the content in the HTML file
can be arranged logically, even though style is used to display it otherwise.

My problem is that I have never had success using the limited positioning
features of CSS1 as it is implemented in IE4 or Netscape 4.  

Can anybody come up with a fix for my example, or just create a better example?

Thanks,
Chuck
