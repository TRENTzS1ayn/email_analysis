Hi Geoff...

Please update the mmsoftwr.htm.htm file with any new information you have,
even if it is only "coming soon" stuff.  Also, if you have any further
information you can share with the public about the mm sync authoring
tool(s) you demonstrated at CSUN, that might be appropriate to add to the
page (since we tell people to caption and synchronize, but give them no
clues as to how.) Maybe also a note saying that there are professional
organizations and companies that can do the captioning, description and
sync work if you don't have the tools to do it yourself.)  Basically, we
need some of the excellent information you provided in your CSUN presentation.

Chuck
