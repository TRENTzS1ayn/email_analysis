I hope it was worth the wait...

I am still missing a couple of examples (help!).  All the slides look
pretty good and do what they are supposed to if you look at them with
IE4.01.  There are still some problems for Netscape 4.0+ users that are
caused by some flaky and difficult to identify style sheet problems.  (One
annoying one is the wild changes in font-size between one page and another).

Users of other browsers will see what their browser supports. In most
cases, except where I forgot to do so, I have included a bit of explanation
of what is supposed to happen for those who might otherwise be puzzled by a
slide. (Please let me know where I still need to do that!)

Anyway, the curriculum, revised to match the WCAG Recommendation, can be
found at:

http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/three/

Please note the URL change (yes... again... sorry about that). 

If you are a Netscape user, the following Example slides will give you some
difficulty:
slides 7, 22, 30, 39, 41, 51, 56, 69, 75, 76, 78, and 94.  I will endeavour
to fix them as quickly as possible.   If you are an IE4+ users, things
should be mostly ok... but let me know if they aren't. I will look at them
with Opera 3.5 soon.  Any intrepid Lynx users who want to review the sets
(primarily for understanding of the content) will earn my undying gratitude.

Cheers!
Chuck
