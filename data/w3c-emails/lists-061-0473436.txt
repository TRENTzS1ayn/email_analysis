CPL:: On my system, this animated .GIF does expand and burst, in both IE
4.0 and Netscape 4.0.  I don't know why it doesn't for you.

CPL: wording fixed, example changed and real applet added.

CPL:: I did add alt-text to the .gif image, but I didn't bother to add a
longdesc.  In the fix I refer people back to the example for checkpoint
1.1a, part 2 where longdesc is first explained.

CPL:: temporary fix: linked to checkpoint 12.2 (sam86-0.htm) where a more
detailed example existed.

CPL:: URGENT - request someone to provide me with a simple but interesting
example I can use in this slide.  (please respect any copyrights... better
yet, write one and donate it to the EO)

CPL:: Question... by null alt text, do you mean alt="" with no space
between the quotes?
Actually, this example may still reflect my particular bias to the use of
alt-text which is no longer reflected in the WCAG.  I should re-read what
the latest techniques document says about it.  Maybe somebody could clip it
and mail it to me to save time.

CPL:: typo fixed.  Example added.  Thanks for noticing all this stuff... I
had these examples in the old set but forgot to transfer them to the new in
my haste.

>Slide 14: cries out to be an example.  Just saying it has less power.
CPL:: I have faked an example using an image of a submit button linked to a
.WAV file.  I don't know how to write a real script that would accomplish
this, but I know it can be done by somebody.  If someone wants to take a
crack at it, please be my guest.
