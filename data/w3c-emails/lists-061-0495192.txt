the WCAG. <grin>

CPL:: changed "don't be frightened" to "don't panic".  I should probably
remove the injunction altogether and leave the statement of (assumed) fact,
but I just can't bring myself to it.  If anyone else thinks I am being
silly, let me know, but be warned that my feelings will be hurt.

CPL:: made "hope" "premise" and fixed the link.

CPL::: fixed the link.

CPL:: yeah... I have become aware of that.  Netscape's interpretation of
style commands differs from Internet Explorer's.  I have yet to figure out
a method that is both accessible and consistent across the main graphical
browsers.  Probably have to do more work with style.
