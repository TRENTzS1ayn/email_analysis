CPL:: did I fix it?  I think I fixed it.  Does "orphan" mean I had one too
many or one too few.  Regardless, when I looked at the slide (in IE) it
seemed to be all right.  Confusing? You bet.

CPL:: I see your point... I changed the wording to: "Note: if you are using
tables for page layout (instead of CSS), then you should not use markup
reserved for data tables (like TH, HEADER, SCOPE, COLGROUP, etc.) because
those elements will be used by some agents to identify and manipulate
data). "  The scrolling seems only to be necessary in NETSCAPE and I can't
figure out why. Yet.

CPL:: comma replaced in slide 43. Priority 2 was an artifact of a previous
slide, now removed.  Fixed font-size change.  Fixed wording about current
crop, but didn't remove it entirely.  Not completely sure how to deal with
this issue, because while some of the newer screen-readers (and some
non-graphical browsers) can decolumnize simple tables, it will take HTML
4.0 aware agents that understand colgroup, scope, thead, tfoot, etc. to
demystify complex tables.  I am not sure where to put this idea, but it
needs to be said somewhere.

CPL:: Will try to fix it.

CPL:: tersified!

CPL:: I thought it looked pretty, but I removed it because you didn't like
it. <Grin>
