CPL:: will ponder this, but inter-set navigation is a bit problematic.

CPL:: I reread the explanation for the lower priority on color controlled
by style or markup (priority 3 for text) and it makes sense to me.  If the
user can control the color, then it is not a significant problem.  Since
you can't control the color as easily in an image, then the responsibility
falls to the graphic designer to choose good color contrast.  

CPL:: I arbitrarily chose three colors to quickly distinguish the priority
ratings visually... not to convey a message with those color choices.  You
have not come right out and said my choices were bad, but you were hinting
(Yes... I caught the hint <grin>).    I would be happy for someone with a
better color-sense than I to choose some appropriate foreground/background
combinations that are in the 216 color Netscape safe set.

CPL:: I don't recall the GL discussions on this point in any detail, but
the decision must be documented somewhere in the archives or minutes.
Perhaps we will have to revisit this item in version 2 of the guidelines. 

CPL:: coding errors fixed.

CPL::  you may be right, but I ain't changin the Recommendation's wording

CPL:: Are you are referring to Checkpoint 12.4?  It doesn't have anything
to do with FRAMES.  It does have to do with FORMS.  Ok... in this case I
broke my own rule about tampering with Rec-text and I added "(in a FORM)"
to the checkpoint to make it clearer when taken out of context.  Feel free
to suggest this to the GL group as an editorial change for the Rec.

CPL::  I don't like what a herd of raccoons and/or skunks has done to my
front lawn while digging for grubs during the night.  Ooops... I guess this
is the wrong forum for my remark too. <grin>.
