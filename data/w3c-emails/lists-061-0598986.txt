CPL:: sigh... Netscape is very touchy about style sheet commands (or IE is
very tolerant... not sure which).  I think Jim found a partial (non WCAG
compliant) solution for these font-size problems and I will look back
through my mail to try and find it again.

>Slide 54: I'm not sure what "animated image" means here.

CPL:: "animated image" refers to the animated image.  At least it is
animated when I look at it.  The picture in the example flips back and
forth between a house and a telephone.

The device-independent event-handlers in this example work in IE4, but not,
apparently in Netscape 4.  My HTML 4 book seems to indicate they should
work in Netscape 4, but for some reason, they don't.  The same problem
occurs on sam69-0.htm. The next slide (sam70-0.htm) has device-dependent
event handlers that do work in Netscape 4.

CPL:: fixed.

CPL:: links added. Colon added.

CPL:: is "the link itself will be followed and a new HTML page will load"
better?  Again, there is something quirky about Netscape and style.  All
code examples look the same in IE.  I will try and find a solution.

CPL:: I added a comma to the event description, but it does work in
Netscape, exactly as I described it.

CPL:: Link fixed... now points to a file that give some accessible options
for on-line forms.  Tabindex is (as far as I know) only supported on IE4+.
Not sure about Opera. Definitely not in Netscape 4.0. Not sure about
Netscape 4.5+. Added a caveat to the example.

CPL:: it doesn't cause a problem on my system (with either Netscape or IE).
 I have temporarily added a warning to NOT submit the example forms since
they may cause a problem on some systems.  I will see if I can identify the
problem you had.

CPL:: IE vs Netscape again... what can I say.  I added a caveat to the example.

CPL:: Your nags are making this a much better product!
