CPL::  removed the extra "that".  Added some text to the example to explain
the checkpoint and added a "negative" example for some contrast.

CPL:: you are incorrect.  I was going for the jocular... it was "someone
else" who was suggesting we "business" it up a bit.  However, in this case,
I am going on strike.  I like my deathless prose.  If somebody wants to
send me some "appropriate" text (same approximate number of words, same
possibility for confusion, etc.) then I will substitute it.  Otherwise it
stays.  Re: "most" screen-readers.  I will change it to "some" screen-readers.

CPL:: fixed.

CPL:: fixed link (By the way, this highlights the extreme difficulty in
making any changes to the slide sets.  Any addition or deletion of a slide
requires manual investigation of all links in the curriculum).  Comma added.

CPL:: and thank you both for having distinctly different mind-sets.  I
would have gotten bored  reading the same comments and typing "see response
to so-and-so".
