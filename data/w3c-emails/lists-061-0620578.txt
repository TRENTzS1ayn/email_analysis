CPL:: I substantially revised the wording of this slide and the previous.
I think it is much better now.  Also, I don't know what the link is, so I
changed the wording.  If anyone is aware that of a resource for
browser/screen-reader compatibility exists, please tell me.

CPL:: HELP!!! Can anybody tell me what the link to deprecated element is?

CPL:: don't know how.  Need HELP from someone who knows.  User friendly
explanation and example desperately wanted!

CPL:: period changed to comma.  Changed "graphic and non-graphic users" to
"users of graphical and non-graphical browsers"

CPL:: 1) Thanks for catching that.  I am almost incapable of distinguishing
between left and right.  Never have been able to.  On the other hand (pun
intended) I am adept at functioning with the compass directions (North,
East, South, West etc.) and never get them confused.  As to making the
frame do something: too much trouble for the moment.  I will consider it in
a later revision.
