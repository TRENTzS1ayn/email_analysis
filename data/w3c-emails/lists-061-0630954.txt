CPL:: I am not clear about this myself.  Anyone have a more appropriate
example where using the "title" attribute might add to the understanding of
a link?

CPL:: this checkpoint is also over my head.  I am asking (again, I think)
for anyone out there to explain this to me.

CPL:: "and" replaced with "an".  And I always forget that A stands for
ANCHOR (though it very often creates a LINK).  Sloppy syntax on my part.

CPL:: replaced with: " In the future, if the page author has grouped links
with the proper markup, user agents will be able to deal with them as a group."

CPL:: done.

CPL:: added a caveat.  Will look at "doing something" with the button in
the future.

Modified the text to clarify, and added the link.

CPL:: done.

CPL:: fixed the first person singular.  Replaced the confusing sentence
with "To maintain a sense of where they are in a site, visitors will have
to rely on less obvious cues or clues on a page to keep from being confused ."

CPL:: fixed the gratuitous quote.  But, at the end of it all, you have
stumped me with your comment about human review.  Can you rephrase or
restate?  I am not sure what you are getting at.

CPL:: Thanks so much William... your comments have been invaluable.  Judy
has been after me to bug the experts, but I am a prime procrastinator.  I
agree that some of the more esoteric guidelines need more.  But I do need help.

CPL:: don't know about Toronto, but Ottawa was deluged with very warm rain
today (after almost two weeks of perfectly sunny, warm, dry (omega-block)
weather.

Cheers!
