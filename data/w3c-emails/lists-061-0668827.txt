Notez bien!

If you have already confirmed your attendance, please do so again --
unless your names are William and guest, Charles and guest, Judy, Robert,
Chuck, and Harvey. I misplaced my list. 

Hello Education Outreach Working Group members,

The informal get-together for EOWG members (and their spouses/partners/
families/friends/whatever) in Toronto is on! 

Date:Friday 14 May. 

Time:7:00. (Developers Day ends at 5 p.m.)

Place:A patio-restaurant on the Danforth, in the heart of Greektown. 
(This is a few miles from downtown. I want to encourage you all to get 
out of the city core.) Details and directions to follow. 

Pre-soiree gathering. Drop by my place for a drink or refreshment around
5:45 or 6:00 p.m. Then we'll head out to the restaurant. Details and 
directions to follow.

Looking forward to seeing everybody.

Alan
