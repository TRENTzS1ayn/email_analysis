EOWGroupies:

While in Toronto, when you want information about transportation,
restaurants, recreation, or whatever, feel free to call me. My telephone
number is +1 416 406-5098. 

From within Toronto, dial 406-5098. 

Public pay phones are everywhere. A local call costs 25 cents. (Canada has
more telephones per capita than any other country.)

Alan
