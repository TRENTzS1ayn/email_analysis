The U.S. Mint's webcast at the White House for the unveiling of the
new dollar coin design is now available in a close-captioned format.  No one has done this live because technology is simply not there yet.  

We have provided a text transcript of the event as well as a close-captioned video for people who are hearing impaired, please see  http://webevents.broadcast.com/usmint/dollarcoin/.


Does anyone know of any government office that has done this?  If you do, please let me know.
