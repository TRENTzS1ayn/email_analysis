Hello,

I am cancelling the pre-dinner "warm-up" at my home. I don't think there
will be enough time to allow this... Developers Day is apt to run late,
and our reservation at il Fornello is for 7:15 p.m. I may not have a
chance to get back here on time. So meet you in the restaurant. 

Please pass this message on to other EOWG members who you may see. 

If anyone wants to visit after dinner for refreshments or creative hanging
around, you will be welcome. (10 - 15 minute walk from the restaurant.)

It might also be worthwhile to head down to the Beaches after supper if
the weather warms up a bit. There's a boardwalk by the lake.
