Paris, 14 May 199

"Click-it", a European conference on how IT can be used to increase
information access for people with
reading disabilities, will be in Ronneby (South Sweden) in the year 2000
(still at planning stage). Participants will be libraries, disability
organizations and private corporations. 

The European Blind Union is part of the Planning Committee.  What about
trying to have a WAI seminar there ?
