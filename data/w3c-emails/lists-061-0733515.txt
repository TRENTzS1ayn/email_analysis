Spoke to Geoff Lindsay, who is coordinating to Net Expo and he is willing to
make adjustments for universal accessibility.  If anyone is interested in
presenting, please email Geof who is copied above.  Deadline for proposals
is close of business this Friday 21 May.  This is in DC, November 4-5, and
attracts 5000 people.

Judy, would you consider being a keynote speaker and discussing the WAI and
Universal Accessibility?  They may be able to provide transportation and
hotel?

Geoff:  I also propose a session where we will demonstate tools people with
disabilties use on the web.  We have given this presentation before and TV
ON THE WEB video'd it.  See the Able channel,
http://www.tvontheweb.com/channels/able/videoguide/dcwebmasters.html  Need
one projection system and a switch for three of four computers.  Also
request one hour to set-up. 

cheers, rob
