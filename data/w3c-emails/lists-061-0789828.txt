I recently rewrote and expanded my evaluation of keyboard-only access, first
presented at CSUN 1998. I presented the new paper on Developers Day at WWW8
in Toronto on 14 May 1999.

The new paper, Escaping the mousetrap: an evaluation of the accessibility
and usability of Windows keyboard-only interface, is on the web at:
