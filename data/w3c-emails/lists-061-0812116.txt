I don't know that WAI has a position paper as such. What we do have is Web
Content Accesibility Guidelines. Guideline 12, in the introductory material,
discusses the use of PDF as a specific example.

  Will be going to Governnment Printing Office next week to discuss PDF and
  universal accessibility, per their request.
  
  My question to the group is, "Does the WAI have an official position or
  point paper that discusses PDF and Universal Accessibility"  I am very
  familiar with PDF, the process and problems, but wondering if anyone had
  previously written papers or examples?  Would use these to point people to
  the issues etc.
