http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/three/sam70-0.htm works in Netscape,IE, and
OPERA! sort of :(

in Netscape and Opera-mouse click on link brings up Alert, hitting OK brings
up destination page
but then no keystrokes work (a click on the mouse button and keyboard
functionality is restored!), or clicking on back button doesn't work and
causes the screen to  highlight, but clicking a second time returns
functionality to normal.

in IE - click on link brings up Alert, hitting OK brings up Alert, hitting
OK second time brings up destination page

In Netscape tab to link, hit enter, Alert comes up, hit ok, destination page
comes up
In IE tab to link, hit enter, Alert comes up, hit ok, Alert comes up, hit ok
again ,destination page comes up
In Opera tab to link, hit enter, destination page comes up

http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/three/sam56-0.htm

no script does not work in Opera, works ok in webspeak
the script breaks the style sheet in Netscape right after "....text that
would appear in the script-generated pop up  window).</SMALL></P>" Netscape
seems not to like <code> following </p> it also broke the style sheet in
http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/three/sam51-0.htm

also, think it would be useful to make a statement about the upcoming
example. It might be confusing to some (like me!) as to what is the purpose
of the text and code about the PRIZE.

Here is an example:
You will win a prize if you do the right thing.

Here is the HTML code for the example

blah-----blah
