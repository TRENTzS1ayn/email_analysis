Netscape 4.6 ignores tab index and tabs to every link in order of appearance
on the page

Opera goes in the following order 6,3,2,7 you can not tab to any other links
on the page

IE ignores tab index in the radio buttons taking you only to the first item,
next tab takes you to index-6 (only one radio button can be selected at a
time, current convention [at least in windows] is to use the arrow keys to
navigate through radio buttons)
I think using check boxes would be better and tabindex should work.

no script does not work in Opera, works ok in webspeak
the script breaks the style sheet in Netscape right after "....text that
would appear in the script-generated pop up  window).</SMALL></P>" Netscape
seems not to like <code> following </p> it also broke the style sheet in
http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/three/sam51-0.htm

also, think it would be useful to make a statement about the upcoming
example. It might be confusing to some (like me!) as to what is the purpose
of the text and code about the PRIZE.

Here is an example:
You will win a prize if you do the right thing.

Here is the HTML code for the example

blah-----blah
