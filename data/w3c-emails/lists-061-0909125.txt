CPL:: Netscape doesn't seem to like SCRIPT/NOSCRIPT in the BODY of the
HTML.  I moved the SCRIPT/NOSCRIPT code between the HEAD and BODY and the
stylesheet is fixed in Netscape.  The placement of script doesn't seem to
matter in IE.  Of course, the script still doesn't work in Netscape 4, but
at least the style is fixed.

CPL:: This one was due to the fact that Netscape doesn't like quotation
marks around style ID calls (e.g. <div class="id">).  If you write it as
<div class=id> then Netscape understands it.  Again, IE doesn't care one
way or the other.
