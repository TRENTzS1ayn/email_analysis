Charles... you have identified, but not helped solve, the biggest problem
with the curriculum.  I simply do not know how to do what is "right" and
have it work on more than one mainstream browser at time.  If I use
compliant code, the Netscape users out there will see either a broken style
or possibly even find their system crashing occasionally (mine does!).  If
I use incompliant code, then both IE and Netscape users will see the
intended page.  It makes me want to cry, but there it is.  If you have a
simple solution, I would love to hear it.

Cheers!
