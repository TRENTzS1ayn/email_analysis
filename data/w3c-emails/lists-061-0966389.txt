Chuck,

What I tended to do in the tutorials I wrote was to name browsers which had
big bugs in them. And point out that this was a bug, and that using a
work-around to suit the browser would just mess it up for everyone else.

It is a pretty religious position to take, that standards are really
important. Fortunately there are alternatives - just point people to the
browsers which do the job properly - in this case IE, Opera, W3, ...

(also, you probably should avoid class="id" since id is the name of a
possible attribute. So you should have class="identifier" or class="xxx" or
pretty much anything else...

cheers

Charles

PS I was told that you work with Deirdre Bagot - say hi from me.
PPS Is it wet in all of Ontario, or only in Hamilton?

  Charles... you have identified, but not helped solve, the biggest problem
  with the curriculum.  I simply do not know how to do what is "right" and
  have it work on more than one mainstream browser at time.  If I use
  compliant code, the Netscape users out there will see either a broken style
  or possibly even find their system crashing occasionally (mine does!).  If
  I use incompliant code, then both IE and Netscape users will see the
  intended page.  It makes me want to cry, but there it is.  If you have a
  simple solution, I would love to hear it.
  
  Cheers!
