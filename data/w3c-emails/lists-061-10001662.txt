Comments on Evaluation & Repair list: (for Feb. 4, 2000 EO Conference call 
minutes)

I would move the brief explanation of each of the three sets to the first 
section, then either eliminate or duplicate the same information at the 
start of each main section.  This would let the user know which section(s) 
are of immediate interest.  A link could be made to the start of each section.

A list indicates what information is to reported for each entry but not all 
entries complete the list.  I would suggest either more consistent data 
collection, or reduce or remove the list.  It was also suggested that the 
information would be more useful if it was structured in each definition 
(e.g. a bulleted list).

Insert some white space between each paragraph.  That would make it easier 
for touch screen users where links not separated by a line.  Also I think 
it would improve the appearance of the page.

Be consistent in layout from one section to another. The entire page should 
use the definition list style. Which also means that the Repair, 
Filter/Transform and Other tools sections deserve short explanations of the 
function of the tools (as in done for the Evaluation tools section).  I 
don't want to link out to another web site until I know a bit more about 
what the tool is used for.
