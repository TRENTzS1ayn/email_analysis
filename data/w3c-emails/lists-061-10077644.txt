WAI EOWG:

We will be meeting tomorrow, Friday February 18th, at our regular time
8:30am -10:00am US Eastern.

My apologies that we again will not be able to meet Thursday this week; we
are still handling fall out from the hearing last week and that has taken
more time than expected. I will be trying to reschedule the Thursday
meeting for next week, the 24th.

The focus of our meeting tomorrow will be two fact sheets: 
- a general WAI fact sheet which includes responses to
"fear/uncertainity/doubt" issues; 
and 
- questions for user agent fact sheet.

Regards

Judy
