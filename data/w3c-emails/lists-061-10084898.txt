Hello,

I started incorporating EO's suggestions into "Evaluation, Repair, and 
Transform Tools for Web Content Accessibility" [1] (previously known as the 
List of Existing Tools).

I have:
1. added a disclaimer
2. added brief descriptions about each type of tool in the table of contents.
3. alphabetized the tools in each list.
4. updated the "last modified date" and copyright (it had been modified in 
February 2000, but the date had been hard-coded. this is now automagically 
generated).
5. added a brief introduction

There are still many tools without information since I have not finished 
reviewing all of the tools.  Could we divide the remaining tools into a few 
sublists for people to review?  Any volunteers?  Suggestions for how to 
break this up?  If we could get a handful of people each reviewing one tool 
per week we could have this updated in a few weeks....which would be really 
groovy. <grin>
