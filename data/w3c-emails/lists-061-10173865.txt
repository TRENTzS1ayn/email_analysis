What about the WCAG Curriculum?  Particularly the Example Set of the WCAG 
Curriculum?

Curriculum: http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/wcag/
Example set: http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/wcag/sam1-0.htm

Please note that the curriculum will be moving to W3C space in the next 
week or so.  Don't bookmark pages in the above site as they will soon be 
invalid.  Once the curriculum is in the W3C space, WAI EO will likely start 
promoting it more heavily.

Regards,
Chuck
