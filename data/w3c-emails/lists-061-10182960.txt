I mis-stated on last week's telecon that I thought Mike Paciello's book
on Web Accessibility was out. Not yet. Mike says now it is delayed till
March or April. It now is being published by Miller-Freeman. It is 
available "when published" from at least BarnesandNoble and Amazon. I've asked
Mike to let us know when it is finally out.

Regards/Harvey Bingham
