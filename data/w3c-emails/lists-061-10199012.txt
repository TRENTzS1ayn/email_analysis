One technology that is fairly heavily used for gathering natural-language
commetary is the slashdot engine.  I believe this came up earlier in terms
of searching for lightweight infrastructure that would serve us in
gathering hands-on review information from lots of people in different
language-centric and other qualified-evaluator communities.

A commercial alternative, which means you may like the user interface
better, is ePinions.com.  

Note this is the current project of Lou Montulli, the original author of Lynx.
