Often this argument is simply false - many browsers also do not support Java
or Javascript or animation effects or frames or many other effects.

It is important to use things in a way which means they do not break down for
some people. So using CSS for layout control needs to be done in such a way
that a browser which does not support CSS will still provide an appropriate
layout.

Many browsers do support CSS. Netscape, Internet Explorer, Emacs-W3, Opera,
Neoplanet, the ICE browser component, Mozilla, and others all provide good
support. And if people are using a browser that doesn't, such as Braillesurf,
lynx, very old versions of Explorer/Netscape, etc then it is very likely to
be because they don't care about layout presentation.

  Hello all,
  We recently recommended to a webmaster to use the CSS for the layout of his
  site. 
  He answerded he could not take this recommendation into acount because many
  browsers do not support CSS. 
  What should we argue to convince him to use them. 
  Thank you in advance
