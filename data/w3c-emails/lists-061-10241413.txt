Sylvie,

it is true that there are some parts of CSS that do not work well in
different browsers. In some cases there are ways to fix it, and in other
cases the implementation is just bad (for example, Internet Explorer 3 does
not handle margin-after properly, and Netscape has a number of bugs to do
with tables and with Definition lists (dt elements).

Having some example stylesheets that can be used and will not cause anything
to break (although some things may not look the same in older or
badly-designed browsers) would be very helpful. The Authoring Tools Working
group is currently producing some sample templates, and perhaps the Education
and Outreach Group would be interested in reviewing them.

  Thank you for your arguments for CSS. I think many people are reluctant to
  use css because they do not know how to use them so that they can be
  compatible with most browsers. If you use a css that works with the last
  versions of Internet Explorer, those may not work with older versions of
  this browser and with Netscape. We experienced that with a CSS that wirked
  under IE but not under netscape. What should we recommend then? 
  I think that Marja's proposal to make a document about the use of CSS is a
  good idea and a necessary thing.
