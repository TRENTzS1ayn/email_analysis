Interesting introduction to accessibility. Braillenet had done something
similar last year -- it also used a more conversational tone than the WCAG
guidelines. In both cases, for WAI to be able to use these materials we'd
need to be sure they are cross-disability.

I agree with Alan Cantor that we should look at what is already available
in terms of examples within the WCAG Curriculum. 

For instance, http://www.w3.org/WAI/wcag-curric/sam7-0.htm shows how to
make an animation accessible.

[note: as with Alan's and my previous comments on this list, the curriculum
is being moved right now, and this link is not yet stable]
