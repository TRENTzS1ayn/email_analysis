>This page addresses one of WAI's most commonly received questions, "how do
>I get started on making my site accessible"? It has similar content to what
>we've been sending out in e-mail replies to this question.
>
>We can obviously add more resources to it, and even more in the future as
>we continue to develop various materials, but let's see how simple we can
>keep this page.
>
>It is already publicly viewable, however kindly refrain from broadcasting
>its presence until we have a few days for comments on it.
>
>One more note: the WCAG-curric version linked at the URI on
>gettingstarted.html is still undergoing its final installation checks, so
>if you note any problems at that link, they've probably been identified
>already and should be fixed shortly.
>
>Looking forward to your comments.
