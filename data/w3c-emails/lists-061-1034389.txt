The question of "responsibility" for details of how things from the Web
will be perceived through browser/access device is a bit tricky.  It is
conceivable that various flavors of either "user agent" will affect the
perception of the user.

The UA Working Group has wrestled with this issue and you might want to
participate in their efforts because, like all of us, they can use all
the help they can get - particularly from people who *must* use these
systems on a daily basis.  For a sighted person to use a screen reader
is a fairly unrealistic approximation of the real experience.
