This is great! 

Only one thing that came to my mind was that should the evaluation tools be
a little later in the list or are they already so good and helpful that
people can start with them with no knowledge of the guidelines?

Another thing is how could we organize the feedback so that when we get a
lot of questions about how to do something in accessible way we could add
examples to the curriculum.
