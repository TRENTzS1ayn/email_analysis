  This message was sent by Richard Jones to the EASI listserv. Does anyone
know whether this product can be recommended?

  Softquad created HotMetal5 which had an interface that allowed a user to
create an accessible web page.  The latest version HotMetal6 and the new XML
editor do not mention these attributes on the Softquad web site.  Does
anyone know if Softquad is still creating products that support
accommodations for individuals with disabilities?
