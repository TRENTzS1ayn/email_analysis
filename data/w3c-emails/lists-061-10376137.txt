Hot Metal Pro 6.0 still has the check accessibility feature, but the checking
is not based on the current W3C Web Content guidelines[1], but on some older
guidelines developed at ATRC at the U. of Toronto.  I have enquired about their
potential support of the W3C guidelines and have not received an answer.  I
urge you to contact them and request they upgrade this feature to comply with
the current W3C guidelines.  They have a feedback form on their web page.
