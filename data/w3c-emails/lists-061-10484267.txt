As we create shorter documents the WAI banner ad is taking up more and more prominence. Currently it occurs once in a document of say 400 lines.

On a page of 1-5 lines a banner has far more, and unwanted impact,
similarly authors/mail-me links.

If its decided that the WAI banner is essential then could we use it on 'say'
every 20th page?
