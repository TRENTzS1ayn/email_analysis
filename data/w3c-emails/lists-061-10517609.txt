In a recent missive by Kelly Ford is a fairly succinct summation:

"Personally I think if the average point and click image loading user
had to put up with even one tenth of one percent of the gibberish people
who are blind do to get around a web site the alt text problem would be
fixed
almost instantly.  I teach many people who are blind how to use the
internet and I know that most of them will never return to a web site
like this because sorting through the gibberish of untagged links is
very
annoying and intimidating."

In this vein it might be good to pick a couple of points of emphasis
from the *huge* set of documents as was done for the QuickTips cards.
Perhaps the group could arrive at even more succinct messages and means
of promulgating them to the Web Community?
