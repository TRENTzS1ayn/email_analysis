Apologies from me (And Gregory Rosmaita) - we will be hanging around airport
check-in queues.

With regard to Outreach updates, we have both been working with various teams
at Microsfot, including Publisher, FrontPage, Office, and the MSN.com team
(the people who do the msn.com home page).

I haven't gathered any information on the groups I was looking for yet - I
was waiting for the minutes to remind me which ones they were - and we have
not started to write up the review document because people are still all on
the road.
