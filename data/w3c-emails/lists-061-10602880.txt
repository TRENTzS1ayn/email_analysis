Further our discussion this morning about the components of a web
accessibility curriculum, I have drawn up a list of eight "learning
objectives" that I have used in my workshops and presentations. 

This list is not exhaustive. What other objectives might form part of a
curriculum on web accessibility? 

By the end of a presentation or workshop, participants will...

1. Understand key concepts about disability and people with
disabilities.

2. Know the business case for accessibility. 

3. Understand the legal requirements for web accessibility.

4. Be familiar with the assistive technologies and alternative access
techniques used by people with disabilities to access the Web.

5. Recognize common barriers that people with disabilities encounter
on the Web.

6. Know the principles of accessible (or universal) web page design
(or... be familiar with the W3C Web Content Guidelines.)

7. Evaluate the accessibility of your organization's Web site.

8. Improve the accessibility of your organization's Web site.

It is not necessary to cover all objectives. Objective 2 may be excessive
for web masters, but essential for company executives. Objective 4 would
be inappropriate for a group of blind programmers, but the most important
element in a presentation to web-based trainers. 

Note that these objectives only state what will be learned. They do not
specific how objectives will be met. There are many ways to satisfy an
objective. For example, to fulfill the fourth objective, the facilitator
can:

- Show a video that shows people with disabilities operating PCs.

- Demonstrate assistive technologies.

- Ask a sighted volunteer use a screen-reader equipped PC with the
monitor off.

- Lecture on assistive technologies, and distribute handouts.

Depending on the audience and time available, means to satisfy the 6th
objective might include:

- Distribute the Quick Tip cards and discuss the ten points. 

- Present a mini-lecture on the Web Content Guidelines.

- Present Chuck and Geoff's Curriculum.

- Ask groups of participants to choose a section of the guidelines,
study it, and summarize it for the entire group.

Objectives 7 and 8 are experiential objectives, and would form part of a
longer, more technical course.
