COMMON MINIMUM WEBSITE ACCESS STANDARDS
The Council agreed to the adoption of the World Wide Web Consortium's Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines as the common best practice standard for
all Australian government websites. This decision should ensure that people
with disabilities or technical constraints can use online resources provided
by Australian governments. The Guidelines are widely recognised
internationally, and have the support of Australia's Human Rights and Equal
Opportunity Commission, disability groups and rural groups.

Adoption of common standards by all Australian governments will promote the
confidence of users in online services, and the accessibility of online
government information and services. The guidelines set out ways to present
information which will enhance access, for example, by providing website
material on a text only basis to facilitate the use of screen readers by
those with visual impairments, and reducing the use of graphics to enhance
download times.

REGIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS
Affordable access to telecommunications by all Australians is a high
priority for all Australian governments. The Council's Regional
Telecommunications Working Group has focused on improving coordination
between the three tiers of government, and has worked jointly on key
projects. The Council supported the Working Group's proposal to conduct a
series of case studies around Australia and overseas, and to develop a
regional telecommunications models toolkit.

The toolkit will contain practical information to assist regional and rural
organisations improve access to telecommunications services for their
communities. The information will be widely disseminated to regional
communities, to enable a much broader appreciation among regional decision
makers of the opportunities offered by these new telecommunications models,
and the issues associated with their implementation.

The Council also supported the decisions to tender for untimed local calls
and untimed Internet access in extended zones, and the proposed USO
contestability trials.
