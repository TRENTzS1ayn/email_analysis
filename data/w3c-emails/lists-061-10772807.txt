The main barriers found to the actual implementation of
alternative design techniques using CSS come, unfortunately, from
Netscape 4.x. Among the biggest problems I found:
* All browsers: None or poor implementation of <object>
* All browsers: inconsistent implementation of margin, padding
* Netscape: lousy implementation of inheritance; it gives a lot of
problems when you try to modify characteristics of an element
nested in a DIV, SPAN or TABLE element, among others.
* Netscape: DIV positioned elements get all messed up when user
resizes the window. Solvable by reloading the page with
JavaScript, which depends on whether the user has JavaScript
active.
* All browsers: implementing LONGDESC looks like SCI-FI
* All browsers: different implementation of default font-sizes
* And the list goes on and on ...

A hope: Opera and Mozilla.

I will try to make the previous remarks as structured as possible.
Last week I posted an excellent reference about actual
implementation of CSS2.
