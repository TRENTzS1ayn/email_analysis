Perhaps 1.0 is a bit presumptuous! The main overhaul is the "who" page.

I've incorporated some points from the teleconference. Both the "what"
and "who" sections are representations of the format I favor: lots of
list type things. The extent and content of these items is very much up
in the air. These are just first-order suggestions. 

The format of this document is as a "checklist" similar to what a pilot
uses before taxiing out to the runway.

I would appreciate specific recommendations for the form and especially
the content of each of these before I proceed to the "how" page.
