The Penn State Academic Computing Web Accessibility Website has several 
references that seem to be based on WCAG.  I have not confirmed that all of 
the info from WCAG is covered in their materials.  This seems to be a 
really nice introduction to the topic.

Are people aware of this site?
Should we use it as a model for the "easy read" revision of WCAG?
Are these people involved in EO WG?
Should we encourage them to be in EO WG? in WCAG WG?
