Could we organise a competition amongst web publishers to create a (flash,
or shockwave animation?) multimedia homepage for WAI?

This would enable publishers to consider their and their clients attitudes
to accessibility.
Enable us to consider how we present WAI to the public.
If used, these resources could provide a broader range of  entry points for
visitors, and outreach talks.
