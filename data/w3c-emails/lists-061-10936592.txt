To streamline the meeting a bit, I thought I would report on recent and 
upcoming outreach projects to the list.

Every Wednesday afternoon, beginning back on April 26, 2000 and extending 
into the foreseeable future, my team does one or two Web site accessibility 
demonstrations for Government of Canada (GoC) Web masters and their design 
teams.  Each session begins with a talk about the W3C, WAI, WCAG etc..  The 
GoC is committed to achieving "Double-A compliance" with WCAG as part of 
its Common Look and Feel Policy.  This service continues to gather rave 
reviews from participants.

June 16: Presentation on WAI Web accessibility and GoC Common Look and Feel 
Policy to Health Canada Web masters (Department of Health).

July 26: Presenting to the State of Connecticut's "ConneCT Management 
Advisory Committee" to help launch their "Year of ConneCT 
Accessibility".  Their goal is to have all Connecticut State Government Web 
Sites universally accessible by July 26, 2001. (Note: their goal is "Single 
A" compliance).

Regards,
Chuck
