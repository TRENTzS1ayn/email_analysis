Hi:
It appears as though the revised Policy
 http://www.cmac.state.ct.us/access/policies/revaccess.html  ) has survived
the 10-day review and comment period by the full CMAC membership and is on
its way to the Department of Information Technology for a stamp of approval
and distribution to agency commissioners!
The two other speakers at the meeting on the 26th are Nancy Wyman, State
Comptroller (my boss) and Dr. Donna Balaski, the Deputy Commissioner of the
Board of Education Services for the Blind.
