The NASA Webmaster asked me to forward the address for an accessibility page they've
developed for your comments.  (Sorry for the delay, Chas)

Subject:  URL for web accessibility tips

We have placed the web accessibility document we showed at the last ViTS on
the HQ server.  There are three sections, the main, "how to" section, and a
section on best practices and a section on assistive technology (which is
incomplete but evolving).  The principal URL is:
http://www.hq.nasa.gov/webmaster/accessibility

We have also created a URL shortcut for the same site
http://www.hq.nasa.gov/webaccess/

Feel free to link to this (it is accessible on the public net) and also feel free to
comment, request additions, forward your learned lessons, etc.

Thanks
Chas Redmond
