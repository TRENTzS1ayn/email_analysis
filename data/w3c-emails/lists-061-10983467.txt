EOWG:

Friday, July 14, 2000
8:30 to 10:00 a.m. US Eastern
+1 617 252 1038.

Agenda:
1. Outreach updates
thank you to those who've been sending your updates to the list!
this is good, let's keep this up
saves meeting time, and encourages more questions and discussion

2. Interesting model of "friendly guidelines wrapper"
http://www.psu.edu/dept/cac/training/outlines/accessibility/
see Wendy's original comment on this list
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-eo/2000JulSep/0011.html
Wendy poses some questions of her own, but I'd also ask:
1. what do people like about the presentation/format
(specifically for the purpose of a friendly/wcag/resource)
2. what kinds of problems do people find on the site (or not)
3. if WAI were to use a similar format for its "friendly wrapper," 
how might the work best be shared or coordinated between EOWG and WCAG WG?

3. Continued discussion of training pages
remember, we have two versions in progress
William's version
at http://dicomp.pair.com/overview.html
original version 
at http://www.w3.org/WAI/training
and we have more to discuss about the training resources page 
at http://www.w3.org/WAI/training/ra
even though I don't believe the page sets have been additionally updated
since last meeting.

If you send regrets please send only to chair at jbrewer@w3.org
