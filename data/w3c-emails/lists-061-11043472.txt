"User  Interfaces for All" is the first book dedicated to the issues
of  Universal Design and Universal Access in the field  of  Human-
Computer  Interaction (HCI). Universal Design (or Design for  All)
is  an  inclusive  and proactive approach seeking  to  accommodate
diversity in the users and usage contexts of interactive products,
applications and services, starting from the design phase  of  the
development  life  cycle. The on-going paradigm  shift  toward  a
knowledge-intensive information society is already bringing  about
radical  changes  in  the way people work and interact  with  each
other  and with information. The requirement for Universal  Design
stems  from  the  growing  impact of the fusion  of  the  emerging
technologies, and from the different dimensions of diversity which
are intrinsic to the information society.

"User  Interfaces  for All" unfolds the various  aspects  of  this
ongoing evolution from a variety of viewpoints. It is a collection
of  30  chapters  written  by  leading international  authorities,
affiliated with academic, research and industrial organizations  and
non-market   institutions.  The  book  provides  a   comprehensive
overview  of  the  state  of the art in the  field,  and  includes
contributions   from   a  variety  of  theoretical   and   applied
disciplines and research themes.

This book can also be used for teaching purposes in HCI courses at
undergraduate  as  well  as  graduate  level.  Students  will   be
introduced to the human-, organizational-, and technology-oriented
dimensions  that call for a departure from traditional  approaches
to  user interface development. Students will also get an overview
of novel methods, techniques, tools and frameworks for the design,
implementation,  and  evaluation  of  user  interfaces  that   are
universally  accessible and usable by the broadest  possible  end-
user population.

This   comprehensive  book  is  targeted  to  a  broad  readership
including  HCI  researchers,  user interface  designers,  computer
scientists,   software   engineers,  ergonomists   and   usability
engineers,    Human   Factors   researchers   and   practitioners,
organizational     psychologists,    system/product     designers,
sociologists,   policy   and  decision   makers,   scientists   in
government,   industry  and  education,  as  well   as   assistive
technology and rehabilitation experts.
