I have difficulty understanding why there is resistance to attempts to
create a web based visual introduction to accessibility. Many companies use
television and posters, to advertise their products and video games have
been the fastest growth sector for some years (until the recent success of
the mobile phone.)

We need some serious discussion, a text, and some storyboards.
