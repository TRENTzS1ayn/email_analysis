JC:: "I have difficulty understanding why there is resistance to
attempts to create a web based visual introduction to accessibility."

WL: The difficulty is presented by the task, not by "resistance" to the
idea. If it can be done satisfactorily, fine. The fact is that there
isn't anything to object to because there is no serious example of a
"visual introduction to accessibility."
