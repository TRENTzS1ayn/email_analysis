At the Danish Centre for Accessibility's website on web accessibility I
found among links to WAI and W3C a link to this site
http://www.eskimo.com/~jlubin/disabled/web-desi.htm  I've only look at a few
links and think they might be a little old. Do any of you know this site?
who owns it? Is the information valid? 
Kind regards
