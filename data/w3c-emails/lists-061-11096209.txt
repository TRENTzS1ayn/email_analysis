Is there a template (model) Accessibility Policy available online
anywhere? (similar to the Trust-e Privacy Policy template
http://www.truste.com/webpublishers/pub_resourceguide.html)   If not, is
it something that we, as a group, could look into as a way to
standardize this small part of the issue?

Thanks,
Diana
