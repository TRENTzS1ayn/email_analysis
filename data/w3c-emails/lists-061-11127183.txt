A press release from Al Gore at 
http://www.algore2000.com/briefingroom/releases/pr_0719_nat_1.html compares 
the accessibility of his web site with Bush's.  It references a 7/17/2000 
story in the Washington Post
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A58625-2000Jul17.html  (one 
of the articles that quotes Judy BTW).

The article notes problems in the Bush site found with Bobby, and WAVE, but 
no problems in the Gore Site.  The article also references the  W3C tools list.
