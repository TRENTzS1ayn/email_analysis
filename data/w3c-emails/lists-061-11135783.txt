Gore's site though does automatically open a window after about 5 seconds 
on the page to allow you to make a campaign contribution and the focus 
moves to the new window.  Bobby and Wave may not detect this problem, but 
it is usually very disorienting to visually impaired users.  This violates 
checkpoint 10.1 in WCAG, notably a priority 2 checkpoint.
