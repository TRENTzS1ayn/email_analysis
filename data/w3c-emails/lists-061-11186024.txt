Joh,

right, it has a popup that violates 10.1.  Neither Bobby nor the WAVE 
caught it (technique 10.1.2 in AERT [1] would have caught it... but neither 
Bobby nor WAVE implement that yet).

This wouldn't keep them from advertising Bobby Approval anyway, since Bobby 
approval corresponds to Priority 1, and as you point out popups are 
priority 2.    (BTW, there's no such thing as "WAVE approved"... it simply 
refers people to WCAG.)

I'll email the Gore site webmaster... about that popup and becoming double 
A in general.  (If someone else has already done so please tell me).

It's great for people to be boasting of accessibility as a competitive edge!
