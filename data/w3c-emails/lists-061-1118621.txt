It's sort of funny that the only explicit reason I had for placing the
labels after the "bullet-style" controls was to have the controls and the
text align nicely without having to resort to a layout TABLE or trying to
figure out how to use CSS that would work across the major browsers.  

Strictly speaking, I think the order of placement suggested in the
checkpoint is valid for text boxes and for controls if the author puts more
than one control/label pair on the same scan-line, so I don't think the
checkpoint should be changed.  However, if there is only one control/label
per line, I think the ordering is unimportant since the control and label
are associated by default.

To maintain internal consistency with the guidelines, I guess I should
move the labels to the other side of the controls (lead by example!).
Either that, or I could add a comment to the slide (or an associated page)
explaining why I chose the placement and why it is not necessarily a bad
thing.  I look forward to hearing what Len's colleagues have to say about this.

By the way, in this case an automated accessibility validation tool
hard-coded to the checkpoint would indicate an access-error when one does
not really exist, although I suppose a rule could be written to test for
the exception.
