It looks excellent to me, and is certainly a resource I will keep, use, and
pass along to others interested in the topic of accessibility.

The only suggestion I would make is purely a matter of preference.  When
you're mentioning WAI and CSS, I'd prefer to see the words Web Accessibility
Initiative and Cascading Style Sheets be the link rather than the acronyms.

Keep up the good work.

http://www.ski.org/Rehab/WebAccess/index.html might qualify as my
"outreach update" since I completely rewrote it yesterday!
