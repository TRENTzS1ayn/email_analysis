I have merged the three glossaries from WCAG, Authoring, and User Agent.
My purpose is to have a consistent reference source. This draft result is 
temporarily available at:

Stylesheet problem throughout: bullet at bottom left of item, not top of

The lead words -- "Demo:", "Present", "Discuss:", "Exercise:" -- often

No mention of audio, only VCR gear. For some, headphone feed is important,
and means to keep personal computers in synch with presentation. Not all
audiences will have individual computers, or with appropriate assistive
technology. Accessible formats presumes assistive technology is available.
