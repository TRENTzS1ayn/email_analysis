EOWG:

Also for review and discussion, first draft of 
"Resources for Web Accessibility"
intent is for an annotated, comprehensive listing of WAI resources
an intermediate step in pulling some of the content off of the WAI home page;
a more descriptive resources bin to point to for "more" info on WAI resources;
and a home page for WAI resources, to point back to from resource sets such
as the training resource pages.
It's at http://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources/
