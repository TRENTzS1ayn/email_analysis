Hello,

I thought some of you might find this brief opinion piece of interest. It is the current column of Alertbox, produced by the much read usability guru Jakob Neilsen under the title "Disabled Accessibility: The Pragmatic Approach". In it he advocates a "staged roll-out" of accessibility based on prioritized standard compliance to the WAI guidelines. He also suggests following proprietary accessibility guidelines from technology vendors such as Microsoft and Sun. 

The article can be found at:

Cheers,

Bill
