Congratulations to Kathleen Anderson for shepherding the State of 
Connecticut's policy on Web accessibility to a wonderful conclusion.  I was 
there on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the ADA to talk about Web 
accessibility and to watch as the policy was formally adopted.  Very 
satisfying.

September 11 and 15, 2000:  I will be presenting two two-hour plenary 
workshops on accessible Web design as it relates to the Government of 
Canada's new Common Look and Feel (CLF) policy.  As I have mentioned 
before, the CLF's major accessibility requirement is double-A compliance to 
WCAG.

September through October - I will be presenting a weekly series of focus 
sessions on specific areas of accessible Web design for Government Web 
designers (on behalf of the Access Working Group of the Treasury Board's 
Internet Advisory Committee).  Topics will include PDF handling, 
alternative content for scripting and programmatic objects, CSS vs. TABLE 
markup, and other hot issues.

Regards,
Chuck Letourneau
