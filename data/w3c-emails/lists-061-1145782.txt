Comments:

The Examples section is extremely helpful!

In general, I find this a good reference as a trainer, as someone who is
carrying the message of web accessible design. 

It is not yet a curriculum I would use directly with either beginner web
designers or experienced graphic designers. Both groups, in my experience,
need filtering lessons about "why?" and "how do I justify the extra time
it takes?". In addition, both need help shifting their thinking to include
accessible design from the beginning.

Those are issues I can help them with, though. Thanks for the many hours
you have put into this work.
