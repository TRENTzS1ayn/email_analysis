Dublin Core stuff co-exists with other meta information. I can't think of any
time when it is not appropriate to use it, although it is probably better
used in RDF which is difficult to edit by hand than in meta elements.

I'm not sure of a resource off the top of my head - most of the current W3C
work on metadata can be found via the RDF home page at http://www.w3.org/RDF

  That is my mission. I know which tags are out there, I don't have clear
  understanding of their relationship to regular meta tags and when to use
  them."
  
  I would really like to help him - he has written a free VBA Macro for
  FrontPage 2000 that checks page HTML for;
  
  (A) <TITLE>: present and first element in <HEAD> section
  
  (B) Meta Tags present;
      Copyright
      Description
      Keywords
      Rating
      Robots
  
  (C)That (foreground) images use ALT-TEXT, specify HEIGHT and WIDTH.
  
  Wahoo! I've asked him to add a check for the DOCTYPE declaration and sent
  him this link:
