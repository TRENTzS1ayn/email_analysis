W3C has published a Note, "Accessibility Features of SVG" 
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-SVG-access-20000807/> which explains how to
use Scalable Vector Graphics to support accessibility of the Web for people
with disabilities. This W3C Note was prepared in order to be available to
potential implementors of SVG during the SVG Candidate Recommendation (CR)
period which started August 2, 2000. This message requests additional
review of the Note.

The SVG Candidate Recommendation itself is available at
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-SVG-20000802/>. As a process reminder, W3C's
Candidate Recommendation status is an implementation trial period which
precedes W3C's Proposed Recommendation status. More information on W3C
document stages is available at <http://www.w3.org/TR/#About>. 

This initial version of the W3C Note "Accessibility Features of SVG," by
Charles McCathieNevile and Marja-Riitta Koivunen, has primarily been
prepared with input from WAI staff and from SVG Working Group members. It
is important that we receive additional review and comment from the WAI
Interest Group, the Education and Outreach Working Group, and the Protocols
and Formats Working Group (which had commented on earlier versions), and we
welcome comments from other parties. We will update the W3C Note with the
results of these review comments. 

Please send review comments by Wednesday, August 30, 2000, to the Education
and Outreach Working Group (EOWG), at w3c-wai-eo@w3.org, with "SVG Acess
Note" in the subject line. Archives of the EOWG discussions are available
at <http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-eo>.

Thank you,

- Judy
