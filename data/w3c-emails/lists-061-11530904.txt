EOWG:

Based on responses from the EOWG active members, we have enough people for
a good working meeting in Ottawa Oct 5 and 6, 2000, including a few people
who wouldn't be able to attend a meeting in Bristol. So, please put this on
your calendars if you are able to, and stay tuned (early next week) for
meeting logistics and other details.

Regards,

Judy
