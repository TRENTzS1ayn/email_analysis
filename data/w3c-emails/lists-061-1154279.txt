Tom, 

Thank you for your kind (and very useful) comments on the "curriculum".  

I believe that most of the documents that should be associated with this
curriculum including definitions, backgrounders, business cases,  the
"who-fors", the "why-fors", and so on, are in some stage of production
somewhere in the WAI.  I think that the short term solution will be to
include a well-designed link page to the curriculum giving "recommended
readings".  

In the longer term, perhaps we will add another module (in a format similar
the existing "slides") that will cover such material.

I think these are good points to be raised at an upcoming EO working group
meeting.

Regards,
Chuck Letourneau
