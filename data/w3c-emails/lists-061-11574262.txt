Based on feedback I've received from several colleagues at federal
agencies, the Check Your Page tool has been updated to a version 3.2.   We
would appreciate comments on this version by the end of August,
particularly on the content, so that these changes can be incorporated into
our redesign efforts.   Please comment through the "webmaster" link from a
results page.
http://w3.gsa.gov/web/m/cita.nsf/YourPage32?OpenForm

A version 4.0, which will be a complete redesign and a different URL, will
have e-mail capability and will keep the results page completely private.
