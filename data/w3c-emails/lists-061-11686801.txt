EOWG:

A reminder that the SVG access note is under review:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-eo/2000JulSep/0080.html

We've only gotten a few EOWG comments on it so far; ideally we should have
at least four or five EOWG members give it a serious read-through. If you
are planning to review and comment on it, could you please reply to this
message on the EOWG mailing list so we know how much additional review the
note will be getting? 

(If you're not going to review it -- and not everyone has fun reading
detailed technical documents, which is fine -- please do _not_ reply to
this message.)

Thank you,

- Judy
