Questions for review:
- is the organization of info better?
**********************
WL: Although this seems like a simple enough question, it really
requires some kind of user testing to evaluate properly. As one user, I
would say it's no better - no worse. As a regular user I would prefer a
stable setup once I've become accustomed but for newcomers, I can't tell
because I'm not a newcomer, and I would be suspicious of any conclusions
made by regular users.
**********************

- are the navigation options clear?

WL: In general the placing of multiple links on one line leaves me very
cold. E.g.:
 Web Content, Authoring Tools, User Agent 
 Evaluation and Repair, Education and Outreach, WAI Interest Group 
 Protocols and Formats 
or:
 WAI Technical Activity, WAI International Program Office 
 Press releases, history, WAI overview 
 Contacts, questions about site? 
 Sponsors, how to sponsor 

I don't know if there should be a site-specific style of showing links
but they just don't seem clear to me.
***********************

- are there key pieces of info you can't easily find?
 
WL: Because the links depend on one knowing what they are going to lead
to, I must say one can't "easily find" key pieces of info. The trade-off
is that if each link is on its own line *and* contains (info about link)
the page might get long.
************************

- does it work well on various assistive technologies?

WL: I am in no position to answer this.
************************

- does it display well in GUI browsers?

WL: Opera 4.01 looks "better" than NS 4.61. IE5 is also better than NS
but I prefer the "larger, spacier" look of Opera. It looks quite good in
Amaya but for some reason the links neither show up nor function!
************************

- is it an improvement over the current WAI home page

WL: I guess so, but not really a *major* improvement - but that's just a
"for me" thing. It's certainly less and as we all know "less is more"!
************************

If continuing to work on it doesn't hang too many people up for too many
hours then keep on keeping on. On balance I think it's a worthwhile
start IF IT HAS THE PRIORITY TO WARRANT THAT.

ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE
