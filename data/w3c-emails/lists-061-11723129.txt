Dear Judy,

We hope that you have had good holidays and that all is well!

Some comments and remarks about the new look of the WAI homepage

Back from our holidays we will take up the thread in working together in the WAI-EO group.
In general we are really happy with what already is done to make the site more usable. Usability is always realizing who is the visitor you will provide with the requested information. Since there is a great difference in visitors (well informed and not yet informed) is it always searching for the right structure of all the information you want to publish.

We have a few short remarks/suggestions about WAI 'new style'.

We would suggest to have more similarity in headers and link names, e.g. in the home page is a link called Sponsors, how to sponsor but the header of the linked page is called WAI Sponsorship etc.

The header WAI Resource Library on the home page is a link itself and is divided in five lines/points and every line/point has several links, but al these links are leading to one page. I think that this can be confusing. Proposal: the header not being a link like the other headers on the page, make 4 or 5 subjects of all the mentioned subjects/links and put every subject in a separate page.

About Participation. The WAI Interest Group and the Workgroups are put together in three bulleted lines. Would it not be better to make clear (in short/one line) the difference between the WAI Interest Group and a working group and to put each working group in a separate bulleted line?

About the start of the home page. We miss the short introduction or mission statement that describes the WAI. Now it only looks like a links page.

The last remark is about the third link of News. We suggest to add a bit more information in this link e.g. Upcoming events / history / press & document releases.

We hope this contribution will help.

Kindest regards,

Eric Velleman and Henk Snetselaar
