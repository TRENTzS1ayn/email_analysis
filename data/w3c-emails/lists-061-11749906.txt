William,

Thanks, as always, for digging into these review projects (and replying to
all my questions!). Some replies below, prefaced by JB.

JB: Interesting that it seems no better. Given that the organization of
info on the current page is fairly bad, I'm concerned if this redraft
doesn't appear to be an improvement. Any more thoughts on how to improve
the organization of info? And yes, I agree on the need for as much
stability as possible, but we're overdue with a clean-up and re-org of this
page.

JB: I'd be interested in alternative suggestions. Here are some of the
things that we've tried: 
#1. using a CSS float to separate out a column of options (inconsistent
browser support for that kind of mid-page float)
#2. using a table to separate out two columns of options for resources and
working groups (can't avoid linearization & sequencing problems)
#3. using a table as a "nav-panel" for some single-line, quick-find options
on the right side of the page (see, for instance, the W3C home page which
was recently redesigned) I would prefer not to use layout tables for the
WAI home page, if we can avoid it, even though we've discussed among WAI
staff some interesting ways (such as embedding a tablin option) of keeping
it WCAG Double-A conformant.

Apart from those approaches, we could also:
#4. strip out more of the individual links & words. Well, I see maybe a few
more words we could strip out, but the trouble is that even now many people
have little idea of the resources that we have available, and so providing
keyword links from the top page gives people a clue of things they might
not otherwise even think to look for. I guess some of my perceptions on
this come from talking with people who call up, looking for things,
including reporters. (I've actually been using the redraft-in-progress once
or twice with visitors or callers over the past few days, and found it
easier to talk people through -- particularly the "Resources" sub-page.)
#5. "verticalize" the lists -- make them long & thin. Visually, this looks
kind of unpleasant, and you only get the very top of the page on the
screen; everything else you have to scroll down for, which is fine for
screen reader users but not so great for visual navigators.

The version I liked best for visual navigation (and with my lousy
dexterity) was #2 above: using a table to separate out two columns of
options for resources and working groups. It left more "air" between the
choices. If we get more feedback on this issue, perhaps we should run some
screen reader trials on that model, perhaps using tablin as an unwrap
option at the start of the table/list, because I may have over-estimated
the linearization/sequencing problems -- it may be possible to build the
layout so that the sequence is irrelevant. But this page has to at least
meet Double-A (and I want to slap a "WCAG AA" logo on it when we're done).

JB: Agreed, that there's a trade-off. Can you give some examples of links
that are particularly cryptic, or suggestions for how to make links clearer?

JB: Fine. Any other volunteers?

JB: Ouch. What version of Amaya are you using? I just checked it with Amaya
2.0, and instead of attractive & non-functional, it comes up rather
unpleasant-looking but quite functional.

Regarding Opera, IE, and Netscape, does it at least render comparably
across those three browsers, things are in the right place, right fonts,
colors, etc? I've tested it mainly in Opera 3.61 and Navigator 4.01.

(A note to other people commenting on the page: please include your browser
data in your comments, as William has. Thanks)

JB: We've had lots of requests both externally and internally to update the
WAI home page, so yes this is high priority. Most of the work (I believe)
is now done, so the time investment has already been made. 

Eventually we wanted to do something with more customized entry points, and
a snazzier design. I'm not sure if that's what you were hoping for on this
round, or if you have other thoughts for different approaches to use on
this clean-up and re-org? Ideas?
