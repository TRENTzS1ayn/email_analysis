Henk, Eric:

>We have a few short remarks/suggestions about WAI 'new style'.

>We would suggest to have more similarity in headers and link names, e.g.
in the home page is a link called Sponsors, how to sponsor but the header
of the linked page is called WAI Sponsorship etc.

JB: Ah yes. Good point.

>The header WAI Resource Library on the home page is a link itself and is
divided in five lines/points and every line/point has several links, but al
these links are leading to one page. I think that this can be confusing.
Proposal: the header not being a link like the other headers on the page,
make 4 or 5 subjects of all the mentioned subjects/links and put every
subject in a separate page.

JB: Interesting. Please also see the discussion on the multiple
links-per-line issue which started with William's thread and then my reply.
You provide yet another approach, which is helpful. Here's why I did it the
way it is, although I don't necessarily think it should stay this way: 
- I found in linking to the various sections of the resource page, but
without a link to the top of the page, one never sees the top of the page
directly. But I agree it is confusing having the resources H2 element link
to a page when the others don't.
- The resource library is rather long, and I had considered breaking it up.
But in doing so, I am concerned that it increases the chance that some
people won't realize the breadth/variety of resources. Many people who come
to our page, for instance, don't even know to look for "guidelines" because
they don't know these exist. The W3C Technical Reports page
<http://www.w3.org/TR/> has been kept as a single page for the same reason.
We could break it up like the suite of training resource pages, I suppose,
and also have it available as a single HTML file. 
This is just background on why the draft currently looks this way; the
feedback is very helpful, and I'd be interested in additional feedback on
Henk's and Eric's proposal.

>About Participation. The WAI Interest Group and the Workgroups are put
together in three bulleted lines. Would it not be better to make clear (in
short/one line) the difference between the WAI Interest Group and a working
group and to put each working group in a separate bulleted line?

JB: Can you be more specific on this one? Do you mean to put each working
group on a separate line (for instance, the way they are on the WAI
Interest Group home page <http://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/>? That takes up quite a
lot of vertical space.

>About the start of the home page. We miss the short introduction or
mission statement that describes the WAI. Now it only looks like a links page.

JB: We wanted to get into more useful content at the start of the page.
What do you think about putting the mission text under the "About WAI" H2?

>The last remark is about the third link of News. We suggest to add a bit
more information in this link e.g. Upcoming events / history / press &
document releases.

JB: In other words, moving up the history, and press & document releases,
that are currently listed under "About WAI"? What do other people think
about that? Some of that information is also very important for "About WAI"
context, but we could cross-link to it from some of the sub-pages under
"About WAI."

>We hope this contribution will help.

JB: Definitely. Thanks for your comments.

- Judy
