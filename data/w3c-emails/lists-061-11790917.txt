These comments in refer to Accessibility Features of SVG, W3C Note 7 August 
2000
[ http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-SVG-access-20000807/ ]

Editorial comment:

In section 1.1, might the sentence: "The working context of people with (or 
without) disabilities can vary enormously." be better stated as "The 
working context of people (with or without disabilities) varies enormously."

In section 1.2, in the paragraph under the heading "Alternative 
Equivalents", the second sentence needs the word "allows" inserted between 
"SVG" and "authors".

In example 2.2, is the first </g> supposed to be there? Isn't that a stray 
end-tag?

General comments:

I would appreciate a concise list of the accessibility features of SVG in 
the introductory section (perhaps with links to the subsequent examples of 
use).  Such a list could be more easily extracted into a one-page handout 
or presentation slide.

I think I recall someone (possibly William) commenting that this note could 
well be split into two documents: a features overview and a user-guide for 
accessible SVG design.  As I got deeper and deeper into it, and the code 
examples grew longer and longer, I began to agree.

Having read the first three sections fairly carefully and having skimmed 
the remainder, I am now all excited about SVG.  I have been talking-up the 
promise of SVG for some time now, and have been very lucky that people just 
stared at me blankly and didn't ask any questions about it.  I am happy 
that I can now answer some questions if and when they get asked, except of 
course, for the big one: when will it matter?

Regards,
Chuck Letourneau
