JB:: "Any more thoughts on how to improve the organization of info?"

WL: The "organization of info" effectiveness seems too
personal-preference oriented to discuss meaningfully. Whatever you use
(well, almost whatever!) will work better for some people than others.
Both the appearance and the organization *look* just fine. My problems
with the original page didn't ever have to do with those factors but
entirely with the content choices. Once I knew what "policy" meant
(something very different than my usual use of that word) it was OK. I'm
not that hip to the differences among "strategic/tactical" or
"process/whatever" so I can only give a really superficial evaluation of
the organization because to me "news" is a "resource" and stuff like
that. I just don't think it's either particularly meaningful or at all
objectively decidable so far as organization goes. So I'm not much help.
I don't even see the need for internal page jumps on a page this short.
When it gets longer then you'll have the same problems you had with the
original and I think you're always going to have a vertical scroll
requirement - once this page fills up. You're not going to want it to be
*all* links.

I think there may be some problem with your linking, perhaps you've
stylized <A HREF>? On more careful examination not only Amaya 3.2 but
Opera 4.01 fail to make the jumps within/from the site. IE 5 and NS 4.61
work. 

The "quick tips, easy intros, how to's, frequent questions" and
"guidelines, checklists, techniques" lines go to the slightly different
parts of the same (external) document. I don't know if this is confusing
or what, but it makes the point about collecting multiple links on a
line worthy of a lot more thought.

At this time (and I have a geezer's prerogative to change my mind) I
favor every link having not only its own line but a parenthetical
elucidation of what I'm to expect if I select it. That "evaluation and
repair tools, logos, alternative browsers" are all in one heading on
another page might excuse their taking only one line in this document
but boggles the mind as to why they are particularly related where
they're stored! Logos and alternative browsers are strange bedmates to
me.

"Events", "Upcoming Events", "more resources" strike me strange. The
latter seems like "etc." without there being any "so" to be "forthed".

I guess I'd choose to jump to the ToC of the "WAI Resource Library"
rather than including jumps to within that page here. 

I think the Working Groups (and Interest Group) under "Participation"
deserve individual lines and parenthetical clues as to what they do.

Same goes for "About WAI" but since I would almost never look into
that...

This will go on for a while and I hope the above helps.
