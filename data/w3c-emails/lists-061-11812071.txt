JB: I think content choice is worth focusing on in some of our discussion
tomorrow.

>I don't even see the need for internal page jumps on a page this short.

JB: You're browsing visually. On a link-heavy page, someone tabbing through
links via a screen reader may want a way to skip through links to H2's, to
avoid hearing a barrage of many links all the way down the page.

JB: I'm hoping that this is a page format that _won't_ "fill up," but that
instead is a stable outline, pointing to sub-pages that can do the filling
up. What do you think?

JB: I don't get it. I'm making my links the way I always do. Anyone have
any insight here?

JB: The back of my mind is cranking away on yet another design, for the
resource section. But it would involve tables, with an unwrapping feature.
Will see if I can try it before tomorrow's meeting.

JB: That adds yet one more indirection before one arrives at the intended
document; I already have some reservations about the indirection of sending
people to the WAI Resource Library instead of directly to documents as on
the current WAI Interest Group page. However, sending them through the
Resource Library at least gives some possibility that someone will get a
little context about the document before landing there (many people end up
at WCAG 1.0, for instance, without realizing that we produce anything
else), and that they'll notice that a lot of other resources are also
available. But _two_ levels of indirection -- ouch. I think we'd lose people.

JB: Takes up a bunch of space. What about pulling the groups off entirely,
onto an "About WAI" sub-page?

It does. Thanks.
