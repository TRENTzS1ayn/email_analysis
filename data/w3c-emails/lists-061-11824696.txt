JB:: I'm hoping that this is a page format that _won't_ "fill up," but
that instead is a stable outline, pointing to sub-pages that can do the
filling up. What do you think?"

WL: "hold hope in one hand and feces in the other and see which fills up
faster" is an old saying. I *hope* so too! When I was doing the training
thingie I went for an even sparser "front page" so you know that's what
I'd like. Good luck to us all.
