Speaking as perhaps the lone Mac user, I have just a few comments:

1.  In a rare instance of cooperation, both IE 5 and Netscape Communicator 4.7
behaved nearly identically when showing the new WAI pages.  
That's not a complaint.  Really.

2.  >"it is not a fancy redesign..."
YAY!  I think its design is, on the whole, just fine and would urge
you not to do much more to dress it up.   Having said that...
I'm not wild about the light yellow background color or the darker yellow 
boxes behind the headers.  They make me squint and, believe it or not, I find 
that I read much more slowly on pages with bright colors.  
Personally, I prefer white as a background.

3.  Uh... allow me to refute #1:  the bullets appear as solid dots in IE and clear
dots in Netscape.  ??  Checking on a PC, it appears the intention is to
use solid dots, which I prefer.

4.  On the Home page, the "questions about site?" link is a direct mailto link.
Don't forget to include the e-mail address in the text.

5.  I also tested it with Home Page Reader and had no problems.
