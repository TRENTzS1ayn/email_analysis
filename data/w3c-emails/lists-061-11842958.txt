JB: Fascinating. In the browsers I've tried it in, it has a very faint
egg-shell color background -- just enough to take the edge off of the white
-- and then a really dull mustard behind the H2's. Nothing bright about it
at all, except maybe the light green navbar. I'll chase down a Mac and have
a look. Another argument for browser-safe, although I've heard that even
those colors aren't so reliable.

JB: Yes, my intention was solid dots, and I get the hollow ones in NS as
well. Actually I'd like to get away from the darned dots, but I don't want
to start throwing a bunch of images on the page unnecessarily.

JB: In real life, this will probably go to a section of the "About WAI"
page, which will have room to spell out these things.

JB: Thanks!
