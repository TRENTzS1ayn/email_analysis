A. Web Accessibility Initiative
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/WAI-home.html

(first H1 is visually redundant) Tooltip on WAI image includes (WAI),
but does not end with "logo".

WAI abbreviation is missing on this page or that H1 content, which may
already fold, depending on width and fontsize settings. Propose: Add (WAI) 
to end that H1. Or change it:

     "The WAI: the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative"

to get around that redundancy.

B. EVENTS
I agree the original Events, News, History list have grown too long. Some
entries had month/day but not year. Most of the older ones are of marginal
interest to new readers.

http://www.w3.org/WAI/events.html

I think pages always need date of last update -- I prefer it at the top,
not buried at the bottom.

Your chunking:

1. Upcoming Events

2. Press and Document Releases

3. History

2a. Press: I'd have a separate one for Press, and include FAQs on individual
guideline releases there.

2b. Document Releases: with URLs to current version, and dates 2000-08-24
style, most recent first (sort by date).

2c. Other Accessibility Releases: All non-WAI group releases, such as 
accessibility papers on SMIL, SVG, object, CSS2, HTML/XHTML, XML, XMLT, etc.

3a. History of Organization

3b. Face to Face meetings: Again in reverse chronological order.
Since there are about a dozen so far, time to rechunk by WG.

C. WAI Resource Library

Tooltip for Web Accessibility Initiative is different from above, adding
Logo at the end after (WAI):

http://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources/

A heavy page, well chunked. We've done lots and have much to offer.

Possibly FAQs go above as part of Press releases, though useful here too.

Your final "MORE" choice on the first menu is OK, though the Events part
deserves more prominence, Why do we need it here as well as on the
events page? Or is this Calendar of conferences just a pointer to the new
Events page (rather than the current old one.)

-------------
D. WAI Contacts

http://www.w3.org/WAI/contacts.html

Page is fine. Good summary detail, with pointers to individuals and groups.

----
Somewhere the content of "A rapid tour of the WAI-PF neighborhood",
possibly renamed, and not "member only" implied, needs to appear more
directly and early in the WAI path:
