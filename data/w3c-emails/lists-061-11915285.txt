Hello all
I've been away from the computer yesterday so I've just read all the
comments and tried all 3 versions with Danish version of JAWS 3.31 and IE
5.0, 600x800 and 256 colors. I see the background as nearly white, the green
bar is yellow, and there is less contrast than on my own screen with true
colors. There are no problems with the reading of the pages. I'm not happy
with the version ....3.html neither as a sighted user or with JAWS as I have
to listen to all the resource links first, and I don't find it easier to get
an overview of the information on this page. I prefer the version ....4.html
It's shorter and clearer than the first draft.
Are the links in the top necessary on such a short page? I'm not sure if I
understand the meaning of the link "Search" in the top.
My comments on the section,The WAI resource Library:
The line Training materials... should be before evaluation.... I think it's
more logic in that order.
The last line is a mix of things with no relations to one another. We
already have events in the top. Is it necessary to have a link to
alternative browsers? Maybe a link to more resources would be sufficient. I
agree with William one has to know the policy page to understand the
meaning.
It's not the policy of WAI/W3C but legislation from different countries.
There is another page with all the conferences. - I always have problems
finding that page -  I think it's very good for getting information on
what's going on. Should there be a link under other resources? The same goes
for the page on how disabled persons use the web, when that page has been
revised there should be a link next to easy intros.
Why don't the links under the WAI Resource Library link directly to the page
instead of going to different lines on the Resource library
www.w3c.org/WAI/resources page?
I've also looked at http://www.w3.org/WAI/contacts.html and find the first
section WAI TEAM rather confusing maybe you just need to alphabetize after
names , and the WAI Working Groups and Interest Groups Chairs should be
sorted after WG/IG?
I don't have any comments to the Events page I think it looks very good and
easy to understand. The Resource Library is more complex but after a first
glance it's O.K.
Talk to you later today
Kind regards

Subject: WAI HOME PAGE REDRAFT, two new versions

EOWG:

Two more versions to look at, each incorporating different comments and
approaches from today's discussions on the list, and neither one "done" --
e.g. the info and layout on each is re-organized, but many of the links are
unlinked for now.

1. http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/WAI-home.html
This is the original page that I sent out Wednesday night for review.

2. http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/WAI-home4.html
This version incorporates a number of the content-reorganization
suggestions from today, with the exception of Harvey's since I just saw
those late tonight after I'd done this redraft. But we can take his
comments into account tomorrow.

3. http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/WAI-home3.html
This page doesn't yet incorporate the good suggestions for
content-reorganizations from today, however I'd be interested in your
reactions to the layout experiment (and obviously none of the resources are
linked yet, but they would be if this layout seems worth pursuing).

- Judy

>EOWG:

>Please review this redraft of the WAI Home Page -- and please read this
before commenting.
>
>- the purpose of this redraft is to reorganize and clean up the current
home page;
>- it is not a fancy redesign -- we will do more on another round;
>- there are still some style sheet bugs, and it needs to be tested in
multiple browsers;
>- it breaks information out into several new sub-pages, which also should
be reviewed;
>- while the sub-pages are at their proper URI's, the redraft of the home
page is_not_ in its eventual home, so you'll need your "go back" command to
get back to it from any sub-pages, until it is at its own URL (next week,
if this is accepted as an improvement over the current home page);
>- some info is missing, and some links not yet active, as you will see
(e.g. the "how to participate" or "how to get involved" page is not yet in
place).
>
>Questions for review:
>- is the organization of info better?
>- are the navigation options clear?
>- are there key pieces of info you can't easily find?
>- does it work well on various assistive technologies?
>- does it display well in GUI browsers?
>- is it an improvement over the current WAI home page (this should not be
a great challenge...)?
>- other?
