August 15,2000  The Net's Rising Stars

25 Shapers of the Net Whom You May Not Have Heard of - Yet

Last but not least among our class of 25 stars is Judy Brewer, who is
working to make sure users with disabilities aren't left behind as the
Internet transforms society. Brewer, formerly director of the Massachusetts
Assistive Technology Partnership, directs the World Wide Web Consortium's
Web Accessibility Initiative, which works to ensure that Web services and
new Web technologies are created in ways that take into account the needs of
people with disabilities - who often don't, or can't, use Internet software
and services the same way the majority of Web users do.
