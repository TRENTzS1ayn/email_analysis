During the call, I was using Netscape 6, Build 2 to view the different pages
we were discussing.
There doesn't seem to be any difference between the way the pages are
rendered by IE 5 and N6, with one exception (and this is hopefully just an
operator error): I can't figure out how to navigate in N6 with the Tab key
and the Enter key! Is it me? Or is it N6?
