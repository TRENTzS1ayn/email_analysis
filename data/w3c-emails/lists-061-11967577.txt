help hearing somebody say it looked blurry. Don't know why, but it does not
work in all browsers. Dared to attach the file to the mail because it is so
small. Please note that when you zoom into the file, the box does not
become larger like when zooming into a jpg image. Thus users can loose
overview over the image. Does somebody know if this is at all possible?

occur in most Netscape versions.
