Dear w3.org,
I'd like to know if it would be possible to have my site reviewed by 
the w3.org.   I'd be interested in any suggestions you may have on 
how to improve my site.    First a little background.   5 years ago I 
built my site with 14 topics, and it has now grown to over 800 links 
in those 14 topics.   Every month I have kept the links up-to-date, 
so there is never a dead link.   I've even added a search engine and 
guestbook for people to signup.   Unlike many pages on the web, this 
site works on all web browsers.   I have aimed for content over form, 
while maintaining a form that is easy to view within any web browser. 
I don't have the funding to become even an affiliate member, as this 
whole site has been done out my own pocket.    I have no sponsors as 
of present.    My dilemma is to find sponsorship that does not 
require cookies or javascript be added to my page that doesn't work 
on some web browsers.    With only about 100 hits a day, I feel my 
site could reach a lot broader audience than it currently does 
because of its usefulness as an internet jumpstation.

Please let me know what you think.  Here is the site:

Thank you.
Sincerely,
abrody@smart.net
