I showed the  different drafts to the blind persons I normally work with in
matters of accessibility to the web, both really experts in the area.
Their comments were: to many links and text on the page, they would prefer
if there only were links to the underlying pages:
News, Resources, Participation, About WAI, Search with just a short
explanation about each of this pages telling what kind of information you
will find there. I think William was in favor of this kind of page on our
meeting last Friday. personally I also prefer pages with fewer links. The
latest draft has more than 60 links and it's very difficult to keep track of
what you're looking for and even harder if you have to keep track with 
a screen-reader and speech or Braille display. I think the present WAI home
page has 57 links. It would be very good if we could reduce the number of
links to e.g. 25. I once read in a book on user friendly web design that a
page should not have more than 10 links ( this may be outdated) but I still
think it's a good design rule.
