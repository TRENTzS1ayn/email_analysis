Hi Nancy... my responses are preceded with "CPL::"

CPL:: I think I know what you are describing,  but I don't know why it
happens.  I have seen this PPP (pretty puzzling problem) occur in Internet
Explorer 4.01, and now you have reported it in IE5.  For some reason IE has
a screen refresh problem in conjunction with my external style sheet (I
don't know if it has a problem with anybody else's yet... let me know!).
It is almost as if the content html and the external style sheet don't
synchronize after a scroll event (and I believe it only happens on-line -
not running off a hard disk -- so maybe it is a bandwidth problem?).  I
have just gotten into the habit using Page Up/Down instead of scrolling
line by line, then I hit the F5-key (refresh) or the Reload Page icon in IE
when the page gets messed up.  IE has the good grace to reload/refresh the
page at the current location (rather than starting at the top of the page)
so the picture "magically" clears for me and I can continue reading.  Let
me know if this works for you.  As for the cause of the problem... if
anybody from Microsoft is reading this,  we would be happy to hear a
solution (or at least an explanation).

CPL:: Thanks Nancy... I don't think I said anywhere that this was meant to
teach basic HTML.  Perhaps I should add a note to that effect in the
introduction, just to ensure that people don't get the wrong idea.  The
curriculum is really aimed at people who have some knowledge of HTML who
want to understand how to use HTML accessibly.  And,  yes, some parts are
still weak.  I am still hoping that experts in those areas will volunteer
some better examples.

CPL:: I agree that it is a "big" effort to plow through the entire
curriculum, but I would hope that, in "real life", users bite off pieces
they can chew, and work at their own pace.  If your instructor (Kynn) is
such a slave driver <grin> that he is making you try do it in one
afternoon... send him down to the office here and I'll have a talk with him
<bigger grin>.

CPL:: And Geoff and I appreciate your taking the time to comment.
