The need for this kind of information in developing business cases in industry
is critical.  If I go to upper management and say, we need to make this web site
or web application accessible, they want to know how many people with
disabilities will use the site.  They also want a cost benefit analysis to
compare the cost of making a site accessible to the benefits we would
experience.  I bring out the point that there are legal issues, rework costs,
loss of customers, ADA compliance issues, need to support other means for
customer to contact us, etc., that also constitue real costs, but they still wnt
to know how many users there are who need accessibility, and what would kind of
customers they would be if the site were accessible (there is a myth that people
with disabilities don't buy services at a rate that would offset the cost of
making the site accessible, or don't making the purchasing decisions in their
households.)  We need some firmer numbers to support a business case, for
example:
how many potential web customers do we have who use accessibility devices or
enhancements,
what kind of customer are they (do they buy our enhanced services),
will they use a web site to do business or would they rather use the telephone.
I have made the case that making web sites accessible doesn't cost much if done
initially, and that users without disabilities don't even have to know about it,
and it doesn't mean boring low-tech pages, but they really don't believe it!
Since we serve essentially the entire public as our customers, the numbers for
my business case should be available but they aren't!
