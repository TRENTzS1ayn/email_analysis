[DJW:]  The basis for this is mainly that the worked
example is a technical diagram and mention of animation
is little and late.  If the worked example had been how
to make a more accessible version of something like
http://www.bt.com/surftime/, preferably one that worked
with current versions of Lynx (I guess the only way is
with content negotiation).  (Note the frames use in this
example is a hack, and some of the pages are best viewed
with colours disabled!  As far as I can see, the Flash
conveys no information.)

[DJW:]  On the other hand people need to anticipate the
misuses, and see if there is anything that will avoid
them.  Note my first introduction to a draft of this paper
was as a counter to a previous statement of this thesis,
so I treated the document as covering the majority case
as well as the minority one.  I.E. as it was used to
counter my position, I think it reasonable to use my
position to counter it.


[DJW:]  I'm running out of time here, but
one of the points I think I deleted was 
what's different between SVG and Flash.
As I see it, the differences are that you 
can construct complete navigation pages in
it, that it is sanctioned by W3C, and that
it might be fully integrated with future 
browsers (although I sense that the developers
only have one toe in the water at present).
