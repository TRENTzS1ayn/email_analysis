EOWG:

Here are more WAI home page redrafts, for discussion at our Sept 1 meeting:

Three different versions of WAI home page:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/WAI-home7
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/WAI-home8
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/WAI-home9

And the following sub-pages, some new, some revised, which you should
encounter while following links from the home page:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/events
http://www.w3.org/WAI/about
http://www.w3.org/WAI/contacts
http://www.w3.org/WAI/participation
http://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources/

I have incorporated most, but not every, comment received; and the pages
still need more editing.

Comments welcome, to w3c-wai-eo@w3.org and in our EOWG meeting shortly.

- Judy
