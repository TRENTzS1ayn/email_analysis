All Three:
"Headlines" on main page seem "jarring" - what criterion put these
particular items there? Should any be there?

#7 & #9 The separate resources cell with links makes acceptable use of
otherwise little used real estate. Since this section is likely the
"meat" of what viewers seek, it might save a click here and there.
However, if one wants to know to what she's jumping this is less
informative than the more general links with extensive explanations seen
on the left on all three pages.

#8 The links mixed in with the explanations seem to sort of defeat the
purpose of indirect links with explanations?

"participation" page:
opening paragraph should include individuals - as it is it sounds like
it's only for organizations.
Add parenthetical explanation for ATAG like the one for UA?

"news" page:
Is there process for inclusion of stuff in "upcoming events" e.g. PF *
ER F2Fs in D.C.?

"Search":
Might consider limiting search to WAI or have separate entry field (or
return link) for W3C search?

I fixed the links on http://dicomp.pair.com/wai.htm
