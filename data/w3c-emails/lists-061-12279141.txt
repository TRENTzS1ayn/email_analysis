Due to server problems I've only glanced at the 3 new drafts and  I prefer
no. 8:  www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/WAI-home8
Regarding news I came to think about when is news news. If I visit a site
every day the news items from yesterday are old news if I only visit a site
every 6 month news from May might be interesting. Has W3C a policy for how
long their news items are presented as news on their home pages?
