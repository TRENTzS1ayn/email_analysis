No W3C-wide policy, no. Generally, WAI home page would rotate off a news
item when the next one comes on. WAI's Sec. 508 comments turns out to still
be of current interest, however; we are getting two or more press inquiries
about it per week. That would change once the final rule is available from
the US Access Board.
