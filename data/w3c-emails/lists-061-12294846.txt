I like the simplicity in the structure and the shortness of the page. I can
quickly get the information from the page and then go on to the parts I'm
interested in. I don't have to read through a long information heavy page
and then decide where to go for the part I want to know about.

Regards
Helle

No W3C-wide policy, no. Generally, WAI home page would rotate off a news
item when the next one comes on. WAI's Sec. 508 comments turns out to still
be of current interest, however; we are getting two or more press inquiries
about it per week. That would change once the final rule is available from
the US Access Board.
