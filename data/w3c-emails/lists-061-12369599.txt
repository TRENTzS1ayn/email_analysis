There used to be a list at:

      http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/EO-Events.htm

...which listed upcoming conferences.  (It was linked to from
http://www.awarecenter.org/community/)  This doesn't seem to be
a valid URL anymore, and there's no redirect.  Can someone tell
me where the current list can be found?

Thanks!
