Why it is important:

Browsers which do not render frames as separate panes of the same window
often render the noframes content, and expose links to each of the frames
linked from a frameset. The title, if it is present, often forms the link
text, and is more suitable than either the name or the src attribute (the
two things which are required) for providing human-comprehensible
information.

  It's much easier for people to do things if they can see
  the reasons why -- current guideline versions don't fully
  explain the "why" for each checkpoint, and so some things
  don't seem to make very much sense.
