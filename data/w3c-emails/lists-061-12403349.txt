Today (in the UK) RNIB launched a new report entitled: "Get the
online message: making Internet shopping accessible to blind
and partially sighted people".

A detailed press realease and the excutive summary may be
read online at
http://www.rnib.org.uk/whatsnew/pressrel/aug2000/webshop.htm

The purpose of the report is to:
- raise awareness of the importance of 'good' Web design for
the benefit of people who use the Web with assistive technology
- flag up the Disability Discrimination Act and the possibility that
companies who fail to produce accessible sites may be
breaking the law
- make e-business aware of the value of the 'disabled pound', ie
ignoring blind and disabled customers is not only unlawful, but
companies are missing a large customer group

RNIB assessed the accessibility of 17 major UK shopping and
banking sites using 5 fundamental accessibility criteria (see
URL above).  

No company passed all 5 tests, some passed none at all.  
RNIB's message is that accessible design is straight-forward
and of massive benefit to blind and partially sighted people who
wish to shop online from home.

If you would like a copy of the report, please send me an email,
listing your address, the number of copies you require and the
format you would like to receive the report in (print, email, tape,
braille).

Please circulate this information wherever you feel the message
needs to be heard.  The report will be sent to 1000 UK Web
design agencies tomorrow.

Best wishes
