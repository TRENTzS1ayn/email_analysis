I have posted a "Guide to the Guidelines" at http://rdf.pair.com/guide.htm 
and although it's a preliminary work-in-progress the links work and I'd 
like any feedback on how you feel about its utility as a tool to help in 
the process of making the guidelines more accessible (lower-case accessible 
<g>)?
