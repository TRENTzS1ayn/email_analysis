In the Scope part of the EO Charter, in the first bullet it says one of
our functions is "to advise on user-friendly presentation of other
groups' work."  As a human factors and HCI professional, my feeling is
that the term "user-friendly" is hackneyed and often misunderstood.  I
suggest changing this to "to advise on presentation of other groups' to
assure that their web sites are both accessible to and usable by people
with disabilities".  Accessible comes first (a necessary prerequisite),
but doesn't insure usability by any means.  Usability is important to
all groups and is independant of accessibility - but, there may be
different requirements to make an interface usable by people using any
assistive technology.
