William,
I bookmarked your page (http://rdf.pair.com/guide.htm) and all that
shows up in my bookmark is "guide" - that doesn't help me when I am
searching through my bookmarks for a site on web accessibility.  Could
you please change the title to something like "Guide to making web pages
accessible" or "Web Accessibility Guide"?  Then, when I search my
bookmarks I know what it is...
Thanks,
Lila
