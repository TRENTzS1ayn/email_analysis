A funny thing happened on my way to the Website. I decided to put in some 
graphics because Jonathan thought it might help and others said it would 
look better. I always thought that was just short of nonsensical. So I put 
in some (supposedly appropriate) icon-like graphics and *ta-da* it not only 
looked different, it sort of looked better. Then I thought they'd probably 
be more useful if they were links. So I made them go places.

Now the "Guideline Guide" has over 20 links. Although many of them are to 
the WCAG 1.0 and other WAI documents, several are to outside sources I've 
found useful in this area. I could use lots more - it's kind of nice to 
have resources pre-located and all in one place IMHO. I'd like some 
feedback from some on the lists who try the site at 
http://rdf.pair.com/guide.htm with the idea that it can be sort of like a 
"concordance" for WCAG.
