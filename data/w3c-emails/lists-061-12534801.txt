WL: I've been wondering about this since these "Recommendations" started 
catching my attention. I gather that there's some absurd bureaucratic 
"process" reason for it but it's gotten completely ridiculous. It would be 
nice if the boiler plate were stored in some bit bucket and referenced by 
anyone who became too happy with nice clean pages! The W3C can do it, 
witness the uncluttered piece at 
http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/DeviceIndependent.html and even the busier 
but refreshing one (oldie but goodie) at http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/ - now 
can't we have something like that?
