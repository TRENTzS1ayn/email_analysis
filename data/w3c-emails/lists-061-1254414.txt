I am a member of Kynn Bartlett's online course in web accessibility.  He has 
asked us to comment on the WCAG Curriculum as an optional assignment. 

All the slide sets were most helpful and informative.  There is a design 
discrepancy between the screen view in AOL and Netscape.  The Netscape view 
lays out as I think you intend it, while the AOL view the boxes at the top of 
the example pages expands to include the first line of the text (in other 
words the Priority 3 which is in a box alone in Netscape is not boxed by 
itself in AOL).

This same problem occurred on several pages in Examples for guideline 1.  (I 
have not gone through all the example slides but all the ones I did go 
through had the boxed text problem and some had other problems with lining up 
such as 1.1a example where divider/horizontal lines are through the text and 
other graphics in this section, although looking similar in both AOL and 
Netscape, are not lined up with the text in AOL.  In addition on example 1.1d 
the balloon in AOL is a continuous loop and keeps repeating while in Netscape 
the balloon bursts once and stops.

While this seems minor, it does make it difficult to read the second line of 
the text.  I have my AOL browser set at default.  I am using AOL 4.0, am on a 
MAC OS 8.5.1.  My Netscape is Communicator 4.5.

I read with interest on the w3c-wai-ig list the discussion about title and 
ABBR and ACRONYM and when to use.  It did clarify your thinking about this 
one time use of these tags.  As a legal secretary, I would agree that it is 
cumbersome to have to write out the full expansion each time and that the 
common usage of the first time is the intuitive way and the one which most 
would use.

Again, I am sure these are minor problems,  but hope my comments are helpful.
