Hello all,
In France there is at the moment a public debate on the use of electronic 
signature. I try to gather information on that topic and to test it with 
different e-mail software.
Could anyone tell me what are their experience on that topic and if they 
know of accessibility problems with this new technology?
Thank you in advance
Regards
Sylvie
