Hi Sylvie,

I have come across digitally signed things from time to time using text-based
systems such as pine or lynx without any digital signature software. If
something requires confirmation of a signature, or requires a signature, then
I would need a way of making it, but so long as the software is made properly
there is no reason for it not to be accessible  that I know of.

cheers

  Hello all,
  In France there is at the moment a public debate on the use of electronic 
  signature. I try to gather information on that topic and to test it with 
  different e-mail software.
  Could anyone tell me what are their experience on that topic and if they 
  know of accessibility problems with this new technology?
  Thank you in advance
  Regards
  Sylvie
