Following the action item for looking at "xml in ten points" and write
something similar - the why of the WIA. It might be a bit too informal, but
a possible starting point 

The web accessibility guidelines exists because:

Not all output devices are the same

A screen reader will not read pictorial content, neither will an internet
cell-phone.

Not all input devices are the same

Keypads, keyboards, mouse, viva la difference 

Not all systems are the same

And I'm not just talking about Netscape and Microsoft

Not all people are the same

Some folks are learning disables, some are visually challenged, You
probably have a few friends who are color impaired, some are sensitive to
flashing screens;

But all this does not have to be a problem

Because we are working to make the web, all the information, and all the
fun, accessible to all.
