I can't recall how long it is since I sent an update.

I gave a presentation on accessibility at Monash University, and another
(essentially the same) at RMIT university - in each case to audiences who
were primarily staff involved in web development or teaching it.

I attended a meeting of a Melbourne accessibility group, with a presentation
of the Deaf Australia Online projects - interesting. Essentially they are
asking for significant multimedia content, including signed "captions", where
possible (or where you want the audience to be interested...)

I attended the W3C/WAP multimodal workshop in Hong Kong. Among other things
they are looking for use cases for multimodal devices (for example phones
that can handle graphics, text, or speech in/out).

cheers
