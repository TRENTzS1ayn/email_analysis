The periods after some of the links can't be suppressed even with a 
punctuation setting of none.  Unless they are helpful for visual layout why 
not use a graphic with a blank alt tag?

I'm not sure what the unwrap table option is supposed to do.  I could 
detect no difference in the page after following the link.

The date displayed has some dollar signs in it that are probably not 
supposed to be there.
