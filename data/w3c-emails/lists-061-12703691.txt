The dollar signs are there so our system magically puts in the last modified

  The periods after some of the links can't be suppressed even with a 
  punctuation setting of none.  Unless they are helpful for visual layout why 
  not use a graphic with a blank alt tag?
  
  I'm not sure what the unwrap table option is supposed to do.  I could 
  detect no difference in the page after following the link.
  
  The date displayed has some dollar signs in it that are probably not 
  supposed to be there.
