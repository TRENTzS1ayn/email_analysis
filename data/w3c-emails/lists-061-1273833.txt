Gayley,

Thank you for taking the time to review the curriculum, and for your
comments.  I don't subscribe to AOL, nor do I have a copy of that browser,
so if you or anyone else can tell me precisely on what bit of CSS or HTML
the AOL browser chokes, I would be very appreciative.  Even better would be
a suggestion on how to fix the problem.  (Even better than that would be a
fix that doesn't cause problems for other browsers in turn... but I won't
get my hopes up.)

About the balloon animation... I haven't been able to figure that one out
yet.  You are not the first person to report on Netscape's cycle-once
habit, but on my system, with Netscape 4.04, the balloon just keeps going,
and going...  

The ABBR / ACRONYM topic has generated a lot of discussion in various WAI
working groups.  It looks like the Web Content, Authoring Tool, User Agent,
Coordination and possibly even the Protocol and Formats Working Groups are
getting involved now.  

Cheers!
Chuck Letourneau
