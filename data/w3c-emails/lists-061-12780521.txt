I would like you to update the reference to our TEDIS (Technological
Enabling for Disabled and Older People) Research Group within GMD.
Right now TEDIS is mentioned, but strangely, it points to an old page
talking us in the old Yuri Rubinski Foundation website. The URL is: 
http://access.gmd.de/

I would like you also to include a link to:
* DISTEC: Distribution List about Assistive Techhnologies, for Spain
and Latin America (in Spanish).

Thanks,
Carlos
