The following two comments are from a friend who uses a braille 
reader and Netscape.


(1)     When I click the [unwrap table] button, all that apparently happens
is that a statement is added below the menu bar, which reads:

      _________________________________________________________________
    Summary: Layout table can be unwrapped for screen reader access. The
    first part contains news, 'about WAI', participation information, and
    a search form. The second part lists WAI resources.
      _________________________________________________________________


     Since the bar itself says:

      _________________________________________________________________
    News ? About WAI ? Participation ? Resources ? Search ? [unwrap table]
      _________________________________________________________________

I confess, I don't get the point, except that this could presumably
contain some expanded information when necessary.



(2) By the way, I don't know how the menu bar appears in print, but
in braille, the header separators look like numeral 7's (%B7); NOT TOO
SPIFFY! -- What's wrong with standard ASCII | (pipe, %7C)? It's perfectly
clear and "THE SAME" for any application.  Before we start using extended
codes for general use, I think we better "standardize" the interpretation
-- if that's not a contradiction in terminology.
