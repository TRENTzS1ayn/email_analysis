Hello,
 
My company is currently working on creating a web site that deals with
on-line registration. We have been doing extensive testing along the way to
make sure that the site is ADA compliant. While the site is Bobby Priority
Level 1 approved, we would still like more clarification on the use of
tables for layout purposes. Will the extensive use of tables (for layout)
cause any problems down the road as ADA Standards change? We would like to
address this issue in the earlier stages of the development process.
 
In addition to Bobby, we have been testing this particular web site using
Jaws and Lynx.  So far, everything seems to be working correctly. Is there a
place where we could send our web sites to be tested/reviewed by visually
impaired people? If such an organization exists, would you please let us
know.
 
Thank you,
 
Tanya
