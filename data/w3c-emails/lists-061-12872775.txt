Thanks again for this, William

>"Choose a background that is a single, solid colour." poses a
problem for me in that I believe the emphasis should be on
absolute separation of content/structure from presentation and
this set of guidelines is dealing with presentation - which should
ideally be entirely under the control/approval of the user. <

We agree entirely on that point.

However, this must be assuming that the end user knows how to
alter their browser settings (in order to over-rule an unreadable
colour scheme). In our experience, the majority of partially
sighted people do not have this knowledge.

For this reason, our factsheet is a combination of WAI and RNIB
clear print guidance.

Perhaps we need a separate factsheet for partially sighted
people on how to get the most from their browser?

What do others think?
Best wishes
Julie Howell, RNIB
