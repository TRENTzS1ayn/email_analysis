Hi
Looking good!  I'm concerned, though, about the use of purple on yellow
in the side text box for those with color sensitivity.  The contrast of
light and dark is visually okay, but there are some viewers whose visual
sensitivity to purple and yellow causes seizures.  Maybe a pale green or
pale blue would be better than the yellow.

Best regards,
Aimee Dixon
