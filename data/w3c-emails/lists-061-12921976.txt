I came across this while searching for information and it looks kind 
of interesting.

It is the Canadian National E-Learning Workshop which will be held in 
Toronto (if it has already been posted I apologize for the repeat).

The URL is:
http://www.canarie.ca/initiatives/start.html

The interesting bit is: [presenter]

Karen Taylor, Project Coordinator for CNIB, CNIB Library for the 
Blind "Creating Barrier-Free Broadband Learning Environments" 

Anyone presenting or attending at this workshop?

Gretchen
