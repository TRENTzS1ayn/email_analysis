EOWG Meeting Reminder

Friday June 25 1999

8:30 - 10:00 a.m. US Eastern Time

1 617 252 1038

Preliminary Agenda:

1. Outreach updates

2. Quick Tips update/reprint
- we've distributed about 20,000 already, and need to get more printed.
- any edits that really ought to be made?
- check out current text at http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/QuickTips

3. Review of WAI site
- right now it's hard to find information. What would help in the short
term, short of a full-fledged design review, which we should do eventually? 
- how to make make the resources more obvious?

4. Meeting schedule
- what about rotating our meeting time, or adding a later session once a
month, so that a few more people from the US West Coast can participate?
(not everyone can get up at 5:30 a.m. like William does...)

5. Other materials for review -- watch the list for more in-depth agenda

- Judy
