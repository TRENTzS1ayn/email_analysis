How about using the Internet to research the some issues regarding
"The Handicapped and the Digital Divide".  See if you can find any
statistics regarding the % of the US population with various handicaps and
other data on the % of persons with handicaps who are using computers and/or
the Internet.  If you happen to find any regular data series with measures
such as I suggest, then a template could be developed to generate new
reports with charts and tables for each period new data becomes available.

At the least you should be able to find data on the percentages of persons
with various handicaps.  You could use that data to calculate summary
tables, tables with % shares, and charts of % shares.
