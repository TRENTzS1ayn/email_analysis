Judy,
Sorry I missed this morning's meeting. I have injured my back and I am
taking all kinds of meds which make me groggy and not able to drive - so
I didn't get here til someone could bring me this morning.  I am
attending the WHite House Forum:Technologies for Successful Aging next
week, so probably won't get on the call next week either (if there is
one).
I have not been very successful at identifying more sites that have
national standards - the ones on William Loughborough's new site seem to
cover it.
Sorry I missed...
Lila
