-------------------------
Quick tips to make accessible Web sites
FOR COMPLETE GUIDELINES & CHECKLIST: WWW.W3.ORG/WAI 
- Images & animations. Use the alt attribute to describe the function of
all visuals. 
- Image maps. Use client-side MAP and text for hotspots. 
- Multimedia. Provide captioning and transcripts of audio, descriptions of
video, and accessible versions in case inaccessible formats are used. 
- Hypertext links. Use text that makes sense when read out of context. For
instance, do not use "click here." 
- Page organization. Use headings, lists, and consistent structure. Use CSS
for layout and style where possible. 
- Graphs & charts. Summarize or use the longdesc attribute. 
- Scripts, applets, & plug-ins. Provide alternative content in case active
features are inaccessible or unsupported. 
- Frames. Label with the title or name attribute. 
- Tables. Make line by line reading sensible. Summarize. Avoid using tables
for column layout. 
- Check your work. Validate the HTML. Use evaluation tools and text-only
browsers to verify accessibility. 
-------------------------

5. Review of WAI site
- right now it's hard to find information. What would help in the short
term, short of a full-fledged design review, which we should do eventually?
What would work as part of a full-fledged design review?
- how to make make the resources more obvious?
- how to make participation in the project clearer?
- how important (or how fast) to make it snazzier, more of a
third-generation site, make the top page a non-scrolling gateway to WAI
resources and activities without trying to pile everything on the front page?
Please particularly review:

6. Draft of message for "gallery" request
- we are giving this item a more urgent status on the priority list. The
idea would be to get at least an initial set of accessible design examples
up for people's reference, to be supplemented later by stable demonstration
tutorials.
- do we have enough reviewers?
- [DRAFT MESSAGE TO WAI IG] The EOWG would like to assemble a diverse
"gallery" of Web sites that are Double-A compliant with WCAG 1.0 and which
demonstrate different kinds of site design and subject matter. These sites
should be relatively stable in terms of design. If you believe you have, or
know of such a site, please send e-mail to <wai-review@w3.org>[??] and
include the URI of the site, and any information regarding the potential
stability of the site. If reviewers agree that the site is a good example
of Double-AA WCAG 1.0 conformance, we may select that site and contact the
site's Web master to request permission to include the site in the WAI WCAG
Gallery. [END OF DRAFT]
- [DRAFT OF INTRO & DISCLAIMER FOR GALLERY] Accessible design works across
all subject matter and types of sites. The following sites provide some
examples of active Web sites that are conformant with Double-A level
(priorities one and two) of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0.
The sites on this reference list have been selected to demonstrate diverse
design styles and subject matter. The sites were considered accessible by
reviewers as of the date indicated next to the URI for the site. All sites
listed are with permission from the sites' Webmasters. More information
about the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines is available at <....> [END
OF DRAFT]

7. Meeting schedule
- what about rotating our meeting time, or adding a later session once a
month, so that a few more people from the US West Coast can participate?
