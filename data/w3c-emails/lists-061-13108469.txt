A man goes to the doctor and says, "Doctor, I've got this problem you 
see, only you've got to promise not to laugh. The doctor replies, "Of 
course I won't laugh, that would be thoroughly unprofessional. In over 
twenty years of being a doctor, I've never laughed at a patient." 

"OK then," says the man, and he drops his trousers. 

The doctor is greeted by the sight of the tiniest penis he has ever seen 
in his life. Unable to control himself, he falls to the floor laughing. 
Ten minutes later he is able to struggle up to his feet and wipe the 
tears from his eyes. "I'm so sorry," he says to the patient .... "I 
don't know what came over me, I won't let it happen again. Now what 
seems to be the problem?" 

The man looks up at the doctor sadly and says, "It's swollen."
