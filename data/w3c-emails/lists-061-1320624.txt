I find it incredible that in our call for "fancy", "snazzy", "whiz-bang"
sites that were at least Bobby-acceptable we never had trumpeted to us
the work available at:
http://www.microsoft.com/typography/web/embedding/ where at least one
http://www.microsoft.com/typography/web/embedding/demos/9/demo9.htm
example clearly fills the bill.  Maybe even all of them.

If MicroSoft were to have an in-house competition to meet our needs
there would probably be dozens forthcoming.
