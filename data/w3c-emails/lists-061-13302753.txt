A villager and his son went to town and were at a supermarket. They were 
amazed by everything they saw, especially by two shiny, silver walls 
that could move apart and back together again. 

The boy asked his father: "What is this?" 

The father responded: "Son, I have never seen anything like this in my 
life. I don't know what it is!" 

While the boy and his father were watching wide-eyed, an old lady rolled 
up to the moving walls and pressed a button. The walls opened and the 
lady rolled in between them into a small room. The walls closed and the 
boy and his father watched small circles of lights with numbers above 
the walls light up. They continued to watch 10 circles light up in the 
reverse direction. The walls opened up again and a voluptuous 
24-year-old woman stepped out. 

The father said to his son: "Come son, let's go back to the village and 
get your mother!"
