Section 2:
"These limitations can include injury-related and aging-related conditions,
and can be temporary or chronic."
Question: Is chronic the same as permanent?

Examples of barriers that people with blindness may encounter on the Web
include:
Add: Animated text or images that interfere with screen-readers.

Hard of hearing:
Add: the inability to turn off embedded music or other sounds that could
interfere with captioned audio.
