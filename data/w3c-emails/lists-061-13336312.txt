Three desperately ill men met with their doctor one day to discuss their 
options. One was an alcoholic, one was a chain smoker and the other was 
a homosexual. 

The doctor, addressing all three of them, said, "If any of you indulge 
in your vices one more time, you will surely die." 

The men left the doctor's office, each convinced that he would never 
again indulge himself in his vice. 

While walking toward the subway for their return trip to the suburbs, 
they passed a bar. 

The alcoholic, hearing the loud music and seeing the lights, could not 
stop himself. 

His buddies accompanied him into the bar, where he had a shot of 
whiskey. 

No sooner had he replaced the shot glass on the bar, he fell off his 
stool, stone cold dead. 

His companions, somewhat shaken, left the bar, realizing how seriously 
they must take the doctor's words. 

As they walked along, they came upon a cigarette butt lying on the 
ground, still burning. 

The homosexual looked at the chain smoker and said, "If you bend over to 
pick that up, we're both dead."
