The curriculum slides look great.

I have couple of suggestions (I hope it is not too late already).

- It would help navigation to have a link to the current checkpoint and
guideline also from the beginning of the slide (e.g. when you are in an
example for 4.1). It could be simply a link from the number 4.1 (The 4
would point to guideline 4 and 1 to checkpoint 4.1). This would take some
time for users to figure out. Maybe something like GL 4/CP 1 would be
better or something like the following:

Guideline
5. Create ... that transform gracefully

Checkpoints for
"start link" 5. Create ... "end link"

Example for
"start link" 5.2 - For data tables that have two or more logical levels of
row or column headers, use markup to associate data cells and header cells.
"end link"

This is still not perfect as it is difficult to get the link to guideline
to fit nicely but this is the idea.

I also thought of putting the previous titles at the beginning of the page
with small font. However, it is kind of nice having a big title Guideline,
Checkpoint or Example right at the beginning.

I actually wanted to test these a bit and that is why they are late but I
just did not have the time for it.

- At the bottom of the page is "Next slide: Checkpoint 4.2" but that does
not give much more information. Is it supposed to be a link? Couldn't it be
a similar arrow navigation as at the beginning of the page so there is no
need to go to top of the page when you only want to continue forward?

- slide 44, it would be great to have an audio link that actually reads the
table to the user

- some other things were already commented
