A man visits his doctor.

"I think I have a problem, doc," said the patient. "One of my balls has 
turned blue."

The doctor examined the man briefly and concluded the patient would die 
if they didn't have his testicle removed.

"Are you crazy?!" exclaimed the patient, "How could I let you do such a 
thing to me?"

"Do you want to die?", asked the doctor rhetorically, and the patient 
had to agree to have his testicle removed. But two weeks after the 
operation, he came back.

"Doc, I don't know how to say this, but the other ball has turned blue 
too."

Again, the doctor told him that if he wants to live, his other testicle 
must be cut off too. And again, the man was very reluctant. "Hey, do you 
want to die?", asked the doc, and the patient had to agree to the 
operation.

But, about two weeks after he is testicleless, he returned to the 
doctor. "I think something is very wrong with me. My penis is now 
completely blue."

After briefly examining the patient once again, the doc gives him the 
bad news. If he wants to live, his penis has to go.

Of course, he did not want to hear about it. "You really want to die?", 
asked the doctor.

"But... how do I pee?"

"We'll install an plastic pipe, and there will be no problem."

So, the penis is removed and a while after the operation, the 
unfortunate man again returns the doctor's office. He is very angry.

"Doctor, the plastic pipe turned blue."

"What?"

"Can you tell me what a hell is happening?"

So, the doctor examined the patient more carefully this time, and says, 
"Hmmmm, I think its the jeans......"
