You know, the WAI home page doesn't have any pictures of people with
disabilities, any WAI staff, or even a computer.

If an outside design agency were creating the site -- say, if Idyll
Mountain Internet's services were engaged -- there would probably be
some sort of pictures to illustrate why this work is important.  At
the WCAG meeting, I made the point that with all the talk of 
guidelines, working groups, HTML trivia, XML implementations, and
so forth, it is very easy to lose track of the HUMAN ELEMENT.  This
is not a technological project, this is a social project.

Thus, some pictures of people on the WAI site would be useful.

PS:  I know that the AWARE Center site doesn't have pictures of
     people either. :)
