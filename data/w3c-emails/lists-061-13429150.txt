>The Honorable William J. Clinton
>President of the United States
>1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.
>Washington, DC  20500

>Dear Mr. President,
>
>As the Presidents of a number of America's leading research universities,
>we are writing to express our support for your efforts to make information
>and communications technologies more accessible for people with
>disabilities, and to describe what our universities are prepared to do to
>support this objective.
>
>This is an important goal.  If we design information and communications
>technologies so that they are accessible, people with disabilities will
>find it much easier to live, learn and work as we enter the Information
>Age.  If we fail to do this, people with disabilities could become
>increasingly isolated from the economic and social mainstream.
>
>As universities with strong programs in engineering and computer science,
>we believe that we can make a significant contribution to this national
>goal.  We educate the next generation of IT professionals and
>entrepreneurs, and provide continuing education for IT experts that are
>already in the workforce.  Our faculty conducts the long-term research that
>often shapes and influences future developments in the information and
>communications industry, and which could lead to breakthroughs in
>accessibility.  Each of our universities has unique assets that we can
>bring to bear on this problem, but we are all committed to taking concrete
>steps in this area.  We will work to:
>
>+      Make "universal design" and accessibility part of the education that
>we provide to computer scientists and engineers at all levels --
>undergraduate, graduate and continuing education;
>
>+      Ensure that our Web sites and on-line resources are accessible to
>people with disabilities;
>
>+      Look for ways to increase support for research to improve the
>state-of-the-art in this area by seeking federal, state, private sector and
>foundation funding -- and providing internal "seed funding" to new or
>existing faculty that wish to pursue this as a research topic;
>
>+      Contribute to efforts by the federal government to develop a
>comprehensive research agenda in this area;
>
>+      Help train experts who can serve as a national resource on this
>issue by participating in standards-setting efforts that incorporate
>accessibility, evaluating the accessibility of IT products and services,
>and providing technical assistance to companies seeking to enhance the

>accessibility of their products and services;
>
>+      Develop a strategy for increasing participation of people with
>disabilities in our computer science and engineering programs; and
>
>+      Encourage our faculty who are developing cutting-edge applications
>of IT to consider accessibility concerns.
>
>Thank you for your leadership in this important area.
