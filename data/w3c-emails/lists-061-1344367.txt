1. I believe all pages should have a prominent "last updated".
Might well have a pointer to "what's new" extract.

2. Resources on the web

Should list the general W3/TR source, as many of the others are interrelated.

I did not equate the topic "Policies relating to Web accessibility" with 
laws in various countries. Suggest "Laws and policies relating
to Web accessibility" or add text after current title " -- legal regulatory 
compliance."

3. Events, News, History -- is a catch-all. 

Events should point to Events list, possibly listing only the next one or two
biggies, before pointer.

I'd demote History down a level.

Not clear why all the dates of drafts remain important.
There are more current drafts than are listed there:

    Page Author Guidelines -- renamed.

    User Agent Guidelines March 1999

    Authoring Tools Guidelines May 1999

Don't use "Upcoming, " as in Authoring Tools meeting.

Last Call is obsolete, delete it.
