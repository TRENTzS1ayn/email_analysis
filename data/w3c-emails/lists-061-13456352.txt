Talked about ATAG at the Device Independent Authoring Workshop in Bristol UK
last week.

Going to Denmark and Finland later this month to talk about accessibility.

Giving a presentation in Melbourne as part of an accessibility summit being
presented by RMIT University in November. Also planning to meet with some
Authoring Tool developers and content providers while I am there.

Met some of the SVG working group who were at Sophia Antipolis for a face to
face meeting.
