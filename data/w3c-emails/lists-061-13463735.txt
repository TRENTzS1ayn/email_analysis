EOWG:

There is now an updated training resource suite available for our meeting
today, incorporating change requests from our October 5 discussion
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/trainingchangelog.html
Note that some but not all change requests are marked DONE.

The resource suite is still at 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/training
but now has a new page (actually, one page split into two) so six pages in
all, including:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/training/cr
http://www.w3.org/WAI/training/pe

We will need to focus our discussion primarily on the Curriculum page
today, to finish filling this in and to smooth out the existing material,
and this may take up the majority of the meeting.  

We also need a brief agenda item on the Quick Tips cards.
