 From 20,000 feet I would urge that a couple of points be made in 
any/all(?) training sessions: a) conformance to some sort of accessibility 
guidelines is (or very soon will be) a requirement rather than a choice; b) 
retrofitting is beyond being a nuisance; c) starting from a universal 
design perspective will maximize the benefits ensured by following our 
guidelines.

The training experience will be enhanced (in the case involving design 
considerations) by going through the steps of designing a series of 
differing iterations for a base project be it a Web Portal, Shopping Site, 
or the "daily news". For the busy executive the "programmers are cheaper 
than lawyers" approach (even touching on the Maguire/asbestos/tobacco 
analogies) might very well make more bottom-line sense than the "get 20% 
more hits" line.

Just my thoughts for the day.

If anyone doesn't know how "colorful" I look you might want to view Ian 
Jacobs' great portrait at

                 ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE
