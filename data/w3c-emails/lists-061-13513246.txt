Diana,

you should consult the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines -
http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10 - whether you
have used PHP or some other language, an online application is web content
and the same rules apply.

This is an active work area for the Web Content Accessiblity Guidelines
working group, as we look at moving towards a WCAG version 2 - you may like
to follow the discussion in that area. http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL

cheers

  Can anyone provide any information about the use of PHP in coding online
  applications and what issues with accessibility might arise.
  Specifically, I was wondering if JAWS can read it and if not, what kinds
  of alternatives might be offered.
  Thanks,
