GIVING THE DISABLED INCREASED eACCESS - The federal government has
ordered its member agencies to improve their Web sites' accessibility
for people with disabilities. Among the innovations being advocated
are alt text, which allows a blind computer user's screen-reading
device to interpret graphics and read them, and close-captioning to
accompany streaming video and voice-operated commands. The scope of
the project is enormous, with the Architectural and Transportation
Barriers Compliance board estimating costs between $85 million and
$691 million. That represents a significant new market for Internet
solutions providers such as Optavia, which says it will concentrate
nearly one-quarter of its efforts this year on disability-related
business. Although the government has not extended this new policy to
commercial Web sites, court precedent suggests the Americans with
Disabilities Act does apply to the Internet. (Washington Post, 24
