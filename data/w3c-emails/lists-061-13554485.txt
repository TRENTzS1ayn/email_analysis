EOWG:

New version of "How People with Disabilities Use the Web" at 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/PWD-Use-Web/20001020.html

This includes changes logged at 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/PWD-Use-Web/changelog.html

Especially the following changes
- flipped order of document to put scenarios first & made related adjustments
- retitled sections 
- added more technical detail to first four examples
- further rounded-out the first four examples in the scenario section
- (and other changes detailed in the log)

Note that all the scenario/examples aren't revised yet, nor the new ones
added (I think few people were going to contribute pieces) but let's check
the format & wording of the ones already changed.
