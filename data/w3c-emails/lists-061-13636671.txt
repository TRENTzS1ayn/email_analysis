Thanks for giving the linking a try. One thing I notice is that this is a
little confusing, since the two tables links go to different places (the
first to the guidelines and the second to the curriculum examples), and
likewise the abbreviations and acronyms links -- thus violating one of our
own checkpoints about linking...

but we could overcome this by adding, in parenthesis, "(table checkpoints,
examples)" ....except of course that there are multiple checkpoints and
examples that relate to tables. I think the links need to go to a separate
"checkpoints and examples" references section, which serves as a
way-station for multiple external links to various checkpoints and examples.
