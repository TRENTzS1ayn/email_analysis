The question that was raised on the call that I was trying to illustrate 
was whether we should link to WCAG or curriculum. I was merely providing a 
means of evaluating which (if any) of these targets was more appropriate 
for our purposes. I haven't gone through to see how many links would be 
called for and won't undertake doing any until we decide if we even want to 
do this. I certainly won't make multiple links from the same word if it 
appears often.

The reason for putting the link to yet another link instead of directly to 
the target is that there will be download time annoyance - this to be 
weighed against the 2 vs.1 click situation. I am on a slow connection but 
once I've cached the target document, it is much more convenient to only 
have to make one click - also "back" returns you to where you were reading 
instead of the "basement."

I am a heavy proponent of inline hypertext links, the more the better. They 
are easy enough to skip if you don't need any referencing but they get the 
additional information painlessly. For someone who grew up racing around in 
library stacks this is heaven.

As I experimented with the two targets I came to feel strongly that the 
proper one for this document is the curriculum. Its language is similar to 
the referring source and the guidelines are just sort of "cold". The people 
reading these scenarios are IMO likelier to be comfortable with the text on 
the slides than in the guidelines.
