OK, I didn't understand that initially from your example. I do now.

I agree that there are a bunch of pros and cons on this. I find it annoying
at first to realize that I'm jumping to another/slow document, but might
also find it annoying to find myself in a library of reference links at the

Can some other EOWG members give opinions here?

I agree on this; the examples were interesting to link to, and the
checkpoints were rather dull-looking.
