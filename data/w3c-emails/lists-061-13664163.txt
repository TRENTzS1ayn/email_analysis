At http://www.microsoft.com/enable/dev/web/default.htm is a recent (2 
October) piece on accessibility in MicroSoft space.

This is not only a good (encouraging) sign but it contains some stuff that 
indicates serious efforts in the "downloads" section. And of course 
mentions WAI. I didn't check the accessibility of the site itself <g>.
