>Macromedia today announced the availability of free
extensions to Macromedia
>Dreamweaver and Macromedia Fireworks that make it easier
for its customers
>to deliver accessible Web content.  The Dreamweaver
extension enables
>developers to evaluate their Web pages for accessibility
based on the
>guidelines of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).  The
extension performs a
>test similar to that of Bobby ( http://www.cast.org/bobby/)
><http://www.cast.org/bobby/)> , which has become a standard
online benchmark
>for accessibility.  The free extensions are immediately
available for
>download from the Macromedia Exchange for Dreamweaver

<http://exchange.macromedia.com> .

>Macromedia also announced plans for a Macromedia Flash
Accessibility
>Developer Kit and future enhancements to the Macromedia
Flash Player,
>expected by the end of the year.  The Macromedia Flash
Accessibility
>Developer Kit will contain guidelines, Smart Clips and sample
code to fully
>support development efforts.  An upcoming version of the
Macromedia Flash
>Player will be modified to allow access to underlying data
within a
>Macromedia Flash (SWF) file, permitting the text within to be
interpreted by
>assistive devices.  Further, developers can choose to expose
their
>Macromedia Flash content, making properties such as scale
and visibility
>controllable by end users.
>
>As part of its accessibility initiative, Macromedia today
delivered
>extensions that assist developers with accessible design. Two
new commands
>for Fireworks confirm that ALT Tags (which describe the
information
>contained in images) are being used, and that complex sliced
image maps are
>properly tagged for readers with disabilities and reading
software.
