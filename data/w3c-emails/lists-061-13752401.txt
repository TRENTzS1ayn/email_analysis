DC: David Clark<br>
CH: Carl Heibenstreit<br>
CL: Chuck Letourneau<br>

WL: William Longborough
</p>
<h2>1. Outreach Updates</h2>
<p>
KA: WAI Interest group Microsoft Terry Crowley about Front Page 2000 
accessibility problems. Had booth at Assistive Technology conference.
Doing Accessibility training for webmaster next week, Jaws, keyboards, etc. 
Frontpage will be tool they use. New Horizons will be doing the training,
in Windsor, 15 at a time for 10 one-day classes.
</p><p>
JB: WCAG WG initially owning glossary. Task force cross-working group. Need
assessment. Possibly useful across W3 as well. DD and JB not wait on any 
W3-wide
Glossary. So WAI should do it itself. HB to represent EO.
</p><p>
GL: Dawson college in Canada is providing accessibility training. Use both MAC
and MS. Do not use courseware tools.
</p><p>
CH: An XML.gov website is being set up. Plan to use the XML guideline draft.
</p>

<h2>2. How People with Disabilities Use the Web</h2>
<p>
HB: Notes are supplemental to changes JB made as we discussed issues. See 
her current revision at

</p><p>
JB: Revisions. Thanks to WL for review. Added new section titles. Added
mini-contents for the Scenarios. Linking from within each scenario to separate
references, different from the general references.
</p><p>
KA: Scenarios reorder.
</p><p>
WL: Need anchors to improve keyboard support.
</p><p>
HB: Check title word capitalization.
</p><p>
JB: Linking examples. Include links to explain disabilities: example from 
Online
  shopper to color blindness, where three barriers noted. When linked to 
curriculum, get
single slide, fast-loading. Later the checkpoint is linked, slower-loading.
</p><p>
DC: Hard to have clear enumerations.
</p><p>
JB: Take out subsection numbers is OK.
</p><p>
WL: Doesn't like option of going to the guidelines.
</p><p>
GL: Likes references to guidelines.
</p><p>
DC: second.
</p><p>
KH: ok.
</p><p>
CL: Likes references to GL/CP.
</p><p>
JB: Exciting to work with scenarios with human case up-front. There is a reason
for the requirements. OK for some. Can be disorienting (color via stylesheets).
When get to Scenario references, some orientation is useful.
</p><p>
DC: Supplementary references, rather than references from.
</p><p>
KA: If use bookmark won't see that.
</p><p>
JB: Look at 6. References, omit 6.#. The checkpoint text has checkpoint texts,
links to curriculum, and then links to the actual checkpoints.
</p><p>
WL: The checkpoint statement language is such a different attitude and writing
style from the rest of this document.
</p><p>
JB: The chosen ordering was to use the link experience.
</p><p>
KA: Send to the short fun one first.
</p><p>
CL: Avoid rewriting guideline text.
</p><p>
KA: Full sentence: then short-fun link, then the detail checkpoint link.
</p><p>
DC: Get to the guideline link within the curriculum only?
</p><p>
JB: Only works for WCAG. What to do for AT and UA.
</p><p>
JB: Label for checkpoint, its language, then curriculum example 2.1, Checkpoint
2.1.
</p><p>
HB: A table with columns for CP and CU.
</p><p>
KA: Reverse order: CP 2.1, then to curriculum
</p><p>
JB: Guideline name, Guideline number, its text, then curriculum. (will try 
this)
</p><p>
WL: Checkpoint checker, see its design: rdf.pair.com/xguide.htm
</p><p>
JB: Will try an alternative ordering.
</p><p>
JB: Two additional scenarios were volunteered. They haven't appeared.
</p><p>
JB: It takes about 20 minutes to check linking in the scenarios.
</p><p>
DC: Do not use same icon for different purposes. Take it off-line with WL.
</p><p>
</p><p>
JB: No volunteers to add links within case studies So try example of Reporter.
</p><p>
JB: Full keyboard support (ATAG) and access keys (WCAG 7.1 and techniques) 
and U
A) could.
</p><p>
DC: WCAG broken links: "check-use-system-conventions" anchor Same anchor should
work in GL and Tech. Going from Techniques to Guidelines do not have the 
filename.
</p><p>
GROUP effort: work on internal links among Scenarios into Section 6. JB is
editing these on-line.
</p><p>
JB: Link from checkpoint number and when curriculum example, put it at the end.
</p><p>
JB: Prototype example under 6: Access key:
</p><p>
DC: Will work some issues this weekend.
</p><p>
WL: Would like feedback on his page.
</p><p>
JB: Uses AOL-press and jigsaw as tools.
</p><p>
JB: This kind of work session has been useful. Plan to go through rest of
document for known updates. Would like full check of the document. KA, WL, DC
eventually. Get in condition to send to other groups soon, before end of Nov.
</p>
<h2>3. New WAI Home Page Review Comments</h2>

<p>JB: Showed draft to Steering Council. Their reaction:</p>
<ol>
<li>unwrapped table (keep but make it invisible gif!)</li>
<li>WAI steering council wanted link group on the left. Care more about the
first-time user coming for resources, rather than the more experienced user.
So put navigation link set for resources on the left. They are asserting
(as non-first-time users themselves) that they do represent colleagues who
were first-time users. </li>
</ol>
<p>
WL: Self-reflective instruction (gives example in place.) Omitting a navbar
on a small page defeats that example for use. Putting resource panel on the
left makes many links before the content.
</p><p>
CH: Keyboard navigation via tabbing forces the whole link list on the list.
</p><p>
GL: Users are going to be looking for resources, so justify putting on the
right.
</p>
<h2>4. Next Week's Meeting 2000-11-03</h2>
<p>
JB: Again schedule 2 hours, starting at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time,
on this bridge: 617-252-7000.
