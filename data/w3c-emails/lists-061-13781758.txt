I may be a bit late for the start of today's meeting. Apologies in advance.

I am (so far) doing three separate management seminars on Web accessibility 
this month - all to different government departments.

Also, sometime in the next week the Globe and Mail (Canada's premier 
national newspaper) is planning to run an article on Common Look and Feel 
and Web accessibility in the Federal Government of Canada.  I was 
interviewed (and photographed) for the article, but so were others I have 
not been able to identify.  I hope, but cannot guarantee, that the article 
will be positive in tone and correct in content.  If (when) the article is 
available on the Globe and Mail Web site, I will let you know.

Chuck
