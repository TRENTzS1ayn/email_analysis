Many thanks to Ian, and Anne,

(for highlighting a problem with stylesheets, which I hope is now sorted.)
Please take another look:

The use of english and style is intended to reflect the current idiom at
WAI.

The intention is serious. Graphics are not currently being studied and
rated. It is a difficult subject, however the opportunities offered by
'skinning' are significant.

The European funded email project uses symbols that are known to be present
on the reciever's and sender's hard drives, these need not necessarily be
identical, for the intention to be clear.

The web appears not to have caught up with this idea yet.
We need to pursue this with vigour.
I noted elsewhere that whilst universality is a goal, it is not currently
possible to use a single url to link to both unix/linux and windows
machines, probably there are a number of others? This seems to be a rather
basic and fundamental problem.
