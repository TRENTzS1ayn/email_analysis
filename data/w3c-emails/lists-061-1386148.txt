Hi,
I think the curriculum slide set is great and extremely useful.  Here are
some comments/thoughts.  I was on Windows 95 and IE 4.01.

1. Refer to http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/three/int7-0.htm  
"Introduction-suggestions for use of this curriculum"
The 'self-study tool' and 'reference' links do not take you to the
appropriate slides.

2. It would be a good idea to include 'Previous section/slide is....' too
along with 'Next section/slide is..'.  Currently, you have a 'top of page'
to take you to the forward and back buttons.  Would it be possible instead
to repeat the buttons at the bottom of the page too and include the
'Previous section is..', 'Next section is..' alongside the buttons?  This
way you immediately know which section the arrow buttons are going to take
you to.  
A 'top of page' link is still useful, but not as a way to get to the
navigation buttons.

3. Retain the 'Introduction', 'Guidelines', 'Checkpoints', 'Examples'
buttons at the bottom of the page for all the Table of Contents pages too.

Some other thoughts have already been expressed by other folks.

Great work.  I will do some more testing and get back to you.
