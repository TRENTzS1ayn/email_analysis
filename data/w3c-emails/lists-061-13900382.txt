Hi folks...

I didn't find out about this until after the conference call ended this 
morning.

An article entitled "Glitter may not be gold - New design guidelines make 
sites more accessible" appears in today's Globe and Mail "Report on 
E-business" supplement.  The Globe and Mail is one of Canada's "national" 
newspapers.

The reporter didn't do great research, especially about the W3C and WAI, 
but the rest of the article is not too bad.  Almost everything directly 
attributed to me was as I remember saying it.

The URL is:
http://www.globetechnology.com/archive/gam/News/20001110/ECACCES.html

A quick comment about the accessibility of the Globe and Mail Web site: Any 
of you looking at the page with a screen reader will likely be unimpressed.

Finally, in the print edition, the column is graced with a somewhat eerie 
looking photograph of me pretending to type on a keyboard.  I guess the 
dozen or so pictures the photographer took of me grinning simply made me 
look goofy.

Cheers!
Chuck
