Hi Jonathan,

I should like to know where can I download the clipart Popular
with Champgne.wmf and others. I haven`t it on my Windows 98

Is <Popular> the name for this collection?

Do you know if this collection is appropiate for LD users?

We (a little group in Barcelona), are working on a web center
for LD and we think that your idea for to use standard images on
user's hard disk is very good.

Thank in advance.
Ricardo S?nchez
