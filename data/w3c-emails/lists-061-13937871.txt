I am gaining understanding of what you want to achieve with an iconic
means to convey any message. Use needs to make the distinctions among
the uses for navigation, for disability notice, for visual representation
of an aural cue, or for concept representation.

1. You have four icons for navigation of slide 1: home, prior, next, top.

Not clear to me the distinction you make between home and top. Is
top to apply only to the current page? If so, why is it at the top?

A useful variant for longer structured documents is to include means
to get to a table of contents.

A variant for documents with heavy initial linking is to let the first
link get to real content.

2. The disability icons of slide 2: cognitive, hearing, mobility, vision.

Not sure the purpose for use as links: one or more to indicate subject
of the link? or accessibility of the link target? or inaccessibility of it?

3. The sound effect of slide four [a loudspeaker emitting a sound] and
eventually says "oh-oh".

That choice is generic. Possibly a family of these with icon suggesting the
reason the author added this.

Your assertion that their use will not have a significant impact on load
time is not borne out from my use, where a File Download pop-up needed
to occur. First I chose to play from its current location. It eventually
played. Next I saved it to my temp file. That didn't get found the third
time I tried to use it. So I still had to go through the pop-up.

4. Your sample of icons for words seems to require at least as much
effort to learn as the words. They do have the advantage of some degree
of independence across natural languages. They fail for concepts that have
no iconic equivalent. They seem best used to express simple relationships.

Graphics, as you intend them to express concepts, still require alternative
descriptions, for those who cannot see the graphics.

Similarly aural cues are a redundant means for those who hear. They need
alternative as well.

Pages that depend on icons seem to take longer than the comparable words.
A smart system could avoid reloading those icons when they are already
available. Not all systems are so smart.
