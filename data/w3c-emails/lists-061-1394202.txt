CPL::  I agree with your assessment.  I have changed the wording in
Introduction slide 8.

CPL:: Thanks for noticing... speaker's notes were eliminated from this
version of the curriculum since most of the notes created for earlier
versions had been worked into the bodies of the example slides. I left the
Introduction slide (9), but changed the wording to indicate what features
speaker's notes will take if and when they are deemed necessary again.
404-Link removed.

CPL:: I'd like to take credit, but the W3C Slidemaker Tool generates these
ToC's automatically.

CPL:: Great idea!  I modify the Slidemaker PERL scripts to make the titles
more informative:
<Checkpoint for Guideline [nl] x text>, and <Example for Checkpoint [nl]
x.y text>.  Doing anything fancier (e.g. Checkpoint y for Guideline x) is
beyond my PERL scripting abilities at the moment. I would have to parse the
slide title passed from the original HTML file and that is for someone who
actually knows PERL (I don't!)

CPL:: Sigh...  This whole slide is a pain in the neck.  The example I
designed is an inaccessible use of TABLE to lay out related groups of FORM
controls.   I was hoping that use of the new HTML 4.0 LABEL,  LEGEND and
FIELDSET elements and attributes would make complex forms accessible even
if the visual layout was not ideal (i.e. grouped with TABLES).  However,
since there is no way to test this theorem at the moment (as far as I know,
anyway) perhaps I should rethink the example.  It seems to me that if
future User Agents do what they are supposed to with LABEL, LEGEND and
FIELDSET, then it won't really matter to the end user how the various
groups are visually laid out.  Maybe this is just an example before its own
time.  By the way, the only way to see this slide without overlapping the
cells is to view it at full screen on a good sized monitor.  This is bad.
I will fix it (but not right now).

CPL::  Excellent point.  I have added a paragraph mentioning the
spell-check/word list possibility to Example slide 100 as a quick update.
However, when I get back from vacation I will see about adding more, as you
suggest.  Perhaps you or someone else who is willing to do a bit work could
put together a short section that could be added to this slide.

CPL:: When there is something simple enough for ME to understand, I will.
This curriculum may be less dense and more graphical than the WCAG
(therefore somewhat more accessible to some with LD), but it certainly
doesn't go far enough in that direction yet.  I think every iteration of
this material should take that into consideration and strive for improvement.

CPL:: I will likely split them up (but not right now).  I am torn between
keeping an internally consistent narrative on one page (to facilitate
printing) or to break up the long pages (to facilitate display).  The
eternal conflict!  I suppose that it doesn't really matter which is done as
long as the entire curriculum does it consistently.  Perhaps some metadata
could be added to a series of slides that are meant to be contiguous so
that a future user agent would print the pages as one document (or page) on
a single print command. I don't know what form that metadata should take.
Maybe an RDF expert could tell me.

CPL:: the positioning of the "slide x of y" text is dependent on the length
of the <H1>TITLE </H1> line for some reason... even though the style says
RIGHT JUSTIFY.  I haven't been able to figure out a fix for this yet.

CPL:: Yeah... we "went to press" using a version the WCAG guidelines that
predated the official WCAG release by only three-days.  You editors made a
huge amount of minor changes over that last weekend and I haven't had a
chance to go back and do the required cut and paste.  It will be a simple
matter when I get to it after vacation.
