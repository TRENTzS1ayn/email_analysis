I've read and tried to understand the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines.
But I don't know enough about the technical parts to comment on it. I think
one must know more about how the User Agents handle the codes and how they
interact with AT applications like JAWS in order to comment on the value and
usability of these guidelines.

Kind regards
