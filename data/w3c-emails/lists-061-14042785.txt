I hereby expand your knowledge: Opera 4.02 will (perhaps "can be made to" 
is more accurate?) play .wav files when they are linked to by an HTML 
document. The example from the curriculum that you pointed out 
http://slow3.w3.org/WAI.old/wcag-curric/sam115-0.htm ("let's shake on it") 
works on my machine (once the .wav file is cached) but in both NS 6.3 and 
IE 5.5 I am required to load a "helper app" to play them and miss the 
immediacy of clicking on the link and hearing it sort of all at once as I 
do in Opera.
