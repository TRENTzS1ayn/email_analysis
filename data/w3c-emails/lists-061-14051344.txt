Though I've only finished about half of it, I thought the list might be 
interested in an outstanding new overview of library services to visually 
impaired people in the UK: "Library services for visually impaired people: 
a manual of best practice." The introduction notes that "The approach 
adopted is intended to integrate library services for visually impaired 
people into mainstream service provision wherever feasible, in line with 
the government's commitment to social inclusion and access to services." It 
is available on-line at:
