you've missed by obviously not well expressed point.

linking to .wav files is a given, though i cannot explain the problems you are having with ie5

I am referring to linking to ambient or sound effects already on the hard drive.
really my point is that at least 100,000 LD clients are currently excluded because they use proprietary software that generates pictures and images as you type. they already have the sounds and pictures, so a browser that linked into that would work fine.
the email project is underway, the browser will come, but will it only be available as proprietary software?

how can it be that when one browses the ms homepages it takes so darn long?
all the images and sounds could already be on the hard drive, as they know you have ie5, and they arranged the installation.
it just seems plain daft.

  I hereby expand your knowledge: Opera 4.02 will (perhaps "can be made to" is more accurate?) play .wav files when they are linked to by an HTML document. The example from the curriculum that you pointed out http://slow3.w3.org/WAI.old/wcag-curric/sam115-0.htm ("let's shake on it") works on my machine (once the .wav file is cached) but in both NS 6.3 and IE 5.5 I am required to load a "helper app" to play them and miss the immediacy of clicking on the link and hearing it sort of all at once as I do in Opera.
