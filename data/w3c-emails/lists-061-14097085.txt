This should be interesting. Unfortunately, it is a nightmare to get to  -
lots of frames to navigate to find a PDF, so I haven't read it yet.

Subject: [eeurope-pwd] Read about Design for All

It might be interesting for you to read about accessibility to
information technology, which is the theme in the third and latest
issue of the magazine "Crisp & Clear". It contains, among
other
things, an interview with the EU Commissioner Erkki Liikanen about
why it is so important to talk about Design for All and "eEurope
2002 - An information Society for all". There are also articles
about
usability and accessibilty to telecommunication products.
EIDD ? European Institute for Design and Disability ?
publishes the
magazine "Crisp & Clear". So far 3 issues have been published.
Read the magazine on www.design-for-all.org
