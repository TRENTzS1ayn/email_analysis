Maria... thanks for your comments.  My responses are merged with your
original message and preceded by CPL::

CPL:: I (we) have been struggling with inter-set navigation concepts for
some time, and the answer is not easy to find.  

In my opinion, people tend to follow links if they look important.  If we
make most of the title of each slide a link (as in your second major
possibility) people will follow it.  In this scenario they will follow it
backwards (or up the chain) to a less detailed slide.  To me, this would
prove frustrating at least until I realized I shouldn't click on that
prominent link unless I truly wanted to pop back up a level.  On that
basis, I would lean more towards your suggestion of making links out of
just the numbers (e.g. 5 (linked to guideline 5).1(linked to checkpoint
5.1)).  It would be simple to explain this convention in the introductory
set (as other conventions are described.)  It would be somewhat more
difficult to revise the code on 100+ slides, but it is doable.  I think I
will hold off on this until after my vacation.  Any such change will be
fairly time intensive (but not actually difficult).

CPL:: The "Next slide: Checkpoint x" statement is intended to tell the user
if  content of the current slide is continued on the next page. Originally
I only included the wording on slides that were actually continued.  At
some point, maybe because I forgot why I did it originally, I added the
basic text to each slide.  That text could be made a link to take the user
to the next page, or, as you suggest, a duplicate arrow nav-bar could be
added to each slide to save the user from having to "page up".  I was
worried that the page would get too busy, and include too many links for
screen-reader users to listen to, but maybe the improved navigation would
outweigh that possibility.  This topic has come up before, but I think I
filed it for future consideration.  I would like to hear from the WG what
they think about this concept.

CPL:: Good Idea!  Hey Geoff - head's up.  I will toss this task you, our
multimedia guru. Perhaps you can make up some simple .WAV (or other easily
usable format) files and read the bad and good tables.  If Geoff can't, I
will do it when I get back from vacation.  Even better, maybe someone out
there can record a screen-reader speaking the table for more realism.
