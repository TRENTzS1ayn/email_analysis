btw my daughter is ill at home today, so there is a possibility I shall join
the discussion tomorrow,
best wishes either way.
A few notes:

http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/PWD-Use-Web/changelog

"Add example of someone with an intellectual disability:
important to keep each of these a story... young adult... supermarket...
part of the stuff at a supermarket... computer that ties into the Web to do
prices of things... price... doing the bagging from people's orders
online... bagging from online shopping orders... check out goods and pack
them... 14.1, 13.4, and 13.3. This is wine, this is meat...//bagger vs
order-filler// downs or general intellectual impairment//
use the same icons everywhere, also 14.1...
make sure this is checked!! "

who is advising you on this??
shopping is a strange choice, to my knowledge web shopping sites are far too
complex currently to be effective, except where clients have additional
reasons for not visiting supermarkets. The very real multisensory input, and
physical experience of  visiting shopping arcades is recognised as an aid to
stimulation. the web is not to be compared.
visit music from my homepage via m and click on rkelly, its not accessible,
but is stimulating, and reasonably easy to find, about 5 clicks. music has
proved very stimulating with lots of copytyping, writing and drawing all on
the computer. next week the students are recording voices. unfortunately our
network is not currently running flash so games have not been as well tested
as they could have been. http://www.music.com is not too far wrong, they
provide text for most links, but additionally letters and pictures, the
difference is that music is a little more limited in variety, and a bit more
interesting, you can taste the goods on the web. rather than waiting 24
hours. real time cause and effect stimulation is central. Its not as if the
clients usually did the weekly shop in the first place, in the main.

"Multiple disability -- substantial - little kid, music, games,
speech disability & substantial physical disability "

I am also a member and speak at the UK's CAMI computers and multiple
impairments group, this covers a very large range of problems, and a kid may
not be pc even if cuddly.
Using a piece of free software produced by cami members called 'carousel',
a few words, a full screen picture and a sound file are displayed, onclick
the next slide is shown, much like this site:
http://www.signbrowser.org.uk/2k/testing
this was also very successful with clients stimulated to view and review.
we are near completing a project 'things we do' with photographs of clients
doing things they like and speaking about it with a one or two word byeline.
of course the range includes hawkins, dont expect too much from a single
example.

Their is no use of graphics in this document. It is time that some wai
documents tried to meet the needs of people with poor verbal memories, and
those who may have excellent spatial/graphical ones.

If you wish to have something submitted, it's not impossible, but it does
require a different approach to presentation as this document is unsuitable
as it stands. Please consider a photo of each individual, stock ones are
available. Every single non-blind reader of this document will retain an
improved perception of its contents.

I am looking forward to seeing an example of somone with learning
difficulties searching the web included.
You may already feel the need to amend your acknowledgements list.
