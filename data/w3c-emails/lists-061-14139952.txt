A teacher expresses a concern about one of the scenarios:

"Fell asleep last night thinking how unrealistic the example of the LD 
student with ADD was ... The student needs to be in high school to be 
taking such a literature course, and the ADD is still going to play havoc 
with listening to the reading, since it will cause the student to have to 
replay the text and still keep her behind her classmates in the "reading"."
