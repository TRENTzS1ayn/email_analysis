Most of us have dates that resonate within as strongly as our birthday. 
Today's date is one of mine.

I work with people, none (maybe one?) of whom were born on the day (as a 
high school senior destined for Armed Service) that FDR proclaimed would 
"live in infamy".

Because, in some measure, of the work we do, this Web of ours is helping 
move from the divisive nature of that idea into a means of inclusion that 
enables me to think of that war as the opening of the information age, 
which has led us to the kind of stuff we do.

I hope you aren't all tired of my sloganeering but once more:

We're all in this together.
We're all members of one another.
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE

Love.
