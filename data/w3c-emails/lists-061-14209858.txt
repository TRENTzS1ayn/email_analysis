Hi everyone

What is your opinion of the Widgit software?
I've  been approached by a UK Government Department who
are considering using Widgit on an alternative version of their
site.

An example of Widgit in practice can be viewed at
http://atschool.eduweb.co.uk/meldreth/

The Widgit homepage is at  http://www.widgit.com/

Kind regards
