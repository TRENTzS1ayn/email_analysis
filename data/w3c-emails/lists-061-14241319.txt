On the page http://www.w3.org/WAI/ the links to 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/#resources and http://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources/ are a 
little (possibly?) confusing.

The former is an "internal" link to the cell labelled "resources" (which 
intuitively wouldn't seem to need being jumped to for visual users because 
it's "right there" already) and the latter to an external file called "WAI 
Resources".

The use of the word "resources" in both cases might not be 
ideal/optimal/unambiguous?

Also the icon for "tabulinearizing" might better be on the "resources" cell 
itself since that would make its function/relationship therewith more 
"intuitive"?
