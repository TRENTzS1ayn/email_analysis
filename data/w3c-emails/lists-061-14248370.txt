A form of outreach used by those of us who don't get about much is creating 
stuff that will help reach out and educate the entire Web community in 
certain areas important to WAI goals.

I am proud to be part of the project (the nuts/bolts part is by Sean B. 
Palmer) you might want to sample at http://uwimp.com

This program has a "fill-in-the-blanks" questionnaire that takes the user's 
"Who?/What?" information and a checked conformance level claim into 
submission and converts them into metadata         [RDF] that may be 
inserted in the user's Web document. It also includes facility for further 
levels of "What?" by means of descriptions of various "id" locales within a 
document when appropriate.

The purpose of this is to: 1) Permit conformance claims to accompany Web 
documents for which assertions about conformance are made; 2) Provide 
indexing information so that properly equipped search mechanisms can get at 
the information - a necessary first step towards a "Semantic Web of Trust".

This program will be developed extensively so that assertions about 
validation, compliance with such regulations as U.S. Section 508, etc. can 
accompany a document for simpler determinations concerning its 
accessibility. This, or something very like it will almost certainly be a 
feature of all forthcoming guidelines and one aspect of EO work is to make 
the reasons for this clear to press, public, etc.

As yet there is no "Accessibility Features of RDF" document but one is 
likely forthcoming.

So this is a "heads up" to EO that tools for conformance certification are 
starting to emerge.
