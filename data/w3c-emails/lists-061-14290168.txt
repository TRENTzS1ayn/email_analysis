I've taken a stab at developing the scenario for clerk with cognitive
disability. Would appreciate feedback.
Many thanks,

Clerk with Cognitive Disability at an Online Grocery Service

Timothy has been bagging groceries for the past year at EZShop, an
online grocery service. He has Down syndrome, and has difficulty using
abstract concepts. He has limited abilities in reading and doing
mathematical calculations.

Recently, he visited the EZShop online customer interface from his
home and found that because the site was heavily icon based  and
clearly designed, it wasn't too difficult for him to use. He clicked
on the icon and it sent his choice directly to an order form.

Prior to an upgrade of the EZSHop online clerk interface, Timothy had
a chance to mention to the companys Web developer that he found the
EZShop customer interface much easier than other similar sites. He
showed the Web developer that the clear and consistent language and
layout of the site, as well as the availability of both text and
auditory output supported his access to the pages. The Web developer
decided to implement WCAG 1.0. into the EZShop online clerk interface
to increase ease of use for Timothy and other employees. Features of
the new clerk online interface included clear and consistent
navigation choices (13.4), clear and simple language (14.1),
supplemental graphic and auditory representation of text (14.2), and
consistent style of presentation across pages (14.3).

Timothys job options have changed at EZShop online grocery service.
He is now conducting quality control for the business.  The order
presents itself on the company computer to Timothy as product icon
with text. Timothy uses a touch window to access the icons if he needs
auditory reinforcement of product description. If an item is missing
Timothy touches the icon which sends a message to the bagging clerk
who fills the order.
