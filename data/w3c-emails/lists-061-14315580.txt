Libby,

This is great! You brought this character to life. Thanks for the
contribution. 

I've incorporated it at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/PWD-Use-Web/20001214.html#clerk
I adapted the style somewhat, using less technical language where possible
and condensing it somewhat, but tried to keep the essence of what you sent.

None of the content is linked yet -- that will come. 

In any case, we can discuss at the meeting.
