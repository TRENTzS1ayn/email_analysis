I only glanced through the executive summary, but I agree that it looks
pretty promising in general.

          Hi, colleagues,

          You may like to know that the Irish government's Information
          Society Commission has just published its third report.  It can
          be found at

          http://www.isc.ie/thirdreport.html

          I was a member of its Connected Communities subgroup, and earlier
          a member of its Government Services and Social Inclusion
          subgroup.

          I find it promising that the needs of people with disabilities
          appear frequently in the report.  Only time will now tell if
          actions are taken to support the aspirations.


          Gerry Ellis.
