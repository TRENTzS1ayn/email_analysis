And the short answer is,

Yes, I think. Colgroup, and other elements may be more appropriate.

  We are setting up a tables for data.  they have multiple columns and each

  I am confused how the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines addresses this.
  They say that if you can read things line by line and they make sense, then
  that is a good "Quicktest."  They also list "colspan" and "rowspan" as
  attributes not directly related to accessibility.
  
  My question is, are rowspans and colspans acceptable in a table that has
  data?  
  
  many thanks, rob
