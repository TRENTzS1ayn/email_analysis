Subject: Web accessibility meeting

Amherst College, in conjunction with NERCOMP, is in the beginning process of
planning an Instructional Services SIG meeting on creating an accessible web
presence for higher education courses.  The meeting, tentatively planned for
Oct. 8th, is going to be designed for faculty members who are creating web
pages for their classes and the support personnel who are responsible for
helping them.  Our assumption is that most attendees with have little to no
prior experience with accessibility issues.  The level of web design and
construction experience will probably vary considerably. NERCOMP SIG
meetings aim for attendance of between fifty and one hundred.

NERCOMP, the Northeast Regional Computing Program, http://www.neercomp.org,
is an organization of educational institutions in the Northeast with the
mission of disseminating information about information technology to it's
members.  Its an affiliate of Educause.

What I'm looking for now is speakers and leads on possible speakers. If you
have any suggestions, or can pass this along to anybody who might have some
suggestions, I would appreciate it.  There's a variety of subjects I would
like to see covered.  If people want to email me a talk proposal I can see
how it fits into the agenda.

I'm also thinking about putting together a panel of disabled users to
discuss "The best and worst web sites - and why".  That could even include
students if they are real web heads.

Thanks in advance for any help, suggestions or leads.
