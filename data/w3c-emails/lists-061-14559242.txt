Outreach Update

On the morning of April the 6th I will be presenting a case study to the
grad students enrolled in a Methods of Inquiry course dealing with the
effectiveness of applying accessible web design to an online course.  The
study profiles a student who is blind as a result of multiple sclerosis
and traces his initial frustrations with the course, which was not "blind
friendly" as he put it, to his ultimate success as a result of putting the
WAI guidelines into practice.

It is estimated that the presentation will result in a renewed interest in
making courses accessible.
