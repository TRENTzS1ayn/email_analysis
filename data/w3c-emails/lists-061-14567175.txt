Outreach update:

I presented at the Australian Online Documentation Conference in Canberra, 29
March. THe conference was for developers of Help systems,and the talk was
about accessible help - why and how. It was well received by an audience who
often had notconsidered how important they are to accessibility, and how
important it is to them.

The talk is online at http://www.w3.org/2001/Talks/0329-help but not all of
it is available yet - hopefully that will be fixed today.

cheers
