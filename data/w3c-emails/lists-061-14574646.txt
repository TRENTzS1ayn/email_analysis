Kathleen/Judy,

Here's a starter for the company & organisations accessibility
plans/policies:

AUSTRALIAN BANKERS' ASSOCIATION - Disability Action Plan

The Australian Banking Industry is committing itself to playing its part in
eliminating the digital divide that makes accessing electronic services
difficult for older people and people with disabilities. As technology
reshapes the financial services industry, it is critical all people have
access to electronic networks such as EFTPOS, ATMs, Telephone, Internet
banking and Smart Cards across the industry.

Cheers,  Andrew
