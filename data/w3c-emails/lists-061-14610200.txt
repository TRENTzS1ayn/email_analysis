Aha! A minimalist's list.

As an old saw says "the list goes on..."

You've got some "hand-waving" ellipses (ellipsises?) in your examples that 
invite infinite extension so the editor must eventually decide and 
ultimately that's you. The exercise of adding *some* further explicative 
material is undoubtedly worthwhile/necessary but I'm about to embark on a 
major trek [http://diap.net/crusade.htm] and feel pretty sure I won't 
contribute much to this - sorry.

If my post this AM to xtech seemed out-of-line, hope you'll forgive me.
