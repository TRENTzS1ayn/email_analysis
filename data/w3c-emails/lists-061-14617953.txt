Hi EOWG-members,

A bit more information about the ISO-stuff I mentioned in the call last Friday.
There is an organization in the Netherlands called SERC (Software Engineering Research Centre) see http://www.serc.nl/english/
They have published a book with the title "Quality of software products" sub-title 'experiences from praxis with a quality model" on how to achieve a software product with quality. It is based on the use of the ISO 9126-model, but they composed an Extended ISO-model. This means that they took the original ISO-model attributes and added in an extended model 11 new attributes  e.g availability, degradability, user-friendliness, reusability and more.

A banking company who uses this model for software development came across our "accessibility mission " and was interested to know whether their PC-banking product also meets the accessibility checkpoints and asked for a review of their product.

Now he proposed to imply the software accessibility issues in the extended ISO-9126 model in the way users of this extended model will pay attention to accessibility too.

Is this a good thing, is one of you also involved in something like this?

Regards,
Henk
