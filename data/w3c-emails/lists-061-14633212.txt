Kathleen/Harvey,

Should we should consider promoting lead organisations (or Peak bodies) with
policies too? We have a number in Australia with accessibility policies (incl
the web), eg:

Law Foundation - http://www.lawfoundation.net.au/olap/access/web_access.html
EdNA -
http://www.edna.edu.au/edna/publish/system/edures/access_guidelines/access_guidelines.html
Bankers Assoc - http://www.bankers.asn.au/ &
http://www.bankers.asn.au/2603016.htm

Cheers, Andrew

Harvey:
Sounds good. If people want to send me the company names, and links, if you
have them, I can start keeping a list.
Two links, actually - one to the company, and one to their policy, if it is
available on the web.
Thanks,
