Dear All,

In our workshops we have still been promoting the use of the "D" link for
complex graphics explanations, however when I recently checked back to the
Techniques document: http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#long-descriptions

====================
7.2.1 Invisible d-links

       Note. Invisible d-links are deprecated in favor of the "longdesc"
attribute.

       An invisible d-link is a small (1-pixel) or transparent image whose "alt"
attribute value is "D-link" or "D" and is
       part of the content of an A element. Like other d-links, it refers to a
text equivalent of the associated image. Like
       other links, users can tab to it. Invisible d-links thus provide a
(temporary) solution for designers who wish to
       avoid visible d-links for stylistic reasons.
====================

It appears that visible "D" links are still acceptable, but the invisible "D"
link is not. (In which case, can anyone point me to a definitive list of "user
agents" (or versions) that do/don't support "longdesc"?) I am then curious as to
why visible "D" links are recommended as a technique but not invisible ones - a
screen-reader doesn't differentiate!

Thanks,  Andrew
