Kathleen

Isn't it wonderful to be separated by a common language.

Peak bodies in Australia are associations of industries or groups, generally
established for the purposes of developing common standards, or processes or
taking action which is common to all members or lobbying government or promoting
the interests of the members.

So they include groups like the one's Andrew has sent you, but there are
hundreds across Australia, wherever people have a common interest. They include
peak bodies of people with disabilities, trade unions, employers, legal centres,
doctors, accountants and so on.

Within the commercial sector they play an important role in allowing competing
companies (like banks) to meet to discuss common issues without the risk
breeching the Trade Practices legislation the outlaws collusion between
competitors which would affect the operation of a free market.

I hope that helps

Andrew:
I'll take a look at the sites, but, at the risk of being "hemispheric", what
is a Peak body?  :-)
