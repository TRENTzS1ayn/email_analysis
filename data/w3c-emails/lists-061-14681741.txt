Kathleen,

A 'peak body' is one that represents a number of smaller (often regional)
organisations (or businesses) with like interests and can take issues to
govt/industry/etc, develop collective policies and standards, etc when it would
be very difficult for an individual organisation/business to devote the
resources and/or stand out and be heard.

Examples:
Australian Bankers Association (www.bankers.asn.au)
Australian Council of Social Service (www.acoss.org.au)
National Farmers Federation (www.nff.org.au)

Andrew

Andrew:
I'll take a look at the sites, but, at the risk of being "hemispheric", what
is a Peak body?  :-)
