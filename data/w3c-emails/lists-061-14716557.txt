Hi Andrew,

my understanding is that while a screen reader is easily able to find an
invisible D-link, a low vision user can't, and a keyboard user may be
confused by the thing appearing as a link with no apparent content.

The place to ask is probably the WCAG working group -
mailto:w3c-wai-gl@w3.org - they are the maintainers of the techniques for
WCAG.

cheers

Charles

  screen-reader doesn't differentiate!
