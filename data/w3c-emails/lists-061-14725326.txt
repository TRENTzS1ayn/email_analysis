EOWG: 

Reminder, we are _not_ having a meeting on Friday 13 April 2001, since many
countries have the Good Friday holiday. 

Our next meeting is Friday 20 April, 2001.

Please note that partial minutes from our meeting last week are posted at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/2001/0406-eowg-min.html

I will send another notice when the final piece is in place.

Regards,

Judy
