Subject: [techlunch] FYI - Charts


I was looking at a study that a disability research organization did on the
website
access of groups that got federal research grant money through NIDRR
(National
Institute of Disability and Rehabilitation Research, an arm of the
Department of

Education):

http://www.ncddr.org/du/success/

The findings were actually pretty depressing, but I think they did a pretty
good
 job of
showcasing the use of the "d" tag to show how charts can be made accessible:
