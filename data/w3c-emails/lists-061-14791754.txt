Hello all,

I added my little contribution to two sections:
Implementation costs:
Impacts or effects on organisational place and image:

I do my best but my english wording can probably be improved.

See attachment

For the two others:
Impacts or effects on development (could be + or -):
Impacts or effects on site functioning (could be + or -):

The content is too technical for me and i suggest to ask Mark, Phil, Rob or
other to precise these considerations.

Regards,

Jean-Marie D'Amour
