Dear all,

I uploaded a third revision of the example of implementation plan: 
corporate, following Friday's discussion on:
http://fit.gmd.de/~velasco/wai-eo/ipcorporate.xml
Please, let me know on the list, since we are not meeting in the next 
two weeks, anything missing. I fixed as well some spelling typos.

Rob, thanks for your comments. See my remarks between your comments.

Suggestion included with a slight rewording :-)

This paragraph is rather confusing for a non-native speaker. I looked up 
in several places "buy-in", and I could not find a definition. Maybe it 
is business jargon. I will be happy to include your suggestion, if you 
help us, non-native speakers, with the first sentence :-))

Done

"Changes" eliminated. The voice and tense was agreed some 
"teleconferences" ago, but it is possible to modify it. In regard to 
your last comment, again, you've got me lost again.

There will be an appendix on costs. In regard to resources, I might be 
wrong, but I see it belonging to the business plan, but not to the 
implementation plan. Again, you have far more experience than me in this 
issues.

Regards,
carlos
