EOWG:

At recent EOWG meetings we have discussed possibilities of several meeting
times in various European cities in June, with most members present saying
the proposed times would be difficult to make.

I have a slightly different question at this point, which is to note that
several individuals have expressed interest in having a meeting
specifically focusing on promotion around the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines in Europe, to provide an opportunity for coordination & exchange
of ideas between individuals pursuing similar efforts. 

At this point we might have an opportunity to hold a meeting in Amsterdam
during the week of June 11th, most likely for a day and a half including
Monday June 11th and Tuesday June 12th. Could you please respond to me
and/or to the EOWG list regarding your potential interest and availability
for a such a meeting at that time & in that location? For this event I'm
particularly interested in hearing from European members of EOWG, although
I'd also be interested in hearing from other EOWG members who might be
interested in joining the discussion.

Please note that this proposed event would not be a regular working meeting
of the Education and Outreach Working Group, but rather a meeting focusing
on outreach in a particular region, potentially to be jointly hosted with
another organization. If this particular time is not convenient for people,
I would still be interested in reactions to the idea for such a meeting at
a different time & location.

Thank you,

- Judy
