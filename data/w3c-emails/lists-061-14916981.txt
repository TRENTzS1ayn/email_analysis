I would be able to make the 18th and 19th in Amsterdam (or t least most of
that - subject to a possible conflict with WCAG). I probably could not make
the other two dates proposed.

  EOWG:

  Thank you for the many quick responses I've received on this question; I'm
  impressed by the interest level in this type of meeting.

  It's been pointed out however that June 11th conflicts with an existing
  meeting, and also that that following week may be more optimal for
  coordination with other W3C/WAI meetings.

  I therefore would like to ask your patience in responding to two alternate
  sets of dates:

  1) Tuesday June 12th & Wednesday June 13th in Brussels

  2) Monday June 18th & Tuesday June 19th in Amsterdam

  Please note, again, that this meeting would not be a regular working
  meeting of the EOWG, but rather an opportunity to exchange ideas &
  strategies on promotion and implementation of WCAG in Europe.

  Thank you,

  - Judy

  Monday June 11th and Tuesday June 12th. Could you please respond to me
  and/or to the EOWG list regarding your potential interest and availability
  for a such a meeting at that time & in that location? For this event I'm
  particularly interested in hearing from European members of EOWG, although
  I'd also be interested in hearing from other EOWG members who might be
  interested in joining the discussion.

  meeting at a different time & location.
