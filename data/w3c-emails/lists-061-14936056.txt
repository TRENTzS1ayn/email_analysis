Sorry for the late answer, I've been out of office.
I second Carlos' suggestion to meet in the same week as the other WGs and if
possible piggy bag or have a half day to get feed-back from the other groups
on the EO work and exchange ideas on  EO activities and maybe related to
actions in Europe. So I would go for Amsterdam. Are there any other venues
in Amsterdam that week since the other groups are meeting and what's
happening in Brussels the week before?
To Judy: have you sought about inviting Harald and Kristian from
Delta-sentret in Norway? I should be in contact with Kristian next week.
Could you send a resume to the list about who and how many would come to
Europe in June? I think many have answered directly to you Judy.

EOWG:

Thank you for the many quick responses I've received on this question; I'm
impressed by the interest level in this type of meeting.

It's been pointed out however that June 11th conflicts with an existing
meeting, and also that that following week may be more optimal for
coordination with other W3C/WAI meetings.

I therefore would like to ask your patience in responding to two alternate
sets of dates:

1) Tuesday June 12th & Wednesday June 13th in Brussels

2) Monday June 18th & Tuesday June 19th in Amsterdam

Please note, again, that this meeting would not be a regular working
meeting of the EOWG, but rather an opportunity to exchange ideas &
strategies on promotion and implementation of WCAG in Europe.

Thank you,

- Judy

several individuals have expressed interest in having a meeting

of ideas between individuals pursuing similar efforts.

during the week of June 11th, most likely for a day and a half including
Monday June 11th and Tuesday June 12th. Could you please respond to me
and/or to the EOWG list regarding your potential interest and availability
for a such a meeting at that time & in that location? For this event I'm
particularly interested in hearing from European members of EOWG, although
I'd also be interested in hearing from other EOWG members who might be
interested in joining the discussion.

meeting of the Education and Outreach Working Group, but rather a meeting
focusing on outreach in a particular region, potentially to be jointly
hosted with another organization. If this particular time is not convenient
for people, I would still be interested in reactions to the idea for such a
meeting at a different time & location.
