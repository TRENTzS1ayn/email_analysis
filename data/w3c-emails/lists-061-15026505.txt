In the section reproduced below, one sentence is confusing:  "It shall
also be considered the actual level of expertise on the topic of
employees involved in the design and production of web content."  Does
this mean that the level of expertise of those employees with regard to
web accessibility will be evaluated?  If so, it should read something
like this: "The level of web accessibility expertise of the employees
who design and produce web content  will be evaluated."

3. Current situation analysis
  The status report of each department involved in this implementation
plan will address several issues. The results of this analysis will lead
to adapt this implementation plan to XYZ needs. Among the issues to be
considered, we highlight the following:

Evaluation of the existing awareness within the department about Web
Accessibility. It shall also be considered the actual level of expertise
on the topic of employees involved in the design and production of web
content.
