EOWG:

I took the "cost factors" that Jean-Marie has been working on (which also
includes work from William, Phill Jenkins, Mark Urban and Rob Neff and our
EOWG discussions) and incorporated it into the resource suite, at:

http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/ap-impcos.html

I did a lot more editing and re-arranging of items, since once I tried to
explain them more clearly, it seemed that several items overlapped. 

I added in substantial explanatory detail, based on my using this document
during several discussions over the past two weeks with people in
organizations that were at the stage of needing to determine cost
information for implementation. The brief phrases we were using were
insufficiently clear; roughly the amount of detail now in the document
seemed sufficient for good understanding. The responses to the draft,
though, were very enthusiastic, e.g. "this is just the kind of information
we're trying to put together ourselves right now; it's great to have it
available here."

In addition I looked back through all of our old change log notes on this
section (April 20th's discussion will be incorporated shortly) and finished
any change requests relating to cost factors that were not already taken
care of; and updated the change log.

I consider this appendix in a near-finished state unless I hear differently
from EOWG discussion or mail list. Thanks again to everybody who has
contributed so far; please take another look now and send any comments to
w3c-wai-eo@w3.org.
