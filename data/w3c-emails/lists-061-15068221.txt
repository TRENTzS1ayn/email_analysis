Dear All,

This is the workshop I refered to during the teleconf:

"The Commonwealth Department of Communications, Information Technology and
the Arts is hosting a national Online Accessibility Workshop. AccessAbility
is a Commonwealth Government grants program that is helping to ensure that
people with disabilities are able to jump the digital divide."
