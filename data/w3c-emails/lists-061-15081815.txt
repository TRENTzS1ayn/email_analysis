EOWG:

Here's a link to the updated change log from today's discussion:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/changelog.html#20010511

Also, a note to Andrew who just volunteered to get a starter draft on the
appendix for "Auxiliary Benefits of Accessible Design" -- please note that
there's already a bit of a starter draft at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/ap-auxben.html
from previous discussions. 

So the next steps would be to:
- expand list to make it more comprehensive
- add enough explanation so that someone who's new to this can understand
- not try to repeat the cost factors appendix, unless it becomes clear
that some items should be pulled over from that list, or do some
cross-linking.

...and everyone else is invited to help with developing that appendix as
well; comments to the list welcome.

Thanks,

- Judy
