Hi all,

I uploaded the new version of the Corporate Implementation Plan to:
http://fit.gmd.de/~velasco/wai-eo/ipcorporate.xml
I included Lila's comments from Friday, and the remarks of yesterday's
discussion.
Any more comments are welcome.

Rob, in regard to your comments of Apr 22:

I included these elements with slight rewordings.

With regard to this point, we tried to figure out your "intentions" in
yesterday's call, but it was not clear for any of us. I will appreciate
if you can be more concrete (which parts of the document are you
addressing?), or even participate in the next call to discuss this
point.

regards,
