EOWG:

We've been talking about adding at least a once-monthly alternate meeting
time, for those who can't make our regular Friday 8:30 a.m. US Eastern Time. 

I have reserved the following time and would like to know who among EOWG
list members, especially including people who usually cannot make our
regular Friday 8:30 a.m. US Eastern time meeting, would plan to attend this
date. 

Please reply to the EOWG list if you plan to attend, and include your
location in your email:

Wednesday, June 6th
4:00 p.m. - 5:30 p.m. US Eastern Time
Tobin bridge +1 617 252 7000
Agenda for initial meeting: 
Outreach updates (extra time given new participants)
Business Case Resource Suite development
Training Resource Suite overview

Thank you,

- Judy
