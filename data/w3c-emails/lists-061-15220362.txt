EOWG:

**Please respond to the EOWG mailing list by 8:00 a.m. US Eastern Time,
Friday, 25 May, 2001**

Over the past several weeks we have discussed on this mailing list several
dates for potential meetings of the EOWG in Amsterdam or Brussels. Each of
those dates has proved problematic for various reasons.

However, we are still interested in the opportunity to have an EOWG
meeting, focusing on promotion and implementation of W3C/WAI accessibility
guidelines in Europe, in conjunction with other upcoming meetings in
Amsterdam in June, including a Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working
Group meeting on 20-21 June, 2001, also at CWI.

Therefore I am asking for currently active EOWG members
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/EOWG-members> to reply to the EOWG mailing list
<w3c-wai-eo@w3.org> with regard to the following date, even if you have
recently commented on this new date in our teleconferences. Please indicate
to the mailing list whether you would be able to attend, and/or whether you
have any opposition to EOWG meeting on that date. Please note that the
meeting would not be decision-making, but rather for the purposes of
information exchange.

Proposed meeting date: Friday, 22 June, 2001

Proposed meeting location: CWI, Amsterdam, NL

As discussed in our teleconferences, if we go ahead with this meeting,
besides being open to EOWG members, we would also invite some individuals
who are just beginning the process of promotion of accessibility guidelines
in different countries, primarily but not exclusively in Europe, and who
are interested in coordinating more closely with WAI.

Thank you,

- Judy
