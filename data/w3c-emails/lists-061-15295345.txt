  However, we are still interested in the opportunity to have an EOWG
  meeting, focusing on promotion and implementation of W3C/WAI accessibility
  guidelines in Europe, in conjunction with other upcoming meetings in
  Amsterdam in June, including a Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working
  Group meeting on 20-21 June, 2001, also at CWI.

          Proposed meeting date: Friday, 22 June, 2001

          Proposed meeting location: CWI, Amsterdam, NL
