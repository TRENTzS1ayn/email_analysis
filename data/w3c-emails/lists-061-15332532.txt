This is a finished paper for HFWeb (Human Factors Web) conference. 

http://www.w3.org/2001/05/hfweb/heuristics.htm

Based on the comments we got from this group on the SVG accessibility note,
we tried to come up with some text that is a bit friendlier and more
general than the SVG accessibility note. So we came up with some design
heuristics for multimedia and graphic languages based on the experience
gained when writing Accessibility Notes for SVG and SMIL, and also the XML
Accessibility guidelines.

While the paper for the conference is finished we can still develop the
heuristics and the presentation. So we would be interested in feedback on
how well this kind of form brings the message and if it should be
integrated to some of the Accessibility Notes.
