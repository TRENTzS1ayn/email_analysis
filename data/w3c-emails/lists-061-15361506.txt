The document is overly long and complex for me to give a realistic
criticism, however I do feel it is a very significant development and wish
to thank you both.
congratulations.

rather than:
particularly users with cognitive disabilities
could we say:
people who rely on visual literacy,
ie focusing on skills rather than disabilities?

could we link directly to the resources ie
Figure 3.2. Image of a WBGH tutorial video with captions.
This will save users efforts and benefit those who rely on concrete
realisations, (like me).

I am not aware of the use of sound effects on the web, traffic, ice cream
vendors, street musicians etc, beatnik seems to be an attempt to meet this
need, perhaps we need to include some reference to this. Do current screen
readers use 'standard' sound effects?
Peepo will certainly be using them in the near future, as they provide very
powerful cues to spatial memory, cf that dredful restart tune.
