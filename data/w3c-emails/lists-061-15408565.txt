I downloaded: yoyocaps.zip
unfortunately WinZip could not decipher it and only gave an error message*,
I tried this twice.
*start of central directory not found...

I also tried lewinintro.zip with an identical result.

I would like to see this all working, equally it is as important that the
wai documentation is at least as accessible as private communications...

It may just be me as I seem to be having a bad week.
