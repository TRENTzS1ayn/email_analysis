Dear Working Group

My apologies for the late posting of this rough draft, but figured better
late than never. I've tried to structure the material by benefits and so
some actions are multiply listed as they have several benefits. It's just a
point-form list at this stage - will try and add explanation next week
(help welcome). Any missing points gratefully received.
