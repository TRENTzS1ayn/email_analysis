Hi all,

Vision Australia Founation has decided that it needs to prepare  a set of
guidelines for internal use to help staff make Word documents more
accessible. While we could write them from scratch, we figure that there
must be some material 'out there somewhere' that we could re-use. I've
looked on Microsoft's site to no avail.

Can anyone point me anywhere useful? Or has anyone done this or their
organisation?

Thanks,  Andrew
