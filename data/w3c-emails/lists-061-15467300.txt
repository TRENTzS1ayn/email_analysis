I am finding it hard work to use javascript, and maintain 'normal'
accessibility functions, whilst 'improving' functionality.
Does anyone know of a specific set of javascript functions that do this?

a current beta I am working on his here: http://www.peepo.com/crap/lbv/
(>IE5 only)

Code has had to be written to include window.status, differentiate drag and
click, and will have to be written to get
tabbing to work. It should all work in a variety of browsers, and play
sounds in Netscape/kde on mouseover, in fact I've read this is not currently
possible in a number of places. (interactive sound is a fairly basic
accessibility requirement)

A search for 'accessibility javascript' was not too helpful, but did turn up
this link:

http://trace.wisc.edu/world/java/inplace.htm
Make scripts and applets keyboard operable (using standard conventions).
[Place holding page - content still under development]

I have contacted them, does anyone know of other initiatives?
perhaps we could link them?

Is there a good reason why WAI does not host javascript pages, with code
examples?
