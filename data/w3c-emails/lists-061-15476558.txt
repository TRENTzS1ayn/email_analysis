Hi Andrew,

well, you could always produce HTML documents, and use the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines...

In actual fact the guidelines and even teh quicktips should be fairly useful
resources to start from - there are paralells in word for most things that
are done in HTML, such as structure and style sheets, some basic text
alternative mechanisms for images (at least in Word 2000) and so on. Plus
there is support for several kinds of hyperlink, which you could make use of
in providing alterntive equivalents.

Cheers

  Hi all,

  Vision Australia Founation has decided that it needs to prepare  a set of
  guidelines for internal use to help staff make Word documents more
  accessible. While we could write them from scratch, we figure that there
  must be some material 'out there somewhere' that we could re-use. I've
  looked on Microsoft's site to no avail.

  Can anyone point me anywhere useful? Or has anyone done this or their
  organisation?

  Thanks,  Andrew
