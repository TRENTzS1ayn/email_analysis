Jonathan,

thanks for these points - they are all good ones.

In this case we have concentrated mostly on visual media, but the thoughts
about sound effects are well taken, and I will bear them in mind for future
work. (As soon as I ahve caught up on past work... maybe better start before
then)

cheers

Charles McCN

  congratulations.

  rather than:
  particularly users with cognitive disabilities
  could we say:
  people who rely on visual literacy,
  ie focusing on skills rather than disabilities?

  could we link directly to the resources ie
  Figure 3.2. Image of a WBGH tutorial video with captions.
  This will save users efforts and benefit those who rely on concrete
  realisations, (like me).

  I am not aware of the use of sound effects on the web, traffic, ice cream
  vendors, street musicians etc, beatnik seems to be an attempt to meet this
  need, perhaps we need to include some reference to this. Do current screen
  readers use 'standard' sound effects?
  Peepo will certainly be using them in the near future, as they provide very
  powerful cues to spatial memory, cf that dredful restart tune.
