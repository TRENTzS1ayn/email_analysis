An example of Javascript functions that are useful is form validation. This
is fairly common - you fill out a form, and in a javascript-enabled browser,
it checks for errors before sending the form for processing. So long as there
is an equivalent for non script-enabled browsers, there isn't a problem.

We tend not to use scripts much in W3C content, and theese are generally
written for a specific purpose. scripts to provide things like sound
interaction would be useful examples - I will look at the examples you have
mentioned.

  Does anyone know of a specific set of javascript functions that do this?

  a current beta I am working on his here: http://www.peepo.com/crap/lbv/
  (>IE5 only)

  Code has had to be written to include window.status, differentiate drag and
  click, and will have to be written to get
  tabbing to work. It should all work in a variety of browsers, and play
  sounds in Netscape/kde on mouseover, in fact I've read this is not currently
  possible in a number of places. (interactive sound is a fairly basic
  accessibility requirement)

  A search for 'accessibility javascript' was not too helpful, but did turn up
  this link:

  http://trace.wisc.edu/world/java/inplace.htm
  Make scripts and applets keyboard operable (using standard conventions).
  [Place holding page - content still under development]

  I have contacted them, does anyone know of other initiatives?
  perhaps we could link them?

  Is there a good reason why WAI does not host javascript pages, with code
  examples?
