Hi all...

I just sent Andrew my contribution to the Appendix B Auxiliary Benefits 
document we discussed on Friday.  I believe he said he would be able to 
post it sometime after this weekend.

I will not be able to participate in next weeks conference call, but I 
think I have given you enough material in the draft to keep you busy.  I 
apologize in advance for having forgotten the "keep it concise" 
requirement.  I know the EO WG is good at making things concise.  I also 
think I mixed styles and tenses rather freely, so watch out for that.  The 
overall structure of the outline seemed to hold up pretty well under my 
onslaught.  I did however run out of time (and steam) just before the end: 
the Server Load section needs detail.

Please note that I am turning control of the draft over to the WG.  I won't 
be available to work on it for a couple of weeks so it is better if you 
don't wait for me to make any further changes or additions.

Cheers!
