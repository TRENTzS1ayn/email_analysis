"...Text alternatives"

I would broaden this bullet (or bite it?) to encompass the notion that 
"text is not sacred" and that having something akin to illustrative 
alternatives to text is of benefit to the millions with mild to severe 
learning disorders and the "partially literate".

We so unthinkingly accept the idea of text being "first among equals" 
within the communications media because practically everybody working on 
these documents is in a rather advanced state of denial about text's 
universality. Just a brief mention of how many more people are reached by 
illustrations than pure text?
