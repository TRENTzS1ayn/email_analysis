I am working on the State of Connecticut Board of Education Services for the
Blind web site. I have created a form to solicit input from visitors about
the types of services they would like to see provided on the web site. The
form in question is at: http://vvv.besb.state.ct.us/help/form.htm  I am
struggling with a couple of issues concerning the phone number field(s) and
was hoping somebody could help me.
I have the field broken out into three fields, area code, prefix and number
and have each one labeled using the label tag. When I bring the form up in
JAWS, in Forms mode, the label tag does not get read out loud. What is it
being used for, if not to identify the field?
I have added JavaScript to the phone number fields that moves the cursor to
the next field when the first field has reached its max length.  Is that
appropriate for a form like this?
Please feel free to fill out the form and submit it for testing purposes, it
is still in development mode only.
Thank you,
