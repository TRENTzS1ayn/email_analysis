I took the action item to assure that all the points raised in the appendix 
B working draft were in fact covered in WCAG 1.0. They are all in there to 
my satisfaction with a couple of somewhat inferential points: "XHTML/XML" 
use and "Semantic Web".

I think that these items (and possibly the point about Device Independence) 
might be reinforced in the text by mentioning the XML-GL document and the 
W3C "Activities" for SW and DI, without the burden of links to rather 
lengthy source information.

Something like "W3C Activities and Technologies include, in addition to the 
WAI, other methods that incorporate these principles that will provide the 
benefits discussed in this appendix, including ongoing activity concerning 
Device Independence and the Semantic Web. There are also papers about the 
accessibility features of such W3C technologies as XML, SVG, and SMIL that 
make benefits of using them clear."

This may already be in there either ex- or implicitly?

We might also mention that some of the techniques recommended to the 
designers of Authoring Tools are germane to the instant issue and that 
selecting tools that conform to ATAG will help acquire the benefits we are 
discussing. In particular by using conformant tools, the checks for WCAG 
conformance will be reinforced within the tool and make it easier to do 
those things that especially assure maximum technology benefits disucssed 
in the appendix.
