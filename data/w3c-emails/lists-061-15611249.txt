I believe the immediately following reference, from the U.S. Department of
Labor, deserves to be among WAI resources.

Subject: We are PEOPLE FIRST!

Dear Accessibility Advocates:

Re: Jeffrey Sutton's nomination

To reiterate a message I have posted before:

As long as we are "THE DISABLED" = by dictionary definition  non-functioning
inanimate objects, we can kiss goodbye any civil [=people] rights.

If we ever become perceived as PEOPLE, PEOPLE First, there might be a
glimmer of
hope in being granted a civil [people] right or two.

We advocates and people who self-identify as people with differabilities may
fully understand and appreciate that people who do things differently are
people who do achieve and accomplish "like everyone else." Please do not
assume
that everyone else knows what we know [they don't].

Change the Language.  Change the Perception.

Positive Language--People FIRST Language (preferably without "dis" and other
negative terminology) Sells and Wins.  Every Time.
