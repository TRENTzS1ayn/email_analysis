Hello all,
Here are my comments on the Appendix B "Auxiliary Benefits of Accessible 
Design".

----------------------------------------------
1. In paragraph : Improve usability for non-disabled visitors
Second sentence: Since one of the
underlying tenets of the WCAG is to increase the usability of Web sites it 
makes sense that following the guidelines will help you reach that goal.
Sentence a little bit long!

2. In paragraph: "Clear and consistent navigation"
I would formulate as follows:
People often avoid a Web site after an initial visit because they may 
encounter the following difficulties:
The site contains complex collections of information. Consequently, it is 
difficult to navigate and the users may have trouble finding (or refinding) 
the item they wanted.

3. In paragraph: "Device independence because of situational usage"
I find the first sentence rather long and not so easy to understand.
Moreover, i do not agree totally with its content. It may be true, that 
"people using multimedia-capable desktop
computer with a high-bandwidth connection", may sometimes use other devices 
such as "personal digital assistants, cell-phone browsers, or other,". 
Nevertheless, those devices may also be used by people who do not have the 
possibility to use powerful devices.

4. I do not understand the next sentence:
"Some users may find themselves in noisy environments where audio content 
may not be easily
heard so having a text alternative is critical."


For all the problems quoted after that, i would make different paragraphs. 
all beginning with "-" sign.

5. In paragraph: "Use of style sheets"
In the sentence: "This means that instead of having to
reedit every content page of your site to meet the needs of a new 
technology, only the master style sheet file need be changed.". I think a 
"to" is missing: "needs TO be changed".

6. In paragraph: "Clearer, more understandable, content"
In the sentence: "When targeting an international marketplace, using 
localized jargon, idiom or culturally restricted concepts in your content 
may make the your message seem
unfriendly or confusing." you have "the your message".

7. In paragraph: Assisting access for Low-bandwidth users
Sentence: "Even those living in area with access to high-bandwidth 
infrastructure" I would write in areas or in an area.


8. In paragraph: Reduce site maintenance
In the sentence: "With site development and maintenance costs an ongoing 
concern for businesses, applying design techniques that can reduce these 
costs a strategic move." I think a verb is missing.

9. I Don't understand "Address Server-load".
