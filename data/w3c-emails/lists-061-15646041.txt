Web accessibility is an important goal and the proposed forthcoming meeting
of the Education and Outreach working group in Amsterdam offers an important
opportunity to discuss what might be the 'European Way'.
Why is it that independent European initiatives to promote accessibility not
developing?.

Business is important, but so are people.
Perhaps within Europe business does not have the central role that America
chooses to give it?
In any case those with the least literacy are most disadvantaged and have
the least economic impact.
They are likely to benefit from educational activities, and less likely to
benefit from appeals to business models.

The approach which I have tried to advocate includes:
Develop initiatives from the ground up.
Produce resources that non-specialists can use.
Teach by demonstrating.

Sorry if this seems a little off topic.
