Gregory,

[Removing cc to webreq list, & reminder please don't cross-post between
lists, thanks]

Just tried it -- if I go straight to the page you indicate, yes it stalls,
but if I go to it through the steps of the reg process, it doesn't -- I
will follow up more with webreq to see if they can figure out why it's
stalling some of the time. Thanks for the alert.

- Judy
