Hi!  I'm new to the list.  I gather most of you are teachers or other professionals in the field. I recently became the long-term foster mother of an SLD-ASD boy of 12.  He has used WWS and PECS at school for a year and has learned to talk a little.  Now we are trying to give him as much control over his life as he can achieve.  One thing he can make informed choices about is food!  As our local supermarket has a confusingly vast range of goods, and a lot of noise and light stimuli, I was thinking we might create a shopping list before we went so that we could spend the time shopping instead of deciding what to buy.  Is there a set of symbols which covers all grocery-types and most of the major brands?  I don't fancy scanning in all the packet covers, reducing in size, printing, etc  And because of his sleepless and other behaviours, I haven't got the time anyway.  This will presumably be something that schools will eventually deal with as the children approach adulthood, but as he is receptive now, I wondered if anyone had a solution for me. Any help available?

Thanks!

Margaret
