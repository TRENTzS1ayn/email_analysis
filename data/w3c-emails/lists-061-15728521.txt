Although it's rather inferential in WCAG 1 (Guideline 7 - control of 
content changes), it is somewhat more explicit in WCAG 2, guideline 2 and 
checkpoint 4.4) that the user should be able to control things that "go 
boom in the night". What this will do is that when one encounters content 
respecting these guidelines, one will have the option of "skip fancy 
stuff", saving server load.

It might be fairly anticipated that sites designed to permit avoidance of 
"fancy effects" (some say "skip intro") will have such a facility  used by 
people who are more interested in getting to the true purpose of the site 
(buying something) than in the entertainment value of what Len Kasday 
called "a drop cap doing the Macarena".

Generally the checkpoints dealing with providing image map legends as text 
will help those trying to select Rhode Island from a U.S. map, etc. which 
reduces access time = usability increase = reduced server load.

The "discipline" of checkpoint 6.1 (Organize documents so they may be read 
without style sheets) will doubly enhance the effectiveness of having used 
style sheets. Virtually all the checkpoints under guideline 6 (graceful 
transformation), will do a great deal to make sites effective despite 
multiple browser uses thus making for more efficient site 
construction/maintenance.
