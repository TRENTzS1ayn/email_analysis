> London, 1 June 2001: The UK Government's new web gateway is poorly
designed
> and discriminates against disabled users, according to Australian web
> expert Tom Worthington. The government's action may breech UK law banning
> organisations from offering a lower quality of service to the disabled.
>
> Mr. Worthington said:
>
> "An Australian Human Rights case I gave evidence to last year established
> that web sites are subject to anti-discrimination laws. There are
> internationally recognised guidelines on how to provide access to the web
> for the disabled and the UK Government should be implementing them."
>
> Mr. Worthington claimed it was relatively inexpensive and simple to make a
> web site accessible for the disabled:
>
> "As well as providing better access for the blind, accessible web design
> can also lower the cost of maintaining a web site and make it easier to
use
> wireless web devices."
>
> The UK Government Gateway was recently established as a centralised
> registration service intended for e-Government services in the UK.
> Registering with the Government Gateway is intended to enable citizens to
> sign up for any of the UK Government's services that are available over
the
> Internet. But concerns have been raised as to how well designed and
> generally accessible the service is.
>
> Mr. Worthington made his remarks on Friday 1 June in London in a seminar
> organised by the Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB). Julie
> Howell, RNIB officer responsible for a national campaign to encourage the
> creation of web sites and on-line services that include people with
> disabilities also spoke at the seminar:
>
> "RNIB conducted a survey of e-commerce providers and found that many were
> not to an acceptable standard. It is disappointing to see the UK
Government
> is not making the minor investment needed to make its web sites more
> accessible."
>
> Tom Worthington is a Visiting Fellow in the Department of Computer Science
> at the Australian National University and an independent e-business
> consultant. In 1999 he was elected a Fellow of the Australian Computer
> Society for his contribution to the development of public Internet policy.
> Mr. Worthington will be presenting a paper on web access to the Global
> Internet conference in Stockholm next week. The full text of the
