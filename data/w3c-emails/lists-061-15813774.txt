I have to disagree; this is one regardless of whether or not
"presentation" is emphasized.  And a demonizing of "presentation"
actually does us little good here, anyway.  "Presentation" is not the
big bugaboo that some people have mistakenly made it out to be.
Presentation and purpose and content all work together, they are not
at odds with each other.
