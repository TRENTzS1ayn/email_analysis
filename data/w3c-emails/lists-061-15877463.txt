aloha, again!

since my attachment didn't turn up in the mail archives as an attachment,
but as part of my emessage, and since the point of the test wasn't to make
y'all read document source, but to provide a test page which could be used
to gather information about screen-readers' cognizance of display:none and
visibility:hidden, i'm re-sending the attachment, using a different email
client -- i apologize for any inconvenience...

hopefully, the attached will be recognized as an attachment and given a URI
which can then be re-referenced as necessary...

gregory.
