Greetings all:

With this message, please discontinue the massive cross-posting. 

For the WAI-based discussion, I suggest carrying the conversation on
wai-xtech@w3.org, which is for cross-posting between WAI groups on
technical discussions.

In the meantime, if you want to look at another example of skipnav
implementation, look at the one that's been on the WAI home page for a
while <http://www.w3.org/WAI/> If you have comments on that, please put
comments on wai-xtech@w3.org if for discussion, or at
wai-site-comments@w3.org if you just want to log your comments on it.

Thanks,

- Judy
