The WAI needs to agree on what disabilities we are going to list, and under
which category.  I initially used the list from "How People With
Disabilities Use the Web", so we could link to the examples.  There has been
disagreement on categories here.  Across all WAI docs there is a large
discrepancy.....................please provide feedback, and perhaps pass
this onto those you know are most versed on this issue.  Please, send your
comments directly to mailto:wai-xtech@w3.org

1. Moved Age Related under Multiple Bullet List
2. Added skeletal under Motor
3. Added Neuro-muscular to Motor
4. Controversy about Mental Health Disabilities being listed at all, I left
it for now.
5. <quote>
   GV: Mental health disabilities are different from the other categories.
Emotional disabilities (ED) not represented. How would you design a page
that would be accessible to someone with ED?
   KHS: Don't want to leave people out
   GV: But don't want to put people in if we're not doing anything for them.
{agreement to remove mental health disabilities from list}

6. <quote>
   GV: Blindness and low vision, Deafness and hard-of hearing, Physical,
Speech, Cognitive, Learning, Seizure, and Multiple are the categories
   KHS: If we do this, WCAG and "How people use the web" will look totally
different.
   JW: Need good general categories that are relatively uncontroversial,
clarify in glossary.

7. Added the work "Techniques" to XML, etc.
