Hello Jonathan,
I wanted to respond to your point:

"In any case those with the least literacy are most disadvantaged and have
the least economic impact..."

I would agree with this comment, and possibly this is a key area for an
initiative to develop.  In my view understanding and implementing strategies
that advance the needs of the Disabled through Web Access that takes into
account levels of literacy and illiteracy have very important goals that for
example Europe ought to consider.  As well as the U.S. take seriously also.
While business is important, society as a whole has a great stake in access
issues.  Thanks for your remarks.
Doyle

I of course am speaking my own opinion and not for Wells Fargo bank.  But I
would like to encourage a look at these issues in the way your phrased
things.  So if you would like to forward my remarks please do.
