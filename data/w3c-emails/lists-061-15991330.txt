aloha, y'all!

following the conversation at yesterday's supplemental telecon, the
following is a list of potential sources of disability related statistics...
this list was obtained by googling the World Health Organization (WHO)'s web
site (http://www.who.int) for the terms "statistic" and "disability" --
although i have confirmed that each of the links leads to a source of
statistical information, i haven't followed all of these leads to their
logical conclusions (i was waiting on hold on the telephone while searching,
so i didn't have the luxury of listening to large gobs of information)...
note that many of the URIs below are extremely long, and may wrap (and cease
to function correctly as links if your email client supports hyperlinks) --
i have, therefore, enclosed each URI in angle-brackets...  as for my
personal opinion on which resources listed below are the most promising as
regards cold, hard, statistical facts, i'd say numbers 4, 5, 7

1. International Classification of Functioning, Disability, & Health (ICIDH)
<http://www.who.int/icidh/>

2. WHO Fact Sheet Alphabetic Index
<http://www.who.int/inf-fs/en/>

3. WHO Statistical Information System (WHOSIS)
<http://www.who.int/whosis/>

4. WHOSIS Statistical Information
<http://www-nt.who.int/whosis/statistics/menu.cfm>

5. Statistical data: new measures for health and health systems from the
World Health Report 2000
<http://www-nt.who.int/whosis/statistics/menu.cfm?path=statistics,whr_statis
tics&language=english>

6. WHO Terminology
<http://www.who.int/terminology/ter/TERWB-WHR2000.htm>

7. Links to National Health-Related Websites (many of which have links to
national statistics collecting/collating/monitoring bodies):
<http://www-nt.who.int/whosis/statistics/national_sites/national_sites.cfm?p
ath=statistics,national_sites&language=english>

hope this helps,
gregory.
