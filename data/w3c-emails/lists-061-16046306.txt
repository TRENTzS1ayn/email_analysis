Hi Everyone,

I realize that this may be old news to some but still may be 
worthwhile mentioning... 

I have been exploring the http://www.usability.gov/ website and it 
contains demographic information as well as ideas for the business 
case, etc.

If you have not explored this site it may be a good idea to take a 
look!

Gretchen
