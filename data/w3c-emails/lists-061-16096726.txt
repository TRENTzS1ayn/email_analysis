EOWG:

At our last EOWG meeting I said I'd make a list of who's working on which
parts of the business plan resource suite. Here's what I've compiled from
the change log & minutes. 

http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/changelog
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Minutes.html

Please look through, and note any changes or additions; and please feel
free to volunteer for additional areas!

The list below is taken from the June 8 revision of the top page of the
resource suite:

http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/Overview

Perhaps I should turn this into a Web page for easier tracking & updating
of who's doing what plus status of each area. But, email for now, to
facilitate discussion & responses.

- Judy
