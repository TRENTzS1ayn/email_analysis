references are indicated.

More to come...

Advances in medical care, rehabilitation technology, and 
rehabilitative treatment have made aging a routine event for persons 
with a disability. The rapid increase in the number of people with a 
physical disability who are growing older has been well 
documented 
(McNeil, J., ``Americans With Disabilities,'' U.S. Bureau of the 
Census, Statistical Brief, SB/94-1, 1994).

Approximately 1.4 million Americans use a wheelchair as their 
primary source of mobility (Kraus, L., et al., Chartbook on 
Disability 
in the United States, InfoUse, Berkeley, CA, 1996), including 
approximately 600,000 Americans who live in skilled nursing 
facilities 
and are over the age of 65 (Shaw, G. and Taylor, S. J., ``A Survey 
of 
Wheelchair Seating Problems of the Institutionalized Elderly,'' 
Assistive Technology, Vol. 3, RESNA Press, pgs. 5-10, 1991). 

...
More than 200,000 children in the U.S. are affected with some form 
of arthritis (Cassidy, J.T., et al., ``Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis,'' 
Textbook of Pediatric Rheumatology, pgs. 133-233, 1995). 

...

    In the U.S., there are approximately three million stroke 
survivors 
and 400,000 to 500,000 new or recurrent stroke cases annually 
(Gorelicj, P., ``Stroke Prevention,'' Archives of Neurology, 52(4), 
pgs. 347-355, 1995).
