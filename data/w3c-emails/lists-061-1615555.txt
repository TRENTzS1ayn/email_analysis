AGENDA FOR JANUARY 8, 1999:

1. Outreach & updates
- upcoming deadlines on events calendar or elsewhere?

2. Review & comment, policy page
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/EO-Policy>
- front-matter has been revised, please review
- format for reference links streamlined (the best example of how its
intended to work is at "Australia" except for the "additional info &
comments section" which is blank there)
- known information linked for Australia, Canada (broken links on CHRC
site), France (no known links), Portugal, Thailand (need original URL's),
United Kingdom (need legislative URL's), United States (still some
legislative URL's to fill in -- "Thomas" seems to have unstable URL's)
- please check existing information
- are additional & relevant original URL's available for legislation,
policies, or interpretations of legislation?
- are policies under development in additional countries which can be
linked from here?
- can someone review legislative summaries in "HEART" report and see what
additional European legislation may be relevant, and find original URL's
for those?
- "call for review" plans, "finalization" plans

3. Discussion of possible press campaign April-June
- which core deliverables most needed for that timeline
- which audiences most critical to reach with those resources

5. Review of Section 4 of EO Deliverables
- <http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/EO-Deliverables>
- status, resources, priorities
- reformatting technical reference pieces for TR page notes
