Just to stay slightly ahead of the crest of our wave it might be nice to 
start translating xml-gl? One value of doing this is the possibility of 
forestalling possible i18n problems with the concepts, not just their 
production/presentation. I don't have any examples but believe this is a 
possibility.

On another note, in my proclamation you've translated "wherever" using 
deseen but Emmanuelle's version uses quieran - both use qualquier momento 
for "whenever". I'm just curious as to the granularity of those forms since 
deseen seems more apt?
