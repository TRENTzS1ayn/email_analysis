It does depend how you define accessible, This activity was described as
'Magic' and entranced all the group.

Our students (across a wide range of ability) enjoyed creating and playing
music in a variety of genres, such as Jazz, Techno, Rap, World, and Spacey.
The activity lasted about 1 hour, which is a long time for this group.
It required virtually no intervention, encourages musical 'ear' and keyboard
skills, which are transferable skills.

It is easy to play something that sounds professional. A "nightclub" collage
is also created .

visit http://www.peepo.com choose music, and then qwerty, qwerty.

for those in a rush http://www.pianographique.com/
How will it be when LDD students can create accessible web pages with such
ease?
