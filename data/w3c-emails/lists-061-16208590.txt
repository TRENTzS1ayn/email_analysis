Socio-Demographic Characteristics of Canadians with Disabilities 

The population with disabilities make up a substantial proportion of 
the Canadian  population. In 1991, there were an estimated 4.2 
million Canadians with disabilities, representing 16% of the total 
population.

Not surprisingly, disabilities are most common among seniors. In 
1991, 46% of all persons  aged 65 and over had disabilities, 
compared with 27% of people aged 55-64, 14% of those aged  35-
54, 8% of those aged 15-34, and 7% of children under age 15. The 
pro-portion of seniors with disabilities also increases with age. That 
year, 84% of people aged 85 and over had disabilities, while the 
figures were 57% for those aged 75-84 and 37% among 65-74-year-
olds. As well, among seniors, women are more likely than men to 
have disabilities, especially at older age ranges. That year, for 
example, 86% of women aged 85 years and over had disabilities, 
compared with 80% of men in this age range.

Nature of disabilities

Mobility and/or agility disabilities are the most commonly reported 
disabilities. In 1991, 59% of all persons with disabilities aged 15 
and over reported a mobility disability; that is, they were limited in 
the ability to walk, move from room to room, carry an object a short 
distance, or stand for long periods. At the same time, 54% were 
limited in the ability to bend, dress or undress, get in or out of bed, 
grasp or handle objects, or reach or cut food; 30% were limited in 
the ability to hear what was being said in a normal conversation 
even when wearing a hearing aid; 14% were limited in the ability to 
see properly even when wearing correc-tive glasses; 7% had a 
speaking disability, while 30% reported other conditions, including 
limitation because of a learning disability, mental health condition, 
mental handicap, or because of labelling by others.

Severity of disability

The largest share of adults with disabilities have a mild disability, 
although a substantial proportion have severe disabilities. In 1991, 
47% of all persons aged 15 and over with disabilities were consi-
dered to have a mild disability, while 32% had a moderate disability 
and 22% had a severe disability. That year, 817,300 Canadians 
aged 15 and over, 4% of the total population in that age range, had 
disabilities that were considered severe.

Older persons with disabilities are more likely than their younger 
counterparts to have severe dis-abilities. In 1991, 32% of persons 
with disabilities aged 65 and over had severe disabilities, compared 
with 20% of those aged 55-64, 15% of those aged 35-54 and 9% of 
individuals aged 15-34. In fact, people aged 65 and over made up 
almost 60% of all Canadians aged 15 and over with severe 
disabilities.

Provincial differences

There is considerable variation in the prevalence of disabilities 
among the provinces. In 1991, more than one in five Nova Scotia 
residents (21%) had a disability, the largest proportion in any 
province. Disability rates were also relatively high in 
Saskatchewan, where 19% of the population had disability, as did 
18% of residents of both New Brunswick and Manitoba, 17% of 
those in each of Alberta, Prince Edward Island and British 
Columbia, and 16% in Ontario. In contrast, just 12% of Quebec 
residents and only 10% of those in Newfoundland had disabilities.
