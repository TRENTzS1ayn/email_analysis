Hello,

We are doing some work with a major NGO organisation in Australia who is
revising their website at present. The new site will have a 'shopping cart'
as they have a large retail operation. Does anyone know of any shopping
stes that work well for disabled access?

Thanks in anticipation,  Andrew
