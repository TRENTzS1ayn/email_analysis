Hello,

We are working with a commercial organisation that is using javascript
heavily to check the integrity of entries and selection on their
transactions pges.

Testing to date with keyboard only indicates that a mouse is will not be
required with a few small changes, and screen reader (JAWS 3.7) testing
with a blind user is also largely successful.

However, the site will probably fall apart if javascript is disabled -
where does this leave them with respect to meeting Priority 1?

Any advice?  Andrew
