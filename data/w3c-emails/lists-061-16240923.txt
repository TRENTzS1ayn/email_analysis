It leaves them failing to meet level A.

the simplest approach would be to replicate the javascript on the server
side, with some extensions to pass on whether the information has been
verified or not.

By the way, it probably makes more sense to ask techical questions on either
the Interest group list w3c-wai-ig@w3.org (archived at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig publicly available) where you
are looking for rough ideas about how to solve a (presumably) known problem,
or directly ask the working group where the answer is really unclear or you
think there is an issue that needs to be addressed for the development of
WCAG - w3c-wai-gl@w3.org (archives
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl publicly available).

  Hello,

  We are working with a commercial organisation that is using javascript
  heavily to check the integrity of entries and selection on their
  transactions pges.

  Testing to date with keyboard only indicates that a mouse is will not be
  required with a few small changes, and screen reader (JAWS 3.7) testing
  with a blind user is also largely successful.

  However, the site will probably fall apart if javascript is disabled -
  where does this leave them with respect to meeting Priority 1?

  Any advice?  Andrew
