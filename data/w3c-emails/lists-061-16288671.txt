An updated Aux Benefits appendix has been posted
(http://members.optushome.com.au/amja/wai/)

This version has incorporated a (hopefully accessible) matrix of benefits
along with some additional benefits. Please note that some benefits still
appear in the text as WCAG actions - the table shows the correct
relationship.

All further comments gratefully received.
