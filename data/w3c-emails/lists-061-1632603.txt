www.art-telecoms.fr, for ART (Autorit? de r?gulation des
t?l?communications) has the legal text for France
(http://www.art-telecom.fr/textes/corps.htm), which includes the
"Service Universel" which only says, I think, that they are some price
reduction for People with Disabilities.

I have a friend working in this area and I'm asking him if there is
anything related to Web Access on the horizon.

For Europe (I think I already sent this material on this list)

The Amsterdam treaty contains a new Article (6a) and a Declaration
(22) on people with disabilities.

TREATY OF AMSTERDAM (Oct 97) AMENDING THE TREATY ON EUROPEAN UNION,
THE TREATIES ESTABLISHING THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES AND CERTAIN RELATED
ACTS.

The following Article shall be inserted: "Article 6a". 

       Without prejudice to the other provisions of this Treaty and
within the limits of the powers conferred by it upon the Community,
the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and
after consulting the European Parliament, may take appropriate action
to combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin,
religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.'

Declaration 22 regarding persons with a disability. 

       The Conference agrees that, in drawing up measures under
Article 100a of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the
institutions of the Community shall take account of the needs of
persons with a disability.
