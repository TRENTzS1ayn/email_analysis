I was genuinely excited to see my first SMIL files* via Real Player

Is there a hotsmils site**? hotsvg?
I'll certainly host one if I get enough links showing a variety of
approaches.
eg:
http://video.hbs.edu/playVideo.jhtml?clip=webtech
works fine in linux as well as windows,  though the links seem to be rather
beta-ish?
I'd like to trial them with my students

I liked this streaming av (using flash but not real player),
http://prototype.urbanomic.com/video/
How easily could this have streaming text?



*Follow on from thread: human factors web conference paper
The links from this site are now up:
http://ncam.wgbh.org/webaccess/pivot/accesslist.html#cc
I had a couple of problems with wlpvtint.smil under linux, i.e. no text,
possibly not implemented yet.
More seriously, completely hung machine ctraltbck.. first time around ok
second.
with yoyocaps.smil it produced an error message: could not find additional
file wl99m6r1yoyo.rm.
(I having problems unzipping some files in linux so had copied the 6 files
across from windows....)
nb: the topic is not of widespread interest, though it is carried off well
enough.

**I visited http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/ (great graphic to use as a link)
and the links here http://smil.nist.gov/s2animation.html produced error
messages.
Did I miss a link to what I seek?
