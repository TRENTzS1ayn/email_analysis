Hello,

I agree with Andrew. The contexte is milestone for implement
accessibility policy.

It is realistic for a large website to have priorities in the process of
becoming accessible. I agree with Judy not to presume of person with
disability interests but when a content is clearly targeting these
peoples, i think it is reasonable and correct to include it explicitly
in the priorities.

Thanks

Jean-Marie D'Amour

Thanks Carlos,

Wasn't sure about that clause - thought it might be controversial, but
there are special circumstances where subsites _are_ of specific
interest to
(some) disabled persons. Eg. physical/public access instructions;
discounts that apply; transport issues; audio-loops in buildings;
sub-titles on films/tv-shows; etc
