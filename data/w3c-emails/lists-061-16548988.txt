EOWG:

Updated draft (dated January 4, 2001) of "How PWD Use the Web," for our
discussion today, and for EOWG comment online.

http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/PWD-Use-Web/
(also http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/PWD-Use-Web/20010104 )

Thanks to Libby for the new & improved teenager section.

The text of this document is mostly done now. Please note changes
incorporated since our last meeting, listed at 

http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/PWD-Use-Web/changelog

In addition, please note these known items still needing work, so as to
avoid redundant comments:

- fix a number of broken links & anchors
- fix some code
- add "text to speech" software (for dyslexia) that is differentiated from
screen readers
- add "mini-tocs" for disabilities section and for assistive technologies
section OR a much longer toc up front
- fix toc order at front to reflect moving the "futher reading" section later
- add braille graphic from Henk and Eric

Some things we should discuss today:

- review teenager example
- review retiree example
- review some issues in the scenario references section
- review the last few (new) descriptions in the assistive technology section
- recheck the multiple disabilities and aging examples
- check some edits in the "further reading" section
- spellcheck etc

But the main question is, once the changes noted about are done, is this
ready to be sent around to other WAI groups including the WAI Interest
Group, for comment? If so, our process would then be to have it out for
review & comment for a few weeks, then to review & incorporate any changes
based on that feedback, then to publish it as a Working Draft on the W3C
Technical Reports page; or to go directly to "W3C Note" status.

Talk to you soon,

- Judy
