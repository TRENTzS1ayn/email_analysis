Actually we now have eight scenarios. The Bingham rule says such groups are 
proscribed by the magic 7 plus/minus 2 so on that basis our keeness to 
limit the number still has a one-scenario headroom space.

JC:: "I'd like to contribute a student's positive experience of the web."

WL: From my point of view (not speaking for the group, and all those other 
disclaimers) the trick is to do so and not just propose to do so. Run it up 
the flagstaff and see if anyone salutes and all that stuff. Particularly if 
it has some feature that "self-reflexes" and gets its message across 
through exemplifying what it speaks to.

But that's just my opinion.
