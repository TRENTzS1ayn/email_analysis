Quick suggestion for bringing natural language into the scenario (I haven't 
given much thought to a seamless integration):

As she was growing up, her family had postings in several countries and she 
has picked up a working knowledge of various languages.  Because changes in 
natural language have been identified in the page markup, her multilingual 
screen reader automatically switches vocabulary and pronunciation 
dictionaries, significantly improving her understanding of the pages being 
read.  As well, for languages she does not understand, the same markup 
permits faster and more efficient automatic language translation.

Cheers!
Chuck
