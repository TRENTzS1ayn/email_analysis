I'm not concerned that there be more policy or business case - I think the
particular value of this note is to explain how it is that people use the
Web, and what it is that gives them access. (The times I have referred to it,
that is what I have needed from it...)

  If that question's for me the scenarios are rapidly becoming what I have in
  mind, particularly since they now contain material emphasizing that there's
  been (and continues to be) a problem here: not all is sweetness and light
  in the accessibility garden.

  The self-reflexive part is absent so far as I can tell and I don't really
  expect much to be done in that regard but I thought Jonathan might provide
  a scenario that used what he's always talking about which might argue for
  its inclusion in an otherwise entirely verbal experience for our readers.

  The only additional flavors I covet in the document are: 1) more noticeable
  i18n; 2) "policy" illustrations to supplement the "bizcase" and "curb-cut"
  arguments now peppering the scenarios.

  I think this is getting to be both a "good thing" and an exemplar of
  effective "concert composition".
