I've got one OzEWAI disc, and I believe that there aren't any more available.
I can make the stuff available via the Web if people are interested (for the
videos we are talking 20MB downloads of .mov files. There are scripts
available, and some still images, but it would take some work to convert this
into (for example) an accessible SMIL presentation. So it depends on demand.

  Yes, we discussed at meeting today that we would reference the WSTW video
  (page up soon!) in the "further reading" (with changed heading) section,
  and maybe break out some clips from that eventually.

  Can't recall where I put my OzEWAI disc, I can hunt...
