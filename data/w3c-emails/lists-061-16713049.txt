(Flippant summary: Trust me - I've seen this work in the real world with real
developers doing real work on real software...)

The real explanation:

I spend a fair bit of time talking to developers of sites, and of web
software. Quite often I find that they do not actually know how people with
disabilities use the Web, and it is very helpful to be able to give them an
idea. This note is short, sweet, and to the point. Other things I use are the
videos on the OzEWAI CD, excerpts from the WAI video, demonstrations on my
own laptop (turn off the screen, get it to read out what is happening, and
try to navigate the web...), or getting someone who has a particular
disability to demonstrate thow they go about using the Web.

It makes a handy reference for documents like the Accessibility Features
of... series of Notes, so that developers who are left scratching their heads
at how a person with a disability could use their system at all can get an
idea.

  If you were even remotely typical of the expected audience, I would agree.

  The only times I will ever refer to it will be to work on it. In fact I
  find it hard to believe that you "needed" much that would be found herein
  <g>. The reasons for harping on bizcase/policy/curbcut are sub-textual and
  to some extent subliminal. The reasons for embedding failures is to lend
  some reality, particularly for PWDs who know full well that none of this
  stuff works anywhere near as well as painted.
