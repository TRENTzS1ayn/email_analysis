I do not feel it is necessarily appropriate to give positive outcomes in all 
the scenarios. We can say there is much to be done.
Learning disability naturally represents a range of ability.

The supermarket scenario is realistic, if only for a very small percentage of 
the most able. I have requested further information regarding what facts it 
was based on, as it could represent a great motivator.

My clients (~100 seen every week) have problems navigating the web: 
navigating and finding information is extremely complex. 

None the less, i do feel that music sites, that provide small pictures of 
stars, with links, music videos, and sound tracks, are doing much to enable 
our clients to enjoy  their experience.
