I think if you can write a scenario that conveys the joy of that experience 
it would be wonderful.

I'm sure there are lots more "success stories" available and the fact that 
so many more are possible might well be communicated so that, e.g. parents 
of people who will likely never do any of the things in the current 
scenarios can still have representatives that have some reality for their 
own experiences.

Inclusion isn't just for the so-far-included.
