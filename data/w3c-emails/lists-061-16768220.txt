Guidelines for Accessing Alternative Format
Educational Materials

Barbara Nail-Chiwetalu
March 1, 2000

Introduction

Individuals are unable to benefit from standard print materials for a 
variety of reasons. Some are unable to read the print due to blindness or 
significant visual impairment. Others are unable to manipulate the 
materials due to a physical impairment such as cerebral palsy or multiple 
sclerosis. More recently, persons who are unable to process printed 
information due to a learning disability resulting from a physically-based, 
organic dysfunction have been included among those eligible for some 
alternative format services (e.g., National Library Service for the Blind 
and Physically Handicapped and the American Printing House for the Blind). 
Regardless of the reasons why a person is unable to benefit from standard 
print materials, students of all ages, elementary through postsecondary, 
require access to information in formats that will provide them with 
equivalent learning opportunities to those who are able to benefit from 
standard print. Alternative format materials include Braille, audio 
cassette, large print, computer diskette, CD-ROM, or human readers. Those 
most commonly used in educational institutions are Braille, audio cassette, 
and human readers, with electronic formats gaining in popularity.
