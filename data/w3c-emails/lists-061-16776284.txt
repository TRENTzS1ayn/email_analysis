My apologies for the email, but would the Microsoft points of contact  pls
email me.  Sorry, I deleted my email, where I know you are on there

We have some opportunities to discuss that will benefit us and the Education
and Outreach.  Would like to discuss putting together a road show for all
the regions where accessibility is discussed.  I have been trying to hit up
the southwest region to put a seminar on to introduce the state, local and
federal (and commercial) and universities to accessibility. I think if you
pitch this idea to Microsoft and then we can coordinate this.  We may be
even able to put on a day long seminar where we showcase PWD using various
screen readers.  What would be better if we could team with IBM in Austin
(Jim, care to put some skin into the game?), Adobe, and others.

As an alternative, we could do this initially just for dallas.  I am willing
to meet with Jim in Austin - fun city <smile>

Have contacts at SMU and could see about marketing to the local colleges.
