My apologies for missing the meeting. I was at the hospital..... with my
fiance...not good.

Anyway, here's my response. It should be noted that I have access to a lot
of general lists for Web developers. I've also been compiling a list of
government/military and educational Webmasters. I'd like to maintain
control over these lists but I will send information to them.

f. Webgrrls - international with hundreds of local chapters- very good
