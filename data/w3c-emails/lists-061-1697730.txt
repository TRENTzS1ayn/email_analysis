Good point. I have an writer starting for me in the February issue. He's
going to write about authoring Web sites for PR companies. Plus, as a
result of doing product reviews for the newsletter, I am in touch with 74
of the major technology PR firms. Each firm has sent me contact information
for 1-5 reps. I got so much e-mail....I sorted them into seperate mailboxes
in Eudora... :)

Needless to say, I never delete anything.
