Rita is an excellent speaker. I met her at XML '98, where she was a
panelist at the wrap-up session. She asked for leads on accessibility.
Do you have a package appropriate for her? I haven't sent her anything
yet.

She would like to include some accessibility material for their 
clients. She's been in the publishing business for perhaps 20 years.
