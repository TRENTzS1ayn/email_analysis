Members of the EO:

I apologize for being out of contact -- it is, unfortunately the result of
being spread too thin. At any rate, things have settled down long enough
for me to let you know that I signed a contract with IDG Books in November
to publish a book on Web Accessibility. If you are a working member of the
EO and would like to review the outline of the book, please contact me by
e-mail. You are welcome to review and comment on it -- but I would request
that you not distribute it outside of the EO. 

Naturally, I would like to use the book as a means for highlighting the
work of the WAI. I've offered a couple of suggestions to Judy to accomplish
this function. I suspect she will present them to you soon. I am open to
any suggestions that you might have to build WAI awareness through the book
-- particularly if it's innovative and creative. 

I also indicated to Judy that I would be happy to make review drafts of the
chapters specifically discussing web accessibility to those interested. You
will be under NDA. The scope of the review should be on a technical level
(in other words, my editors already provide me all the feed back that I
need for style, format and construction). I will make a similar offer to
members of the GL group.

I am, needless to say, quite excited about this book. IDG is putting in an
incredible effort to publicize it. If all goes well, we are timing the
release of the book with the WWW8 conference in Toronto.

Regards and thanks,

Mike
