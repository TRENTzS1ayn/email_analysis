WAI EO Meeting :

Reminder that we have a call tomorrow, Friday, January 15, 1999.
Time: 8:30 a.m. - 10:00 a.m. US EST.
Phone bridge: US: +1 (617) 252-1038

European participants: Please NOTE that there is not a bridge in France
this time. We were not able to get the INRIA bridge this time, and also
have been hearing that it is actually more expensive to call
country-to-country in Europe in most cases than to call direct to the US.
Could the EOWG members in Europe please confirm whether this in the case or
not.

Upcoming calls (make sure these are on your calendar):
January 22
January 29

Agenda to follow.

Regards,

Judy
