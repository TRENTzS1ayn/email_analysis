Everyone's comments have been incorporated into the list and posted to 
http://www.webspots.net/eo/pr_list.htm (15kb).  This is located here 
temporarily on my web site and there is no link from the root directory.

Please advise if anything is missing.  I still need to add more training 
sites, professional organizations and magazines.  I have just rebuilt my PC 
<ugh> and have not had time to load all my data <another ugh!>.

Thoughts?  OK, I have one.  I was trying to build the categories off the 
three areas: university-related, industry and government, but this 
categories are disjointed.  This is a draft and we can reorganize for 
clarity as we move forward.  Does anyone have any comments or items to add? 
 Right now the information is slanted towards groups in the United States. 
 Once we have more info for other countries and local areas we can always 
break out each category by country.

Are we going in the right direction to make a list that could be used by 
Public Relation Firms?  I also foresee this as as a resource for us and to 
others?

Many thanks!  Rob Neff
