Rob,

Thanks for getting this going. In response to your questions, I'd suggest
keeping the list focused, and being more comprehensive in fewer categories.

In the minutes from last week's discussion of a possible PR campaign
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/990108_EOWG_Min.html#PRcampaign> the action item
was to compile training contacts, and that alone would be quite valuable.
Probably you should rename it a "training contacts list" and focus it more
on that theme. 

The categories most relevant as a training contacts list then would be 
- professional internet related associations
- magazines
- training
- government Web consortia
- Web-based builder resources
I think more comprehensive lists of the other categories already exist,
such as disability organizations, which we can link to. The magazine list
may duplicate what BK compiled; Daniel, can you compare those?

Yes, I agree that it is very US-heavy, and it would be a good project for
someone on EOWG list to research comparable Web-related training contacts
in other countries. Who wants to take that on? The international and
national level contacts are the most useful, then down to state or
provincial-level contacts if available. I question including local contacts.

Also I'd recommend finding e-mail addresses, even if generic for each site,
to add to this list; otherwise it is not really usable as a contact list
but rather is a kind of portal.

In regards to your question about whether this list could be used by a PR
firm, that depends. The more focused it is, the more likelihood it could be
useful in a PR campaign, since any PR strategy would likely select
particular audiences to reach with a tailored message.
