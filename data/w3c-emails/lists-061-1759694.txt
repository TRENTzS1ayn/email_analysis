WAI EO WG Agenda, January 15, 1999
Time: 8:30 a.m. - 10:00 a.m. US EST.
Phone bridge: US: +1 (617) 252-1038

[European participants: Please NOTE that there is not a bridge in France
this time. We were not able to get the INRIA bridge this time, and also
have been hearing that it is actually more expensive to call
country-to-country in Europe in most cases than to call direct to the US.
Could the EOWG members in Europe please confirm whether this in the case or
not.]

-------------
Web Characterization Activity, notes on data wanted; please review & comment:

[this was a rough first pass at the types of data needed for baseline
assessment of Web accessibility, and for assessing changes over time in
complexity of Web access issues as multimedia increases, as legacy browsers
are superceded with those with better accessibility, etc.]

1. What we want to know:
A. Is the Web getting more or less accessible (measured across sampling of
automatible guidelines)
B. Can we link trends to causes (many factors: availability of Web
technologies,  guidelines, promotion)
C. What is the deployment of new/legacy user agents? of browsers
implementing new access supports? of legacy browsers needing proxy supports?
D. How should we be adjusting our strategies?

2. Examples of static information--that can be sampled over time:
(Beware not assessing accuracy of alternate information)
A. Do all images (IMG) provide alt-text?
B. Do all applets (APPLET) provide alt-text and content?
C. Do all image map links (AREA) provide alt-text?
D. Do frames have titles?
E. Do pages that contain frames have fallback NOFRAME pages?
F. Etc?.

3. Static but marginally testable, or untestable
(Beware involves subjective assessment)
A. Do stand-alone audio files have a textual transcript of all words spoken
or sung, & 
significant sounds?
B. Do server-side image maps provide text links for each hotspot in the
image map?
C. Does audio associated with video have a textual transcript of dialog and
sounds?
D. Do foreground & background color combinations provide sufficient contrast?
E. Do scripts presenting critical information or functions provide
alternative, equivalent 
information through NOSCRIPT?

4. Dynamic behavior
A. For sites using longdesc, what volume of hits to that information? 
(once this is implemented)
B. In a SMIL multimedia presentation, what is the frequency of access to 
captions?
C. What is the frequency of access to an audio description track 
synchronized with video? 
D. Etc...

5. Performance data related to style sheet usage
A. To what extent does full usage of style sheets for presentational 
mark-up speed transmission time? (once this is more measurable) (e.g. this
kind of data supports universal design benefits of broader deployment of
style sheets, which also helps accessibility)

6. User Agent & Device Trends
A. Changes in user agent distribution which support different access 
features?
B. Changes in device distibution which parallel some access 
requirements, & /or create new access requirements (such as mobile 
phones, TV-based Web)

7. How much of this testable with existing 
resources?
A. and how much requires more consistent/ and/or sophisticated Web 
characterization tools?
B. how much would benefit from greater consistency, reliability, 
automatibility, sustainable, comprehensive...
