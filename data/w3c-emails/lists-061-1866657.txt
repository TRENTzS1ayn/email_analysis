Greetings EOWG,

I'm working on a collection of alternative browsers and screen-readers for
one of the EO deliverables.   this is for reference and to help check pages
with different browsers and combinations of browsers and screen-readers.

this may be discussed during Friday's meeting, and I'd welcome any
suggestions for improvements or additions.

In particular, there could be a third section for "mainstream alternative
browsers" such as LYNX, Opera, net-tamer ..., would this be helpful?  And
can you let me have references for any others, Arach.... and others I can't
call to mind.

the first draft is at http://www.soundlinks.com/absr.htm.

Regards,

Peter.
