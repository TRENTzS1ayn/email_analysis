  Greetings EOWG,
  
  I'm working on a collection of alternative browsers and screen-readers for
  one of the EO deliverables.   this is for reference and to help check pages
  with different browsers and combinations of browsers and screen-readers.
  
  this may be discussed during Friday's meeting, and I'd welcome any
  suggestions for improvements or additions.
  
  In particular, there could be a third section for "mainstream alternative
  browsers" such as LYNX, Opera, net-tamer ..., would this be helpful?  And
  can you let me have references for any others, Arach.... and others I can't
  call to mind.
  
  the first draft is at http://www.soundlinks.com/absr.htm.
  
  Regards,
  
  Peter.
