A couple of new browsers:

EIAD, developed by Rob Seiler, is a browser meant for people with learning
disabilities in particular. http://gippsnet.com.au/eiad/eiad.html

Tango is used becuase it has good mulitlingual support.

To clarify: Emacspeak is not a browser, it is a speech output system for
Emacs. The fact that emacs can incorporate so many functions - a shell,
editor, some browsers, mail package, etc, means that it is somewhere
between a screenreader and a speech-output enviroment which can include a
browser.
