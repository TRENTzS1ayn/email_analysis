WAI EO WG Agenda, January 22, 1999
Time: 8:30 a.m. - 10:00 a.m. US EST.
Phone bridge: US: +1 (617) 252-1038

[European participants: Please NOTE that there is not a bridge in France
again. We continue to hear that it is actually more expensive to call
country-to-country in Europe in most cases than to call direct to the US.
If this is a problem, please let us know.]
