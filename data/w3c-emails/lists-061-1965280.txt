BK, 

Yes, that's exactly what the User Agent Guidelines Working Group is for.
Jon Gunderson is Chair, and I am cc'ing this message to him
<jongund@uiuc.edu>.

If you can put whoever at Netscape is actually working on accessibility
implementations in touch with Jon, or even directly with the working group
where it's been discussed, that would be appreciated all around. UAWG is at
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA>. 

Thanks,

Judy
