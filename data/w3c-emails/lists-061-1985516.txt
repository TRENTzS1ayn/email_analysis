There is no recommended technique, it's really browser/platorm
dependent.

On Windows/IE, you can hit F14 or something like that, and get a
propoerty sheet with a direct link to the longdesc doc.

On another platform, right button click and a context sensitive menu.

On another platform, a little D-link might be added inline.
