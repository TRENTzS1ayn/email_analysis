There are several possible "handouts" mentioned in our meetings and the
first, quicktips card, is very nearly a *product*.  There has also been
talk of a brochure.  I would like to add to the mix a version of the
checklist which could be a two-sided letter-size card with perhaps the
quicktips card as a "punch-out".  The checklist need not follow the same
order as, or duplicate the wording of, the one on the GL but of course
it should make the same points.
