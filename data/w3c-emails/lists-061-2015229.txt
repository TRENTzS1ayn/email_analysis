I like this. Other reactions? 

If we want to do this, we should plan for it before finalizing various
"alternate" formats for the QuickTips (bookmarks, large print, etc.) so
that they would work well together.

May be hard from a timing perspective, since the QuickTips content can be
frozen way before the checklist content could.
