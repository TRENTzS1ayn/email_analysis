This thread is confusing me.  Maybe it's just the semantics.  I do not
consider "math" to belong to any particular interest group.  Even
historians use math on occasion.  Math and scientists use it more, but...

My understanding of the latest conversation is that people writing "math"
should use mathML.  If they use images instead, they should reproduce the
math as LaTeX.  Am I correct here?

I have no major problem with this recommendation.  My only concern is that
authors who don't know LaTeX (e.g. probably most historians) might just
ignore the recommendation, but if the recommendation were broadened to
permit words as a less desireable alternative, they might not ignore it.
