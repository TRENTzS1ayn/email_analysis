There are two issues related to math in the guidelines.

Issue 1: The specific recommendations on how to author mathematical
representations.

Issue 2: Where will the recommendations appear in the guidelines.  
Will there be a  guideline (primary document) directly referencing math, or
will math be mentioned only in the techniques document( examples of how to
do things)?  
In the later approach the primary guidelines document would probably have
no mention of math.
