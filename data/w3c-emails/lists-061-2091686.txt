Jim:

I suspect that this is a decision that needs to be made by the EO as a
whole. The W3C copyright does allow me to copy them, as long as I include
the W3C copyright statement along with each document. My problem is that I
have completed the Appendixes to the book. I was hoping to hear more
response from folks last week so I coud get a feel for everyone stood.
You're the only one I've heard from. I'm hesitant to do anything without
support.

On the other hand, we decided today to include the WAI Checklist as part of
the book cover (inside).  

- Mike
