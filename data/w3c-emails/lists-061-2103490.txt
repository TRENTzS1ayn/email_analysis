I don't see any reason to single out "Math" and "Science" in 
the Guidelines. What particular accessibility issues do they raise?
What distinguishes those subjects from Architecture or Philosophy
or Art History?

I could see adding a checkpoint to the guidelines that reads
something like:

 "Where it's possible to mark up content (for example
  mathematical equations) instead of using images, 
  use a markup language."

Then, in the techniques document, one could talk about
using MathML to mark up math content.
