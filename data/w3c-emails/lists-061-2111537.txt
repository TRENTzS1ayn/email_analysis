Mike,

It's a decision that has to be made by W3C/WAI, not the EOWG. You sent your
message on Friday afternoon; I have been checking several things as it is
not only an issue of W3C copyright but of the Working Draft status that the
guidelines are in. I suggest you allow more than one business day for
feedback on questions such as this.

Which checklist are you referring to,
