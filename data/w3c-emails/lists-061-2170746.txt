In the Status line of Lynx 2.8 an imagemap is given as a link to
LYNXIMGMAP:http://wherever/it#is

Is the status information available to Assistive technology?

  There's a test for image maps at
  
  http://astro.temple.edu/~kasday/web_access/image_map.html
  
  The user agent should make available the ALT text for the image itself,
  inform the user that there is a series of ALT tag'd links, present those
  links, and allow user to select any of them.
  
  Also, for "extra credit", the user agent should 
  
  1. at user's option, skip the ALT tags or go through them one by one.
  
  2. give a keyboard shortcut method, e.g. initial or highlighted letter, to
  select an item.  Especially useful for nav bars that are used frequently.
  
  At this point I don't know of any browser that does all this, even without
  the "extra credit" parts.
  
  
  with JFW 3.2
  Netscape doesn't show AREA tags.
  There's no mode in which MSIE shows both the AREA ALT's and also the ALT
  for the IMG.
  
  Lynx 2.7.1 is not fully satisfactory either.  It gives all ALT tags, but
  when the user encounters the link it just just looks like an ordinary link
  which the user must select to get to the AREA alt tags.  Thus, it relies on
  proper IMG ALT text for the image to hint at menu it leads to.  It would be
  better for the browser to explicitly say that there is an "image map"  or
  "menu" etc.  (I don't know what best words are for beginner).
  
  I've been told, but have not personally verified, that 
  pwWebSpeak
  HomePageReader
  emacspeak +w3 
  
  give the ALT tags for individual AREA's but from the answers I got so far I
  don't know they give the ALT text of the image itself.  
  
  None of the browsers do the "extra credit" features.
