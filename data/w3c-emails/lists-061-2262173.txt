/WAI/EO/waicard4.htm is the version we worked on curing the call.

I haven't changed it since the call.

/WAI/EO/waicard5.htm is the new version I modified, making it even
shorter to be able increase one point to 8 points.

To do that, I used FrameMaker with a real business card template.

For those who can see, check /WAI/EO/waicard5.ps for actual layout.

in waicard5 I trimmed the title to
   Quick HTML tips for 
   Accessible Web Site

> In 2. does "text alternatives" mean *alt*?

yes, I changed that already.

see the hardcopy, it doesn't save much room

I really think we need the rationales.

ok with me. It adds some space on this line and on this side, which is 
packed right now.

doesn't fit on the first side this way.
