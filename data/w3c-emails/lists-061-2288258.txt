That's why I didn't talk about ALT text as such.

I have changed mine - it allows for the mechanism that I think OUGHT to be
used in the future, which is A type links in a MAP with areas specified.

  I think, as a practical matter, for maximum accessibility right now, if

  This is because I think there are more browser/screenreader combos that can
  handle the tables, than there are that see the ALT text in AREA tags. (My
  earlier email pointed out summarized problems with NN and MSIE and ALT
  text; I believe, that they read tables cell by cell with most or all
  current screenreaders however). 
  
  On the other hand, if this card is aimed more at the future, when all user
  agents do what they are supposed to, then it's fine as is.
  
  Personally, I'm more worried about right now, even though it's messier.
  Which would mean omitting injunction against tables for layout, and adding
  words about redundant text links.  
  
  At any rate, that's what I'm doing with folks I advise now.
