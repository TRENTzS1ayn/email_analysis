suggestions on trimming words making easier sell:

>Tables Don't use tables for columnar layout. Have data make sense when
read row by row. Provide a summary. 

Suggest omit absolute "Don't use tables...".  Just say

7. Have data make sense when read cell by cell.  Provide a Summary.

This shrinks more, omits what would be touch sell and really isn't neccesary.

"without mouse or monitor" is really asking average webmaster to use JAWS
or some such, which is unrealistic I think.  Also, this omits need to turn
off sound.  And "check your work" could be omitted.  How about

10. Validate the HTML & CSS of your site. Use evaluation tools and all-text
browser to verify accessibility. 

Or

10. Validate the HTML & CSS of your site. Use accessibility evaluation
tools and test with Lynx and no sound.

Both are a bit shorter.
