rob neff>I hate to be a stickler for redundant conversation on this.  How
are we providing input to people who use tables that have two columns? The
example I use is Table Width is 600 Pixels. Left column is 150 and contains
navigation bars.  Right Column is 450 and uses the cell width to contain the
text.

When I discuss with people the need  to not use tables to format text, then
the next question is what about tables with navigation bars.  Designers can
understand not using tables to format tables, but what about navigation bars
in HTML 3.2. As this is heavily used, these people need to be provided more
concrete direction.

Please note that I do not see "in HTML 4" as the appropriate answer,
because, intranets and internets are using HTML 3.2 and some will not go to
IE 4.  So I need to stress, HTML 3.2 is the bridge for at least another
year.  If you need more proof, some government offices will not go to HTML
because they do not have the disk space for all computers and some have
security fears for IE 4.  Like it or not, this is the environment.

On our just released redesign, I took out tables which also decreased
download time, except for when the servers are slow - which is almost always
at my former job <frown>

P.S.  The internet web site, www.usmint.gov, is not universally accessible
and we will be starting a redesign soon to address these issues, but it
takes time.
