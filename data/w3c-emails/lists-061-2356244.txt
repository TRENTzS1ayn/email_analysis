I'm not really in favor of asking for duplicate anything to be added
to the page.

But I'm happy with the way Charles phrased it: 
  Image Maps Use client-side MAP and provide text links for hotspots

which can be read either way: ALT text on AREA, or dup text in
addition to AREA. Depending on your willingness to support legagy
browser, this leaves some freedom.
