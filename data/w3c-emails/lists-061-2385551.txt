    I really think it has to 9 point, so we definitively need
    to drop the rationales (see above) 
    It could also be what Charles has used:
  
             Quick HTML tips to make your site accessible
  
    but I prefer to mention "Web Site" than "to make".

CMN::

    is way too long for 9 point, I have shorten it to:
  
       Complete Guidelines at www.w3.org/WAI
  
    and William to:
  
       Guidelines & Techniques: http://www.w3.org/WAI
  
    I think http:// can safely be dropped.
    I prefer to mention "Complete" than "Techniques", but not strongly.

     rationales need to go.
  
     Charles proposes:
  
      Use headings, lists, lang attribute, for structure. Use CSS for
      layout and style. Be consistent
  
     which is a close fit at 9 point, and I have
  
      Use headings, lists, lang attribute and consistent structure. Use
      CSS for layout and style.  
  
     which is a little shorter and is I think better because it's not
     bound to "just" heading, list and lang *for* structure, but open with an
     "*and* consistent structure" which can include fieldset, quote, etc.

CMN::
how about

Use headings, lists, lang, etc. for structure. Use CSS for layout. Be
consistent.

  Now on the verso side: as I said, we can keep it with rationales at 8
  point, but I have made an attempt to shorten for 9 point as well,
  while using some of William and Len's comments.
