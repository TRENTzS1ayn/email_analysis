I think that since this is mostly for an intro and entirely in English
that it's OK to leave out the part about LANG.  

I still don't think the word "attribute" is ever necessary.  I still
believe that some type-face semantics will get the point across.

When I made my card at http://dicomp.pair.com/card.htm I moved the
"Quick HTML..." and "Guidelines..." up so that they were between the
logos and this enables at least 4 items on obverse side.  It is
conceivable that if the title is "Quick HTML tips for Web accessibility"
that this phrase could be in *10 POINT* thus looking more like a real
title.  The sub-head might be "See www.w3.org/wai for details"

5 Links  Use meaningfull link text. No "Click Here".  I really like this
one.  It's actually "meaningful".

"Have data make sense when read cell by cell."
"Make cell by cell reading sensible."
