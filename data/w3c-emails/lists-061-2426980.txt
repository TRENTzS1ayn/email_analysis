I'm running a cross check between the card and the guidelines (last
version + issues resolved in the last couple of telecons)

P1 missing from the card:

   - Don't use color to convey information
   I guess we're fine with tips 4 on Page Org. In any case, it's hard
   to have a negative as a tip.

   - Ensure that the source of each frame is a markup file
   I say we can safely ignore this one, kind of extreme case

   - refresh only happens after a link has been selected 
   - Avoid any blinking or updating of the screen that causes flicker.
   It's fine with me that we don't mention these, but that's propably
   because I'm the one argued for them to be P2 for a while.

   - A.14.3. non-W3C technology alt page
   On the one hand, I consider the quicktips to be for HTML only, so
   it's a Not Applicable, but it is part of Website design, so I don't
   really know. Not to ease the issue, it's the longest
   guideline/checkpoint text...
