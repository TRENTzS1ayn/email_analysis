This probably isn't our responsibility but I was doing some research on
blindness statistics and came across the Web site for the organization
"Research to Prevent Blindness." While it may be argued that the
organization is working to prevent blindness and not work with people
already visually impaired, I ran their site through Bobby and found them to
be very inaccessible - (no ALT attributes, use of frames and tables for
layout etc.). What is WAI EOs stance when coming across sites like this?
Should we actively approach the organization and mention the
inaccessibility of their site?
