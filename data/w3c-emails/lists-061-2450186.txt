Fantastic work summarizing the discussion, Daniel.

>           Quick HTML tips for Accessible Web Site
> 
>           Quick HTML tips to make your site accessible

Why Quick? The word "Tips" -- not to mention the size of the card! --
signal its intent. I think it's good to say HTML. I never liked the
rationale in the title; it was a grammatical quagmire: .... including
people with disabilities, handheld devices... etc. It read as though
handheld devices need quick tips! 

"HTML tips to ensure your Web site is accessible (to everyone or everybody
or to all)" 

or 

"HTML tips to make your Web site accessible (to everyone or everybody or
to all)"

Every sentence needs a verb. Don't omit articles when they fit.

"See the complete guidelines at www.w3.org/WAI"
"See the guidelines and techniques: www.w3.org/WAI"

I prefer the first.

> 1 Images & Animations 
> 
>    Use the alt attribute to describe the function of all visuals. 

Some visuals create functionality. Other visuals are purely aesthetic,
which may or may not be functional. 

Is it desirable that web-authors describe ALL visuals? "This is an
aquamarine, 4-point line section-separator with ice cream and a cherry on
top?" What do the guidelines say about this? Anyway, I propose:

"Use the alt attribute to concisely describe visuals."

> 2 Image Maps 
>  
>    Use client-side MAP and text link for hotspots.

"MAP" and "link" must agree in number with Image Maps. Therefore:

"Use client-side MAPs and text links for hotspots."

> 3 Multimedia 
> 
>    Provide captioning and transcripts of audio, and descriptions of video. 

Should it be captioning AND or captioning OR? 

"Provide captioning or transcripts of audio, and descriptions of video."

I find the second example clearer. I would add "a" and "the" 
where needed to improve readibility. "Style" may be too techie; is
"look-and-feel" better? Or just drop style -- CSS says it.

"Use headings, lists, the lang attribute, and a consistent structure. Use
 CSS for layout." 

"Use headings, lists, the lang attribute, and a consistent structure. Use
 CSS to layout pages." 

> 5 Hypertext Links 
>

"Use link text that makes sense when read out of context."

or revisit the first draft:

"Ensure that each link makes sense when read alone."

"Summarize the data, or use the longdesc attribute."

Remove the comma after Applets, add "the" after "in case." I think we can
drop "inaccessible." If scripts and applets were well-supported, they
would be accessible. Can we leave out "active?"

"Provide alternative representations in case the active content is
unsupported." 

"Provide alternative representations in case the content is unsupported." 

> 8 Frames

Add "the" if it will fit:

"Label each frame with the title or name attribute."

"Ensure that data makes sense when read cell by cell. Summarize. 
 Use CSS to format columns."

Change "textual" to "text."

"Validate the HTML. Use evaluation tools and a text browser to verify
accessibility."
