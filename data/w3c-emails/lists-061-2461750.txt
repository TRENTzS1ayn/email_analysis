I don't know about dropping the Quick in Quick Tips. It's kind a
catchy as a name (the WAI Quicktips card).

Adding "to xxx" might be possible, but by dropping a point size for
the title.

Sounds OK.

The guidelines insists that what goes in the ALT is the function of
the visual, not the description of the visual. So you don't find "this 
is a line of yellow duck", you find "" for ALT in that case.

Actually, it's one MAP with multiple hotspots. Does that change ?

I think it's both ?

I think Style is CSS is not obvious to everybody and needs
to be mentioned.
Adding articles is nice but it doesn't fit anymore.

I need to check if this last one would fit in 9 point.

The only reason I shortened this one is to fit in 9 pt.

Please comment on whether or not you think it's worthwhile before
proposing to re-add the text.

A browser can support something and this something is inaccessible,
like JavaScript with OnMouseOver activation, or PlugIn in Shockwave.

"content unsupported" feels awkward.

I will check if it fits tomorrow (I'm home on a serial connection)

Issue with that is that CSS is not really supported everywhere for us
to ask specifically to use it.

Last version has text-only. Is that better ?
 

I would really like people to give opinion on the font size choice.
