Although our efforts is constrained by the guidelines, must be genuflect
before the guidelines when something is unclear? What are its authors
trying to say here? I will re-read this section of the guidelines and see.
"Function" of a visual means little to me.

The word should agree with the title, which is "Image Maps." How about:

"Use client-side MAPS and text links for each hotspot."

How about:

"Structure pages with headings, lists & CSS. Use the lang attribute.

Here's a shortened version:

Summarize, or use the longdesc attribute.

How about 

"Provide alternative representations in case features are unsupported."

True, but CSS is mentioned elsewhere in the card.

Yes, I agree. "Text-only" is more precise.

Personally, I did not find the original card challenging to read. It is,
however, preferable to err on the side of bigness than smallness. 

I don't think we should get too caught up with the issue of font size. 
That's the job of the graphic designer. Graphic designers know how to play
with typefaces, leading, kerning, scaling, etc. to make things fit. We
should not compromise transparency of meaning for the sake of a handful of
words. Our primary job is to distill the guidelines into a clear and
succinct form.
