This last wording implies, to me a least, text links separate from the
image map as opposed to ALT text for each AREA in the MAP.  A previous
version of these guidelines had it as "alternative text" which was
ambiguous enough to cover both the ALT text as well as separate links.  

My personal (minority)opinion, as I've mentioned, is that we should
explictly mention both.  But if we can't have that, I guess the
deliberately ambiguous version would be better.
