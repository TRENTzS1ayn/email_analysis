I completely disagree - the logical corrollary is that it would be ok to
leave it out of a card in Japanese is it were an intro for japan. (I
think).

  I still don't think the word "attribute" is ever necessary.  I still
  believe that some type-face semantics will get the point across.
  
  When I made my card at http://dicomp.pair.com/card.htm I moved the
  "Quick HTML..." and "Guidelines..." up so that they were between the
  logos and this enables at least 4 items on obverse side.  It is
  conceivable that if the title is "Quick HTML tips for Web accessibility"
  that this phrase could be in *10 POINT* thus looking more like a real
  title.  The sub-head might be "See www.w3.org/wai for details"
  
  5 Links  Use meaningfull link text. No "Click Here".  I really like this
  one.  It's actually "meaningful".
  
CMN::

Use meaningful link text. No "click here". Doesn't quite explain it -
click here is meaningful. What we are trying to capture is the idea that
it must make sense without a context. But I am having trouble thinking it
up.
