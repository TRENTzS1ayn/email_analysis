Overall: the set is great!

I'm using some of the examples and noticed couple of lapses etc. Here are
some of them.

1. The list of techniques and guidelines look too similar at a glance. It
is difficult to keep track where you are and in many places you don't
easily get back and forth between them.

For instance, if you go to
http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/gid/a12s1-0.htm

It is difficult to notice that you are in a totally new level of
techniques. The title is same as before, only thing that changes is a
little number somewhere and I didn't notice it until after looking really
hard.

Now, if I want to go to the main guidelines list from

http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/gid/overa12s.htm

I have no idea of how to get there. There should be at least links or icons
for the guidelines and techniques TOCs available everywhere.

2. If the 4th item is recommended in

http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/gid/b4s2-0.htm

shouldn't it leave out the "Click here" part?

3. To me these sample lists with all the labelling look really distracting.
Probably because there is only one "a" under each item numbered and the
title already states first, second etc.

http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/gid/a6s2-0.htm

I wonder if there would be a better example of this.
