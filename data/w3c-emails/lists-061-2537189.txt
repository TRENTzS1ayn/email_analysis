After some discussion on GL, it seems that LANG is going to stay a P2, 
so we don't have to mention it at that point. 

I was thinking of reusing the space to mention "no color to convey
information" but that's way too long.
Maybe we can just add: No blinking, as in:

Page Organization 
  Use headings, lists, and consistent structure. Use CSS for layout
  and style. No blinking.
