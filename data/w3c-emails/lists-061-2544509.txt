example: a magnifying glass: function is "search", a colorful logo,
function is "home page", little worker digging the ground: function is
"under construction", etc.

I don't see why we need to use plural here, it just makes it longer.
(MAPS is not a valid element name anyway)

Taking into account Len's comment, which I might have read the wrong
way since I removed "alternate" based on his input, I suggest:

  Use client-side MAP and alt text for hotspot.

You don't really structure with CSS, you style. That's why it's a
separate sentence. lang is now gone.

I like this one better that what we have now.

We don't have "," anywhere in the card, so I'm not sure it's needed.
I've added "the" and it sort of fits, but as you say, the final
designer will make the cut if needed.

Hum, features doesn't quite convey the active nature of script, applet 
and pluging. A feature is really anything.

> True, but CSS is mentioned elsewhere in the card. 

CSS is operational for regular styling, but not really to replace
column layout.

My reading of your comment is that we can err on the side of the "too
big" and trust the graphic designer to shrink it to fit, without
removing any word.
