I think I wasn't being clear.  My suggestion would be something like

"Use client-side MAP with ALT text plus text link for each hotspot."

Once internet explorer, opera, and netscape navigator show the ALT text for
each AREA when used with popular screen readers, we can shorten to what
Daniel wrote aside from inserting "each" before hotspot, and changing "and"
to "with".

Use client-side MAP with alt text for each hotspot."
