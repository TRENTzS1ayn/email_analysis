Yes, good to include other formats. A few thoughts tho

Alternative doesn't have to be on separate pages, e.g. when you use OBJECT.
Non-w3 might be accessible or it could be possible to make them accessible
(e.g. work on VRML at Toronto)
I agree with concern that folks don't know what "w3 formats" are.

How about

Multimedia Provide captioning and transcripts of audio, 
descriptions of video, and accessible versions of
other inaccessible formats.
