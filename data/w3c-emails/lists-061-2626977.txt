The ambiguity in my version (Use client-side MAP and text links for
hotspots) was deliberate. It implies redundant text links (which can be
achieved using the HTML 4 version of MAP, or by providing redundant text
links.

  I think I wasn't being clear.  My suggestion would be something like
  
  "Use client-side MAP with ALT text plus text link for each hotspot."
  
  Once internet explorer, opera, and netscape navigator show the ALT text for
  each AREA when used with popular screen readers, we can shorten to what
  Daniel wrote aside from inserting "each" before hotspot, and changing "and"
  to "with".
  
  Use client-side MAP with alt text for each hotspot."
