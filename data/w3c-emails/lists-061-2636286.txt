I would prefer to say 'Provide captioning and transcripts of audio,
description of video, etc' - these are Quick Tips, not a substitute for
the guidelines.

If it made a difference to layout I would leave out captioning. But I
would not substitute 'captions' for the reasons I explained on the call.

  After the review of the GL P1, I feel that we need to add something
  related to using non-W3C formats. I'm trying to extend Multimedia,
  since it is most likely the reason/area where people use non-W3C
  format (VRML, PDF, ShockWave, etc)
  
  It now reads:
   Multimedia Provide captioning and transcripts of audio, 
   descriptions of video, and alternative pages when non-W3C  
   formats are used.
  
  That's another 3-liner, so I need to swap the Link and Page Org item
  from recto to verso to make it fit.
  
  I also think "No blinking" is not very good, at least not in the Page
  Organization tips.
  
  Waiting for more comments on waicard8 or previous versions to generate
  a waicard9...
