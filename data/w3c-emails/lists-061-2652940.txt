Let's try to get consensus on the card within EO today, so that Judy
can send it to WAI IG and GL for review asap.


Changes from version 8:

 Image Maps Use client-side MAP and alt text for hotspots. 

goes back to

 Image Maps Use client-side MAP and text link for hotspots. 

I agree with Charles that it's better to cover both alt text (whether
in AREA or in new MAP model) and redundant link text in one sentence.



 Multimedia: Provide captioning and transcripts of audio, 
 descriptions of video, and accessible versions when
 non-W3C inaccessible formats are used. 

Since there is room for clarity, let's try to use it.

First, let's not equal non-W3C and inaccessible, as the Java
accessibility effort are real.

The way Len had phrased it: "accessible version of non accessible
formats", it sounds as if we're asking people to use an accessible
version of a format, not a page.

I also think the current wording covers the use of OBJECT (i.e. not
necessarily need a separate page).

We could use "when other inaccessible formats are used" instead of
"non-W3C", but since the guidelines mention non-W3C, I think we can
use it as well.

To Alan: HTML is not is only accessible format, in fact, it can be
inaccessible, as the other tips prove.

To Charles: are you really suggesting we use "etc" ? Very few people
would know what to swap this etc for IMHO. We need to be more
specific, without including the whole guideline 30 lines of text.


Watching us working on this, I haven't seen a clear need for numbering
the tips, so I removed the counter and just used dot for each tip in
this version. I think it looks better. Tell me what you think.
