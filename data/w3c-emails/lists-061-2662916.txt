Dan,

Its looking better, and I have several comments:

1.  Can we put a revision control number on the cars.  Very small print and
possibly in on corner.  I fear that as these circulate and revisions are
made, we may not know which version of which we are speaking.

2.  Use CSS for layout and style.  I could not agree more with this.
Suggest,
"Use CSS for layout and style where practical", or
"Use CSS for layout and style or accessible HTML"

3.  Last item, wish we had room to say something about also testing on voice
web browsers and screen readers.

We are not at HTML 4 yet and we have a bridge gap to fill until such time.
Again I think this sends mixed signals to the user community.   How many
people use CSS?  Not many that I see.  Seems we are suggesting that it needs
CSS to be accessible.

Going to work, if there is discussion, please copy me at work.
