I'm not sure you've seen my argument.

How about "wherever possible" ?

A few other changes showed up in waicard9 since this morning:
  - In my local office review here in Sophia, someone told me we
    should emphasize the word "function" in the Image tip
  - the same person didn't get the "read out of context" (and he's not 
    a HTML beginner to say the least) so I added back the 'No "Click
    Here"' piece.
