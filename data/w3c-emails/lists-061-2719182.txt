I'm overall happy with the new card, but I'm still uncomfortable with the
deliberate ambiguity in

> Image Maps   Use client-side MAP and text link for hotspots.

What does the deliberately ambiguous "text link" translate to?  That
designers should provide

      alt text AND separate text links 
or
      alt text  OR separate text links
or
      alt text
or
      separate text links

???

I predict that different readers will interpret differently, and that not
all will interpret the way we want them too.

Sorry to be such a nudge here, but I think this is such a critical item
that we should invest a few extra words to be clear.
