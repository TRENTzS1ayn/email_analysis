Marja,

Thank you for your comments on the Page Author curriculum.  I notice from
the URL's that you are quoting that you are looking at a very old set.  You
must have missed the messages that indicated the new curriculum set is at
http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/one/

Judy, Geoff and I ask that people hold off on comments about the curriculum
slides for a week or two.  We are working on some major revisions will
announce when we are ready for the working group to comment.

However, I suspect that some of your comments will still be valid for the
newer curriculum slides.

CPL:: I agree.  The "fourth-level" slides were not originally planned for
in the design, hence they are not automatically generated by Slidemaker
with all the current linking and associated style.  They were created by
hand from earlier templates.  In an upcoming revision of the curriculum,
your concerns will be addressed.

CPL:  I think you may be right.  I will look at ways to improve that example.

CPL: I think this has been changed in a recent update.
