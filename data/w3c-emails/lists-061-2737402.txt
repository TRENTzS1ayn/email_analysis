You're right and I think that's good.

At a minimum, we want to get
  alt text OR separate text links
and with this wording we might get 
  alt text AND separate text links 

I know you're worried that we only get 
  alt text (and no separate text links)
but that's only a P2 right now, so I think it's OK.
