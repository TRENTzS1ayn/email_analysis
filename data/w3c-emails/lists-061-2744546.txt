Daniel,

What you say makes me more comfortable with this.  

Since we understand that all interpretations are valid, this gives me some
freedom in how I'll use the card.  When I use the card with agencies that
are obligated to serve a wide public, e.g. gov't, I'll interpret it as alt
text AND separate text links.  When I'm working with organizations that
know its users have browsers that handle the ALT text (e.g. a company that
properly equips its employees)  I'll intepret it as ALT.

So count me in the consensus for this version (although since I'm not
officially in EO you don't really need it <grin> ).

(BTW I'm hoping for acceptance of Geoff's suggestion of omitting "non-W3"
in the other format tip).
