The actual example waicards9snapshot.gif prints (2.4" x 4.2"),
about 120% of the US business card (2" x 3.5"). It looks like the
point size in the text of the *.gif is about 11 pt, so the
scaling of the gif, up 20%, is consistent with 9 pt at the
2" x 3.5" card size. I assume the latter is your objective.

1. Suggest you run the HTML against tidy. It gives 5 suggestions,
one of which messes up result, as there is a missing </ul>. 
2. Make DOCTYPE refer to a proper DTD: do we want HTML 4.0?
Both the W3C and WAI homepages use:
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">
3. Change <HTML> to <HTML LANG="en">.
4. Add <META HTTP-EQUIV="Keywords" CONTENT="Web Accessibility Initiative,
WAI, Accessibility, Web page design"> to help 
search engines find this URL. [I gather that some search engines
may choose to only see the HTTP-EQUIV=..., rather than the
<META NAME="Keywords" ...>. Is that right?]
5. Make <TITLE>WAI Accessibility Tips Business Card</TITLE>. Suggest
consistent alt text on the two images: Now are:
"W3C logo." and "WAIlogo."   Why the periods? They aren't in the
guidelines.
6. Many endtags are missing.
7. The lettercase of names in tags is inconsistent.
8. Replace "&" by "&amp;"
9. Repair residue of former <ol start=5> <li start=5> ... </ol>, first </ol>
of which is missing. Now they are <ul>...</ul>

Amen.
