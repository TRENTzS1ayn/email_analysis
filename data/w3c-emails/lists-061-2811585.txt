I think we have a winner: http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/waicard10.htm 

Thanks Harvey for the HTML validity review, it now passes
validator.w3.org and is also tidied-up.

Regarding your comment

Yes, the gif is just to show the layout, not the real size. It wasn't
clear so I modified the sentence introducing the link. I have also
attached a Color PostScript of the card, which is at real size (gives
same size as the pilot when I print it).

(the day we don't need a gif and ps but can only use CSS font-size and
other positioning and printing properties to do that dual layout is
going to be a great day)

Judy, I incorporated most of your comments.

I took the <em> out on "function" but I insist we keep the word
itself. It was discussed heavily on the GL list and people really want
ALT to indicate which function the visual performs, not to indicate a
description of the visual (see my examples to Alan: "search" instead
of "little magniflyer glass"). For purely decorative graphics, the
function is nil and ALT="", which is different than no ALT - which is
invalid).

My intent with 
    No "Click here"
  was to convey some kind of genericity, as in 'No "click here" kinda
  stuff please'
  I now have
    Hypertext Links: Use text that makes sense when read out 
    of context. Do not use "click here" for instance.
