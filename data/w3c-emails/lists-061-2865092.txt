Sorry, I was a bit unclear. It is not the comma I have a quibble with, it
is the use of 'when' instead of 'in case'.

  Writers often use the comma to separate lists of items. However, it's not
  necessary to use that comma for the last list item preceding the connective
  (in this case, "and"). Functionally, the comma and the connective (and) do
  the same thing. But, I won't quibble over style.
