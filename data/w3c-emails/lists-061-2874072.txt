For someone who has expressed an interest in "freezing" this card I just
had a (perhaps absurd?) mild reservation on looking at the finished
item:  the word "complete" is both adjective and verb and for some
reason it struck me funny at 5 AM.

At first I thought "just leave it out" because *of course* the linked-to
guidelines must be *complete* or we wouldn't use them as reference; and
of course we aren't asking the reader of the card to *finish* them!

If we must modify "guidelines" perhaps "full" will do.  I dunno but on
balance I still vote to cast the plates and print on.
