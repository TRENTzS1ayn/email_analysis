No, they are exactly the same thing (remember ALT is the function)
so we're talking redundancy here, for legacy situation mostly.

The last version has "Use CSS for layout and style wherever possible"
which I think covers your (and others) worries that we're asking too
much to authors.

"Accessible HTML" is all this card is about, I don't think adding it
here is adding anything.

OK thanks. I don't want to argue again about this one.

Please keep in mind this is just a tip.
