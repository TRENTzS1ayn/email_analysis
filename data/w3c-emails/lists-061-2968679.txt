I'd support Bob's comments questioning the requirement for CSS on this
card, even though I agree that it is very desirable to have.

I was going along with the reqt, but I'm swayed by Bob's comments plus my
experience this morning in a meeting on helping ordinary people, like
liberal arts college profs here at Temple, who are not professional web
page designers, write accessible pages.  

CSS is only P2 in the guidelines.  We're comfortable dropping other P2's
(e.g. explicit reqt for separate text links for image maps).  And the
guidelines have further qualifications, viz.

"A.6. Checkpoint 4: Use style sheets to control layout and presentation
wherever possible as soon as a majority of browsers in use support them well"

I'm worried that some people who would only have to do a couple of simple
things to get their sites accessible would get turned off because we want
them to use CSS instead of <B> </B>, and indeed imply that they should
retrofit their old pages to be accessibile.  It could also turn off people
with pages laid out with tables that are quite accessible with lynx,
pwwebspeak, home page reader, and NN and MSIE  3.0+ with screenreaders of
that vintage.
