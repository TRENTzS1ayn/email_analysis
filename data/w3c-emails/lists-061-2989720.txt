Now that the QuickTips card is past the "design" stage we should begin
looking to what's next.  The CheckList that is part of the guidelines
might be a good place to start.  FWIW my first proposal is for a
two-sided version on card stock (perhaps with a punch-out of the Tips).

We should examine what we think the audience will be and decide on the
order of things.  The current draft of the Checklist at: 
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-19990115/full-checklist

is up for comments, etc. but I think whatever hard copy version we agree
on might be very different as to layout and sequence (or not, if that's
what gets decided).

As a first approximation we might think of it as something an author
would consult while creating a Web site.  It is also posssible for it to
be distributed in books and at conferences, etc.  The version at the
above URL has links to the main guidelines but the sequence seems to me
to be a bit off: I don't think the first item on anything should be
"don't use color to convey information" but let's discuss it.
