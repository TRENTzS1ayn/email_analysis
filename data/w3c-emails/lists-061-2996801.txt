For cognitive stuff you could check out Rob Seiler's work on EIAD

http://www.gippsnet.com.au/eiad

although I think it is targeted really towards adults with cognitive
disabilities

  I am part of a project here that is building a kid's page for the US MINT.
  This is in part sponsored by a grant and will serve to educate kids.  This
  will be used in schools and teachers are assisting in the development.
  
  I came in late in the game here and am scrambling to ensure universal
  accessibility and a complete testing process.  Does anyone know of any work
  done for Kids with disabilities such as usability testing and cognitive
  understanding?  
  
  Also, does anyone have any contacts at Galladet University?  Would like to
  set-up a discussion with people there on any research for kids with
  disabilities and possibly more.
  
  Thanks, rob neff
