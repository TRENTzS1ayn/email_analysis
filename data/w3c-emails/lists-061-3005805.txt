Hi everyone!

Since I'm a new member toi the EOWG I thought it would be nice to introduce
my self.  First, as you know from the heading of this email, my name is
Sophie.  I am 30 years old.  I am currently living in montreal and I speak
French as a first language..  I have cerebral palsy, which affected mostly
my haND COORDINATION.  I started using a typewriter at 6 years old.

I did a master's degree in communication, where I had the chance to learn
most of multimedia related software (DIRECTOR, Photoshop, after effects,
etc).  My masters degree consisted in doing a 300MB autobioigraphical CD-Rom
(it is autobiograhical: so it is about: myself!!).  I  used this CD-ROM both
as a way to learn the nuts and bolts of multimedia and to have something
creative as a testimony of who I am.

This experience led me to realize to the importance of access to both
software and information highway for people who have disabilities, even
worse than mine.

I still have to figure out why, but I still haven't found a job in AT, here,
in Montreal.  I have, however, succeeded in getting a few articles published
in local newspapers (in French).  I feel that my participation will teach me
a lot on web accessibility and sustain me in promoting web accessibility in
French community.

But, mostly, I really hope that my contribution to EOWG will be both
valuable and appreciated.  I still have to feel that I can be of use in this
world!  I really believe in the accessibility as a right rather that a
privilege and hope to contribute to have this right respected.

On a more personal note, I am someone who paradoxically is both critical and
 very open minded.  Collaborators, beware!!!

I have been invited to go to Florida for a week, leaving tomorrow.  I will
thus be unable to attend the next conference call and will be silent  (don't
feel disappointed, when I'll be back I will greeeaaatly compensate for
it!!!).

I will carefully each eowg mail when I come back and will, most probably,
add my insights.  In the meantime, I would appreciate people to send me an
intro about themselves(directly to me, not to overload the list)...  I look
forward to know in what kind of game I involved myself!!!!!

Sincerely
