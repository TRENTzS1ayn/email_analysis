with alt in bold or not ?
putting it in bold clearly points at the attribute (used in AREA) and
leave out both the inline alt text (that Len wanted to have expressed)
and the new MAP content model with text in A (that wendy mentioned).

I suggest we use this sentence with alt not in bold.

Agreed.

my mistake probably, we had "wherever possible" and it was never my
intent to remove it.

is that a ; or a : ? I would prefer a :

I guess it's too much asking to see a image of the preprint ?

how about re-adding "non-W3C inaccessible" ?
