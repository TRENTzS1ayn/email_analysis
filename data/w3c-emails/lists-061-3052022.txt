Discussion on image map item follows. Statement on waicard10 currently reads:

"Image maps. Use client-side MAP and text links for hotspots."

Even if we know what we mean in real life, the challenge with the reference
card is to get this into an absolute minimum of words, as a conceptual
prompt, with the expectation that people will refer back to the guidelines
for additional information. 

We can't use a general statement as long as the one above. Do you have a
(short) proposal, or a reaction to Daniel's proposal? Here are Daniel's
comments from this morning:

>> ...but if others agree it should be changed to read "Use client-side MAP
and
>> alt text for hotspots," please let me know, & that's what we'll do.

Replacement proposal is "Image maps. Use client-side MAP and alt text for
hotspots." Are we missing an obvious other approach? Is either version a
"show-stopper"?
