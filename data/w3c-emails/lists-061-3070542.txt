Latest summary of comments:

Note another comment we have received from Michael Muller of Lotus:

>1.  On Frames, I suggest:
>     "Frames. Label each frame with a unique and descriptive title or name
>attribute."

Item currently reads "Frames. Label with title or name attribute." 

We have a space constraint here, but could do this: "Frames. Label with
unique title or name attribute." 

Reactions? I will use this unless disagreement.


>> 1.) image map comment...

Here is the latest proposal from Wendy:

>>Discussion on image map item follows. Statement on waicard10 currently
reads:
>>
>>"Image maps. Use client-side MAP and text links for hotspots."
>>
>this is better, 

This is actually what the card already said...

>although people may interpret it to mean "provide separate
>text links elsewhere on the page" unless they read the GL Techniques
document.
>

>Use client-side MAP and provide text for each hotspot.
>
>too cryptic?

Yes I think this risks being misunderstood; I could image someone putting
bit-mapped text on the hot-spots and not realizing it is a problem.

Will leave as is.

Will add back in, but as "where possible" due to space.

Yes, sorry given time constraints, but I've copied the latest version in

>how about re-adding "non-W3C inaccessible" ?

So then "Multimedia" would read: "Provide captioning and transcripts of
audio, descriptions of video, and accessible versions in case non-W3C
inaccessible formats are used."

Does this automatically equate non-W3C formats with inaccessible formats?
Is that always a valid statement?

Also, Gregg, can you re-state what was confusing about the "accessible
versions of inaccessible formats"? In your view is this (a)
incomprehensible; or (b) incorrect? And do you have a (short) proposal of
how to fix?

Without further proposal, I will leave as is.


LATEST CARD CURRENTLY READS:

Quick tips to make accessible Web sites

For complete guidelines & checklist: www.w3.org/WAI

- Images & animations. Use the alt attribute to describe the function of
all visuals.
- Image maps. Use client-side MAP and text links for hotspots.
- Multimedia. Provide captioning and transcripts of audio, descriptions of
video, and accessible versions in case inaccessible formats are used. [OR:
some change in last phrase?]
- Hypertext links. Use text that makes sense when read out of context. For
instance, do not use "click here."

- Page organization. Use headings, lists, and consistent structure. Use CSS
for layout and style where possible.
- Graphs & charts. Summarize or use the longdesc attribute.
- Scripts, applets, & plug-ins. Provide alternative content in case active
features are inaccessible or unsupported.
- Frames. Label with unique title or name attribute.
- Tables. Make line by line reading sensible. Summarize. Avoid using tables
for column layout.
- Check your work. Validate the HTML. Use evaluation tools and text-only
browsers to verify accessibility.
