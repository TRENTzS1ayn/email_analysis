I like that one.  It is a bit ambiguous, but as I mentioned before (and as
Daniel and Charles recommended) that amgiguity is an advantage because if I
use it with someone I'm working with I can interpret it as AREA/ALT alone
or redundantly with separate text links, depending on what kind of
browser/screenreaders we can expect users to have.
