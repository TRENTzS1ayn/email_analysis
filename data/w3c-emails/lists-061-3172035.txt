Time: 8:30 a.m. - 10:00 a.m. US EST
Phone bridge: US: +1 (617) 252-1038

AGENDA:

1) Outreach & Updates
2) Report/debriefing on WAI card production formats
3) Presentation proposal discussion (including recent rejections)
   - how soon can the events calendar go public?
4) Flyer drafting (see really rough draft text below). Discussion:
   - needs much more zip
   - needs much less text
   - yes, will need design assistance but today let's focus on content
   - and perhaps think a little about format: are tri-folds passe?
   - needs more narration on the wonders of accessibility & device
independence
   - needs less lists
5) Agenda for EO meeting at CSUN
6) Planning upcoming meetings schedule

Web Accessibility Initiative

"The power of the Web is in its universality.  Access by everyone
regardless of disability is an essential aspect." 
 -- Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web

[inside front panel]

The Web has become a vital medium for education, employment, commerce,
civic participation and recreation. The World Wide Web Consortium's Web
Accessibility Initiative seeks to ensure that the Web is a barrier-free
medium for people with visual, hearing, physical and cognitive disabilities.

Web accessibility solutions offer benefits to other users such as those
with mobile devices, low bandwidth, or with no audio output.  

W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) is a partnership of industry,
disability organizations, research centers and government. WAI pursues
accessibility of the Web through five complementary activities:

*  Ensuring that Web technologies support accessibility
*  Developing guidelines for accessibility
*  Developing tools to evaluate & facilitate accessibility
*  Conducting education and outreach
*  Monitoring and engaging in research and development

Quick tips to make accessible Web sites

For complete guidelines & checklist: www.w3.org/WAI

- Images & animations. Use the alt attribute to describe the function of
all visuals.
- Image maps. Use client-side MAP and text for hotspots.
- Multimedia. Provide captioning and transcripts of audio, descriptions of
video, and accessible versions in case inaccessible formats are used.
- Hypertext links. Use text that makes sense when read out of context. For
instance, do not use "click here."
- Page organization. Use headings, lists, and consistent structure. Use CSS
for layout and style where possible.
- Graphs & charts. Summarize or use the longdesc attribute.
- Scripts, applets, & plug-ins. Provide alternative content in case active
features are inaccessible or unsupported.
- Frames. Label with unique title or name attribute.
- Tables. Make line by line reading sensible. Summarize. Avoid using tables
for column layout.
- Check your work. Validate the HTML. Use evaluation tools and text-only
browsers to verify accessibility.
