Mike Paciello notes:

"The Assistive Devices Industry Association (ADIA) of Canada:
http://www.starlingweb.com/adp/as00015e.htm

Officially, this is not a home page -- yet. However, the Assistive Devices
Industry Association of Canada provides an incredibly useful service through
this web page by providing a complete listing of all disability related
conferences. "

It does not list W3C or XML conferences. They haven't made the
accessibility-awareness of this group I guess. Someday?
It has contact info, including URLs, but not deadlines for submissions.
