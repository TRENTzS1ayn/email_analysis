CMcCN: " I feel that something along these lines justifies the volume it
adds to the document."

WL:: How many similar instances are proposed?  Enough to warrant yet
another document?  Or perhaps a major expansion of the Introduction? 
Need guidelines serve as be-all/end-all exemplars of completeness or can
we assume some participation from the audience?  

I think the examples given are cogent and well-chosen and have a place
but the question of where? persisits.  Again who's the audience?  What
do they already know (and when did they know it?)?
