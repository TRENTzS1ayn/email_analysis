  I think that the principles given are the complete set, although I have a

  I expect some participation from the audience - people who write
  applications are not fools, although by and large they have never run
  across accessibility (any more than the people we cite in the 'explain
  accessibility in help files' checkpoint). I think what we are striving for
  is a document which can be read and give somebody a terse but accurate
  explanation of what needs to be done. I think we should also outline some
  strategies which could be used, but I would prefer them to be in a
  separate techniques document.

    WL:: How many similar instances are proposed?  Enough to warrant yet
    another document?  Or perhaps a major expansion of the Introduction? 
    Need guidelines serve as be-all/end-all exemplars of completeness or can
    we assume some participation from the audience?
