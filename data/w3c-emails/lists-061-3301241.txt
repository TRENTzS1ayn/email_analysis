My red face is not just from my all-nighter! I misspoke this morning 
about a new version of Bobby.

The version I recently downloaded is the same beta version 
    Bobby 3.0b3, build 002     with file of 1999/07/28
File sizes slightly incased since I first downloaded it: 5797216 bytes, 
vs 5786177 that I had on my old machine. I find the FAQ describes the
differences between Bobby 2. and Bobby 3.0. Basically they assert they 
are tracking the WAI guidelines.  

David Clark had said last Fall that a new version was due in January. 
I had thought this was it. Only in checking after my statement on this
morning's teleconference did I find that it was still the old beta release 
one. I have email for the bug reports I had turned in, where I find the 
version numbers matched. 

I assume Chuck Hitchcock or David Clark will give us proper notice when
the new release becomes public.

Regards/Harvey
