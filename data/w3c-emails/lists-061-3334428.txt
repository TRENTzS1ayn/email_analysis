I would have thought that a web resource that wants to be a textbook as
well should meet some additional requirments.  The DAISY digital talking
book concept of a "table of navigation" is one example.  Did the Texas
project review the DAISY /NISO model in any depth and was there a conscious
descision not to go beyond the general web content requirements as set
forth by the WAI?
