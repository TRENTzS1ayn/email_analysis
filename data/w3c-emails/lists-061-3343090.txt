Before the world of "distance learning" gets completely out of hand we
might consider a special mission of getting outreach to anybody in that
industry.  A search produced too many to deal with on a one-on-one basis
but http://www.bergen.org/DistanceLearning/hotindex.html has a lot in
one place.  

I started to deal with http://www.imsproject.org/ via their email
response and will let us know if anything good comes of that one - but
there are *LOTS* of them to cover.  Boiler plate, anyone?
