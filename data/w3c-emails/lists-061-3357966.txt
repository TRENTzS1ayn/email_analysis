Web Accessibility Initiative

"The power of the Web is in its universality.  Access by everyone
regardless of disability is an essential aspect."

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative

The Web is a vital resource for many of life's activities. News, education,
employment, government, commerce, recreation -- people with disabilities
need access to all these areas. 

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international, vendor-neutral
consortium promoting the interoperability and evolution of the Web. The Web
Accessibility Initiative (WAI) addresses accessibility requirements of
people with visual, hearing, physical and cognitive disabilities. 

WAI works in partnership with industry, disability organizations, research
centers and governments in the following areas: 

*  Technology
*  Guidelines
*  Tools
*  Education
*  Research

Many Web accessibility solutions emphasize redundant modalities, for
instance ensuring that information can be accessed by either vision or
hearing; or that someone can enter information either by keyboard or mouse.
Therefore accessibility solutions also benefit users of a variety of Web
devices -- mobile phones, palm-tops, kiosks; and users in a variety of
situations -- low bandwidth connections, noisy environments, eyes-busy
activities such as driving.

Quick tips to make accessible Web sites

- Images & animations. Use the alt attribute to describe the function of
all visuals.
- Image maps. Use client-side MAP and text for hotspots.
- Multimedia. Provide captioning and transcripts of audio, descriptions of
video, and accessible versions in case inaccessible formats are used.
- Hypertext links. Use text that makes sense when read out of context. For
instance, do not use "click here."
- Page organization. Use headings, lists, and consistent structure. Use CSS
for layout and style where possible.
- Graphs & charts. Summarize or use the longdesc attribute.
- Scripts, applets, & plug-ins. Provide alternative content in case active
features are inaccessible or unsupported.
- Frames. Label with unique title or name attribute.
- Tables. Make line by line reading sensible. Summarize. Avoid using tables
for column layout.
- Check your work. Validate the HTML. Use evaluation tools and text-only
browsers to verify accessibility.
