I'm starting to advise the distance learning folks here at Temple  on
accessibility.  Their main concern right now is math, esp. math that's in
Acrobat.

Also, around here they prefer term "on line learning" since customers may
be local, e.g. sitting in their office or dorm room.

Please loop me in any conversations that go on if they are not already on
the list...
