Have an invite to, "The Government Accounting Office's 8th annual Federal Depository Library Conference is the week of April 12-15, 1999, at the Holiday Inn-Bethesda in Bethesda, MD."  They asked for a presentation "Tools Persons With Disabilities Use to Interact With the Web."   There will be 500 Librarians there from across the nation.  Not sure how many people will be in our presentation, but any audience is a good audience!
 
Putting together the presentation and am lining up the usual trio and some other folks.  If anyone is in the area and would like to stop by, please let me know - we will introduce you.  More importantly, we could always use your help working the audience before, during and after the presentation!

Daniel Dardailler:  Who do we ask to get at least 500 Quicktip Cards?  Marketing brochures (If they are ready).  Anything else we can pass out?
