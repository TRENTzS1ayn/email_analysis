The business case for accessibility

By enhancing the accessibility of [xxx], the service will be more 
attractive to

1. The 2.3 million adult Canadians who have disabilities (15% of the
population). 

2. The parents and families of children with disabilities. 

3. Individuals who provide services to people with disabili-ties: 
occupational therapists, rehabilitation and biomedical engineers and
assistive technologists. 

4. Organizations that provide services to people with disabili-ties: 
hospitals, private and public rehabilitation institutes, universities and
colleges. 

5. Organizations that deal with accessibility and disability issues: 
advocacy groups, social justice groups, and human rights watchdogs. 

6. Organizations that choose products and services according to some
criterion of accessibility for people with disabilities. 

7. Organizations that train people with disabilities to use assistive
devices. 

8. Seniors: older people tend to have more disabilities. 

9. Children: well-designed pages are easier for children to use. 

10. The millions of people who do not have multimedia computers, who use
text-based browsers, or have slow modems.
