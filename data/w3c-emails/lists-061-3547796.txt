to which I would add:
11. Legal reuirements (obviously)

12. Allowing the expansion of markets through enabling the practical
re-use of low-end machines

13. People who live in areas where infrastructure is poor (this is
slightly different from 10. Saigon and outback Australia both have wealthy
people with fancy computers, but the infrastructure leaves tehm in a
low-bandwidth situation anyway)

  ------------------------------
   
  The business case for accessibility
  
  By enhancing the accessibility of [xxx], the service will be more 
  attractive to
  
  1. The 2.3 million adult Canadians who have disabilities (15% of the
  population). 
  
  2. The parents and families of children with disabilities. 
  
  3. Individuals who provide services to people with disabili-ties: 
  occupational therapists, rehabilitation and biomedical engineers and
  assistive technologists. 
  
  4. Organizations that provide services to people with disabili-ties: 
  hospitals, private and public rehabilitation institutes, universities and
  colleges. 
  
  5. Organizations that deal with accessibility and disability issues: 
  advocacy groups, social justice groups, and human rights watchdogs. 
  
  6. Organizations that choose products and services according to some
  criterion of accessibility for people with disabilities. 
  
  7. Organizations that train people with disabilities to use assistive
  devices. 
  
  8. Seniors: older people tend to have more disabilities. 
  
  9. Children: well-designed pages are easier for children to use. 
  
  10. The millions of people who do not have multimedia computers, who use
  text-based browsers, or have slow modems.
