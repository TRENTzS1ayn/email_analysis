Spain States Net a Universal Right

Spain and France are requesting that the European Union declare Internet 
access a universal right, a status already held by telephone acces, education 
and healthcare.

The move would allow access to be guaranteed at an "accessible price". 
This would allow Spain to finance Net access with funds earmarked by 
Spain's General Telecommunications Lawbypassing the free trade 
provisions of EU legislation. The money would be used to partially 
finance those companies (chosen through a public bid), "willing to 
extend networks to every corner of Spain."

Currently, a little over 6% of Spaniards have access to the Net.
