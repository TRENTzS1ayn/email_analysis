WAI EOWG:

Please review the following draft note
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/NOTE-css-access-19990309> and comment on-line
this week. We will discuss & ?approve? at our EOWG meeting this Friday,
March 13. It is being jointly reviewed by WAI PFWG & the CSS/FP WG.

This is the re-write we have been discussing of CSS accessibility features.
It will replace the less formal description of access features at
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/css2-access>, and the new document will
be submitted as a formal W3C Note.

Judy
