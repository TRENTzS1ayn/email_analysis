The first sentence of the section, "How Style Sheets Benefit Accessibility"
reads:
       "CSS benefits accessibility primarily by separating document structure 
       from presentation. "
Don't we usually say:
       "CSS benefits accessibility primarily by separating document content
and structure 
       from presentation. "
Not a big deal, just a thought.

Also, in the section, "Spacing, alignment, and positioning", the example
uses WORD-SPACING to insert white space between the letters of the word
"hello".  If that is true, then what the heck is FONT-STRETCH for.
Intuitively, wouldn't you expect WORD-SPACING to increase white space
between whole words?  (Please note: I haven't looked at the CSS2 rec. to
see what it says... though it probably would have been faster than typing
this paragraph).

Then, way down in the section, "Generated Content" there is a typo - "th"
should be "the":
CSS2 adds international list styles to the styles defined in CSS1. 
         See th 'list-style-type' ...
 
Cheers!
