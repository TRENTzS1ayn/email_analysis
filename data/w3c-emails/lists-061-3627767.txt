Education & Outreach WG,
Protocols & Formats WG:

If you are planning on attending the WAI meetings following the CSUN
Conference in Los Angeles next week and have not registered, please note
that you must pre-register, but you need to do so immediately.

Also, please note that the Marriott Hotel, where the WAI meetings will be
held, still has some rooms available under the W3C/WAI room block. You must
ask for this block; the CSUN block is sold out. If anyone has had any
trouble registering under this block for either Saturday or Sunday nights,
please let me know. 

Information on meeting registration and hotel reservation is available at
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/1999/03/agenda.htm>.

Regards,

Judy
