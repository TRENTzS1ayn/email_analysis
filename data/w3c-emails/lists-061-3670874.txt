I don't think Amaya gives enhanced accessibility to anyone at the moment.
As an authoring tool, it implements some accessibility features in the
code it produces.

Ultrasonix is a screen reader for Xwindowxs under Solaris (I believe).
There is a linux version of Ultrasonix, but I am not sure how stable it is
yet. It is available from TRACE, but I don't have the URI.

SVLpro is a screenreader for linux. Again, I'll look up the URI
