NCAM's Web Access Project has uploaded new version of an accessible SMIL movie.  You can find the new clip at

ftp.wgbh.org/incoming/ncam

Download CAR.ZIP.  After you unzip the file, you can switch between English and German audio and captions by doing the following:

1.  Open the Options Menu
2.  Choose Preferences
3.  Choose the Content tab
4.  Choose English or German from the language menu
5.  Turn on the enable captions option at the bottom of the window.

You should see captions and hear full audio (that is, program audio plus audio descriptions) in the language of your choice.  If you don't want to see the captions, just uncheck the enable captions option from within the G2's Preferences menu (step 5, above). 

I will be showing this clip, as well as others in different formats, at my CSUN session on Accessible Multimedia on Thursday, March 18, at 8:00am in the Marriot Denver room.  

Let me know if you have questions.
