Both Monday and Tuesday, I am attending the (United States) Federal Webmasters course.  There was a good interchange of information especially on legal aspects.  Thumbing through the book noticed there was a tab for ADA.  Spoke to the instructor and I will be presenting the PWD section for the class.  Think we should rename that section, Universal Accessibility.  Any comments?

Anyway, all federal webmasters go through this course and they are also trying to develop a certification.  The course runs about 20 to 40 people a month and I will ask to present future Universal Accessibility sections.

The instructor also regularly briefs all the Federal Chief Information Officers (CIO).  Trying to get Universal Accessibility on the agenda. 

Plus the NEW video would be great for the course as well as the CIO Brief.  

Judy, pls send about 200 WAI Quicktips cards to:

and when they are printed, please send about 200 full size Quicktip phamplets.

cheers!  and goodnight!
