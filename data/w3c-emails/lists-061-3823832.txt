>2) Preparation of FAQ for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
JB "in the event that" WCAG becomes a recommendation: planning 3-part
release to include a FAQ. - Nominations for key questions to go on the FAQ?

I read with teh comments with great interest and here are my comments here.

The major problem i see implementing the WCAG is getting the contractors,
managers and developers trained and up to speed.  I am running a project now
where I have an outside contractor that will design to the spec, but really
is not familiar with it.  I have introduced them to bobby, the html
validator, WCAG and they and we have missed some things in the Qualit
Assurance check.  I am literally taking each page and showing to all our
other developers and managers and showing them pwWebSpeak and Lynx and
Bobby.  Oh yea, i have my own responsibilties too.  This project is a rapid
appplication development and is to be turned in thrity days.  Two major
design changes have  now impacted time allocated at the end to address
testing and universal accessibility issues.

Because the US Mint is somewhat operating as a commercial site (than the
rest of the government) we need to be sharp and clever in the design.  Plus
we all inherited a poorly designed site and have been patching it - too many
graphics used as borders and spacer gifs. We are going to need to train
graphic artists, HTML coders and programmers on universal accessibility.
This will take time WHILE WE CONTINUE TO OPERATE AND ADD to our regular
site.

Can we consider getting some training providers on board to start training
people - like federal employees?

Managers are looking at the bottom line and we help them reduce their costs
to redesign.
