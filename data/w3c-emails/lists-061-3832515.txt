Have we or anyone ever discussed training guidelines for companies to use to train their employees.  We need to spoon feed the world on universal acessibility and what better way?  I would have said "training standards" but that can convey a certification and not sure if we want say this?

That way a company can say they are following the "WAI recommended" training guidelines.  For example, the course could use the WCAG and actuall experience with multiple browsers.  The guidleines could be us to make people aware of the problems that PWD face and to educate.

Is this something we can do? or ask a non-profit or training people to do for us so we can post on the web?  We or a training company could be a certifying offical or body for other training companies that want to do this.

In the Washingotn DC, several conpanies have expressed doing this, but arent sure how?

Anyone else care to brainstorm on this!
