Is there a comprehensive list that has all browsers and devises and thier versions for people with disabilties?  Could we maintain one or would this for another group's responsibilities?

Say I want to download an older version of pwWebSpeak to use or test and then delete, I have to go find it.  Same with all versions of the GUI browsers. lynx, emacs and screen readers, webtv.

Could we form a relationship with all the browser and devices and have them provide us the links to older versions on their sight. Can we maintain all the older versions.

Like many poeple, I am hunt for the information and still dont always know where the other stuff is.  Especially if i am away from the my desk.  I have some links at <http://www.webspots.net/mas_ref.htm#Web Browsers>
