Hi Rob,

The "Alternative Web Access" page that I'm working on for EO is the nearest
thing I know to what you want.

It's still a draft, and I have a bunch of additions and amendments from a
recent meeting still to add, but it's a start and I'll incorporate your
suggestions as far as possible.

The current draft is at:
http://www.soundlinks.com/awa.htm

Kind regards,

Peter.
