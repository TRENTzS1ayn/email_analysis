Correction to the imminent submission deadlines:

Education and Technology II: Exploring Ethical Issues and Interactions 
http://www.cde.psu.edu/C&I/Education&Technology/
State College, PA 9/16-18
Originally listed with
Submission Deadline: 4/30/99
Has the following info on the web site:
Deadline for submission of abstracts (100-200 words) is May 15, 1999. 
Authors will be notified of acceptance by May 31, 1999. Four copies of 
completed papers (3500-4000 words) are due September 1, 1999.

This conference currently doesn't seem to be looking at disability
access issues. Does anyone know if the organizers would welcome this
addition to their focus on privacy concerns in educational technology?
If they do it sounds like a good forum for policy discussions.
