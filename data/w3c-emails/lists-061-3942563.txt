Hi Mike,

CanADIA, or the Assistive Devices Industry Association of Canada, is an
trade association representing the interests of manufacturers and
developers of assistive devices based in Canada.  The devices can be
high-tech, low-tech or anything in between.  For its members, CanADIA does
national and international promotion, distribution of strategic business
information, identification of partnership opportunities,  and lobbying of
governments to improve or change regulations that negatively impact on our
industry sector and ultimately our customers (i.e. persons with
disabilities).  The  CanADIA Website (although it is quite accessible) is
not really aimed at consumers or the community but is intended as an
information resource for the industry.  The URI is
http://www.starlingweb.com/canadia/  

For our members and the general public, we do maintain the Calendar of
Events in Disability, Rehabilitation and Assistive Technology.  It can be
found at http://www.starlingweb.com/adp/as00015e.htm

Hope this helps,
Regards,
Chuck
