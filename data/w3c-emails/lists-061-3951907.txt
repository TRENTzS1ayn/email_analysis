I happened to be dealing with "Rights" stuff and encountered this site:
http://www.bazelon.org/ and ran it successfully through Bobby and upon
congratulating the director of communications of Bazelon got this nice
reply.  It is all too rare to find such but maybe EO is working even
though Lee seems unaware of WAI, but maybe the webmaster is.

attached mail follows:
Thank you. I took a quick look at Bobby and will relay this 
to our webmaster and ask him to add it (and, as time 
permits, to run other pages through). Good idea!

As long as you're putting labels at the bottom of your 
site, you might
want to indicate your obvious commitment to accessibility 
by displaying
the Bobby logo, which you qualify for.

http://www.cast.org/bobby/index.html is where the 
"certification" occurs
and I just put your home page through it successfully.
