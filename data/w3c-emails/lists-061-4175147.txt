I am on the Education and Outreach Working Group and these are my beliefs
and not a comment from the EO.

We need to remember our audience that we must reach is both technical and
non-technical. Actually i argue they are more non-technical. This group has
become conditioned to instant gratification - unlike members here that
understand the issues and can disect the points verbatim.

People want to learn and are already taxed in a fast paced environment with
zero overhead.  They are pushed to be more productive so margins can be met
at corporate.  We are throwing so much at people.  I give presentations and
eduacate people/groups constantly in the DC Metro area and other spots
across the USA.  So I see the looks on people's faces contantly.  Here is a
simplistic scenario for a developer.

1.  Comprehend what universal accessibility is.
2.  Understand what their audience is up against so they "get it"
3.  Sell this to their boss so they "get it".
4.  Obtain approval to work on the redesign.  If they are turned down due to
timing or poor presentation, hopefully they continue with the next steps.
5.  Read all literature - including WCAG and train.
6.  Test concepts so they get up to speed and train
7.  Implement without someone there who has any experience doing this.
8.  Tell their manager they are compliant.
9.  Train everyone else.

We all are working on many processes to help UA along.  Formal training and
certification is one area and guidelines is another.  I believe we need
another set of Guidlelines or on the next revision that are written so they
can be easily understood and implemented.

Tonight I gave a presentation at the House of Representatives (Staffers &
System Adminstrators) Networkers Association meeting.  I was one speaker
among many talking about univerasal acessibility.  Like many people they are
trying to grasp what this is and what is involved.  They must be able to
sell this to their managers as well as the training, and processes to help
this along. They need time to redesign the site while they are justifing
this  These are the types of people we need to target for universal
accessibility to be a success! We need everyone to help make the WCAG easily
digestable, especially the priority and conformance level.  (One thought
process would be better - keeping the conformanace level since it has
received so much publicity).

Implementing universal accessibility is a passion I share with many here.
To me the WAI's job is full life cycle development that involves all
facets - the groups.  Just so happens, i beleive, the WCAG are now at the
forefront and they need to be easily implemented so all efforts will be
successful.
