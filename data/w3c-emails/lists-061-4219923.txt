In our new website we use css1 for the layout. But the company amking the
sitehave a problem with a page where the user can fill a form with name etc.
and order our publications and then submit the form. If we use css one can
jump from field to field with TAB but  not by using the mouse. If they make
the same form as a table every thing works O.K.  When using the table layout
everything is O.K. with the Bobby test, but my designer wants to know how
this complies with the conformance levels ?
I have looked trough the guidelines and many other  Wai papers including the
curriculum and find it very difficult to explain how to use and interpret
checkpoint 3.3 and checkpoint 5.3. I also checked the page with JFW and
found no problems with the screen reader. Maybe this is a bit out of
context.  But I think it demonstrates some of the problems we face (at least
here in Denmark) when trying to convince designers and web authors to use
the guidelines and they face problems where the recommended technologies
contradict with one another.
