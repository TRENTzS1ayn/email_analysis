Judy, your reminder about the EO meeting in France reminded me to talk to
you
about AIR-Austin as it relates to EO

http://www.main.org/AIR-Austin/

Talented web folks design incredible web sites for nonprofit groups, and are
judged on accessibility criteria!  It's fun, it's politely competitive in
the
true spirit of a Rally.  AIR-Austin has a very race-car feel to it and it's
a
great way to connect to the community. Imagine that you are working with
some of
the most creative designers around AND that you are doing work that will
benefit
many community-based organizations.  Join the race to make Austin the most
accessible city on the Internet

There is also information from Sharron Rush at 512/478-4596 or send email
srush@knowbility.org about how to take this "rally" to any city on the
planet.
