Rob,

To re-interate what Charles is implying in his message, and what I
mentioned in an earlier e-mail, there is a W3C process we need to follow
for hosting workshops. We welcome organizations offering to host, and we'd
need to coordinate closely on this. I've suggested to you in my earlier
e-mail a time we could meet by phone to discuss this. Please let me know if
that time is possible for you.

Regarding having a two-day line-by-line discussion of the WCAG, that is
what the Web Content Guidelines Working Group did for over a year. Current
comments can go to the attention of the WCAG editors' addresses noted in
the introduction to the document. That working group then discusses those
comments for possible inclusion in future versions. 

Regards,

Judy
