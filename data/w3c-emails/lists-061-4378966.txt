JB: Why? Other attributes aren't.

JB: Good point. I meant the reverse: it should be in boldface in addition
to caps, as is HTML.

JB: Please see separate thread under "disparity" in Web Content Guidelines
Working Group for working out a resolution on this.

JB: A clarification -- the Quick Tips card is only a brief summary of the
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0. It isn't a change to revise or
downgrade the priority of checkpoints in WCAG. So, changing descriptions of
video to a lower priority "may" would not be appropriate here. Please look
carefully at the definitions of priorities. They are based on the extent to
which the items, if not done, are barriers for various groups; not on the
extent to which they might "overwhelm" people thinking about doing these.

JB: Not knowing how to describe an event means that we need to make sure
there is guidance on how to do that (have you checked the Techniques
document?) not that we should rewrite the guidelines.

JB: See above re definitions of priorities, and which working group gets to
thrash out the decisions on these, & when.
