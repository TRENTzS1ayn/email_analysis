Here are my comments:
Hypertext links.  I second the proposal to remove the example and add:
"include non-link printable characters between adjacent links"
Graphs & charts. Why is "longdesc" in bold?  All attribute names should be
the same. See also "title"  and "name" under Frames.
Check your work. good idea to make a reference to the Guidelines URL. But
why is text-only browsers mentioned explicitly. In Appendix A in the
Guidelines Text-only browsers are just one of several browsers to use for
validation.
A new point for the Quick tips: Guideline 7 "Ensure user control of
time-sensitive content change" I don't have the wording of the point yet and
suggestions are most welcome. I think it's an important checkpoint. here in
Denmark I see more homepages and websites with auto-redirect, and I can't
see it's covered by any of the existing points.

I have made the first work on translating the Quick tips to Danish but will
await this revision before continuing.
