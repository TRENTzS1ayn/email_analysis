>>Press Release
>>Petition for the Accessibility of the Internet crowned of success
>>
>>http://www.acessibilidade.net/press990709.html Lisbon, 09/07/1999 - Already
>>has a favorable answer the first petition carried out through the internet
>>to a Parliament in the Europe. The "Petition for the Accessibility of the
>>Internet" is Portuguese and was submitted by email to the Portuguese
>>Parliament, in February, after collecting 9,000 electronic signatures in
>>http://www.acessibilidade.net.
>>
>>This petition, innovator in its form and its content , proposed the adoptio=
>>n
>>of a set of basic rules to be applied in the production of the information
>>offered on the Internet by the Government and all other public services,
>>with the purpose of facilitating its access to people with special needs,
>>specially people with disabilities and the elderly.
>>
>>The Parliament, through the Commission for the Constitutional Affairs,
>>Rights, Freedoms and Guarantees, agreed with the intentions of the present
>>petition in the past 30th of June, approving by unanimity a recommendation
>>to the Government so that, considered the suggestions present in this
>>petition, and in the shortest period of time, adopts the necessary and
>>adequate measures to ensure the full accessibility of that information to
>>all citizens with special needs, specially the people with disabilities and
>>the elderly.
>>
>>In report, this commission considers that "In a way, the proposals
>>formulated in this petition follow the same principles that are in the base
>>of the existing legislation regarding the elimination of physical barriers
>>to people with disabilities, specifically the law 123/97, recently approved
>>by the Government, which endorses the adoption of a set of technical rules
>>to eliminate the architectonic barriers in public buildings, collective
>>equipment and the public way to provide better accessibility to people with
>>conditioned mobility. In fact, the digital barriers which we are discussing
>>are only another dimension of the same accessibility problem to the public
>>services of people with special needs, and so it deserves an adequate
>>reflection."
>>
>>This Petition was the first official initiative of the PASIG - Portuguese
>>Accessibility Special Interest Group who joined other efforts that have bee=
>>n
>>developed on other levels to face the same problem, be it at the
>>international level, as the "Web Accessibility Initiative" promoted by the
>>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), or even the "National Initiative for the
>>Citizens with Special Needs in the Information Society" promoted by the
>>Government through the Mission for the Information Society.
>>
>>The Government should now take the measures, so that Portugal becomes the
>>fourth country in the world declaring the elimination of digital barriers o=
>>n
>>the Internet, after the United States, Australia and Canada.
