Building on that idea: I believe that either content and function but not
both are appropriate.

* <strong>Images & animations.</strong> Use the <strong>alt</strong> 
attribute to describe the function or content of each visual.

No. "Mouse only" is no less significant than "voice command only" or 
"keyboard only" for navigation.

Suggest you can use lynx or its simulators to do this. There are other
assistive technologies that will do the intended eye-replacement test.
I don't believe this deserves to be on the card. There will soon be some
guidance from the Evaluation and Repair group about achieving this.
