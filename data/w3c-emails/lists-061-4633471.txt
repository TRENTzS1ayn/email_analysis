Hi Judy,

Will try to make it.  Went "soft" live (no press) with another major site
yesterday (nineteen minutes ago).  and we have to scamble to fix some
things - darn bugs!

The site is www.usmint.gov/kids  and it fails universal accessibility
miserably.  It is high graphics and games - great visuals.  The design had
started before I got there, but like to think that we have made progress.
They are going to make a text version and maintain two sites.  Why?  Because
the Mint is using this coins on this site to teach kids in school about
history, science, and technology and the project team wants to provide the
information to everyone!  This will be a tool for the teachers and has
Department of Education sponsorship and White House visibility.

Not quite sure how games can be made into text using client side javascript
and yet accessible?  Havent thought about it.  Any ideas?

My notes,

1.  I expect to go over to the House of Representatives and present
Universal Accessibility to the web folks and system administrators next
week.
2.  Department of Justice's 508 survey has extended their deadline for
Agency submittals on their IT and web accessibility.  Odd thing is I wonder
if we can see the results, because I want to know how many webmasters are
using CSS.  Better yet, I wonder how many know that it is required for
Double Conformance <sorry, couldnt resist>.
3.  Mid August traveling to Chicago to present Universal Accessibiltiy to
IBM SHARE confernce  - this is their national user group meeting.
