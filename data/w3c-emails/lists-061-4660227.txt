replace 4 (don't use 'click here') with

Write clearly, use images and navigation consistently.

Note:
There is a deliberate ambiguity in "consistently", between doing it in a
manner which is recognisable across the site (very important) and a possible
alternative interpretation of doing it throughout a site (which is also
important, particularly for the cognitivve disability case.)

add to 8 (label frames with _title_ and _name_) Use _noframes_

It is an important part of using frames. simply labelling them is a very bad
practice, which excludes accessibility in non-frames capable browsers (as
opposed to lynx, amaya, which provide access to frames although in a
different way to newer versions of ie, netscape, etc. It is an accesibility
issue in terms of creating reasonable navigation requirements, and although
it is not strictly P1 it is probably pretty close. And for the price of 2
words, the completeness seems pretty valuable.

change 10 (validate work) to Validate. Use evaluation tools, WCAG checklist

text-only browsers are as common an evaluation tool as Bobby. But checking
in a few different tools is not a very good test, and checking thoroughly in
different environments is not practical.
