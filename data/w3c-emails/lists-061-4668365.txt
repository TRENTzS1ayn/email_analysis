I found it a lot easier to find stuff. I suspect I should look at it in
graphic form too, but I will do that later - probably after the meeting.

  For discussion during Friday July 16 meeting:
  
  It was easier to think through the re-organization of the home page using a
  mocked-up page, rather than just send around a list of topics. 
  
  Some links are active, some are not; if we like this set-up I'd need to put
  in a number of sub-pages to back these up. Some links are to resources not
  yet created or finalized, so we can see how it hangs together; they'd be
  taken off the actual home page until they're ready.
  
  Here's the draft re-org:
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/WAI-home
  Here's the original for comparison:
  http://www.w3.org/WAI
  
  Is it: clearer? friendlier? easier to get to find really useful resources?
  easier to use by different audiences? etc.?
  
  I realize it's just flat text for now; we can throw in some styling later.
