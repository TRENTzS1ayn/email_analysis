QuickTips #8:

The argument that only priority 1 items can be on the card is already
broken since "title" attribute is only ever given as an example and
"name" not at all in the checkpoints, therefore "noframe" is just as
permissible.

Proposal:

Frames. Use "noframe"[format shows it as an element]. Use _title_ or
_name_ attribute.
