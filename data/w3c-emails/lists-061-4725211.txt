We saved one line by eliminating "Avoid using tables..." in item 9 so we
have room for the URL of the guidelines in item 10.

Check your work. Validate. Use evaluation tools to verify accessibility
in accordance with http://www.w3c.org/TR/wai-webcontent. Check off all
checkpoints at
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990324/full-checklist.html

perhaps we can get shorter URLs for both those docs??
