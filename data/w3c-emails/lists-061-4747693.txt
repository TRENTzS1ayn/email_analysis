My old home e-mail is what's on the list, since the first meeting I participated
in was from home.  I would prefer to have my work e-mail used for the mailing
list and web page whenever update is possible; for me to participate this
morning, you'll need to add my work e-mail to your messages and reply to all,
rather than using the mailing list.
