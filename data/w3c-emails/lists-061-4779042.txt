AG:: "Equalize competion by letting team captains draft players
in rotation. Develop N designs ( not less than 2 ) and use the one that
wins, with credits."

WL: I think Jonathan Chetwynd and Anne Pemberton should have one team! I
don't know if Al's being tongue-in-cheek but this sure sounds like a
good idea and the "splash page" could say "websites don't have to be
