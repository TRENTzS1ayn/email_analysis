agree. drop attribute. If we are going to use "smallcap" bold for elements
and lowercase bold for attributes, then using "attribute" is redundant and
wastes space for more important material that is "written clearly"

Unless the decision to continue using the word "attribute" is required
by Tim or some stone-engraved rule, I think it should be dropped in all
three places it's used (1,6, and 8) in favor of denoting that the term
in question is an attribute by its typography, as is currently done with
"element".  If it is bold lower-case then the word "attribute" is a
*DUH* item.  Else why not use the word "element"?
