                       EXPRESS 
                       BRIEFLY 

or  
                       SAY IT
                      TERSELY

or
                     BE BRIEF

or
                       ESHEW
                     WORDINESS

or  (less seriously)

                     EXORCISE
                   MAGNILOQUENT
                     LOGORRHEA

on the reverse side.

Of course we are trying to maximize understanding. We have blue available.
A faint blue.  

But: Any (even subliminal) background reduces contrast, making it somewhat less readable. 

Just think what we could do with the on-line version,
flashing such background images at a suitable epileptic trigger rate,
whenever the writer goes sesquipedalian.

Time for bed, 30 hours on the computer is getting to me.
