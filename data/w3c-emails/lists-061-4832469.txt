Quick tips to make accessible Web sites 

FOR COMPLETE GUIDELINES & CHECKLIST: WWW.W3.ORG/WAI 

Images & animations. Use the _alt_ attribute to describe the function of
each visual.

Image maps. Use client-side _MAP_ and text for hotspots. (NB: _MAP_ is in
small caps.)

Multimedia. Provide captioning and transcripts of audio, and descriptions
of video.

Hypertext links. Use text that makes sense when read out of context. For
example, avoid "click here."

Page organization. Use headings, lists, and consistent structure. Use _CSS_
for layout and style where possible.

Graphs & charts. Summarize or use the _longdesc_ attribute.

Scripts, applets, & plug-ins. Provide alternative content in case active
features are inaccessible or unsupported.

PROPOSAL: "Frames. Label with the _title_ or _name_ attribute."
OR PROPOSAL: "Frames. Use _noframe_, and _title_ or _name_ attribute. (NB:
"noframe" would be in small caps)

Tables. Make line-by-line reading sensible. Summarize.

PROPOSAL??: Check your work. Validate. Use evaluation tools, WCAG
guidelines and checklist www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT.

--------

Note also that there was some discussion of possible additions (see #11 in
discussion minutes
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-eo/1999JulSep/0072.html>) but
there does not seem to be sufficient space to add anything, or time to
figure out which should and can be said clearly in small space. Reconsider
for later revisions.
