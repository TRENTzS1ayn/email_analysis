WC:: I like the second proposal.  This technique is included in checkpoint
6.5, which is P2.
We've recently found that at least one browser for PalmOS acts like older
text-based browsers: it give you
a blank screen rather than a list of frame names.

however, i don't feel strongly about this, because if the line-by-line
reading is sensible, it is most likely in a single column.

WC:: yes, I like this.
