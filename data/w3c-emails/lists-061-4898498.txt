Frames:  Proposal 2
Tables:  Original proposal (I don't agree with an explicit restriction of a
single column; this is an issue that should be resolved by further developments
in screen readers)


For clarification purposes on Tables, what is your opinion of the use of tables
in the Main Menu page of my site? I use multi-column tables at the top and
bottom (with the top menu embedded in a subform if there's any difference)
http://w3.gsa.gov/web/m/cita.nsf

FYI -- I haven't had a chance to look at Notes/Domino R5 yet, but I've seen
demos where they are adding multiple options for tables, such as showing a row
at a time.

My comments prefixed with WC::

>PROPOSAL: "Frames. Label with the _title_ or _name_ attribute."
>OR PROPOSAL: "Frames. Use _noframe_, and _title_ or _name_ attribute. (NB:
>"noframe" would be in small caps)

WC:: I like the second proposal.  This technique is included in checkpoint
6.5, which is P2.
We've recently found that at least one browser for PalmOS acts like older
text-based browsers: it give you
a blank screen rather than a list of frame names.

>Tables. Make line-by-line reading sensible. Summarize.

WC:: proposal:  Tables. Make line-by-line, single column reading sensible.
Summarize.
however, i don't feel strongly about this, because if the line-by-line
reading is sensible, it is most likely in a single column.

WC:: yes, I like this.
