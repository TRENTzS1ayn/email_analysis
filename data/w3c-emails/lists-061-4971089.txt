  PROPOSAL: "Frames and Objects. Use _title_ or _name_ attribute, give NOFRAMES content or text default."
  
  I note that FRAME and NOFRAMES are only in the transitional HTML, not part 
  of the HTML4.0 strict.dtd. They are replaced there by the OBJECT 
  generalization that can have as the "if all others fail" choice a text 
  version equivalent to the NOFRAMES.
  
  >10. Check your work. Validate the HTML. Use accessibility evaluation tools.
  Check http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT guidelines.
  
  I note that the approximate effect of the printer's smallcaps is achieved 
  by a smaller font size inline.
  
  As I've been up for 30 hours, now to bed. Use these as you see fit.
