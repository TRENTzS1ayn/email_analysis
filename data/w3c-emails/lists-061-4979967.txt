I'm not sure I agree here. I think your comment assumes two things:

a) That the HTML WG in conjunction with WAI input knew everything that
   had to be done. I don't think this was the case.
 
b) That rendering of NOFRAMES information, whatever the element
contained,
   would suffice to create an equivalent browser experience. Nothing
   guarantees that in the HTML 4.0 spec and since the spec doesn't
   say anything about rendering (besides when, and even that has led
   to confusion), I don't think one can rely on consistent behavior
   from user agents.

This is not to say that NOFRAMES is a bad idea or should not
be used. I just think it's hard to say it's the definitive solution
for making frames accessible.

I don't think the situation is the same - longdesc semantics are
not required to achieve as much as NOFRAMES semantics. Authors needn't
do nearly as much to make a long description useful for an image.
I think they have to think a lot more about making frames accessible,
and thus, it's not cut and dry to just say "use NOFRAMES". 

How about this language as a quick tip:

  Title frames and provide NOFRAMES equivalents.

  Comments:
    - leave "name" and "title" as (ugly) details to found in the techs
      document.
    - the key word is "equivalent"
