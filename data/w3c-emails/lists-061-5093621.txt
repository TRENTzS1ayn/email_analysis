EOWG, and GL Editors:

STATUS: 
- Two issues still to resolve: "frames" and "check your work." One new &
one old proposal below.
- The printer has gone home for the day. I do not feel we have sufficient
consensus on #8 or #10 to procede. I would like to get consensus during the
weekend, and then freeze it while the printer runs the proofs. Please
continue to comment until we reach consensus.

JB That point, in combination with Ian's clarifications about NOFRAMES in
the HTML spec, and the fact that this is a technique not a checkpoint, says
to me that we should not make this sound so absolute. I don't know,
however, whether we have space to say it conditionally. Two attempts:

JB PROPOSAL #1: "Frames. Label with _title_ or _name_. Use _NOFRAMES_ if
complex."

JB Trouble is, it won't fit on the line.

JB PROPOSAL #2: "Frames: Use _title_ or _name_, and NOFRAMES if complex."

JB Anybody like this?

JB I was relaying a strong concerned expressed by Gregg-- that people would
get to the end of the card, and really think that was it. The WAI URL up
front doesn't lead directly to the guidelines, and we can't guarantee that
they'll always be at the top of the WAI home page. I've talked with many
people who haven't found the Quick Tips or the Techniques document after
visiting the WAI home page many times, and who are fuzzy about which set of
guidelines they are using as well. If our insurance for having such a
concise and sometimes cryptic list of Quick Tips, is to know that we are
emphatically pointing people to the full resource then I agree with Gregg
that the card would benefit from _some_kind_of_ reminder at the end of the
card. Maybe there's better phrasing?

JB We even did some informal "user testing" when discussing this at the
AAES Conference recently -- Gregg and I each handed cards to a few people,
gave them a short time to look at them (didn't mention whether there was
anything on the back or not). One noticed the URL on the top, one didn't--
he thought it was just a design element, etc. Given how important it is to
get people to the guidelines, maybe this one bit of semi-redundancy is a
good thing.

>I'd rather just change "text only browsers" in "text only rendering",
>to point people at lynx-it web page, not just lynx browser.

Right now that's not part of the proposed re-draft; but in any case, I
wonder if people will understand "text-only rendering" as easily, even if
"text-only browsers" isn't 100% of what we mean here.

PROPOSAL STILL: Check your work. Use evaluation tools, guidelines and
checklist www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT
