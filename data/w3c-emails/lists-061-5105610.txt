I think we are near enough - I'm not sure that we'll get real consensus
except by attrition (in particular, Daniel and I appear to fundamentally
disagree on the importance of noframes), but I think that whatever is decided
is likely to be good enough. Having said that, I'll keep on the thread...

  JB That point, in combination with Ian's clarifications about NOFRAMES in
  the HTML spec, and the fact that this is a technique not a checkpoint, says
  to me that we should not make this sound so absolute. I don't know,
  however, whether we have space to say it conditionally. Two attempts:
  
  JB PROPOSAL #1: "Frames. Label with _title_ or _name_. Use _NOFRAMES_ if
  complex."
  
  JB Trouble is, it won't fit on the line.
  
  JB PROPOSAL #2: "Frames: Use _title_ or _name_, and NOFRAMES if complex."
  
  JB Anybody like this?

  JB I was relaying a strong concerned expressed by Gregg-- that people would
  get to the end of the card, and really think that was it. The WAI URL up
  front doesn't lead directly to the guidelines, and we can't guarantee that
  they'll always be at the top of the WAI home page. I've talked with many
  people who haven't found the Quick Tips or the Techniques document after
  visiting the WAI home page many times, and who are fuzzy about which set of
  guidelines they are using as well. If our insurance for having such a
  concise and sometimes cryptic list of Quick Tips, is to know that we are
  emphatically pointing people to the full resource then I agree with Gregg
  that the card would benefit from _some_kind_of_ reminder at the end of the
  card. Maybe there's better phrasing?
  
  JB We even did some informal "user testing" when discussing this at the
  AAES Conference recently -- Gregg and I each handed cards to a few people,
  gave them a short time to look at them (didn't mention whether there was
  anything on the back or not). One noticed the URL on the top, one didn't--
  he thought it was just a design element, etc. Given how important it is to
  get people to the guidelines, maybe this one bit of semi-redundancy is a
  good thing.

  Right now that's not part of the proposed re-draft; but in any case, I
  wonder if people will understand "text-only rendering" as easily, even if
  "text-only browsers" isn't 100% of what we mean here.
  
  PROPOSAL STILL: Check your work. Use evaluation tools, guidelines and
  checklist www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT
