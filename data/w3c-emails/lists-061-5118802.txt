Charles, 

It hasn't gone to the printers yet, partly because of this. Please see my
most recent comment, with status; and also Ian and Daniel's comments
regarding this interpretation of the use of NOFRAMES. If the argument is
that you think this is the way the guidelines _should_ read, and therefore
we should put it on the card, then we're going beyond the bounds of what we
should do with the Quick Tips. That's how I read this:

CMN: >Basically I think noframes should be used to provide good quality
access to
>framesets in non-serial media.

If I'm on target there, then our hope for consensus is either with an
abbreviated conditional, if people agree to my recent proposal: 

JB PROPOSAL #2: "Frames: Use _title_ or _name_, and NOFRAMES if complex."

...or to default to the original text on the card, given that time
constraints are requiring us to be conservative on changes-- e.g. no change
in the material except where there is strong consensus. Can you
specifically comment on whether you thought there was something _incorrect_
with the use of "label" in the phrase on the card "Frames: Label with the
_title_ or _name_ attribute" or was your concern w/ labeling them w/ title
or name...?

CMN: >simply labelling them is a very bad
>practice, which excludes accessibility in non-frames capable browsers 

...or at least confirm whether the "good enough" in your last message was
regarding JB PROPOSAL #2 or the original text on the card.

And other folks reading this this weekend still need to comment on JB
PROPOSAL #2, please... 

Thanks,

- Judy
