I guess I forgot to note:

no, I don't like "use noframes if complex". It is extra verbiage, to qualify
a need, based on the fact that there are emergency strategies that can get
around it. That seems like a bad approach to me. It is also not the approach
taken in the rest of the card

  I think that what the guidelines say about noframes (i.e. that they are P2,
  in the case where you are using frames) is correct. I think that noframes is
  an important part of using frames accessibly, and is something taht is still
  very rarely done properly, and should therefore be on the card. I have no
  problem with what is already there, excpet I think the lack of mentioning
  noframes is a serious ommission in the context of the card (especially at the
  price of 11 letters, including 8 bold ones, plus a space.
  
  I don't think that either Daniel or I are about to change our repsective
  minds on the importance of this (we haven't in the last 6 or 8 months) and I
  don't think it is important enough to hold up printing of the card. I do
  think it is important enough to keep asking for it, and I will. (The luxury
  of not being chair). In the absence of that, I think the proposals and the
  current text are all good enough. If it fits, I think meaningful is a useful
  thing to say about labelling.
  
  I have read all the comments posted on this issue to date. I agree with Ian
  that providing longdesc and providing noframes require different types of
  thinking. I disagree (tentatively) with the idea that one or the other is
  more difficult to do well.

    Charles, 
    
    It hasn't gone to the printers yet, partly because of this. Please see my
    most recent comment, with status; and also Ian and Daniel's comments
    regarding this interpretation of the use of NOFRAMES. If the argument is
    that you think this is the way the guidelines _should_ read, and therefore
    we should put it on the card, then we're going beyond the bounds of what we
    should do with the Quick Tips. That's how I read this:
    
    CMN: >Basically I think noframes should be used to provide good quality
    access to
    >framesets in non-serial media.
    
    If I'm on target there, then our hope for consensus is either with an
    abbreviated conditional, if people agree to my recent proposal: 
    
    JB PROPOSAL #2: "Frames: Use _title_ or _name_, and NOFRAMES if complex."
    
    ...or to default to the original text on the card, given that time
    constraints are requiring us to be conservative on changes-- e.g. no change
    in the material except where there is strong consensus. Can you
    specifically comment on whether you thought there was something _incorrect_
    with the use of "label" in the phrase on the card "Frames: Label with the
    _title_ or _name_ attribute" or was your concern w/ labeling them w/ title
    or name...?
    
    CMN: >simply labelling them is a very bad
    >practice, which excludes accessibility in non-frames capable browsers 
    
    ...or at least confirm whether the "good enough" in your last message was
    regarding JB PROPOSAL #2 or the original text on the card.
    
    And other folks reading this this weekend still need to comment on JB
    PROPOSAL #2, please... 
    
    Thanks,
