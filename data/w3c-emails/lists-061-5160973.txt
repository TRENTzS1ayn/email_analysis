Question:  Is the page with CSS instead of the HTML more accessible,
less accessible, or equally accessible?  Can you explain exactly
how the accessibility has been noticeably improved in this case?

Note that there may be a choice between "having this look the
same in Netscape 3.0 and Netscape 4.0" and "making a very minor
increase in accessibility."  For some agencies or companies, the
tiny benefit is not worth the cost of losing support for Netscape
3.0.
