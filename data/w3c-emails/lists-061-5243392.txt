Adam,

"3.3 Use style sheets to control layout and presentation. [Priority 2]"
sounds very definitive to me.  It does not say, Style Sheets may be used to
control layout and presentation."  Lets substititue words, "Use both hands
to control the saw" <smile>.  I can cut with wood with a saw using one hand,
but this wording does not give me an option to use one hand or HTML 4 done
properly.

Once more, I fear managers will read 3.3 literaly.  I know I do.

appearance of the page. Here, CSS would be required. Or, simply strip out
the deprecated elements, and you're fine without CSS.

rob>if i strip out the out the deprecated elements, I am fine without CSS,
but then I did not use a style sheet.

thanks, rob
