First reactions:

1. Lead paragraph deals only with physical disabilities.
That misses the wider benefit of addressing the common experiences of
the wider group who at times have environmental or equipment limitations.

2. The word "policy links" just isn't strong enough: Suggest "international 
policy and laws". 

3. Working groups: though looks like links are to deliverables, rather than
group pages themselves. Why?

4. Couldn't find members of various groups. Guess that would be under
WAI Participants.

5. Not all readers understand the W3C Recommendation vs Note, and may
wonder what status these have. Related are the techniques to achieve
guidelines. As most of what we are doing is developing guidelines,
checklists, and techniques, so a brief statement of what these are is
worthwhile.
