Discussed frames and 'check your work' at EOWG face to face today. 

Outcome:

1) replacement sentence for "frames": 

_Frames._ Use _NOFRAMES_ and meaningful titles. 
[NB the "_NOFRAMES_ is bold and in small caps. The "titles" is neither bold
nor caps.]

2) replacement for "check your work." 

_Check_your_work._ Validate. Use tools, checklist, 
and guidelines at www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT.

We are checking to be sure this latter one fits.

3) In addition the group recommended two changes to the blue bar w/ URL on
the front, to make it more prominent as readable text, rather than design:

- try it with blue background black instead
- try w/ upper case for start of each word and lower case for the rest of
each word

Anyone have major concerns about either of these changes?

- Judy
