I am closing the discussion of Checkpoint 3.3 on the Education and Outreach
WG list. It will continue on the Web Content Guidelines Working Group list,
which is the appropriate place for this discussion at this point. Archives
of that mailing list and subscription information for that list are
available from the working group home page at http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL.

The Web Content Guidelines Working Group will report back to WAI IG and to
the EOWG once resolved.

Thank you,

Judy
