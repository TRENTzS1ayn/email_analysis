>It was easier to think through the re-organization of the home page using
a mocked-up page, rather than just send around a list of topics. 
>
>Some links are active, some are not; if we like this set-up I'd need to
put in a number of sub-pages to back these up. Some links are to resources
not yet created or finalized, so we can see how it hangs together; they'd
be taken off the actual home page until they're ready.

>Here's the draft re-org:
>http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/WAI-home
>Here's the original for comparison:
>http://www.w3.org/WAI
>
>Is it: clearer? friendlier? easier to get to find really useful resources?
easier to use by different audiences? etc.?
>
>I realize it's just flat text for now; we can throw in some styling later.
