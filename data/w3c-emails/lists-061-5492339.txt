Judy, here are my comments for the proposed WAI web page


A.  These nav bars (Headlines | Mission | Resources | Participation | About
WAI ) are not easily discernable, would use CSS to simulate the H3 Tag or
something similar.

B.  The techniques document does not get scanned by the eyes, propose
bulleting this out as such

May 5, 1999:
   1.  Web Content Accessibility Guidelines become Recommendation
   2.  WCAG Techniques becomes Note.

Also would put Headlines over it...see the link but need to be consistent
for scanning

C.  On the far right of the top gif or below in the nav area

i would put something like "Need help making a web site accessible"  ...not
sure of the words here

The resources have mixed information and audiences.  How about splitting up
Resources to separate "training and help" and "Related Information"  the
later may be a bad term.  but i want to see something like, "Resources to
help you make a web site accessible for everyone!"  This topic for a lack of
better words, POP out at me!

Here is a stab?

+  Resources to help you make a web site accessible for everyone!  <NOTE,
this would be the first item over headline>>
