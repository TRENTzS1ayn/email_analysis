Jim,

A big anvil just feel from the sky and hit me on the head...  i was asked by SHARE (IBM's user's group) to present in August.  Hmmm, and who do i know at IBM that is involved in the WAI?

http://www.share.org/  also see www.share.org/speakerchair.   I am presenting on Tuesday August 24th at 6

Am presenting universal design.  would your like to help?  Are you folks going to be up there showing off your efforts?  


Here is the topic

Session 0469 - Tuesday 6:00 p.m.
Title: Improving Web Accessibility
Abstract: Designing Web Interfaces? If so, have you considered the obstacles
 people with disabilities (PWD) face when trying to access your web page and
 obtain information about your business? The speaker will discuss the design
 issues and obstacles PWDs face on the web. The session will provide you with
 an improved understanding of web browsers and the design issues associate with
 making your business information accessible to all.

TO WAI EO, is anyone else going to be in the area? and care to join.
