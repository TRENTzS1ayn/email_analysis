WAI EOWG:

Please review the draft technical reference Note on SMIL accessibility
features <http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/NOTE-smil-access-19990726>. It is also
under review by the SYMM WG. Please send comments back to this list
<w3c-wai-eo@w3.org>, keeping the same cc's as this message, before the EOWG
meeting this Friday July 30, if possible. 

EOWG looked at an earlier version of this months ago; it's changed a lot
since then and we would like to publish this a.s.a.p., so this is just a
check to ensure no serious problems.

Thanks,

Judy
