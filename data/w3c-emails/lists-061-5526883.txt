Just in case you want typo, etc. stuff:

There's a gratuitous comma at "...formats such as smil 1.0,..."

There's a superfluous "an" before "refreshable Braille"

If we are to be consistent, I think elements and attributes should have
some differences in font characteristic "...attributes such as the _alt_
attribute and the _img_ element" might use different markup than italics
for both.

In 2.1 the phrase "...following attributes" implies a series to follow
which is not the case.

I will continue this sort of proofing if it's time to do so, I dunno??
