Actually I would suggest that events is a top-level heading on its own. It
falls into enough other categories for this to make sense, rather than
repeating it in all of them.

(It also seems like an ideal place to work on an accessible,
database-generated bit of web content...)

  The new draft is easier to read. I was surprised to see the Events nav link
  missing.
  Events are an important public display and forum of/for on going work and
  developments.
  Oops! I see on closer inspection that events is included under
  Participation.
  I see WAI events WG meetings and the like falling under the Participation
  umbrella.
  General Events Calendar should come under the Resources umbrella - something
  the public can attend to learn more about WAI activities (work in progress,
  up dates, trainings, materials, etc.)
  
  I like Rob Neff's idea of 'splitting up Resources to separate "training and
  help" and "Related Information" ' Then General Events would fall under
  "training and help"
