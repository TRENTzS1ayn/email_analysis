Since this is XML, we probably shouldn't use uppercase. 
We'll look into a different highlight mechanism.

[On captions/subtitles]
> This is a really philosophical problem more than a technical one.  I would prefer that we not recommend that multimedia authors feel free to use the same text file for both captions and subtitles, but I could be persuaded that, rather than recommending that authors always provide two separate caption and subtitle files, a single *caption* file should be created and used for both purposes.  I would rather risk annoying the hearing audience than shutting out the deaf audience.

I agree and thought the document was clear on that point. We can clarify
further.

We intend to improve this index.

Thank you again,
