The following comments were accidently left out of Madeleine and Geoff's response to the SMIL note:

Section 2.2.1:
Since there are several examples of SMIL files in this document, wouldn't it also be helpful to include an example of a caption text file?  I have several if you want to borrow from them.

Section 3.2:
"In SMIL 1.0, the only style attribute that can be set in SMIL 1.0 is background-color..."

Delete the second reference to SMIL 1.0.

Section 4.1:
In the third paragraph the A element is mentioned but there's no explanation of what it is.

Thanks.
