Regrets for today.

I talked to some people from the German association of visually impaired
students and professionals on monday - more about what WAI does within the
consortium than general accessibility problems, since they are aware of
those, and have been talking today to Haakon Lie (if you have an
internationalised email, change the double-a in Haakon to an a-ring) from
Opera about what needs to be done for Opera to conform to the User Agent
Guidelines (this is a two way process - it is also a test of whther the
guidelines can be implemented. As with the same exercise which I did with
Irene Vatton from the Amaya team, for the authoring tool guidelines, the
results were generally very pleasing.
