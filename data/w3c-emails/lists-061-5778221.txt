Hi:
I don't mean this to be a nasty criticism but rather pointing out a minute
problem to fix.

There is a link on the WAI site that, when a blind person tabs, says "click
here" and nothing else!  think I saw guidelines saying that's a 'no no'.

I didn't copy the url, but it is the page that has the Prince Andrew
webcast from 1998.
