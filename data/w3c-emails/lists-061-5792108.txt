Just got my first look at the redraft of the WAI home page.  I would have a
slight preference to see the large Participation grouping broken out as
follows:

? Events: Upcoming WAI events, General Events Calendar 
? Interest Groups: WAI Interest Group, Evaluation & Repair Tools IG 
? Working Groups: Web Content Guidelines, User Agent Guidelines, Authoring
Tool Guidelines, Protocols & Formats Review, Evaluation & Repair Tools WG 

Participation 
?Sponsors: NSF, NIDRR, Industry Canada, IBM/Lotus, Microsoft, Bell
Atlantic, more, Becoming a Sponsor 
? WAI Participants 
? Joining: WAI, W3C 
? WAI Update: Back issues, Subscription 

Regards,
Chuck
