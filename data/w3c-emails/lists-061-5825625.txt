here are some comments and just got back form vacation land....

1.  i would like to see pictorial or GIF examples alongside the code.
2.  would like to see a simpler explanation.  Many people are going to be
drawn to this because SMIL is starting to get HOT!  would a executive
summary or purpose be appropriate to tell people in one section "why they
need this and what it can do for them"
3. I would like to see a pictoral and word flowchart that describe how smile
file are used and their components.  For example, what are the required
files and what is the directory structure.  Not sure what can be done
without aligning the content with a company (does the file structure differ
form vendor to vender?).  Geoff, one of the biggest problems I had when we
used it here was trying to make sense of the different files and where they
needed to be placed)
4.  If i want to make a presentation with the video description, how is this
to be added...on another track.
5.  I have more notes that i made on the airplane, but need to unpack to
find them...


6.   In the sentence, "Dynamic multimedia presentations differ from less
dynamic pages in some important ways that affect their accessibility to
people with disabilities:"  reword to "Dynamic multimedia presentations
affect accessibility"  not sure what "differ from less dynamic pages in some
important ways" adds to this?  Less dynamic pages are not explained anywhere
and i found myself caught up in this...
7.  need visual examples of discrete and stream..  can we give examples of
how SMIL can be used?
8.  file extensions RM and RTX are used without explanation.  are there more
extensions?  See item 3



good night?
