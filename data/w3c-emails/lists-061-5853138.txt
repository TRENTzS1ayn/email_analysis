While I agree that images or illustrations may help explain some
features, will static images convey the dynamic issues we are
discussing? Can you say a word about what you would like to see
in images?

While an "executive summary" would be useful, that is not the
role of this particular piece. This one is meant for developers
(to understand what features to implement) and authors
who are not necessarily using authoring tools to produce SMIL.

I don't believe that this is an accessibility issue. This would
be appropriate for a general SMIL tutorial or FAQ and I'm sure
that a tutorial would help all audiences. However, including
this level of detail in this Note might dilute the accessibility
points we hope to communicate.

Marja and I will discuss this.

I suggest looking near the shaving kit. <wink>

The goal of the sentence was to juxtapose static pages (a la HTML)
from
more dynamic pages (a la SMIL). However, in editing, we lost the
context that justified this transition. We'll clean it up.

It would be nice to link to a demo to show what we mean. Does
anyone have a demo handy that we can put on the W3C Web site?

Ok, we'll clarify.

Thank you for the comments Robert,
