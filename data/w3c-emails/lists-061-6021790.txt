in general, the motivation to include alt text and longdesc for 
accessibility is that text2voice tools can use these attributes and
read them out - it is not so much to handle the case that a certain
media type is not supported by a player
 
however, this behavior still seems non-optimal - is there a way to 
change this ?

on a related note: i noticed some time ago that when Realplayer does
not understand a MIME type of a media object contained in a "switch",
it does not go to the next media object, but tries downloading a plugin
instead. And if it does not find it, it stops the presentation.

This kind of defeats one of the purposes of a switch, namely
to be able to point to media objects that are encoded in different
formats, and to have the player select the media object whose format
it supports. Again, is there a way to change this behavior of G2 ?
