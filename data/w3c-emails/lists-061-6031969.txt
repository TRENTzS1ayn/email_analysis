Here my 2 cts.


This document adds considerably to the usage of SMIL.
Explaining/illustrating by way of examples I found helpful. 
Can we refer to it from the SMIL Boston document ?
For example, the explanation on alt, longdesc, etc. 
in section 2.1 places all these attributes together,
showing their relationships and usages.


In sec. 2 I was wondering about the wording "stream".
The opposite of a discrete media is a continuous media.
A continous media is streamed to the renderer. Later
in the document "stream" is used in that rendition/presentation 
sense, so I am not sure whether and how to change 
the text in sec. 2.


sec.2.2.1., the note.
Can CSS authors also use the @media mechanism,
e.g. adding a hearing-impaired rule set ?
[Maybe this is an application of timesheets:
a different "timing style" to another choice 
of media.]
[In SMIL different <layout> could have been declared, 
if <layout> was supporting system-attributes.]


sec.3.1.
Should the example be extended with a root-layout element ?

 <layout>
   <root-layout top="20" left="20"/>
   <region ..
     .
 </layout>

The body section I would author as

  <switch>
    <video region="video" system-captions="off" .../>
    <par system-captions="on">
      <video region="capvideo" .../>
      <textstream region="captext" .../>
    </par>
  </switch>


sec.4.1.
The 2nd example contains illegal SMIL.
SMIL doesn't support inline text; the text 
in the <par> should be referenced through 
a <text> element.


sec.4.2.
Is it special for (time-dependent) links to require 
a kind of ToC listing of them ?
Isn't it sufficient to require control on the presentation 
rate of the overall presentation ?


Warner.
