It has been decided that this only talks about SMIL 1. The future
discussions will be in the dependency reports. I think there will be
another Note for SMIL Boston.

While continuing to develope the next SMIL version I think it would be good
to gather some use scenarios of the new features. That would help to see
what the needs are and how well the features response to the needs.

There has been some discussion of this in the WAI groups. At least the user
should be informed of the new windows and be able to prevent opening them
(i.e. use the same window all the time). To get a comprehensive answer I
think it would be good to send this question to UA and PF groups.

Sounds great! I need to look that more carefully.

OK.

Do you mean that CSS should be used with the textual media object elements
containing HTML or XML?

I thought we could give a class name to audio descriptions and users could
use cascading mechanism to turn the audio descriptions on in their personal
style sheets. Of course we really need this mechanism for the player.

As I said earlier the Note is just on SMIL 1.0 and I understood from the
SYMM group that there is no chance to make changes to that. I don't believe
it is officially possible to do something faster than waiting for next SMIL
recommendation, but maybe I'm wrong.

We just wanted to point out some things and therefore did not include all
the timing to the examples. The file extensions came mainly from the
examples used in SMIL 1.0 document. I hope to get an example caption file
with SMIL time attributes to the document. So there would be at least one
example of that.

For me, the URI with data still seems a bit odd. Why not let authors to
write content for the text objects or links?

OK.
