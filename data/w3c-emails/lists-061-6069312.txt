I agree, images usually help me too. In addition to Rob's suggestions, it
would be nice to have images of the SMIL layout examples and maybe some
examples of how the user sees the test attributes in the player etc.
However, it would take still more time and maybe even some negotiation if
we selected one player and not the other etc.

At the moment I think that this document is more focused in the language
and we really need it out soon. Later we can make other documents based on
this for different purposes.

However, if I can easily find some good pictures to illustrate some points
I might add them to the document.
