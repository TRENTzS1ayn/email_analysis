I agree. Some things are more important and some things can be made more
easily than others. The priorities are discussed in WAI/User Agent group.

Sounds like a good feature. In some cases it might be that something else
is needed as well.

I agree.

OK. I think it is still a goal from accessibility viewpoint and priorities
are discussed in WAI/UA.

Users can define their own style sheets that take their needs into account.
We will rephrase some of the CSS stuff as CSS is not supported by the SMIL
players yet.

It is not but it does help authors to make changes.

This helps e.g blind users who don't see windows popping out. They either
should use the same window or inform the users about the new windows and
help users to navigate between them.

(Actually sometimes also the seeing users can find it distracting if there
is several windows created and stopped without the user control.)

Philipp already answered this.

OK. We should change this.

This is explained more carefully now.
