GF:
This is a good idea.  Making them all yes/no rather than some yes/no and some either/or will help avoid confusion.

>Captions usually contain more information than subtitles, like sound
effects and speaker identification.  In some cases, the timing differences
between one movie's captions and subtitles can be significant.  Having
separate classes for caption and subtitles would therefore, I think, be a
great idea.  (An aside for another forum, but still worthwhile here:  SMIL
1.0 uses "system-overdub-or-caption" when what is really intended, I think,
is "system-overdub-or-subtitle".  Perhaps this is something that could be
addressed in SMIL 2.0?)

I think we really want to have system-overdub and system-subtitle
separately (and it would be also nice have some metadata to separate the
captions, subtitles, audio descriptions and overdubs because the test
attributes can be used in other ways too). Then the user interface in the
player could give the either-or alternatives if necessary.

>NCAM experimented recently with QuickTime captions using a translucent
background; depending on the case, the captions (or subtitles) were, in
fact, much easier to read.  QuickTime has a pretty simple mechanism for the
author to adjust the percentage of translucency; I think this would be very
useful in SMIL, especially if the user can adjust the translucency, too.
(By the way, some broadcast closed-caption decoders already have a
translucency feature.)

1-pixel outline around each character.  Again, you can do this in
QuickTime.  This would be useful in SMIL, too.

Translucency seems to be a good feature, in addition, sometimes e.g. with a
big screen the captions or subtitles can also be under the picture.
