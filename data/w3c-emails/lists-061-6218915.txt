Here's an example:

   <audio src="audio.rm">
   <textstream src="closed-caps.rtx">

Should we include the suffixes at all? I don't know 
how SMIL players handle content negotiation,
but if possible, shouldn't we promote it?

Of course, we could still show examples
with suffixes, but indicate that content
negotiation is preferred.
