i have an absolute great reason for missing this telcon.  I will be
presenting Implementing Universal Asseccibility at IBM's User's conference,
SHARE.org, in Chicago.  Been to some great presentations already.  Jim
Steger, IBM, presented Accessibility, Technology for everyone, and some of
the questions from the field were:

1.  Are there standards to code one's web browser?
2. Windows includes screen magnifiers but they do not work with all
programs.
3.  The guidelines are difficult to understand?
4. We dont have any money for our web site now?  So how can we learn this,
we are all volunteers.

Alan Happ presented today on usability on the Share.org site and afterwords
i demonstrated Bobby and HTML Validator.  here are some of the questions:

1.   rob>  After listening to people say many things, i determined their
real question was "how do PWD access information on the web?
2.  How does 508 and ADA affect me.
3.  What tools do we use to build this.
4.  How does Lotus Domino interact with this?
5.  Where can I learn more.

thats all for now, but seems we can go to the next conference and put on
more demonstrations.  People are hungry for information and we need to back
this up with live presentations and solutions.  Anyone have any grant money
laying around?

more after my session tomorrow, rob
