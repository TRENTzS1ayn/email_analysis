I find no mention of this completed report on the WAI policy page.

      http://www.access-board.gov/pubs/eitaacrpt.htm

I have just downloaded it and find it important to list there.
In our minutes Judy Brewer was to report on it. Did I miss it?

Seems like that report will (if it hasn't already) become the basis
for "law with teeth" to impose accessibility compliance for
government procurements.
