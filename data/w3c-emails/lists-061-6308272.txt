I see that they reference WCAG rightly but for AU and UA, they just
point to http://www.w3.org/TR (in 5.3.3.2 and 5.3.3.3)

Isn't the case that we already have stable URL for both, i.e
  http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-AUTOOLS
  http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-USERAGENT

that we will still valid when the guidelines come out.

Should we ask them to fix their document ?
