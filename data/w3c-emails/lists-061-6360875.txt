Hi,

Here's call for abstracts for INET 2000.  Since this is one of the
biggest Internet related conferences where various types of people who
are woking on and/or interested in the Internet gather around from all
over the world, this may be one of the best opportunities for outreach
works.

The deadline for the abstracts/proposals submissions is Oct 1, by the
way.

     Cheers,
Max

Dear Friend,

INET 2000:  The Internet Global Summit, is a special INET.  Hosted
by the Internet Society, the Summit will be held 18-21 July 2000, in
Yokohama, Japan.  The place, the date, and  the fact that it is the 10th
anniversary of this important event all mark it as an exceptional year.

To be considered as a speaker, panelist, tutorial instructor, or poster
presenter, please see http://www.isoc.org/inet2000/callforabstracts.shtml
for submission instructions and to read about this year's theme,
"Global Distributed Knowledge for Everyone."

INET is the premier international event for Internet and internetworking
professionals.  Nowhere can such a broad cross-section of important movers
of the Internet be found in one single location.

We look forward to receiving your abstract and seeing you in Japan!

Sincerely,

Jean-Claude Guedon & Jun Murai
Co-Chairs, INET 2000 Program Committee
