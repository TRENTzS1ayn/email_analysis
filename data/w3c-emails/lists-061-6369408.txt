Hello Chuck Letourneau
Please send me a copy of the curriculum as a zip-file. I'm going to make a
presentation at a seminar for Danish librarians by the end of this month. I
want to use part of the curriculum and translate the text into Danish. The
seminar is about accessibility to public libraries in general and I'm only
going to do a short presentation about web accessibility. Later this year
I'm running a full seminar on web accessibility and hope to translate most
of the curriculum, and make it available on the Internet.

Kind regards
