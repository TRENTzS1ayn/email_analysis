according to the Danish newspapers the Danish minister of Research and
Information Technology has appointed more than 10 mill. DKr. (1,5 mill. USD)
to improve the access to IT and to the Internet for handicapped persons.
Part of the money is to be used on the development of the Danish synthetic
speech, others on developing an education program for visually impaired and
hearing impaired PC users, and finally to establish a centre to help and
advice governmental institution's on how to make their web-sites accessible.
