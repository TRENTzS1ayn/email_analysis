WAI has produced a major Recommendation (WCAG) and has two more (UAGL
and AUGL) in process. As these become "normatives" the focus will shift
to the pragmatics of implementation all accessibility efforts in some
organized fashion and the pattern for site evaluation, repair tools, and
dissemination of procedures for all these things is now taking shape at:

http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/

This deserves our attention since if the ER-IG list could be a place to
exhaustively present techniques/examples to aid in achieving "everyone,
everything connected" it would be a Good Thing.

Perhaps EO can help publicize and attracting participants for this
purpose.
