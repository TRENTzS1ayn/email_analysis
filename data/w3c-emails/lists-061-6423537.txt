WAI EOWG:

Get 'em while they're hot -- the new Quick Tips cards are here. 

If you would like some, please go to
http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/QuickTips and send the requested
information to wai-quicktips@w3.org.

I'll also be announcing this to WAI IG, but figured the EOWG deserves first
crack at these.

Thanks for all the good work on these!

- Judy
