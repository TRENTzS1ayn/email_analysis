1) minor point about the long first sentence in Section one, Paragraph
three that ends:
"one because of inability to visually track the pointer, and the other
because of inability to move the hands".  
To ensure clarity, I would suggest either changing this to read: 
"the former because of inability to visually track the pointer, and the
latter because of inability to move the hands", 
or, 
"one because of inability to visually track the pointer, and the other
because of inability to move the hands, respectively"

2 Paragraph 4: "A Checklist is available to test Web sites for
accessibility?" This makes it sound like the checklist is an automatic
tool, like Bobby. Maybe something like " A Checklist is available to aid in
reviewing Web sites for accessibility? "
