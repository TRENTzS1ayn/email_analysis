What objects? Where are these defined?

Short answer: I can't. I don't think you'll find this info in WCAG
or other WAI Guidelines today.

So far, W3C has not produced guidelines for non-W3C technologies
such as JAVA. We should have references, howver, to other resources.
For Java, try [1], [2], [3]. I looked at the Macromedia site but
didn't find information about accessibility there.

For the need you are expressing: Quick access to key accessibility
features that need to be used or implemented, we are producing
Notes for W3C Technologies. There is one available for CSS 1/2 [4],
an older one for HTML 4 [5], and very soon one for SMIL 1.0. Other
Notes will follow.
