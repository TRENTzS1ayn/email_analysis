>1. Outreach Update

The Electronic Book conference at the National Institute of Science and
Technology has 600 registered. It is next Tuesday thru Wednesday, in
Gaithersburg, MD. Thursday morning will be spent on details of Open Ebook.

I have ordered quick tips cards for all.

Here is an audience for whom electronic book delivery isn't necessarily
related to accessibility. For some, the new game machines are suitable
delivery platforms, costing only a few hundred dollars, with CD players,
decent graphics, graphic accelerators, and internet connections.

The co-sponsor is the National Information Standards Organization.

NISO is one of the principal sponsoring organizations for the Digital
Talking Book 3 application for whom I've been the lead DTD designer.
This application uses SMIL 1.0 for synchronizing the professional
narrations with the structured XML markup of the book.

Many aspects of e-books will be addressed, in addition to accessibility. 
George Kerscher will be our advocating speaker.

injury-related limitation that is temporary for some people and chronic for 
others _is _repetitive stress syndrome.


Para 3: Different disabilities sometimes require similar accommodations.
For instance, _full keyboard support is necessary_ for both someone who
is blind and someone who cannot use his or her hands_._ Xrequire full
keyboard support for the Xcommands in browsers and authoring tools,X
since they both have difficulty using a mouse but can use different
assistive technologies to activate commands _and keys_ that are supported
by a standard keyboard interface _to allow authoring and browsing._

Para 4: The number and severity of disabilities tend_s_ to increase as

     missing outline and summary information

Para 2: ?double negative?...and may benefit from the level of language on a
site not being unnecessarily complex for the site's intended
purpose.

...and may benefit from summary descriptions, and means to
suppress detail.
