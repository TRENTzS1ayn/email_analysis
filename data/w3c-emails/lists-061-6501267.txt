1:
for:

Individuals with learning disabilities may have difficulty processing
written language or images when read visually, or spoken language when
heard, or numbers when read visually or heard. Specific learning
disabilities can affect the ability to focus.

Could we instead say

Most people prefer things to be stated simply.
Individuals with learning disabilities may have difficulty reading or
comprehending text especially if complex.
They may not be confident with, or able to use numbers.
Specific learning disabilities can affect the ability to concentrate.


2:
Could we include a paragraph about the difficulty in searching the www for
those with LD, and the need to provide external links that help resolve this
problem?

eg:
Barriers that people with learning disabilities may encounter on the Web
include:
    difficulty browsing and searching
    too much information per page
    too many links per page
lack of alternative modalities for information on Web sites, for instance
lack of alternative text that can be converted to audio to supplement
visuals, or the lack of captions for audio
distracting visual or audio elements that cannot easily be turned off
lack of clear and consistent organization of Web sites
