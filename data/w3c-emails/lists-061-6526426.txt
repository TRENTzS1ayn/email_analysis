I wonder if E & O should be this focused on the issues (and even the
document) that was being discussed when I arrived (very) late at this
morning's telecon? Clearly it's important to deal with what was being
talked about (what's dyslexia, how about "intelligence impaired", etc.)
but IMHO it detracts from our main chartered objectives. I've been wrong
before, but here are some agenda items I think might be timely and
appropriate:

Publicize the AU Guidelines, particularly when (if?) they become a
*Recommendation*.

Publicize the ER report form for user-to-author accessibility concern
communication.

Publicize the important milestones in the "Policy" department, such as
Cynthia's recent successes with the State of California and what's up in
UK, Oz, and Canada.

Particular attention to Distance Learning Accessibility in all of the
above.

Since XHTML promises to help fulfill one of the main goals of our
guidelines (valid HTML) and will probably be a cornerstone for XML, we
should try to get all fora and spokespersons for it to mention (stress?)
accessibility benefits from *proper* XHTML usage.

Further identifying accessibility with usability in the minds of Web
Site Designers.
