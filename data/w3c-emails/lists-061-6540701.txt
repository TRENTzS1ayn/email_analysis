RE:     Web Page Design Contest

WEB DESIGN CONTEST

It's time to redesign the ACM SIGDOC Web pages (http://www.acm.org/sigdoc).

SIGDOC is sponsoring a redesign-the-Web-pages contest.  You are
eligible to join if you are a SIGDOC member or join SIGDOC at the time
you submit your entry.

The prize will be the your choice of either one free registration for
the SIGDOC 2000 Conference to be held in Cambridge, MA, or a full
one-year ACM membership.  The work would otherwise be volunteer.

The pages should meet several criteria, including:

* Compliance with the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), see W3C
  guidelines at http://www.w3.org/wai
* No cookies and, preferably, no Java
* Ability to be viewed on a wide variety of browsers and platforms without
  loss of integrity
* Ability for someone other than the designer to maintain
* Minimal download time -- not graphic intensive
* Ability to search the site
* No moving parts
* No Frames

Designs will be judged on the above, PLUS

* visual design (identity, clarity)
* navigability
* usability standards

Submit an overall design for the set of pages as well as two or three
sample pages, including the home page and a main "features and
benefits" page

Use the existing material from the Web pages as well as any ideas for
new pages.

Deadline:  December 15, 1999

Submit pages or URLs to sbjones@mit.edu, LindaSue.Trapasso@compaq.com,
nina.wishbow@entrust.com
