http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/wcag/

DO NOT USE YOUR EXISTING BOOKMARK, FAVORITE OR INTERNET SHORTCUT, or you
will go to the wrong set.

If you want to read about what has been done to the set since you last
looked at it, see the change file:

EO members with time on their hands are encouraged to review the Curriculum
