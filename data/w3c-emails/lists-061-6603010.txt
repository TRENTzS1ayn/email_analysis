Could we use headers such as chromosome factors, brain damaged, as well as
dyslexia, literacy, numeracy, and 2nd/foreign language which are specific,
or at least include these terms in a descriptive paragraph, to avoid
confusion.

"LD is a lifelong condition which results from damage to the brain before,
during or after birth, or from genetic or chromosome factors (like Down's
syndrome)."  from Mencap literature

Mencap is a large UK based charity working with mentally handicapped
children and adults
