Hi, Rob:

MAGpie is due for release in mid-november, but we should be announcing a beta test period in two weeks.  i'll add you to my tester list; if anyone else reading this message hasn't already signed up to be a tester, send me a note and i'll notify you when it's ready.  when finally released, the software will be available free of charge from NCAM and Trace.

Pleased to announce that we have added another event to our webcasts for the
new dollar coin using SMIL technology.  Please go to
http://www.usmint.gov/dollarcoin/webcast2.htm
<http://www.usmint.gov/dollarcoin/webcast2.htm>   and click the 4 June link.
There are six videos there and each has a caption video and text transcript.
We have not done the description yet, but are looking to do this in the
future.

Geoff, when is Magpie coming out and is it going to be free?
