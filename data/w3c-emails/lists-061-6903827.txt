Re: definitions, OK but some Deafness may be surgically improved, new
cochlea implants for example.
But, re: the web. yes no captions for audio, but also, the written language
levels, reading , usually do not exceed 3rd grade reading level.  That's the
level of the Boston Herald, approx.
Usually, the more complex the sentence structure, for a example, a long
sentence, including phrases the more difficult the understanding for a lot
of deaf people.  Their native language is (American Sign Language) ASL, and
although their written language is English, the two are not the same syntax,
grammar, etc. Therefore captions need to be clear, simple and precise,
basically.
Yes, H of H, Hard of hearing, have the advantage of hearing and
understanding the English Language and are therefore more successful with
written english.  Usually, captioning helps a lot, because perhaps a person
doesn't hear high pitch sounds well, such as f, s, sh, those csound s can
change words and word endings, and therefore meaning.
