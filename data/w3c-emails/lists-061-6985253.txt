1. Outreach updates

2. Policy page update
- I updated some links on policy page, but in addition to new developments,
a lot of the original links have moved. Sometimes documents have moved
URL's, sometimes entire agencies have abandoned their addresses. 
- Anyone want to check the new links & research the missing ones, keeping
consistent format with current page, and suggest new links?

3. Events calendar checking & upcoming presentation opportunities
- <http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/Events> look at it jointly, what kind
of events are missing, what presentation opportunity deadlines are upcoming? 
- Anyone want to research new events to link to?

4. Authoring Tool Guidelines FAQ brainstorming
- top ten questions that public & others are going to ask about authoring
tool guidelines once they're out? we will share these questions with the
authoring tool working group.

5. Update on Review Groups planning
- see my message cc'd to this list Oct 15, from w3c-wai-eo archive at
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-eo/1999OctDec/> (it hasn't
shown up in the archive yet, so I can't give the exact URL)
