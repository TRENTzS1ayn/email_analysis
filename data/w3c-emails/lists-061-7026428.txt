Hi all,

A few people, including myself, have been working on the Japanese
version of the QuickTips card.  And now, someone at W3C/Keio is working on
its artwork.  As we prepare the material, I came to wonder if it would
be any good to have some Braille on the cards, e.g., ``WAI QuickTips''
on one side, and the URI on the other.

I think putting some Braille on the QuickTips card is good for
following reasons:

1. It draws sighted people's attention, and (hopefully) they will look
   at the card a little more carefully.

2. It helps blind folks to identify what it is.

The No. 2. may look meaningless, but being blind myself, it looks as
important as the other.  The reason for this is that we often give
away the cards to various people for demonstration purpose, and
sometimes blind people take them hoping they can show the cards to
their sighted colleagues.  But after coming back from some
conferences, etc., the QiuckTips card may get buried in a stack of
other business cards and is very difficult to be located without
sighted help, unless they are well-organized.  At least, that has
happened to me.  (Yes, I can't deny that my desktop is pretty messy.)

Anyway, I'd like to hear what people think about putting some Braille
on the cards, and if many people think it's helpful, what should the
Braille on the card say?

     Cheers,
Max
