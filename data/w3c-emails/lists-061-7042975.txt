I agree with Max that it would be very goo. A title and a URI would perhaps
be best - I think being identifiable is the most useful thing, since we are
unlikely to fit the quicktips onto a card in braille.

  Hi all,
  
  A few people, including myself, have been working on the Japanese
  version of the QuickTips card.  And now, someone at W3C/Keio is working on
  its artwork.  As we prepare the material, I came to wonder if it would
  be any good to have some Braille on the cards, e.g., ``WAI QuickTips''
  on one side, and the URI on the other.
  
  I think putting some Braille on the QuickTips card is good for
  following reasons:
  
  1. It draws sighted people's attention, and (hopefully) they will look
     at the card a little more carefully.
  
  2. It helps blind folks to identify what it is.
  
  The No. 2. may look meaningless, but being blind myself, it looks as
  important as the other.  The reason for this is that we often give
  away the cards to various people for demonstration purpose, and
  sometimes blind people take them hoping they can show the cards to
  their sighted colleagues.  But after coming back from some
  conferences, etc., the QiuckTips card may get buried in a stack of
  other business cards and is very difficult to be located without
  sighted help, unless they are well-organized.  At least, that has
  happened to me.  (Yes, I can't deny that my desktop is pretty messy.)
  
  Anyway, I'd like to hear what people think about putting some Braille
  on the cards, and if many people think it's helpful, what should the
  Braille on the card say?
  
       Cheers,
  Max
