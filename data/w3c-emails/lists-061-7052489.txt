For consistency, add colon after magnifiers, or remove from both

We should add a category on

Font enlargers:
Capability of some browsers to allow the user to enlarge the display font,
and re-wrap lines to fit the display window. In contrast to a screen
magnifier, this re-wrapping usually avoids the need to scroll in the
writing direction, so often proves more effective for low-vision users,
unless the source is in an inaccessible image file format.

Do some of these need to do pattern matching and OCR on the pixel image
read from the actual screen image? Or do they intercept text before it
gets into the screen image generation?
