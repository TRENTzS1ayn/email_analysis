For consistency, add colon after magnifiers, or remove from both
subheads below.

We should add a category on

Font enlargers:
Capability of some browsers to allow the user to enlarge the display font,
and re-wrap lines to fit the display window. In contrast to a screen
magnifier, this re-wrapping usually avoids the need to scroll in the
writing direction, so often proves more effective for low-vision users,
unless the source is in an inaccessible image file format.
[:jma] I have problems with adding this. The major heading for this
materials is "Tools", in the introduction it discusses assistive
technologies specifically. Font enlarging capability is a function of the
browser, not an assistive technology. I see it as equivalent to being able
to use the TAB key to move between links. It helps accessibility but not
specifically an assistive technology. There are many features of browsers
that enhance accessibility-like changing foreground and back ground color. I
think it might confuse people who are unfamiliar with the range of tools
available and miss "capability of some browsers" and start looking for a
"font enlarger" tool.  I think it is useful information and I tell people
about these features all the time. I see two possible solutions
1) add another section  to the entire documents that addresses "Features of
browsers that aid accessibility".  or
2) since Some of this information already exists on EO Browser page
http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/Browsing.html in Section 3: Browsers with
adaptive technology, that this page be update and expanded to include
"Features of browsers that aid accessibility".

Do some of these need to do pattern matching and OCR on the pixel image
read from the actual screen image? Or do they intercept text before it
gets into the screen image generation?
[:jma] screen readers do not use ocr. they receive the text from the
character generator for the platform.
