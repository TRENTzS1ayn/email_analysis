Max, I have slept for a few days on your suggestion....

Recently the WAI has been moving towards a user centred rather than
hardware/software centred model.

Could quicktips cards possibly reflect these twin approaches, by having one
side devoted to each?

Thus examples that benefit individuals could be demonstrated rather than
described (QED) on one side.

suggestions include:

Braille                "Quick Tips"
Large Type       "W3C" (part of a longer word cut off might be more
effective)
Graphic            "Wheelchair" (Toilets/Microsoft)

One side would benefit from white space, but with careful design might be
able to include examples of up to 2 others such as:

label                  link and or alt
table                  Web Accessibility Initiative

The present (cluttered) look whilst informative, has limited appeal,
probably to webmasters, programmers and rule enthusiasts.
In today's fast moving world, it is vital that we grab people's attention as
well as attempt to inform them.
