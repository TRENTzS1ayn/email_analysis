aloha, max!

you aren't the only one with a disorganized desktop and a pocket full of
indistinguishable business cards -- braille on the QuickTips cards is an
excellent idea, for both of the reasons you cited... 

as for what to braille, i like "WAI QuickTips" on one side and the URI  on the
other...  i don't think we could fit the URI for the QTs on the card, so it
would probably just need to be a pointer to the WAI web space...  which makes
me wonder, could we save valuable real estate by leaving off the http colon
slash slash, or would that confuse people?
