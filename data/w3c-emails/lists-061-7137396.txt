Hi Max

I don't think we need to say WAI twice (in the URI and in the title).

I don't like URIs without http:// but I can live with them.

Sounds better to have something than to argue what it is.

  So, my proposal is to have 
  
  WAI QuickTips
  www.w3.org/WAI/
  
  on the front side of the card.  We might need to break the ``WAI
  QuickTips'' into two lines if we are to capitalize the words
  appropriately.
  
  Thoughts?
  
       Cheers,
  Max
