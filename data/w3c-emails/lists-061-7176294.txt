aloha, alan!

one note of clarification...  you wrote:

quote
  Second, there is a simple way to squeeze the URL in Braille on the card:
  State the URL as:

     w3c.org/wai

  Of course, this is not the "accepted" way to express a URL, especially
  amongst the more computer-savvy amongst us. But this format works on every
  browser I have ever tried, including Lynx. 
unquote

the veracity of the last statement depends upon how one has Lynx configured --
one can edit one's lynx.cfg file so as to activate Lynx's URL domain prefix and
suffix settings...   in plain english, that means that the user can define the
order in which Lynx will attempt to apply a schema (such as http://, ftp://,
gopher://, wais://, etc.) to a minimal URI -- such as quote w3 unquote... 
likewise, one can configure Lynx, again using the lynx.cfg file, to define a
string of domain suffixes to sequentially append to a minimal URI to attempt
resolution...

so, for example, if you had Lynx set so as to attempt to append an h t t p
colon slash slash to every URI you type, and defined the URI suffix order as:
        .com,.edu,.net,.org
(which are the default values for this setting in Lynx when it is uncommented
in the lynx.cfg file), typing
        w3
would cause Lynx to try the following URIs in the following order:
        http://www.w3.com/
        http://www.w3.edu/
.       http://www.w3.net/
        http://www.w3.org/

one last note: all of the following applies to versions of Lynx 2.6 and greater
(the functionality was added earlier, but it wasn't fully debugged and
operational until 2 july 1996), and -- unfortunately -- a lot of shell account
users who use Lynx to access the web, are saddled with a version of Lynx much
older than 2.6

PS: as for whether the triple double-yews should be dropped or not, i vote nay
-- not only for the policy reasons cited by Charles, but precisely because
there is no reasonable expectation that any URI will start three double-yews
(forgive the phonetic spelling, but it's unsettling when my synthesizer says
quote double us unquote!
