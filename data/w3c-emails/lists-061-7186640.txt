IT is important to meet the needs of the blind.
Is it appropriate to discuss the issue of braille alone.
The issues raised, run to the heart of accessibility at WAI.
"The attempt to be accessible to all."


www.w3c/wai in braille and, out of context has very little meaning.
It is very unlikely in itself to lead to hits, unlike say "freesex.com" (no relation).
This needs more thought.


The QT cards must represent an attempt to express the problems as understood at this time.
The design needs to be considered in its totality.


This example is intended to promote discussion rather than be a result.
To enable those with poor vision to better understand the design above the following is a longdesc:

an Alt tag "QuickTips" partially covers the characters W3C in a very large font say 72. 
The W of W3C supports a wheelchair in front of a short phrase in braille.
An arrow in the bottom right corner encourages one to interact and turn the card over.


As far as the Quick tips cards go they, by their nature are a token.
The very words Web Accessibility Initiative are excessively ponderous, and incomprhensible to someone with even mild cognitive difficulties. Access all areas is a little better understood.
