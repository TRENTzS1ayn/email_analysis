What is at stake here ? in my view what matters is being able to identify
the QT card against the many other cards one holds.
So the way you call it is not that important :  the blind holder knows he
has the QT card, and any brailled  name - WAI, Quick, Tip, QT - will help
to identify it against the other cards.
