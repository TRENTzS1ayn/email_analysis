I agree with Gregory.

It is most important to be able to identify the card. But since most of the
information on it is repeated on the WAI website, (among other things it says
"look at the WAI website for full detail" or something like that) if we can
also put the URI on it the card will be substantially more useful to someone
who does not already know how to find us.

  aloha, mokrane!
  
  the one missing element in your summation of the issue is that -- if the QT
  card has the URI for WAI web space embossed upon it, then it can also be used
  _BY_ a blind person, not just as a means of identification, but as a pointer to
  WAI web space...
  
  it's not merely a question of identity (although that does enter into it), but
  of making information available to the widest possible audience, and if we can
  incorporate braille (as max suggested), symbolic content (as johathan has
  suggested), and large print (possible if we adapt charles' proposal that we use
  a folding card, such as those commonly used by agencies for the blind here in
  the states), then the cards are more useful to more people...
