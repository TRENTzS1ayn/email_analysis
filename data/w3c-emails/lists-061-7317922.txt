The URL for 'Making the Web special' by Chris Abbott is
http://www.sed.kcl.ac.uk/special/makingweb.html

it is well structured:

Introduction
Part 1: What do we want to share?
Part 2: Why use the WWW?
Part 3: Structuring your site
Part 4: Who will be your audience?
Part 5: Virtual communities
Part 6: What next?
Conclusion
Appendix: The technical details - an overview

It is about two year old, and is still a good introduction to Special Needs
and the www.
It has a good list of SN school sites.
