The idea of embossing the quicktips card leaves me cold and I'm a truly
devoted brl advocate - but anything brailled is visually hampered,
particularly small typefaces.

It is mandatory that the quicktips be available in braille and it would
be appropriate to furnish such a document with its visual counterpart so
a braille user could furnish an alternative version to her blindless
colleagues.
