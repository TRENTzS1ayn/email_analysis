If you have the time to read this document please forward me your comments
so that may be adressed to the relevant persons.

http://www.iagchampions.gov.uk/wgdraftversion2.rtf is rather a large file
that contains information on policy for UK governments websites.

2 recent changes that refer to WAI are noted below:

4.3 Accessibility
In addition to compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act, it is
vital that all potential users of government web services are able to access
sites. Designers should consider carefully whether it is necessary to depart
from these recommendations and, if they do, ensure that optional displays
are available to permit inclusive access.

an additional paragraph has been added:

Designers should in addition be aware of the guidance provided by the W3Cs
web accessibility initiatives  on www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/


later within 4.3 http://validator.w3.org   has been added after the link to
bobby

Testing for accessibility

The site may be tested using Bobby <http://www.cast.org/bobby/> or a similar
system. Although this is an automated system, it can provide helpful
results.

It is almost certain that there are equally serious concerns that could be
raised,  please comment.
