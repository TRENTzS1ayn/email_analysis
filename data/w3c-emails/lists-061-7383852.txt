In my humble (yeah, right) opinion:

Overall design - I like the extra nav buttons at the bottom of the page. I
will implement this in WCAG Curriculum before we port it to W3C space.

Slide 01 of 23 - To me, there is something clumsy about the statement:
"What kinds of steps are useful in promoting Web accessibility?" How about
"How can Web accessibility be promoted?", or, "How can you promote Web
accessibility?"  Or, maybe, "actions" would be better than "steps" because,
to me, "steps" connotes a logical progression.  Even on Slide 23 of 23,
there is no real order to the "actions" you suggest. 

Slide 18 of 23 - "As of November 3, 1999, User Agent Accessibility
Guidelines have in Last Call status" >> should read "... are in Last Call ..."

Slide 20 of 23 - link to WCAG Curriculum is incorrect... should be
http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/wcag/

Slide 23 of 23 - you need a space between the line-number and the text for
points 10 and 11.

also on 23 of 23 - the title:  "... Action Steps ..." is a bit redundant.
"... Actions ..." , or, "... Steps ..." would be enough.

Chuck
