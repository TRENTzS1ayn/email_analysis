  Was there an agenda for the meeting last Friday? My last mail from the list
  is from Chuck dated November 12 and from Judy dated November 11. I'm just
  wondering if I've been thrown of the list.

aloha, helle!

no, there wasn't an agenda for the meeting last friday, but the following
topics were discussed:
    1. Outreach updates
    2. WAI Curriculum / Slide Set Update
    3. AOL Case as an Outreach Issue
    4. Brainstorming for Authoring Tool Working Group "FAQ"
    5. Wrap-Up and Announcements

i minuted the meeting and converted the minutes to hypertext and sent them to
judy last night so that they can be posted in EO's web space...  i apologize
for not getting the minutes out sooner, but a small nagging thing called life
kept me offline all weekend!

if you would like, i can email you a plain ASCII copy of the minutes,
        gregory..
