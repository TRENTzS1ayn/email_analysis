Hi Harvey...

My comments are mixed with your comments below, and prefaced with CPL::.
Thanks for noticing the bugs and for your suggestions.  The simple ones
will be fixed today.  The recompile may require the weekend to be ready.

CPL:: I will have to modify my slidemaker tools to do this, and recompile
the entire set, but it is worth doing.  I will add TABINDEX=1 to Next-slide
and TABINDEX=2 to Previous-slide.

CPL:: Fixed... it now reads: "Use W3C technologies and use the latest
versions when
they are supported by browsers."

CPL:: Since I have to recompile the entire curriculum set for item 1, I
will add a duplicate nav-cluster at the bottom of the page.  I had intended
to do this a long time ago, but I forgot somewhere along the line.

CPL:: In IE4, pressing and holding ALT-N would advance the page, ALT-P
would do previous page, ALT-I, -G, -C, and -E to the table of contents for
the Introduction, Guidelines, Checkpoints and Example sets, respectively.
This was with the ACCESSKEY attribute on the link elements.  However, IE5
has changed the way it handles ACCESSKEY.  Pressing ALT-N will move the
focus of the cursor to the tagged link, but it will NOT activate it.  You
now have to hit return after doing the ACCESSKEY combination.  This makes
it less convenient, but probably removes some of the conflict problems with
other keyboard-aware assistive devices.

Regards,
Chuck
