Hello from Germany!

I'm doing the HWG Course 'Universal Accessibility' at the moment (Week Three
Reading Assignment) so I have to deal with the WCAG. I downloaded the
'curric.zip' file twice - but neither copy of the file could be opened by
Winzip 7 SR1: it says 'missing 10 bytes in file' !

As the online costs in Germany are relativly expensive I would prefer to
have the slide sets locally to read them over. Please try to fix the
problem - or could you give me any advice how to access the downloaded
'curric.zip' with another tool to get at least the rest of the content?

Thank you very much in advance!
