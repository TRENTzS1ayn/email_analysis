Harvey... thanks for your detailed comments on the WCAG Curriculum slides.
My comments and actions follow each of your points.

CPL:: I agree... the description was somewhat obtuse.  Please note I was
NOT trying to describe the problem of older screen-readers not reading
wrapped text in cells, but was trying to explain the difficulty of not
being able to easily associate headers in large tables. I replaced the
description with the following:
Example: A travel expenses worksheet.  While the following data table
appears simple enough visually, it would be difficult to understand if read
by some of today's screen-readers.  A good way to approximate what some
screen-reader users will hear is to hold a ruler to the table, and read
straight across the screen. Then, move the ruler down until the next line
of characters is displayed.  Read straight across.  After a while, pick a
data cell at random and, without looking at the column or row title, try
and remember what headers describe that data point.   The larger and more
complex the table, the harder it would be to remember the row and column
relationships."

CPL:: As I mentioned in a previous note, IE5 does support accesskey, but
not, in my opinion, as well as IE4 did.  Regardless, I substantially
reworded the example 9.5 to make it (I hope) less confusing.

CPL:: I added the quotation marks to the example.  As to why I had the
example twice: it was a poorly realized construct to show the wrong way,
followed by the correct way, when indeed, only the correct way was
necessary.  In previous versions of the curriculum, I had many more of this
kind of example, and have gotten rid of most of them.  This one slipped by.
 It is now fixed.

CPL:: Done.  As to 10.5: when the Checkpoint is officially changed (in WCAG
V2.0 or in the Errata), I will make the change here.  I have no right to do
otherwise.

CPL::   Wasn't a <pre>...</pre> problem.  It was a CSS problem.  I think I
have fixed it.  Try it an let me know.

CPL:: the bullet text now reads"
Block alignment: CENTER
and alignment attributes in most elements:  align, valign, clear, nowrap 
Note: within tables, only align is deprecated for the overall placement of
the table on a page, and of the caption if any.

CPL:: They are now active links that don't go anywhere (or more correctly,
that link back to the NAV bar).  I added a note saying that the nav bar is
really not what it seems.

CPL:: Thanks for catching that one!  Rather than attempt an example, I
reworded the slide thusly:
"In HTML,  the DIV, and FRAME elements could also be used to group links.
Since these HTML 4.0 elements can take the "id" and "class" attributes, the
grouping could be identified using one or more of those attributes with a
descriptive name.  However, unless a standard method of grouping and
identifying links is agreed upon, then User Agents will have difficulty
catching and rendering that information."

Thanks for catching this too!  When I split 13.2 into two slides in the
last major revision, I forgot to change the link from 13.9 to point to the
actual example noted.  I used the simplest method possible to try and
address the confusion you mention, by targeting the link to the specific
paragraph in sam99-0.htm

Thanks for your detailed comments.  Every little bit helps!

Chuck
