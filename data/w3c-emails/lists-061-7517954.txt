EOWG:

If you want to get going on the first part of the EOWG agenda for
tomorrow/Dec 3rd, it is to provide EOWG comments on the User Agent
Accessibility Guidelines
<http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19991105>, which are just
closing Last Call. 

Here's how this works:

EOWG has a dependency with the User Agent Guidelines WG, namely that we'll
be obligated to help promote awareness & implementation of their
guidelines, along with other WAI resources. So this means that we need to,
as a group, consider if there are any comments/concerns that EOWG has about
the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines. It could be things like, 
- is the purpose clear?
- does the introductory matter explain the context of disability
requirements adequately & appropriately for the purpose of that document? 
- will developers or other users of the document need additional kinds of
supporting resources to make best use of the document? 
- Etc. 
So, even if you've read the UAGL before, please read it again, from an
education/outreach perspective.

Timeline-wise, we're doing this under an extension. Last Call officially
closed on Wednesday, Dec 1. I notified UAWG folks that we'd give them
comments tomorrow, after our meeting. We'll need to batch all comments at
that point; they have to be in as early as possible tomorrow. 

So any comments you have from the EOWG perspective, send to w3c-wai-eo for
discussion, then we'll batch them.

Thanks, 

- Judy
