Summary of WWW8 Developer's Day Track - Accessibility: Software and Design

Accessibility was a thread throughout the 8th International WWW Conference.
The topic was raised during various panels, plenary talks, and paper
presentations that did not have accessibility as their main focus. The most
in-depth treatment of accessibility occurred at a Developer?s Day track
devoted to the topic. The theme was "Software and Design" with five
presentations focused on software, and four focused on design. The purpose
of this article is to summarize the highlights of these presentations. Links
to the actual talks are included where available at the time of writing.
Also, a list of links to the software, specifications and organizations
discussed are provided at the end of the article. Jutta Treviranus organized
this session and heads the Adaptive Technology Resource Centre at the
University of Toronto. She reminded us that, "Accessibility in Web design
makes good design, business, and legal sense." It is hoped that this
information will assist those of us in the design, usability, and
development communities to realize this goal.
