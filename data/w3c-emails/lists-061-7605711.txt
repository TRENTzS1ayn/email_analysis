     Much existing HTML is not well-formed in the XML sense. Many
     authoring tools that have an HTML output choice make no effort to
     check for presence of attributes that are there to enhance
     accessibility.

     As many current browsers accept ill-formed documents and present
     them by default, without regard to their accessibility, there has
     been little incentive to fix their inaccessibility.

     Can a conformant authoring tool accept invalid or non-well-formed
     documents? True XML documents must be well-formed, and if there is
     a referenced DTD, also valid to it. XML parsers should bounce badly
     marked up documents.

     Can an authoring tool repair such badly marked-up documents?
     [TIDY attempts to develop well-formed HTML, where a DTD is available.]
     Any tool working on an existing ill-formed document without a DTD will
     not know which elements need empty end-tags, or where missing end-tags
     (or start-tags)
     need to go, so cannot make it valid without major assumptions like
         "any unrecognized tag is by default empty."
         "develop list of start-tag and end-tag. Any with no end-tag found
          are presumed empty. Any with some end-tags found, put in others
          in similar places."
     Few of these will be perfect. An adjusted document can be made well-formed
     only with low confidence.


     Can it augment the non-accessible versions from commercial
     authoring tools?

      None do at this time.

      Reference the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines.

>12. Do authors have to use conformant tools to create accessible Web pages?

      No, but as apps move to XML or XHTML, they will have to be well-formed
      and preferably valid as well.

      Can we include some product reviews?

             Most unlikely. [Bobby makes the author make many
             manual judgements]

>         18d. produce content that works across different kinds of browsers?

             Many accessibility solutions apply to the different kinds
             of delivery devices.

>         18e. explain how to do things like caption audio or describe video?

             Special tools to attach these text streams. ?Does SMIL Boston
             address these?

>         18f. provide some way to verify accessibility of Web pages?

             If an XML application has some required attributes needed
             for accessibility, their presence can be verified automatically.

             A decision by author as to when to validate is appropriate.
             The conformance needs to be checked before releasing a document.

>         19b. have to know much HTML to make accessible Web pages?

             No, though it helps, particularly with strict HTML 4.01 or XHTML,
             since there are some required accessibility attributes.

>         19c. have to convert their existing code?

             Hard to adjust code, scripts, applets.
             Hard to adjust style mechanisms unless authoring tool gives
             handle on CSS/XSL.

        19d. have to convert their existing documents?

             A conversion filter can adjust for some deficiencies, and may
             put place-holders in that a proper authoring tool can call
             to the author's attention.
