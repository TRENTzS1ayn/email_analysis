EOWG:

We will not be meeting this Friday, Dec 17, due to too many conflicting
meetings and proposals.

Please be on the lookout however for material on the mailing list from
Wilson Craig, for review and comment.

The next two Fridays are not good for meetings due to upcoming holidays.

That puts our next meeting at Friday, January 7, 1999.

Regards,

- Judy
