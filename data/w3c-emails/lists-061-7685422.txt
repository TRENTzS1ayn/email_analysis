WC:: "The following is a draft of a statement that would be used to
introduce assistive technology developers to the WAI..."

WL: Where and by whom would this be used? Are there AT developers who
haven't been properly introduced? Some of them are W3C members, others
are on the Working Groups. I guess I feel that the home pages of W3C/WAI
are already a reasonable introduction so: what are we to comment on
here?
