Hi Wilson...

As I recall, the rationale for you "volunteering" to write this
introduction went something like this: "There are guidelines for content
developers, guidelines for browser developers, guidelines for authoring
tool developers, but nothing specifically aimed at assistive device
developers, so it might be a good idea to spin an introductory blurb that
would engage that group."  I hope you will correct me if I have the sense
of it wrong.

One point that bothers me is that you appear to use the phrase "assistive
technology vendors" interchangeably with "assistive technology developers"
and I think you should stick exclusively to the latter.  (If you are
looking for a synonym, try "AT maker" or "AT creator".)

While I am not quite a certain as William Loughborough that developers of
Assistive Technology are as well educated about the W3C/WAI as they ought
to be, I would hope that at least the ones developing AT to use with the
Web are.

I do agree however this introduction may hard to place in the growing WAI
"background information" library.  Was this project struck with the goal of
eventually having "entry-portals" for target audiences (e.g. AU developers,
UA developers, etc.) that would list or highlight such information and
resources that are of immediate interest to that audience?  If so, then
"target-specific" introductions are valid.

Chuck Letourneau
