JRG: The user agent guidelines only really talk about "mainstream" user
agent technology.  There is no longer any conformance statement for
"assistive technologies".  Although it would be interesting look at
conformance it an assistive technology in combination with a "main stream"
user agent technology satisfied all the checkpoint for speech or braille
rendering.
