There isn't anything unique about either of these methodologies. But if they
are effectively used they can provide useful insights.

  Per your requeste, here is a brief overview of the difference in
  methodology between BizRate.com and Jupiter:
  
  BizRate is the only company that sits at the point-of-sale of over 2200
  online merchants and continuously collects data from each purchase via a
  standardized survey.  BizRate is currently collecting over 40,000
  surveys each day that capture the most current and accurate feedback
  from the online buyer.  From this, we aggregate the data and create a
  variety of syndicated research products.  The BizRate methodology also
  allows for the most unique custom research capabilities through blitz
  surveys at the point-of-sale, data mining, and the use of an online
  panel consisting of 70,000 panelists.
  
  Jupiter research delivers insight into where a strategic issue stands
  today, how the landscape will change and how clients should best
  position themselves to benefit.  Quantitative data research and
  qualitative analyst review, based on years of collective experience,
  yield actionable recommendations. Jupiter's dedicated Data Research
  group has access to proprietary consumer data, Executive Surveys, Web
  site traffic data and a host of other in-house tools. Analysts
  intelligently apply the appropriate research tool to the issues being
  explored, illustrate their theories using real-world case studies and
  build sophisticated, accurate forecast models to aid business planning.
  
   In short, the BizRate methodology is the most unique in that it captures
   online buyer data at the freshest point of retention.  No company has
   applied this methodology, least of all in the form of a standardized
   survey.  The most significant advantage of this methodology is that the
   level of accuracy of the data collected is far more reliable than that
   collected by any other method, weeks or months after the actual sale,
   and often in a non-standardized format.  By using a standardized survey,
   BizRate also has the best resources to allow benchmarking for online
   retailers.
