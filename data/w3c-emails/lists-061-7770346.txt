FYI -- Just ran across a link to this article in an online discussion
group.   I'm not sure what to make of this -- are there just a couple of
judges/lawyers who don't "get it" when it comes to the web, or is there
a real threat to the Internet?   Are these types of issues being
confronted by the Policy Interest Group?
