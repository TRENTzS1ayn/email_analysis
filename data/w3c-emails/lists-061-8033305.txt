WAI EOWG:

Any comments on Gregory's comment here?

A few thoughts: This proposed alternate EOWG meeting time is by no means
mandatory -- it is an auxiliary meeting slot, so if individuals also active
in the WCAG WG choose that meeting over the EOWG meeting, that is fine;
what seems problematic is that the 4:00 p.m. US Eastern is now too early to
be a useful time for anyone who might be interested in this group from
Japan or Australia/Eastern Time. And I've got a conflict if we move it
later on Thursday.

Comments welcome.

Judy
