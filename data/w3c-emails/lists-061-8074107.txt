A left-field proposal:

run a meeting at a time that does suit the pacific rim, but has a different
format - specifically that it is based on presentations of what is happening
in different areas of the world. In fact I would suggest a time that is
morning in Europe, and evening in the Pacific, which will be the middle of
the night in the US (especially on the east coast).

  Wouldn't help the Pacific Rim - 2 pm is 4am in Melbourne. The Pacific rim
  timezones are two or three hours either side of that...
