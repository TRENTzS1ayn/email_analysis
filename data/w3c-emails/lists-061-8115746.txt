EOWG:

To belabor the thread a bit more:

2:00 p.m. US Eastern does not help Pacific-rimmers as it is in the middle
of their night;

Middle-of-the-night US Eastern does not help US West-Coasters, who are one
of the groups we are trying to accommodate with an alternative to 8:30 a.m.
US Eastern Time meetings;

How about 7:00 p.m. or 8:00 p.m. US Eastern? Either of those should give a
time that is near the end of the work-day for US West Coasters, and at the
beginning of the work-day for Pacific Rimmers; and US Easterners will for
the most part at least still be awake.
