Alan,

Please note, as mentioned earlier in the thread, that we are not attempting
to replace the regular EOWG meeting time, but rather to add a time at which
people can participate in EOWG discussion who are unable to attend our
existing time. 

We are not trying to accomplish miracles, but rather to create an alternate
meeting time to broaden geographic participation.

I think this is sufficient discussion; I'll go about checking the bridges
and various weeknight choices.
