aloha, chuck!

thank you for your valuable comments on the rough draft...

one point you made which i wanted to address was

quote
I am concerned that being too proscriptive (e.g. requiring a team to 
include six people with specific abilities using different assistive 
technologies, one WCAG domain expert, one W3C language domain expert, etc.) 
will prevent most volunteer review groups and many governmental or 
commercial concerns from getting involved, simply because of the resource 
and management implications.

on the flip side, this is a very good way to get people with technological 
skills educated in accessibility, and to get individuals from volunteer 
groups and organizations versed in the technology...

there's a vast training ground out there called the web, and if, as you so 
rightly point out, we develop a strict methodology and ironclad 
accountability mechanisms, it would be possible to train a lot of people 
not only how to analyze a site, but how to repair the process that led to 
the inaccessibility of the site in the first place...  it is exactly what 
EO needs: a chance to raise the level of awareness of all concerned as to 
what it takes--a combination of awareness, skill, technical competence, 
inventiveness, and judgement--to make sites accessible in the quote real 
world unquote...  and, in this effort, the past work of EO (such as the 
curriculum) will be indispensable,
