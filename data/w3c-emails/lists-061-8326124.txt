I have independently been drafting a Web site accessibility rating algorithm
stemming from the work that Jakob Lindenmeyer and Reto Amb?hler had
presented at last year's WWW8 conference.  I am not developing it with
accessibility defined on a single scale though, such as 0-100, but rather in
five different "spheres."
These include:
Vision
Hearing
Mobility
Learning
Cognitive

I am trying to derive whether sites are particularly biased against one
modality, or is it generalised.  For instance, does a site with AA
conformance but lacking graphical cues also benefit a person with a learning
impairment?  Would a rating system  similar to what Zagat's restaurant
guides does, where different facets of the experience are evaluated, be
useful when coupled with search engine results? Once I have a more suitable
baseline, I will forward additional information.

Sincerely,

Evaluation and Repair has some changed info worthy of inclusion in

     http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/Review

Bullets 1 and 2, adjust to the new ER Title Change:
"Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Evaluation and Repair Tools"
(AERT).

Work in progress there:

"Rating Algorithm for Evaluation of Web Pages"

     http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/rating/

"Evaluation, Repair and Transformation Tools for Web Content Accessibility"
