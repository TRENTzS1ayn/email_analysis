This is to satisfy my action item from the f2f on 26 March to provide info 
for http://www.w3.org/WAI/Standards/

Web 3-D Consortium
Name: X3D
Host: Web 3D Consortium
Technology: X3D - Extensible 3D
Related W3C Technologies: XML, SVG, SMIL, DOM, RDF
Focus on Accessibility: "Such poorly adopted navigation consistency remains 
the norm that perhaps everyone is "access impaired" in 3D" from Extensible 
3D (X3D) Deliverables & Next-Step Plans (a presentation by Don Brutzman)
Key Issues:
Timetable/Upcoming milestones: Aiming for ISO: VRML2002. Authoring tools, 
browsers, example content, and a conformance testing suite all exist.
Their Contact: http://www.web3d.org/ Don Brutzman (brutzman@nps.navy.mil)

liaison matrix [http://www.web3d.org/TaskGroups/x3d/Web3D-W3C-Liaison.html]
