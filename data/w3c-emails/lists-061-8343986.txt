The principle of all three Guidelines is that they apply across disabilities
- in other words, if a page is double-A conformant then it is hoped that all
significant barriers have been removed, for people with all disabilities.

Follow up on whether the guidelines meet this goal should be directed to the
working group for each set of guidelines -

  Web Content Accessibility Guidelines - mailto:w3c-wai-gl
  Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines - mailto:w3c-wai-au
  User Agent Accessibility Guidelines - mailto:w3c-wai-ua

  I have independently been drafting a Web site accessibility rating algorithm
  stemming from the work that Jakob Lindenmeyer and Reto Amb?hler had
  presented at last year's WWW8 conference.  I am not developing it with
  accessibility defined on a single scale though, such as 0-100, but rather in
  five different "spheres."
  These include:
  Vision
  Hearing
  Mobility
  Learning
  Cognitive
  
  I am trying to derive whether sites are particularly biased against one
  modality, or is it generalised.  For instance, does a site with AA
  conformance but lacking graphical cues also benefit a person with a learning
  impairment?  Would a rating system  similar to what Zagat's restaurant
  guides does, where different facets of the experience are evaluated, be
  useful when coupled with search engine results? Once I have a more suitable
  baseline, I will forward additional information.
