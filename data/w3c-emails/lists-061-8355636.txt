Marja,

good comments about the feedback to the guidelines groups - this is an
important benefit we can get from doing reviews.

The tool DanBri and I have been developing for tracking conformance by using
metadata could be readinly adapted to work as you suggest - if I get time to
play with it in the next week or so I'll make the changes (they are fairly
trivial).

  Hi Judy!
  
  Sorry, I need to go to another meeting with my visitors and I thought I'll
  be just disturbing if I come for 30 minutes. So here are some comments about
  
  http://www.w3.org/2000/04/wareview
  
  Good document, I liked it!
  
  I think, it would be good if reviewers could also state somewhere if they
  had some problems or were unsure of some things e.g. of how to interprete a
  specific guideline. This would give us more feedback on problems areas of
  the WCAG and also encourage other reviewers to look more carefully some
  specific issues.
  
  Also when testing with actual users it would be good to know exactly what
  kinds of users with what devices doing what kinds of tasks in what
  environments where tested (could be a link to a detailed description).
  
  Could we have a way to add metadata to the info so we could easily add the
  results together e.g. if somebody has not tested speech input or only
  looked the WAI guidelines they could submit there partial results and then
  users sould easily select if they want to look results from the same
  reviewer or WCAG checklist results or only all the actual user test
  results, or look where the reviewers had most problems.
