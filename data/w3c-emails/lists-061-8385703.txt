I think it is important in this document to specify what skills are required,
not how many people. Training people in particular areaas is outside the
scope of the document. On the other hand, there will be different
interpretations of "an expert in WAG guidelines", or "an expert user of
screen reader technology" (which screen readers? How expert? etc).

  aloha, chuck!
  
  thank you for your valuable comments on the rough draft...
  
  one point you made which i wanted to address was
  
  quote
  I am concerned that being too proscriptive (e.g. requiring a team to 
  include six people with specific abilities using different assistive 
  technologies, one WCAG domain expert, one W3C language domain expert, etc.) 
  will prevent most volunteer review groups and many governmental or 
  commercial concerns from getting involved, simply because of the resource 
  and management implications.
  unquote
  
  on the flip side, this is a very good way to get people with technological 
  skills educated in accessibility, and to get individuals from volunteer 
  groups and organizations versed in the technology...
  
  there's a vast training ground out there called the web, and if, as you so 
  rightly point out, we develop a strict methodology and ironclad 
  accountability mechanisms, it would be possible to train a lot of people 
  not only how to analyze a site, but how to repair the process that led to 
  the inaccessibility of the site in the first place...  it is exactly what 
  EO needs: a chance to raise the level of awareness of all concerned as to 
  what it takes--a combination of awareness, skill, technical competence, 
  inventiveness, and judgement--to make sites accessible in the quote real 
  world unquote...  and, in this effort, the past work of EO (such as the 
  curriculum) will be indispensable,
