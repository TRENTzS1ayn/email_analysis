I would like to endorse Kynn's suggestion that the generation and
maintenance of an "implementation planner's kit" become a work item.  

Along these lines here are some meta-planning notes:

Rob Neff has some "model procurement language" that should be in one of the
chunks of the kit (possibly after some scrubbing).

Ron Kelly at GSA has the unwelcome task of providing aid and guidance to
people throughout the U.S. Federal Government planning their implementation
of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.  These two topics are not
synonymous, but there is a major block of the 508 standards that directly
address the Web, and a Web accessibility implementation planning kit would
be something they could a) contribute to b) share with their customers to
good effect.

When I say "contribute to," I think this is real.  If Ron understood the
nature of what Kynn suggests, I believe he could mobilize order-of-three
workers who would actually work for the team to develop the implementation
planning kit.  I say order of three because that is what I think he should
be asked to come up with.  The U.S. Federal presence should not dominate
the group, but it should be a strong presence.
