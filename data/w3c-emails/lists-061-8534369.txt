The page titled "Legislation and Policies on Information Systems Accessibility"

     http://www.itpolicy.gsa.gov/cita/law_pol.htm

contains some references that do not appear in the W3C page "Policies 
Relating to Web Accessibility",

     http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/Policy

at least by the same names.

1. I find a series under the general topic:

     Disability Related Federal Register Notices, yyyy

     These list effectively all Notices, many with pointers to
     summary and/or full text.

The current one is frequently updated (last updated 2000-05-01):

     Disability-Related Federal Register Notices, 2000
     http://www.adata.org/text-fr.html

Earlier archived ones include:

     1999 http://www.adata.org/text-archive-fr99.htm
     1998 http://www.adata.org/text-archive-fr98.html
     1997 http://www.adata.org/text-archive-fr97.html
     1996 http://www.adata.org/text-archive-fr96.html

2.  TECHNOLOGY-RELATED ASSISTANCE FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES ACT OF
     1988 AS AMENDED IN 1994   (Public Laws 100-407 and 103-218)

     http://www.itpolicy.gsa.gov/cita/tech_act.htm

3. Department of Education Accessible Software Design Criteria

     http://gcs.ed.gov/coninfo/clibrary/software.htm

4. Also, some of the descriptions therein make more explicit the legal 
identifications than in the W3C page:

     ADA reference adds Titles 1 and V

I wonder if these omissions were a deliberate decision that the content is
off-subject for WAI, or just oversight? I suggest that as a minimum add
a pointer to that page for further references.
