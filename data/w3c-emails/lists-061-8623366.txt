Of the 60 papers included in the WWW9 CD, 23 included "ccessib", a surrogate
for [aA]ccessib(le|ility). Also, each of the 8 summary html files mentioned
"ccessib". If these 31 papers, there were a total of 78 such strings found.

Since a diverse set of subjects were presented, that over half that mentioned
accessibility seems a positive indication that the authors are becoming
aware of this topic so important to us.
