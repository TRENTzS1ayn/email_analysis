WAI EOWG:

I posted this earlier today on WAI IG, and the three guidelines lists;
meant to post it to this list as well, in case people don't catch it on the
others.

Regards,

- Judy

For those following the U.S. Section 508 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,
WAI's comments have been submitted and are available at:
http://www.w3.org/2000/05/w3cwai-508nprm.html

While I cannot confirm this directly, I have heard from several people
involved in submitting that the U.S. Access Board is still accepting
comments through this week. If you are interested, you could contact them
to confirm.

Regards,

- Judy
