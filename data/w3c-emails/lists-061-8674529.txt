Hello,

Was wondering what stage of development accessibility "training and certification" plans are in currently?  Is there any training currently available?  Our company may be interested in becoming certified and "training trainers."
At the very least-we need to be knowledgable in order to make certain that our own sites and those of our clients comply.

Thanks,

Mary Summitt
