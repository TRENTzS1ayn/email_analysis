Hello everyone

The UK computer television channel 'dot TV'  have kindly given
a lot of space to our campaign for accessible Web design this
week, including our own public discussion forum on the subject.

I greatly encourage people on EO to take part in the on-going
discussion, to help us raise awareness of the issues.

Visit the 'dot TV' site at http://www.tvchannel.co.uk and click on
'Forums' then 'Talking point: disability' to participate (I'm afraid
you will have to register to post a message).

Very many thanks.

Best wishes

1.7 million people in the UK experience a serious sight problem
or blindness.
Poor Web design prevents many disabled people from getting
the most from the Web. Support our campaign for better Web
design!
