---original message

To underscore our committment concept of universal design and meeting
Section
508 standards (whatever they may turn out to be) the FMS public web site now
includes an Accessibility Statement. The wording of the statement is below
and
is available from FMS homepage (right side after the Privacy Statement) and
via
our Index page. The statement has been reviewed by Gavin in EEO as well as
FMS
staff in legal.

I want to thank Rob Neff at Mint for the idea!!!
