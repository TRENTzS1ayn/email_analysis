Hell of a start. This could well be EO's "portal to Webfix".

Perhaps as we participate more we can flesh out our own "versions"
instead of just commenting. That way we become trained as well as
trainers. Maybe the document can even be one to download, modify, and
put up for comment? Anyway that's what I will undertake. The
http://www.bib.ecs.soton.ac.uk/data/3368/html/WRWH.html paper
questioning the paucity of true inline hypertext linking suggests a much
richer use of links, so that's what I'm going to try.

Back in a few days with, I hope a demonstration of how I envision this
document.
