Please be more explicit. Good? Bad? Suggested improvements?

So that we can move this along, please make comments onto the list and we
can discuss those and take those into account. At our last meeting a few
folks offered to do alternate versions, and those didn't happen, so I'm
asking people instead to comment on this version so we can get it usable
fairly soon.

The final version will have many more links to resources -- this version
shows a reorganization, which needs comments; and suggested approaches to
try, which need comment. I haven't yet added links to all of the various
resources, but will do more of that, particularly once the basic
organization and content has gotten more comment. 

If you have specific suggestions of things you would like to see links to
(besides the obvious ones for documents or resources that are mentioned in
text and links haven't yet been added) those would also be helpful.

Any chance you can provide more specific comments on the list before our
meeting instead?
