The mind is boggled! 

The link to How to Retrofit begs for a pointer to a collaborative paper
(Gregory and Kelly Ford?) about retrofitting from a hands-on perspective
even using the simplistic thing GR did for Canaday's site?

The "back" button sure gets a lot of use. I don't know if all browsers
have a pull-down for "back" that precludes multiple "back" pushes since
often one is 4 or five deep when hyperlinking becomes addictive.

If one is to work on the whole document, it with *all* associated stuff
should be in one downloadable folder although if the link addresses are
complete this won't be necessary. It's just not fun to have to find the
style sheets if they aren't referenced externally.
