Please be clearer: again, good, bad, improvements? I don't know what you
mean by "the mind is boggled." Nor would I assume that it translates well,
for people who are following this in other than their first language.

Do you have the link for this? And what about what we've said earlier in
EOWG discussions, where we've said that in formal "WAI Resources" we wanted
to maximize on-site (on W3C-site) links where we had some assurance of
stable URI's? (You were one of the main proponents of this, as I recall).
For this training resource, however, seems like there should be some
off-site links; maybe we should differentiate those.

Not sure what you mean here; are you saying that the document set is indeed
too layered now, as Sheela was suggesting might happen, so that you're
having to jump back and forth too many times between pages? Or are you
saying something else?

Good point: once done, we can package this so it's available in the various
zip and other packages that we make available for W3C specs (although those
don't always zip the images and style sheets correctly, though they should).
