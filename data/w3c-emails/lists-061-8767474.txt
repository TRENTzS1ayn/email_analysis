JB: I think we do need a "how to retrofit" page (and remember that at a
previous call I'd mentioned that a few major corporations may be ready to
write up their experiences on that, and I'm sure we could get some smaller
organizations to as well.) Actually, working with this set of "planning a
training" pages has made me feel that we should revisit the "Getting
Started: Making A Web Site Accessible" page
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/gettingstarted>, and turn that into a similar set.
There is too much information on one page right now; some of it really
needs to be developed more (including the part about how to do an informal
evaluation of your own site, but then that also relates to our "process for
reviewing Web pages" document that we need to move along as well). I'm
thinking that eventually, we'll end up with sets or clusters of pages on
various topics, with a grand central station for an overview of the
resources, and some audience-tailored entry points to the WAI site.

minimize it?

JB: Hmmm. I made the pages as compact, file-size-wise, as I could. I'm
curious what your bandwidth is?

JB: I don't see that feature in Opera or Navigator.

JB: For now, how about grabbing:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/training/overview.html
http://www.w3.org/WAI/training/lo.html
http://www.w3.org/WAI/training/ra.html
http://www.w3.org/WAI/training/ad.html
http://www.w3.org/WAI/training/pe.html
http://www.w3.org/WAI/style/wairesource.css
Then you can experiment with those.

We may have a zip package available later today, but not sure.
