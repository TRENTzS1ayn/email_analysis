>Based on discussion at our last meeting, I experimented with some different
>formats, and invite comment on the mailing list (in advance of the EOWG
>meeting please) on this new version of the training page(s). I haven't
>received other versions from people, so I am posting this.
>
>I found myself aiming more towards Rob's comments, of keeping especially
>the top page as lean as possible (sorry Sheela, but see what you think).
>There are now five pages, linked in one set, with nothing more than one
>level down. 
>
>We need to fill in the "perspectives" page, with brief blurbs (let's say
>150 - 250 words) describing different people's approaches (e.g. audience,
>length of session, learning objective(s), key resources, favorite
>approaches, five-point outline). If you frequently do trainings, please
>draft a perspective and send it to the EOWG list. We may end up selecting a
>representative variety.
>
>Here's where the new set of pages start:
>
>http://www.w3.org/WAI/training
>
>Please take the time to comment on content also, especially for the
>"resources and approaches" page.

>Thanks,
