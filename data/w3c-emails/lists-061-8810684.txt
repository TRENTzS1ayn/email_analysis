Judy:
One comment (actually more of a question):
Can we address the issue of 'working' with students who use WYSIWYG web
editors and don't know HTML?
Perhaps a way to identify that issue in the Planning Phase and a reference
to a quick and dirty HTML primer for those students to review before the
class?
