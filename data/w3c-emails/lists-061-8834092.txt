No need to send messages to the list saying that you _will_ be commenting
on the training page set. Just send those comments in when they're ready... 

(I'm assuming that all the active EWOG members will be commenting, right?
<grin>)

>>Based on discussion at our last meeting, I experimented with some different
>>formats, and invite comment on the mailing list (in advance of the EOWG
>>meeting please) on this new version of the training page(s). I haven't
>>received other versions from people, so I am posting this.
>>
>>I found myself aiming more towards Rob's comments, of keeping especially
>>the top page as lean as possible (sorry Sheela, but see what you think).
>>There are now five pages, linked in one set, with nothing more than one
>>level down. 
>>
>>We need to fill in the "perspectives" page, with brief blurbs (let's say
>>150 - 250 words) describing different people's approaches (e.g. audience,
>>length of session, learning objective(s), key resources, favorite
>>approaches, five-point outline). If you frequently do trainings, please
>>draft a perspective and send it to the EOWG list. We may end up selecting a
>>representative variety.
>>
>>Here's where the new set of pages start:
>>
>>http://www.w3.org/WAI/training
>>
>>Please take the time to comment on content also, especially for the
>>"resources and approaches" page.
>>
>>Thanks,
