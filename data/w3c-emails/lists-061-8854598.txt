JB:: "Suggestions on how to minimize it? [multiple back button pushes]

WL: Although a case-by-case study might be revelatory (does one link to
a section of a page which is just yet another link to get anything
meaningful?) it won't matter much in this case because everything is
fairly quick - and will be really quick this time next year in all
probability.

JB:: "I made the pages as compact, file-size-wise, as I could. I'm
curious what your bandwidth is?"

WL: The reference to back button delays actually isn't very germane here
because we're dealing with small loads but the real problem at my end is
that I live at the end of five miles of noisy copper, an RF relay across
the Columbia River, a telephone junction box on Hwy. 97 which usually
has a Sprint repair truck parked near it, a Goldendale modem bank
with... you get the idea. Don't be diverted from lots of layers, they
are A GOOD THING.

I will "grab" the files you pointed to and try to do something useful. I
probably won't have much to report for a while, but I still think it's
an important exercise and would urge all members to consider doing so.
Talking about all this so much is fine but at some point, it's important
that someone besides Judy, Charles, Ian, Wendy, and the usual suspects
DO something useful.
