Hi,
Firstly, my apologies for not putting up my version of this trainings page.
I was planning to do it today, but Judy beat me to it!!

Some thoughts.

1. I like the use of style sheets. It is a great way to 'chunk' information.

2. I think the 'planning' page is coming together. In my opinion, the
planning page should contain enough information so that a trainer can
quickly get a sense of all the elements he/she needs to cover by looking at
that single page. It should act like a list of check points and if he/she
wants more information, the hyperlinks should be be used. Given that goal,
the section on this page called 'Arrange Resources in Advance' is probably
the most well constructed. The four points under this section -'Consider
online or off-line presentation modes', 'Arrange equipment', 'Order W3C/WAI
materials in advance' and 'Check need for accessible formats' all provide
concrete informtion. I like the way each of these are hyperlinked to the
same page. I don't think 'Determine Needs and Expectations' and 'Choose
Resources and Approaches' are constructed as well. In the second
particularly, the title of the section is repeated again as a point below
it. I think we can definitely come up with 3 points (each not more than 8-10
words) that can serve as checkpoints for 'choosing resources and
approaches'.

Here is a thought for 'Determine Needs and Expectations' section. How about
changing the heading to read 'Gather information about needs and scope'? The
points under that would be 'Find out audience needs and expectations in
advance', 'Discuss potential learning objectives with your host', 'Know the
skill level of your audience', 'Determine the duration of your session'.

Something like that...Not more than 4 points, but 4 important points. Then
similar to the 'Arrange Resources in Advance' section, these could all be
hyperlinked to the same page if folks need more information on each.

3. Currently, the planning page seems parallel to the rest if you look at
the hyperlink navigation scheme on the top of the page. This can confuse
users. They should know that even if they drill down they can always come
back to a 'launch' page (i.e. the planning page) to get an overview and
continue down the list of checkpoints. It may be a good idea to called it
some slightly different. 'Planning Overview', maybe? Also, we need to
visually indicate that the other four links (objectives, resources,
arranging, perspectives) are 'under' the planning page-not parallel to it.

4. I don't know if William was referring to this, but the user is often
forced to use the 'back button' once he/she selects a link from the planning
page. That is because the link from the main page usually takes you right to
the section (eg. Arranging Equipment) and if your window is small, you
cannot see the navigation scheme at the top of the page. Maybe after every
chunk, there should be a link that says 'Back to Planning Overview'. On many
pages, we see a 'Top' link that takes you back to the top where you have
your navigation scheme'. Some web pages have all the navigation as a
sidebar, so this is not as much an issue. I don't think users will know that
they need to scroll back to the top to navigate back. We should not rely on
the back button as the only way to get back.

5. It was a little confusing to have each objective link to example
resources and approaches. That has been mentioned in the learning objectives
section, but maybe it needs to be emphasized more. Visually, we might want
to make that sentence bold or italicized, or something like that.

6. I haven't reviewed the content of resources and approaches very closely.
I will try to do that before the meeting.

Looks good!!
