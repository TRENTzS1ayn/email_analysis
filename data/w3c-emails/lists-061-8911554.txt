I think the "resources and approaches for training" page is especially
densely packed, and so it would be helpful to find some ways to break that
up or present it a little differently, but without scattering the
information onto too many additional pages.

Bear in mind that these aren't intended to be presentation slides. They are
intended to be resource pages, and not too large a set. "Only one topic per
page" may be a good approach for a presentation format, but would make this
set of resource pages more difficult to use by greatly increasing the space
that someone would need to wander through to find information.

Right, we can add a link to the before/after demo site which we are
developing, once that is available.

No, I can't; this set of pages is not the actual training materials, it is
a resource listing of training materials. Over time we can develop and link
to many kinds of training materials, some of which could perhaps have
customizable styles. But we still need a central listing, with a style
that's generic enough to any audience -- which is the purpose of this set
of pages.

?

>and the need to demonstrate kit and software.

Those are resources that we could potentially develop over time.

I believe that screen reader users are familiar with the use of bar
vertical as a navbar separator. If that is not the case, would a screen
reader user please reply on that question.
