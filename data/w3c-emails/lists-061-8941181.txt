Thanks for your extensive and thoughtful comments. If you still want to put
your page up, please feel free, and send us a pointer; or feel free to
tweak the zipfile of these pages, & post for comment.

And fun to learn & use; both the CSS book by H?kon Lie & Bert Bos, and the
one by Eric Myers, are helpful.

Right, a checklist...

Good point. Let's discuss approaches at the meeting tomorrow.

If we could do it in no more than three points for each H2, then we would
keep that first page from becoming too overwhelming. Let's discuss. Or
others may want to comment on this point on the list.

Right. Hmmm. What about just "Overview" for the first one? And then how
could we differentiate the next ones; perhaps just naming it like that
would accomplish the objective?

Yeah, one kind of feels lost when one lands in the middle of a page.

We could discuss "top" or "back" options in the meeting.

We could always use frames <grin>.

CSS positioning is still iffy in terms of browser implementations, no?
Anyone have new updates on that?

Agreed.

I'm not at all sure it's the best organization yet. But I haven't figured
out another way. There's too much on the resources and approaches page. 

>6. I haven't reviewed the content of resources and approaches very closely.
