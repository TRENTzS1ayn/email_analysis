Great. Thanks for all your comments here, these are helpful.

It would be good if we can spend some time tomorrow discussing the ideas on
the resource page, then, because not all of these have been equally well
road-tested.

There are many resources mentioned on the list that would be helpful to
develop further -- as you and Chuck have mentioned, the "How People with
Disabilities Use the Web" is critical to get in a usable format as soon as
we can. I'll be editing in some of our previous comments to that shortly,
and putting it out for more discussion. 

But there's a bit of a problem with W3C developing guides on accessibility
approaches or concerns with non-W3C, proprietary technologies. W3C is not
necessarily in a position to make unilateral representations regarding
problems or issues in other technologies -- however, it is possible that
such guidance might be developed jointly with other organizations, and in
fact WAI is beginning one or two such discussions.

Depends how many things we'd be putting on there that would be specific to
training. There's also the possibility of linking back to a central "WAI
Resources" page -- (different from the "WAI References" page which includes
a number of external links (and which needs to be updated) and different
from the "Training Resources" page. The "WAI Resources" page which we've
talked about quite a while ago will either be a directory of or include
very short blurbs on the whole range of WAI-produced W3C Recommendations,
Proposed Recommendations, Working Drafts, Notes, and WAI EOWG Resource Pages.

Can't wait to read those trainer perspectives. Karl, can you draft one,
based on the GSA trainings you've been organizing? We'll may
mix/match/combine topics and perspectives, but might help to set a blurb
about your trainings.

The trouble with giving people the whole list would be making sure to
manage expectations. Realistically, only a fraction of the objectives can
be addressed in any one session.

I don't think we should have unlimited perspectives, though.

Several methods. Large print, braille, disk, Web...
