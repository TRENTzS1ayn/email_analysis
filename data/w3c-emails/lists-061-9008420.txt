Hello Judy
There are problems with the links in the download version. I can't link from
the overview  to the other pages. I've tried to change the HREFs without
success.
Kind regards

For those who want to play with different formats of the pages on your own
(and then share them with the list) there is now a zipped package at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/training/training.zip

Let me know if you have any problem downloading.
