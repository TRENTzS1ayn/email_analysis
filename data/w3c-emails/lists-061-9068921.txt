Another state reporting they are aware of accessibility issues.

"The Michigan Department of State (MDOS) has made a concerted effort to
comply with the World Wide Web Consortium standards for web content
accessibility. This includes developing web pages that operate with most
assistance software for people with disabilities."

That is the first paragraph from:

     www.sos.state.mi.us/info/accessible.html

I note that page lacks alt="brief description" on its images. It also
lacks separators between active elements in its menu. On another page,
an image map has only text in the images to guide their links, no alt.
I have sent comments back to them.
