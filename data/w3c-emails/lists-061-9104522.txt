J-f-W well well, the meeting went okay, I came away feeling that the lady
had a definite feeling for special needs, but had perhaps got caught up in
the thrill of a very successful company and a good post.
Also I am not the most hypy person, perhaps I could book you an appointment
(no offence)
The W3CWAI stuff hardly trips of my tongue, not much does....
I felt she wanted to make sure they weren't going to be left behind by the
competition.
It went better than it sounds.

Jaws installed very easily, can be turned off and works fine, it is very
easy and natural to customise.

Emacspeak is another matter....  I have found T.V. and Jason rude at times
and not very helpful in general.
There seems to be a feeling that if you cannot get it together, you must not
need it.
I may have to wait for speaKedit until the students get to see this stuff in
action.
It is important to realise that they will benefit at least as much as the
blind prof with m.e. or m.s. or whatever.
It doesn't make such great headlines, CD is not soft and cuddly.
Do you know of any other similar linux products?
Perhaps someone (at CAST?) who uses emacspeak and is a boffin, and
sympathetic, i've only a few months linux experience, no C and it seems to
be a problem getting emacspeak to perform.

This afternoon I took one group to see a production of the Tempest by
another group.
Wow live Acting, Singing, Dance, Music and Signing, with video, slides,
projected symbols and script text, and of course costume, scenery and wild
face painting. A wonderful romance, with flirty leads.
It will be a while before we can fit all that on a web page.

I have very high hopes for Linux, our students now have a Dell433mc ie 486
800mb 20Mb 256c laptop running Mandrake 7.0 with icewm at present, as an ok
GUI.
Phew
Soon I hope to have a few desktops as well.
