Well folks today is my last day at the United States Mint.  I am leaving to
return to the private sector,  zales.com.  but i am proud to push my last
project here, the Golden Dollar Interactive Map,
http://www.usmint.gov/GoldenDollar/gdim/main.html
<http://www.usmint.gov/GoldenDollar/gdim/main.html> 

This went live a bit a go and pioneers a technique  where people with
disabilities who have macromedia flash turned off  or have screen reader can
now read the alt tag...we  (all of us) pioneered it!  and pls let the list
know if there are any issues, so we can improve this!
 
Also, if you go to the Golden Dollar web site,
http://www.usmint.gov/GoldenDollar/ <http://www.usmint.gov/GoldenDollar/> ,
you will find multimedia clips that are captioned or have text transcripts.
 
here is proof that designing cool web sites for people with disabilities can
be done!
