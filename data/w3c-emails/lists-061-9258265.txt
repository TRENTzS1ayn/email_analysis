Hello,

i put a new version of the page up on the internet, same address:
www.bartimeus.nl/access/week252000eng.html 
i made most of the changes you advised and added a nontabular version.
Still have to add the ABBR tag to n/a.
As to your question:
PS: pardon my anglo-centrism, but is there an english version of your 
site?  do you know of a reliable dutch-to-english auto-translator through 
which i could create a link to your site for english-speakers?

Until now we have been very busy making as much information as possible 
accessible to the Dutch by giving it in Dutch. English is our second priority.
And as to translate programs, they mostly do a very lousy job translating from
Dutch to English and vv.

Kindest regards,

Eric Velleman

aloha, eric!

thank you for taking the time to compile such a useful resource...

i do have a few comments on the page:

1) in the English version of Opera, the default keystroke for moving from 
link-to-link is Control+DownArrow to move ahead one link and 
Control+UpArrow to move back one link -- using the tab key will work, 
provided that there aren't any forms on the page, as the TAB key is 
reserved for moving from form control to form control, and initially 
pressing TAB on a page which contains a form, moves the application 
cursor/point-of-regard to the first form control...  once in "forms mode" 
repeated tabbing merely cycles one through all of the available form 
controls, until the user uses the F9 keystroke to remove focus from the 
form...  note that one MUST use the F9 command to escape from forms mode, 
as Control+UpArrow and Control+DownArrow do not move the 
point-of-regard/cursor out of the form, as one might expect...

2) in an attempt to define minimal conformance for UAAG checkpoint 10.5

quote
           Allow the user to configure the user agent so that the user's
           preferred one-step operations may be activated with a single
           input command (e.g., key stroke, voice command, etc.).
           [Priority 2]
           Note: User agents are not required to provide single command
           activation of all user agent functionalities at once, only some
           of them. Furthermore, in some modes of interaction (e.g., when
           the user is entering text), the number of single commands
           available will be significantly reduced. This checkpoint is an
           important special case of checkpoint 10.4.

Kitch Barnicle, of the TRACE R&D Center, posted a list of default 
keybindings for IE, Netscape Navigator and Composer, and Opera to the User 
Agent Working Group's mailing list...  her post is archived at: (long URI 
warning)
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0433.html>
and her list of single-stroke command keystroke commands is available at 
the following (incredibly long) URI:
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/att-0433/01-single_key.htm>

3) could you please make a non-table-ized version of the keystroke commands 
available?  when accessed via Lynx (version 2.8.3dev.17), the contents of 
the table read as follows:

far from the most unintelligible linearized table that i've ever heard, but 
a definition list as an alternative to the table would be a definite 
improvement to the overall usability of the page...  and there are definite 
places (such as the enlarge and decrease font size, where it is completely 
unclear from the linearized version to which browser the keybinding 
belongs...  if building a definition list along the lines:

Enlarge Fontsize
         IE: n/a
         Netscape: n/a
         Opera: Control+] (Right Bracket)
Decrease Fontsize
         IE: n/a
         Netscape: n/a
         Opera: Control+[ (Left Bracket)

(using the ABBR element to title the abbreviation n/a as "not applicable")

doesn't appeal to you, could you make the page available via a link that 
references some form of Tablin, the ER WG's table linearizer, either by 
server-side script, proxy server, and/or a (clearly demarcated) 
auto-submission button, more information about which can be found at:
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/Tablin/>
and <http://www.w3.org/WAI/setup/>

if you want to know more about Tablin, please ask daniel dardallier, 
courtesy of the ER-IG mailing list:
    <w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org>
in order that others might benefit from his expertise, as it is daniel who 
maintains Tablin

i hope you find these comments useful -- if you would like more 
information, please contact me via the WAI lists, so that we can continue 
this dialogue in public, where others might have more to contribute...
