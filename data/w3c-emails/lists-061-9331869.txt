I am a bit concerned by these results.  I find that several of them are not
fully accessible according to WAI guidelines, and the majority of these
designs would not be considered acceptable in any commercial environment,
which I was hoping the contest would encourage.

Web Design 2000 Contest Entrants


EASI's Web Contest Awards
EASI is proud to announce the results of its contest for universal web
design. Web Sites were evaluated both on their general attractiveness and
HTML design as well as their accessibility for people with Disabilities.
EASI bears full responsibility for its decisions. While EASI strove to
conform to the WAI guidelines, in many cases, decisions and comparisons
become subjective.
We have ranked the winners in four categories: Extraordinary, Exceptional,
Honorable Mention and Fully Accessible.

We thank our winners for setting an example for other web designers to
follow.
