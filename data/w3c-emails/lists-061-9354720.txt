Laurence, Alan, 

I've added it to our agenda for tomorrow's EOWG meeting. 

I had some of the same reaction as Laurence, but noted that all the winning
sites in the contest seemed to be university-based, and so aren't
necessarily going to reflect leading edge electronic commerce design.

My general reaction is that these kinds of contests really help awareness.
I don't think that they're supposed to be a substitute for the "gallery"
that we've been talking about <http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/Gallery>; 
and over time, there should be more & more choices of Double-A WCAG
compliant Web sites from which any contest can select winning designs, and
also more & more choices of tools & approaches with which to
comprehensively evaluate sites. But in the meantime -- nice to see people
including accessibility as in contests.

By the way, I get an error message at the "extraordinary design" award site
-- "Could not find the application specified in the URL", using Opera 3.61.
Anyone else get similar result?
