Outreach updates:

Have a meeting monday with RMIT to look at all their web courses and how
accessibility fits in.

Have a meeting thursday with people who are looking at setting up a
commercial accessibility testing service in Australia - there is a fair bit
of demand for the service.

Contacting various people about Authoring tools - journalists and
developers, although I am also interested in people who are looking to buy
accessible authoring tools. Received a query from one developer - is there
information published by the US governement relating to what things meet
requirements like 508?

Also received a request for information about studies that show that the WCAG
works to improve accessibility.
