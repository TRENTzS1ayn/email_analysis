It has been pointed out (thanks, Carlos) that for trainers to have as
complete a set of resources to use in their training it must be pointed
out to them that, e.g. pointers to the WAI techniques documents must
include caveats along the lines of the unfortunate "until user
agents..." clause. I.e., browser incompatabilities that conflict with
the urge to use CSS, etc. should be noted and updated as the conflicts
ease. 

However this should not stop us from providing would-be trainers of Web
authors and managers with as full a set of resources contributing to
accessibility as is possible. 

So when, as I'm sure you will, you contribute submissions for inclusion
in the "resources for training" please include any notices of possible
problems with their use.

If we can find *normative* documents from other than W3C sources that
might fill the instructor's tool box in this area, we should discuss
whether to incorporate their intent and content or merely link to them.
Several commercial institutions have policies and guidelines in these
matters that may differ from as well as amplify our intent.

So this thread should be used to deal with: suggestions for further
inclusions in the training resources list; caveats for the
already-included items; discussions about inclusion of "outside"
resources in connection with their probable worth and reliability of
persistence; should in-line hyperlinks be to externals?
