Hello
While I still remember I'll send a few comments right away

Make the one word links longer e.g.:
"Discuss slides six and seven from Overview of WAI". would be: Discuss slide
six <underlined> and slide seven<underlined> from overview of WAI.
"Discuss selected sections of the Techniques for Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines." We have to point directly to sections in the Techniques....
This is the document (to my experience) that makes people quit designing
accessible web sites, and therefore when pointing to it we have to be very
specific. I haven't had time to look at the new drafts, maybe they are
easier to use.
"Ask groups of participants to choose sections of WCAG, study them, and then
present to the rest of the group." I would never do this. Does everyone know
what WCAG is? To be more international we have to link to the translations
of WCAG and the policy page for trainers to find equivalent or supplying
guidelines from their own countries.
"Introduce WAI technical reference documents on HTML, CSS, and SMIL." this
link has to be broken into specific links to each document. If one follows
this link the target is not precise enough.
More comments will follow but now it's week-end in Denmark
