Hello 
Sorry but can't be by a phone for the meeting tomorrow. I'll take a look at
the policy page and send the latest news from Denmark. By the way
accessibility has now been added as a separate parameter in the Danish
"golden @"  competition. So for the next month a group representing
different disabilities has to validate 100 specially selected websites
(mainly commercial). I'll let you know how we manage! 
Kind regards
