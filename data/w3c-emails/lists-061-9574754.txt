Hi,
I will be giving presentations on Universal Design to a group of teachers 
in Springfield (Massachusetts) tomorrow. Hence, I will not be able to 
attend the phone meeting. I do intend to distribute the Quick Tips card to 
each participant!

Judy, I am not sure what the agenda items are, but would like to volunteer 
for any task that might come up at the meeting tomorrow.  Do let me know.

Talk to you all at the next meeting.

Thanks.

Sheela Sethuraman
