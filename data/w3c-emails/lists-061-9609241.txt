Here's one that the State of Connecticut has participated in:

http://www.gii.com/awards/index.html

"The Global Information Infrastructure (GII) Awards program is the
Internet industry's premier leadership initiative honoring a wide
variety of businesses, organizations, and communities. The Awards
showcase the advancements that are possible in all sectors of business
and society when network and Internet technology are creatively
applied."

I don't know that accessibility was one of the criteria, though.

Their site says: 

"Winning a gold award is recognition of a total commitment to the
pursuit of website excellence.  It represents an outstanding website
with a very high standard of design, accessibility, content,
originality, professionalism & effectiveness."



http://www.lib.umich.edu/megasite/best.html

Their site says: 

From an initial selection of over 50 health information megasites, we
had selected 25 for this review. From those 25, we selected only six as
best overall, three each in Design and Content. 
...
For Design, we asked that a site: 

adhere to principals of good web design as defined in commonly accepted
resources (see Bibliography); 
that no design features interfered with accessibility (ie. ADA issues,
known in the web environment as "web accessibility"); 
that higher level technical features (such as cookies, java, frames, and
animated GIFs) were used minimally or were incorporated into the design
in a way that allowed patrons to work around them if needed;  and the
results from the search engine tests. 


I also found a Web Accessibility Web Ring, at 
http://hs.riverdale.k12.or.us/Accessibility/webring.html

but there are only two sites in the ring.,
