WAI EOWG:

Please check the proposed meeting schedule at
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/#Meetings> and let me know how it meshes with
your calendar. 

Note that I have proposed once-monthly additional meetings at a time that
might facilitate more regular participation from East Asia, Australia, and
the US West Coast. We had discussed this a few times, and there seemed to
be general willingness to try an additional time slot. 

The idea would be that most people would just attend the time slot that was
convenient for them, and a few people would attend both meetings, for
continuity (and to get a double dose of the discussion...)

Please 
- see whether you can make sense of the schedule
- see if there are any major collisions with different events
- comment on feasibility

Thanks,

Judy
