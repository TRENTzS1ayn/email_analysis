5. Policy references
- updated a number of references, check it out at 
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/Policy>
- I put out a query for more US State-level policies to Tech Act
colleagues, and am thinking of breaking out a separate page for those;
sound good?
- sent mail to Reidy Brown to inquire what he was compiling on
universities; what about us linking to a select batch of model policies,
and then to an off-site comprehensive list of policies?
- replied to Raphael Romero on some policy questions
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2000JanMar/0036.html>. We
had talked a few months ago about developing a page giving some background
on potential advocacy approaches. What do people think about including some
of this information?

6. WAI Overview Slides
- completed on-line "Web Slides" introduction to WAI 
<http://www.w3.org/Talks/WAI-Intro/slide1-0.html>
- it's now listed as a resource in the (updated) resource section of the
WAI home page
<http://www.w3.org/WAI#Resources>
- and from the W3C "Talks" page (which is a bit on the outdated side in
general)
