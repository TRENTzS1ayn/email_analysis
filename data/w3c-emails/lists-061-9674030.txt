For the minutes of the January 7, 2000 conference call:

----------------

The Government of Canada, in its continuing effort to make its electronic
information and on-line services accessible to all Canadians, has begun a
pilot project operating a ?Web site Accessibility Testing Service?.  The
service is sponsored by the Chief Information Officer?s Branch of the
Treasury Board Secretariat, and hosted by the Enabling Resource Centre of
the Public Service Commission.

GoC Web masters or design teams can make an appointment to watch as persons
using enabling technologies experience their designs under real-world
conditions.   Also on hand will be an expert in accessible Web site design
to advise the client on how to make their designs conform to the Treasury
Board?s and W3C?s guidelines for universal accessibility.

Provisions will be made for the evaluation team to be mobile should a
client?s design reside on a department?s Intranet server or in an otherwise
secure environment.

The service, located in downtown Ottawa, will only be available to local
GoC organizations during the pilot phase.  However, since the Enabling
Resource Centre is fully equipped as a teleconference site, this service
has the potential to be rolled out across the country.
