AIR is an annual event in which members of the high tech community compete
to build accessible web sites for local nonprofit organizations. This year
(1999), more than 175 people on 22 teams participated in AIR-Austin, the
annual web competition sponsored by IBM, Powershift Group, Infotec, Gray
Cary Ware & Freidenrich, and Applied Materials. AIR-Austin pairs non-profit
organizations with web design houses to work collaboratively develop new or
redesign existing sites in a friendly competitive contest. Points are
awarded for accessibility (52%), functionality, appropriateness, and
aesthetics. Awards are publicly presented at the annual ChariTech
convention.

Rob,

Great info, and interesting matrix, thanks.

Now, if we could get some of these contests to consider sites with great
design, but that are accessible, that load in less than 30 seconds, and
don't require special plug-ins, that would be great.
