This looks good to me. (And I like the idea of friendly time zones).

  WAI EOWG:
  
  Please check the proposed meeting schedule at
  <http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/#Meetings> and let me know how it meshes with
  your calendar. 
  
  Note that I have proposed once-monthly additional meetings at a time that
  might facilitate more regular participation from East Asia, Australia, and
  the US West Coast. We had discussed this a few times, and there seemed to
  be general willingness to try an additional time slot. 
  
  The idea would be that most people would just attend the time slot that was
  convenient for them, and a few people would attend both meetings, for
  continuity (and to get a double dose of the discussion...)
  
  Please 
  - see whether you can make sense of the schedule
  - see if there are any major collisions with different events
  - comment on feasibility
  
  Thanks,
  
  Judy
