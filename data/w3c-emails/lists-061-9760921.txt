The US MINT (that's me) hosted the Government Intranet Roundtable.  Discussed aceessiblity, web casts, SMIL, etc.  We may get some press out of it as people are looking to us for best practices.  we are desperately awaitng the ACCESS Board recommendations.

Also presenting at two different govt seminars thsi spring on e-gov and the topic is universal design.
