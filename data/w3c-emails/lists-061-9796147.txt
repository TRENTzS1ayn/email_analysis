Hi EOWG, 

We've gotten some good responses on the Thursday alternate meeting time
option, but things are not yet all in place for that so we won't be meeting
today Thursday January 20. I hope to have a Thursday meeting set up within
the next several weeks so we can start that.

We will however meet at our regular time on Friday US Eastern at 8:30 a.m.

The agenda for that meeting will immediately follow this mesage (depending
on how your server delivers things...)

Judy
