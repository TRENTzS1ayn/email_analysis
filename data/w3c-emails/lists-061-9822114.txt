Hello Judy and all,
We would be glad to participate in the EO Meeting on Friday 21, at 8:30
a.M. your time. 
I had a look at your pages about the review groups planning and the gallery
planing and find them all right. 
I would like to present shortly what has been taking place in France in the
establishment of a french review group. 

A group of experts specialised in the field of accessibility for people
with visual impairment has already been constituted. We have begun to
review a selection of web sites according to an evaluation method we had
preliminary defined. 
This group is going to include people with motor disabilities very soon. 
We will be able to present the first results of our review group at the
CSUN conference. We have selected around 20 web sites belonging to
different categories that will be soon presented in an observation gallery. 
Dominique and I will give you more details on this group at the EO meeting
if you wish. 

Regards

Sylvie
