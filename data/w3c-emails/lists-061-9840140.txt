Hi Sylvie...

As another thing to look at, the RNIB has begun endorsing sites, listed at

  Hello Judy and all,
  We would be glad to participate in the EO Meeting on Friday 21, at 8:30
  a.M. your time. 
  I had a look at your pages about the review groups planning and the gallery
  planing and find them all right. 
  I would like to present shortly what has been taking place in France in the
  establishment of a french review group. 
  
  A group of experts specialised in the field of accessibility for people
  with visual impairment has already been constituted. We have begun to
  review a selection of web sites according to an evaluation method we had
  preliminary defined. 
  This group is going to include people with motor disabilities very soon. 
  We will be able to present the first results of our review group at the
  CSUN conference. We have selected around 20 web sites belonging to
  different categories that will be soon presented in an observation gallery. 
  Dominique and I will give you more details on this group at the EO meeting
  if you wish. 
  
  Regards
  
  Sylvie
