People who are interested will be submitting pages
and whilst the group would be able to help.
it is important to build some form of search function
as the the work is in progress and from the start.

ie a box to type a keyword into, with responses limited to WAI pages, or
possibly including members pages.

it is very difficult to pre-define the interests of users woth such a broad
based project.
