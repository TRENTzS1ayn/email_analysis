There is a search facility on W3C's website, and some groups such as the WACG
group have a search their area facility on their homepage -
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL

Is this the sort of thing you mean? I can talk to the systems team about
a simple version that looks for things in wai space if you like...

  it is important to build some form of search function
  as the the work is in progress and from the start.
  
  ie a box to type a keyword into, with responses limited to WAI pages, or
  possibly including members pages.
  
  it is very difficult to pre-define the interests of users woth such a broad
  based project.
