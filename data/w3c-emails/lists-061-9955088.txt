 We are implementing CSS on the intranet and have seen two snafus that we
are
 looking at now.

 1.  We use Documentum, a electroninc document management system, as our
 document delivery system.  It has a server piece that sits on the web
server
 and queries the document database for documents.  On the CSS page is an
 embedded query that starts the Documentum server piece and returns the
 documents.  This is not working well with CSS.  It is blowing up on IE 5
and
 locking upnon IE 4.

 2.  We have a simple intranet with headers and footers and inlcudes for
each
 and we have applicaitons.  We also are having serious problems implementing
 the CSS as is does not work well or not at all on all builds of Micorsoft
 Internet Explorer.  This is causing us to reinstall Micorsoft Internet
 Explorer.

 CSS is not integrating well and we are troubledhooting to see what the
 problem is.  For exmaple we are building a simple HTML page to test
 fucntionality with th browsers.

 Anyone else having problems like this?
