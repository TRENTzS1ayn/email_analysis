Carlos,

Please advise your colleagues at SIDAR that the glossary is in a very early
draft stage, and we expect it will be changing considerably over the next
several months (there is a group of people starting to work on it) and so
they should be careful not to assume that it is a completed or official
document yet.

Thanks,

Judy
