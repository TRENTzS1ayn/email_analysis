The translation is in fact two thirds based on Recommendation documents, plus
a draft of UAAG. It is not the tranlsation of the working glossary that we
are trying to use for the future versions, but of the original basis - the
combined glossaries published by Harvey. But it's still useful - not least
for translating The specs themselves.

  Carlos,

  Please advise your colleagues at SIDAR that the glossary is in a very early
  draft stage, and we expect it will be changing considerably over the next
  several months (there is a group of people starting to work on it) and so
  they should be careful not to assume that it is a completed or official
  document yet.

  Thanks,

  Judy
