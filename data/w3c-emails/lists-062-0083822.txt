I prefer the card with "the ... element":
         a) it reads better (i.e. slightly more grammatically).
         b) to me it looks better with the last line of text on the front 
side almost in line with the "over" arrow.  It appears to make the 
margin/padding uniform on all sides.
         c) it is slightly more informative - there is a difference between 
elements and attributes so why not emphasize that fact.

Having said all that, I won't stop handing the cards out if you choose to 
go with the simpler fix.

Cheers!
