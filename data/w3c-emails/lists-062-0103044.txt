Judy et al,

Here is a strong opinion in favour of "the ... element:"

I greatly prefer the version containing the extra words. The two revised
points are much clearer than before. I happen to be reading an HTML primer
right now. When I read the new version of the Quick Tip card, I am reminded
that that noframes and map are "elements" (as opposed to "attributes,"
"values," etc.), and this reminder powerfully reinforces what I am learning.
To my ears, the extra words do not make the points sound overly technical; the
extra words enhance clarity and aid my understanding.

The inclusion of the extra words sacrifices only a little in terms of visual
aesthetics. Of course, it would be nice to have more white space at the bottom
of Side 1, but the new version is not unattractive. I don't find it clunky.
Maybe the printer can tighten the leading a little, but if it can't be done,
the polar ice caps are not going to melt.

I am willing to trust those who translate Quick Tips into other languages to
use their ingenuity to make everything fit.

Alan
