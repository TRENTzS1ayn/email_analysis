There may be some groans but I think it's worth it to think this thing
through clearly.

Good point -- noframes could be read as a typo, and if it were considered a
typo, the implications would be pretty bad: it would be misinterpreted to
mean that we are against the use of any frames, which is not the case. I
think this is a very important point.

Right.
