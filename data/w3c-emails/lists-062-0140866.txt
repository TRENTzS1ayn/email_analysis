EOWG:

Thank you for all the quick feedback! 

It's been pretty unanimous in favor of adding "the...element," so that's
what we'll do.

The only concern raised internally on this change was that it will require
some extra coordination and gradual updating of all the translated
versions. Some of the translations are in different situations -- needing
typo corrections soon anyway, or needing re-printing to replenish stock
anyway, or using different scripts so that the English "map" and "noframes"
will jump out in any case, although we might still want to add the word
"element" later. We will deal with the translations on an individual basis,
and eventually getting all the cards consistent again.

And, at some point in the future, we will be needing to revisit the Quick
Tip cards to re-align them with a completed WCAG 2.0. But that is not in
the near future...

- Judy
