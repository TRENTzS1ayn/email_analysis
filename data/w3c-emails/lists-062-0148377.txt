Greetings all,

I am writing to you for your assistance.

I am putting together a Descriptive Analysis or perhaps a Meta 
Analysis that will look at ways that researchers have explored the 
use of assistive technology for those who use the web.

The end result will be summary of what we know in this area and 
hopefully project an idea of what we are not getting at.  I believe 
that knowing this would be a great benefit.

To do a complete and thorough job I need to locate as many studies as 
possible: both published and unpublished (such as paper presentations 
and articles that are hiding in file drawers).  Ideally, these would 
be quantitative in nature but I have not excluded qualitative yet!

In summary - *I am looking for everything*

If you have a study stuffed in your file drawer that would not come 
up through the usual search strategies such as ERIC or PsychLit 
please let me know.

Sorry for the global posting like this but I figure that if anyone 
knows where hidden articles may be it would be you guys ;-)

Thanks,
Gretchen
