Here is stuff I wrote years ago about Universal design and the web...

=============

Good design considers intended users. Universal design means considering the
needs of all people, and incorporates features useful to people with and
without disabilities. A site, facility, or service is accessible if it can be
used by everyone, including people with sensory, mobility, and learning
disabilities; people with injuries; children; and seniors.

"Universal design"

Universal Design is design for people of all ages and abilities. It is
applicable to all design disciplines including architecture, landscape
architecture, industrial design, and graphic design. Universal design
accommodates people with disabilities, older people, children, and others who
are "non-average" in a way that is not stigmatizing and benefits all users.

Good design results in easier use for everyone while reducing the need for
modifications later when abilities change.

Universal Web-page design

Universal Web-page design considers intended users. It means considering the
needs of all people, and incorporates features useful to people with and
without disabilities. A site, page, or feature is accessible if it can be used
by everyone, including people with sensory, mobility, and learning
disabilities; people with injuries; children; and seniors.
