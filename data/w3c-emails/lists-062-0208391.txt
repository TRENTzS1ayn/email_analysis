  Hello everyone

  can anyone tell me...

  - do you have any experience of producing web sites in Asian languages?
CMN: Yes. Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese (simplified and Traditional)
and some languages written in Latin (ASCII) characters. This was for a major
University which did a lot of work in Asia, including having several campuses
in different Asian countries and extensive recruitment programs.

  - which screenreaders can read Asian languages?

CMN: don't know. Sorry.
  - does the user need to download the character set or is this something the
  site provides?

It depends on the user's system. Generally they will need to be able to
handle the encoding used, which may mean that they need a font. (I don't
suppose  it really matters if you are using a screen reader that is not
relying on the font itself). Often people who speak a different language will
have realised that they can get a different language version of software (for
example, it is easier to buy Japanese versions of software if you are in
Japan, although as Max pointed out some of it might be different software).
My experience was that this was not always true, and that it was very helpful
to provide links to where people could get this stuff.
