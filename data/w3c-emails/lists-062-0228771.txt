I am wondering if there is any mileage in contacting the AMAYA working group
regarding producing a web authoring + browsing tool that was accessible to
LD.

Probably a dream, but I have to author all our pages, and this will change.

My students would like an interface similar to notepad or paint.
They will have an unavoidable problem of differentiating between browsing
and authoring mode.
It would be important to make the difference visually explicit.

It would be excellent if symbols or clip art could be included
automatically, as one typed,
or conversely if text was published as symbols were selected.

Best wishes
