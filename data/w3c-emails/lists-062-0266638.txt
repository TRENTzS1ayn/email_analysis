The teacher was able to find suitable Web sites because many sites designed 
for his "developmentally/cognitively/learning disabled" pupil made use of 
the recommendation of Checkpoint 13.2 to include information about the 
sites in their metadata and 14.2 urging authors to "Supplement text with 
graphic or auditory presentations where they will facilitate 
comprehension  of the page."
