Job Shadow Day, February 2, 2001, is a nationwide (United States) effort to
introduce young people to the world of work by giving them an up-close look
at the workplace. In 2000, more than one million young people and 75,000
businesses participated; in 2001 the goal is to increase the number of
participants.
