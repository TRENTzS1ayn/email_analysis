A brief search for learning disability at google produced a rather large db.
perhaps you could be more specific about how the desired sites were found?

learning cognitive disability browser LD SLD
which happens to be a meta tag I use produced 4 results, but not
http://www.peepo.com

developmentally/cognitively/learning disabled
the tag you quote produced no results.
though
developmentally cognitively learning disabled
produced 300.

I cannot comment on the value of amny of the results.

anyway thanks for keeping the topic current.
