Since we are (nominally) maintiaing a list of this information too, it seems
like we should coordinate, or redirect to them, or vice versa, or use RSS or
RSS-like channels to collect the information across the two pages.

Thoughts?

This link has significant material not on the WAI policy page.

     http://icdri.org/us_legal_resources.htm

This section includes resources dealing with US legal issues and
disabilities. It is divided into sections and these resources may appear in
more than one place. The information will include papers, case law, and
various US laws that cover people with disabilities. The Center intends to
create a section for each country that has laws dealing with disabilities.
If you know of such laws or resources on the Internet that deal with this
subject, please contact us, at: icdri@icdri.org.
