I'm going to a seminar about persons with disabilities and the
telecommunication situation in Denmark, hosted by the government. One of the
speakers is Neil Scott from Project Archimedes at Stanford University, he
will present the project and a part of it called TAS (Total Access System)
Does any of you know more about this project?
See you next week on the phone bridge.
