EOWG:

Minutes from our EOWG discussion today will be along later, but in the
meantime I thought people might want to see the next revised version of the
"aids not solutions" scenario. This is based on our discussion in the EOWG
meeting today, and I will be adding it to the "How People with Disabilities
Use the Web" document roughly as follows. 

Please note I've used numbers to indicate link concepts for now but these
would be changed to reflect the same format in the document once the
section is rolled in.

Please let me know if you have any comments.

- Judy

Adult with limited reading ability using the Web (as edited Feb 9 2001)

Ms. Sato is in her 40's and lives at home with her parents. She has
difficulty learning new concepts, and gets lost in complexity [1].
She can read a few words and recognizes many symbols. She is lively, 
has opinions about many things, and has been using the Web for two 
years now with some assistance. 

Ms. Sato goes to an adult day care center on weekdays, where she uses
the Web with the help of local college students. She has found that using 
a talking browser with synchronized highlighting [2] helps on well-designed 
pages, however on some pages with confusing layouts, the highlighting jumps 
around too much for her [3]. She has some difficulty with hand
coordination, making it 
hard for her to select links [4].

Some Web sites she finds very welcoming. These sites include graphics,
animations, music, games, and video including webcams, all of which help
her understand the content of a page [5]. She loves watching TV programs
on the Web, and finding her favorite songs. She bookmarks some pages and
returns later. Sometimes she copies words that interest her from Web pages, 
and pastes them into a search engine. Because the output of the search engine
is completely text-based, she needs someone to help her interpret all the
different choices that appear [6].

[1] link to impairments of intelligence
[2] link to talking browser with synchronized highlighting
[3] keeping layout clear and uncrowded layout
[4] link to difficulty selecting links
[5] inclusion of graphics and animation for comprehension
[6] options for searches
