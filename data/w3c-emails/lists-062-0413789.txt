EOWG meeting Sunday 25 March, 2001: Registration available

A meeting page with registration details is now available for the Education
and Outreach Working Group face-to-face meeting, following the CSUN 2001
Conference, that we have been discussing for Sunday, March 25, 2001.
Pre-registration is required for this meeting.

http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/2001/03/agenda

Please note that a room block under the name "WAI with CSUN" is still
available at the L.A. Airport Marriott hotel, for registered participants
of the EOWG meeting, even though the CSUN block itself may no longer be
available.

Please let me know if you have any questions about the agenda for the EOWG
meeting.

Note also that there is a meeting of the WAI Interest Group the day before,
Saturday afternoon March 24, 2001, for which separate registration is
available.

Regards,

- Judy
