EOWG:

Regarding our 4th agenda item for tomorrow, the general references links
page for Web accessibility, please note there are already some edits to
look over at 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/
including breaking out developer information from other project & research
info. 

Also some links are updated (but need more, especially in different
countries); a bit more annotation added (but not a lot yet, we need
comments on what to add); added some explanations about the various
sections; considering adding tutorials (?). Other suggestions welcome. 

Sally De Angelis is working on the page and will join us for this agenda
item tomorrow.

- Judy
