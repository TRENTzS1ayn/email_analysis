my regrets as i have been meeting with potential clients.  fyi, i have left
zales and the zrneff@zalecorp.com address is not valid.  zale is scalling
way back on their internet division and for more info on the bad retail
season and the subsequent fiascos, see http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=zlc&d=v1

i can be reached at office@webspots.net  or on the cell 703.509.2125
