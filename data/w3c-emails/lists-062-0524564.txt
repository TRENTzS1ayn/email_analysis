EOWG:

For our discussion today, here is a rough version, a half-filled in
outline, of what the top page of the implementation plan section might look
like. It is interesting as this starts to come together -- like so many of
our recent EOWG projects, it is (will be) linked to so many of our other
resources.

Some of our questions for today include:
- how much of this should we really cover on one page
- can we use this page as the questions, and use the sample implementation
plans themselves as one hypothetical set of answers per context/field
- should the writing style be stronger or is appropriate to leave much of
this as questions
- etc.
