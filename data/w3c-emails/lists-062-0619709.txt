EOWG:

Here are some initial brainstorming notes on education (k-12) from Sheela;
let's expand on this in our discussion on implementation plan today:

-----

Implementation Plan for Web Accessibility - Educational Institutions - K -
12 (Very drafty!)

In educational institutions, Web Access is relevant in the following
situations

? A Web site developed for/by the educational institution (i.e a school web
site, a course web site)
? Web sites used for teaching the curriculum
? A  'Web Design' course/workshop/class for students

Curriculum directors, Superintendents and other school district
administrators need to made aware of access issues, since as
decision-makers, they can influence how web-accessibility gets infused into
the educational environments.

Administrators should be made aware of policy requirements.

They need to make commitment to devote time and resources to learning and
leading the rest of their school in implementing Web Accessibility.

Technology Professional Development and Teacher Training programs should
include awareness sessions and hands-on workshops on Web Accessibility.

Any school, district or state-wide initiative looking at how technology can
be integrated into the curriculum should ensure one or more special needs
educators is involved in the planning and implementation processes.

Consultants could be brought in to do training and workshops on "Web
Accessibility"
