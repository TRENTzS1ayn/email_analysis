EOWG:

At our meeting last Friday March 9, we realized there would be too many
EOWG members on the road this Friday March 16, and so decided to cancel
this Friday's meeting. 

Our next meeting will be our face-to-face meeting, Sunday March 25, at the
CSUN 2001 Conference in L.A. -- information at http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/.

Regards,

- Judy
