For something where you give it a name and it goes and finds you a list of
links, I use the term "search engine". This is how I think of Google.

For a site where I get a list of choices that leads to a list of choices that
eventually leads to sites I use the term "portal". This is how I think of
Yahoo (although Yahoo's site also included a search engine last time I
looked).

  Please could someone tell me how to distinguish by name the 2 types of search engine
  http://www.yahoo.com
  http://www.google.com
  the one you type a query in, the other you select keywords.
  I am in the process of redisigning our homepage.
  and choosing definitions for this:
  <meta name="keywords" content="
  ours is the second type.
