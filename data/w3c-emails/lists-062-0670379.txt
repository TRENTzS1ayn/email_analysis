Search Engine strategy is key to any web site.  You have two types of
submission - Directories and Search Engines

Directories are human-indexed and so the meta data is very important.  You
can input your data into these listings.  Items like Category, site title,
and site description.  Yahoo! and Looksmart are the two most important
directories.  Search engines are computer indexed like google.  All the
major search engines have placement fees for registration and this will have
you placed right away.  

In addition, here are some good links
