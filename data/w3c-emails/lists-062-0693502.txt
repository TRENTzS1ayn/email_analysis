I'd be very keen to see a graphical version of The Brain, and endeavour to
make a visit, if you'll go ahead.

Small graphics load fast and the brain, reads them far faster than words,
millions of years study.
The topics have a relation to contents that words cannot emulate.

You'll see graphics and recognise them far faster than you can name them

please visit our directory/portal for adults with a learning difficulty:
http://www.peepo.com and advise me what keywords I need?

unfortunately our java drive thru with links has been down a while, it does
continue to work offline, just cannot find the time to get it working online
again.....
