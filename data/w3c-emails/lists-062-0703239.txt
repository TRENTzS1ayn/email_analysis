This is a set of criteria I used to help me decide which conferences IBM
should participate in.  I changed the term IBM to WAI and provide it to you
as a resource for determining either the WAI's potential involvement or
your own organization's potential involvement:


                  Accessibility and Developer Conferences



Why should WAI participate?
     What is the priority as compared to other  commitments?
     What is the projected follow-up responsibilities by the presenter or
others in WAI?
     1st time or known event?


What's in it for WAI?
     Interact with attendees.
     Gain greater WAI recognition and accessibility awareness.
     Increase our return on accessibility investment.
     Position accessibility with the conference and position it as leading
edge.
     Technical vitality and/or professional development opportunity for
attendee?


How many attendees?
     Type of attendees,  developers, industry experts, policy makers, press
and analysts, or end users?


What will or could WAI do?
     Type of presentation, technical or advocacy?
     Hands on tutorial lab? Birds of a Feather session?
     Separate presentation or part of other presentations and/or panels?
     Key messages for event and text for keynote?
     Handout materials (Cards, Flyers, CD-ROMs, etc.)?
     Man a booth?


Cost?
     Travel costs?
     Booth costs?
     Conference fee?
     Materials?


Time? When?

Preparation requirements?


These questions are not meant to make a major production out of each
proposal,
but set some criteria for deciding which conferences WAI should attend and
how WAI should participate.

Meeting and discussing the one year outlook plan regularly (at least every
6 months?) would improve
     communications,
     help us stay focused on and re-evaluate our commitments,
     reduce propagating individual preferences,
     and hopefully reduce some of the demands on our personnel.
