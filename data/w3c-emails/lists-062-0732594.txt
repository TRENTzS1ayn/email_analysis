to see how the world of communication can be changed by a product please visit http://www.isketch.net
it is similar to inklink: http://www.shockwave.com/bin/shockwave/entry.jsp?script=/content/inklink/landing.jsp
but has a less proprietory interface.

this game allows people of many abilities to play, by using a mediator, we can sign or shout our answers, as well as typing. One day we might be able to dicatate them.

If you can get a speech dictator to work with shockwave (and these sites) please tell me.
hope you enjoy it as much as I did...
