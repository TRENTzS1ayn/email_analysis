The original suggestion (posted January 5, 2001) was to add a paragraph to 
the scenario entitled: "Classroom student with dyslexia"
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/PWD-Use-Web/Overview.html#classroomstudent

This addition would bring mention of the checkpoint on changes in natural 
language into the example.  This would be extremely useful for officially 
multilingual countries like Canada.

I haven't given much thought to a seamless integration, but the following 
might fit in as the third, fourth or fifth paragraph:

[begin addition]

As she was growing up, her family had postings in several countries and she 
has picked up a working knowledge of several languages. Because changes in 
natural language have been identified in the page markup, her multilingual 
screen reader automatically switches vocabulary and pronunciation 
dictionaries, significantly improving her understanding of the pages being 
read. As well, for languages she does not understand, the same markup 
permits faster and more efficient automatic language translation.

[end addition]

I grant that this would make for a long scenario: most others are three or 
four paragraphs.  However, the "Teenager with deaf-blindness, seeking 
entertainment" scenario is five paragraphs.  Rather than get hung up on 
length, I suggest we concentrate on completeness.
