Hi to all,

I am a new member in Israel and look forward to working with you.

"I recently visited http://www.ld.org, could anyone advise me how well
regarded this site is.
It is the site for the "National Center for Learning Disabilities" and
boldly states:
'Individuals with learning disabilities are generally of average or above
average intelligence.'

Is there a language problem here?"


This quote was a subject of debate on the Dyslexia list a few months ago:
See the archive of the discussion:
http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A1=ind0012&L=dyslexia#7

I'm not sure if you can categorize this site re: whether it is well
regarded, or not, since there is helpful info. on many sites, even when they
make mistakes, or statements not backed up by empirical data.
But clearly they mixed apples and oranges when trying to categorize those
with learning disabilities on an intelligence scale. without regard to
research...and the discussion caught them on this.

I have found some of the info. on this site useful, and ignore other info.
