Natasha, 

I agree that additional information from EOWG meetings would be nice.
One challenge is that different people take minutes each week and some
are not comfortable doing more than 
verbatim recording of what is said. Another issue is balancing the time
I spend on meeting minutes versus other tasks.

I am refining the EOWG minuting process and I will keep your suggestions
in mind. Hopefully we can find a way to meet your requests efficiently.

In the meantime, the documents' changelogs should list the resolutions
of any discussion relating to a specific document. I will make sure they
are linked from the minutes each week.

Best regards,

~Shawn
