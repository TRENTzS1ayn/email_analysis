EOWG:

The Online Overview of the Web Accessibility Initiative has been updated 
with all comments received to date.

The updated slides _should_ be available at:

         http://www.w3.org/Talks/WAI-Intro/

However, right now they're not, due to either a publishing or a mirroring 
error.
They might be updated by the time you get this message. But if you see "17 
January 2003" on one of the first few slides, those are still the old 
slides, and you should instead look at the source file, which _is_ updated, 
but which is one long run-on file:

         http://www.w3.org/Talks/WAI-Intro/all.htm

This version incorporates the fruits of our labor on the "What is Web 
Accessibility" slide, as well as many detailed updatings of various 
resources in the slide content, particularly later in the slide set. 
Hopefully the content updating can now be considered done. However if you 
notice typos or linking errors please send to wai-eo-editors@w3.org.

The changes to the slidemaker tool itself have not yet been completeld, so 
the issues that have been raised there still remain.

Regards,

- Judy
