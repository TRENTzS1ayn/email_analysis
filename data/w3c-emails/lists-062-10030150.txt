Dear all,

I would like to tell you informed of the EuroAccessibility project.

Twenty four (24) European organisations from twelve (12) countries working
in the field of Web Accessibility, together with the W3C/WAI (Web
Accessibility Initiative), on Monday, April 28, 2003 have signed a
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the creation of the EuroAccessibility
Project. The MoU sets out governing principles for their co-operation
towards the goal of establishing a harmonised set of support services over
Europe, which would include a common evaluation methodology, technical
assistance, and a European certification authority for Web accessibility.

The MoU was signed in Paris at the BrailleNet Workshop.

For more information, a web site is on ligne at
