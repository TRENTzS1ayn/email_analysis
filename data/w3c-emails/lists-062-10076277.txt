Somehow this email was dated 1 May about a 2 May meeting and I got it on 3 
May! Really felt weird!

The "questions" section really sticks out now and I hope that's what was 
intended because it's what I've been dreaming of for us/it. I think this 
bulleting/highlighting (I hope that in the previous meeting the talk on 
"over-bulletizing" wasn't intended to avoid this sort of emphasis) would be 
of benefit within a great many of our documents, which often appear a bit 
too much like doctoral dissertations rather than WEB documents.

I guess I hold rather strongly with Jakob Nielsen's urgings as expressed in 
http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9710a.html in which he answers his question 
"how do people read on the Web?" with "They don't".
