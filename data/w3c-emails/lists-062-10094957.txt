EOWG:

We will have no EOWG teleconference this Friday, 9 May 2003.

My apologies for the late notice.

We will meet again next Friday, 16 May 2003, at our usual time,
8:30am - 10:30am US Eastern Daylight Time.

We hope before then to have new drafts available for discussion
on the business case resource suite, and encourage you to comment
on those drafts online before the meeting as soon as they are available.

Regards,

Judy & Shawn
