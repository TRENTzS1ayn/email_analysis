One of the hardest things to do is allow others to take credit for one's 
own efforts. On the one hand it is so heartening to find big companies 
embracing/proselytizing accessibility, (e.g. the efforts reported at 
http://www.at508.com/articles/jw_017.asp ) but on the other hand it is so 
tempting to say "that's what we've been talking about for all these years 
and some of these new-found advocates always seemed to be fighting our 
efforts."

Anyway I found it strange that an article about all this stuff in this 
context made no mention of Phill Jenkins who was clearly central to IBM's 
taking this public stance, nor to Judy without whom Section 508 would just 
be another round of vapo(u)rtext, nor WAI/W3C whose language is parroted in 
everything said in this regard.

But we know! And celebrate having a bandwagon to jump on.
