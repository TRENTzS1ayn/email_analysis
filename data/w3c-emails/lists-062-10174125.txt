Apologies for not having an update for the Social and/or Economic sections
for the Business Case by today. Some of you will know that I lost my HDD
just after Easter - I didn't get it replaced until last Friday. I've come
back into work to tidy up and finish off the changes to Social before
today's meeting only to find that all my notes must have been left at home
<frown />.

Both the Social and Economic will be completed by next meeting - maybe
today we could look at the Technical section. I don't recall discussing
this since Alistair and I  updated it after the F2F. This can be found at

Regards, Andrew
