Dear colleagues,

Here is my attempt to rewrite "Reduce site maintenance" in less words (agreed in 16th Of May teleconference). I am aware that it gives less information, but the questions whether someone who reads this to make a business case needs more details.



Reduce Site Maintenance

Site development and maintenance are an ongoing concern for all organizations. Implementation of the WCAG design guidelines will give the following benefits:

-> Easy altering of the presentation of web content, by following the guideline using a style sheet to manage the presentation specifications for the web site and using mark-up rather than images to convey information..

-> Efficient debugging of web content, by following the guideline to create documents that validate to formal grammars as automated validation tools can be used.

-> Reusable web content for different presentation modalities, by following the guideline to use the latest version of W3C technologies enabling the use of web content for different displays, user agents and (mobile) devices.

Have a good weekend,

Henk Snetselaar
