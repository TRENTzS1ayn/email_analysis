I'm not sure if I written this right or put it in the right place, but the
accessibility of the tool itself must be considered if it has to be used to
maintain the site after contractors leave.

3. Specify conformance level

For organizations that subcontract Web development to external
organizations, consider whether the software used by those organizations
might introduce invalid code or markup that is a barrier to accessibility,
and/or whether those organizations develop templates for [this
organization's] production of content. [Also, consider if the software must
be used to maintain the site after the end of the contract, that the tool
itself is accessible to employees of the contracting organization.]  If so,
consider adding a provision to ensure that the markup and templates will
support accessibility. For example:
[To add to terms of subcontract]: "[Subcontracted Web developer] will
consider the use of ATAG 1.0 conformant software where available. If not
using ATAG 1.0 conformant authoring tools, [Subcontracted Web developer]
will ensure that all content and templates generated for [this
organization's] production of content is WCAG 1.0 Double A -conformant, and
contains no markup that will interfere with generation of WCAG
1.0-conformant content.
