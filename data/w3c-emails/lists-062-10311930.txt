As some of you will know, it has always been my belief that web 
accessibility will be working well when individuals rather than 
organisations are creating accessible web pages.

To that end, I'd like to mention one of the best websites that peepo 
currently links to http://www.magpol.org/s8/0.html
(this is a personal view, it's a tough call)

The website manager has made changes to the site that don't effect the 
appearance, but attempt to make it accessible within our current 
understanding.

In a way I suppose this is a request for more resources designed for 
the non-profit sector.
We plainly are not meeting this need currently, and this is a 
significant sector of the whole market.
