Hello All,
Jonathan asked me to post to the W3C guidelines.

Jonathan makes a point (below) that the guidelines are unclear in some ways
about how to make a site accessible.  There are areas which leave things up
in the air of course.  In particular defining what it means for someone with
a cognitive impairment is not well defined.

I wonder though about not putting alt text in for images.  That seems to me
to be where the guidelines are most clear.  Perhaps Jonathan could comment
on clarity in more depth.

Doyle,

Perhaps you could post your comments to the list.
This person genuinely believes they are following W3C guidelines, and 
over an exchange of a  dozen e-mails has tried to develop the site to 
meet our understanding.

You can tell there is a way to go, and much of this is because of a 
failure of clarity on the part of WAI.
with regard to scripts, did you read:
Client-side Scripting Techniques for Web Content Accessibility 
Guidelines 2.0
