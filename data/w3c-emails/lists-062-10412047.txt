Thankyou all for contributing to the development of this section of
"technical factors" last week. My synthesis of it all, and accounting for
the discussion at the last teleconference, is now available at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/tech.html

Please suggest further improvements to all three sections of the document.

Andrew
