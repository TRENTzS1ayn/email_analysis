Doyle,

whilst this snippet* is still text it has the additional benefit that 
it is rendered as a specific representation that maybe tested.
It would be great if you could illustrate some of your discussion.

That is what written words do.  They stick to an object they don't 
resemble
the object.  That resolves what you referred to in the example of the 
red
bus and green bus, is the connectedness issue between expressions such 
that
the green and red refer to the same bus.

Unfortunately this is the nub of the issue, and it is far from 
resolution. People with SLD simply don't generalise or abstract in the 
way described, one might go so far as to say that this is one 
definition of a LD. Naturally if we could find an abstract pointer the 
issue would be resolved, but we can't. So this leads to much confusion, 
little of which is resolved by text based discussion.

Reality fortunately has many useful pointers, loo signs for instance. 
However these are currently missing in virtuality, and so for the 
present it is necessary to augment virtuality, before it will help 
augment reality, the HUD has to highlight the pylon before the pilot 
can avoid it.

Sadly peepo is very nearly a lone voice in the area of providing a W3C 
accessible virtual space, even though in a very limited sense.
However there are many excellent VRML, flash and other attempts. 
Accessible SVG is also an extremely rare commodity :-(
to resolve the red bus problem will also require excellent and 
transparent authoring tools.

Perhaps we can use your expertise to create some other useful visual 
examples with SVG.
