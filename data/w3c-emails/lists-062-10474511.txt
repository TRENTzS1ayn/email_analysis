Hello List Members
Under Tech factors section we should mention that:
Reduced Support Calls and Risk of Legal Exposure
Adhering to the validation (or quality assurance) process recommended  in the Appendix A of WCAG 1.0 (see
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505/#validation)
 helps to  establish  the usability of Web content with a reasonable  level of confidence. Testing content with a variety of browsers and involving actual users of assistive technologies strengthens the validation process. This helps to reduce the number of support calls relating to   accessibility of Web content. Additionally, it reduces the organization's legal exposure on account of inaccessible Web content. Documentation of the good-faith effort to   build and validate accessible Web content  is likely to induce courts to regard any failings with   leniency.
