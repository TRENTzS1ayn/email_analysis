This is apparently not new, but it's not included in the policy document.

I can't read it because it's  in Swedish, but this is what I believe it's
about:

"At the beginning of June 2002, theAgency for Public Management
(Statskontoret) presented a set of guidelines for the design of public web
sites, including the application of the WAI Guidelines, in a document
entitled " 24-timmarswebben" (24 hour Web sites)."
