I liked Marga's idea : "Automate and guide authoring of content". Consider  building in an explanation like:
Some authoring tools incorporate accessibility checking and some prompt authors to include accessibility features during the development process    either directly or through suitable plug-ins. This facilitates  the process of  accessible  content development.

  To get authoring tools stuff there we could add to business case 
  [http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/tech.html] another section saying 
  something like:

  Automate and guide authoring of content
  or
  Reduce time needed in developing content


  And add points from the ATAG guidelines there.
