I think there's a big difference between a single page for all desktop 
computer browsers, or one that will work on all mobile phones, and one that 
will work across all devices.

Many sites try to detect the browser and serve up separate versions, for MS 
IE and for Netscape, for example. This is the kind of duplication 
accessible design can avoid. But to try to make a page work on all devices 
is fighting a losing battle.

I think that some sites will have to have multiple versions for different 
device profiles, but what we should claim is that each of these versions 
will be usable with all user agents and devices within that profile.
