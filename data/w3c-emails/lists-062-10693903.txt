So Chuck,

Do you have a suggested (additional or re)wording?  I agree entirely with
Matt, but am not sure quite how to restate this last section and its
sub-points.

W R T this point we tried very hard with the Vision Australia redesign
earlier this year to create a standards compliant home page (other still
need some tweaking) that owuld be quite usable on all browsers.

Cheers,  Andrew

Thank you Matt!  You neatly restated the problem I was trying to express
and clearly suggested the direction we should take to highlight it as a
benefit.

            I think that some sites will have to have multiple versions for
            different device profiles, but what we should claim is that

            devices within that profile.

      It appears that this discussion brushes against the difference
      between "usable" and "capable of being used." While the former is
      subjective and squishy, the latter can be claimed by
      standards-conformant sites on all devices. The value of browsing a
      2-megabyte file over a 9.6kbps connection through a four-line phone
      display notwithstanding.

      If sites are designed in a uniform fashion, and in a
      transformation-capable language such as XHTML, the case could be made
      that adhering to a common style (e.g., valid code, sections marked up
      with <h*>, alt text) affords the author the ability to transform the
      existing files in place for use by mobile or smaller displays using
      XSLT.

      I do tend to think most of the descriptions I've seen of this benefit
      are a bit overoptimistic or lacking in detail. You don't get this for
      free unless you plan for it. But relative to the jaw-dropping sums
      companies are happy to charge sites for screen-scraping services, it
      may sell some people, or at least get them thinking more about their
      designs. And that dovetails well with the Quality Assurance activity
      and their documents on designing for standards.
