I am so sorry that I will be unable to attend the June 6 meeting. On May 
27, I gave a presentation to approximately 400 persons in Mexico City. 
The conference was sponsored by the Venconmigo Foundation 
http://www.venconmigo.org/. My hometown of Norwich, CT has named me the 
"Native Daughter" of the year. There will be a ceremony on June 11.
