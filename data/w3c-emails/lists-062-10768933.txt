EOWG:

In order to encourage a volunteer scribe to take minutes at the EOWG
teleconference on Friday 6 June, I've started the HTML minutes file,
which is attached.

Minute-takers can use this file, or provide minutes in other formats and
I will integrate them into HTML.

Thanks to the volunteer scribes - past, current, and future!

Cheers,

~Shawn
