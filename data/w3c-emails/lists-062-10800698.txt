Regrets as well -

One update - ITTATC has canceled its 2-day, hands-on course on Accessible IT
for Industry
Marketers and Accessibility Program Managers scheduled for next week.
Registration was not sufficient to justify the expense of putti9ng on the
course.

This opens up an interesting point - how to best induce and support ongoing
awareness of accessibility (and its attendant business advantages) to the
"what's-the-big-thing-this-week" culture of the Marketing and sales sector?

My regrets for the 6/6 meeting - we are under a lot of pressure here with
clients requiring work finished before the end of the Australia financial
year (30 June).
