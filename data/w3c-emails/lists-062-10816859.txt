But isn't it true that most people (and by extension companies, 
organizations, etc.) are more amenable to doing something if they believe 
(or allow themselves into believe) that the idea or justification came from 
within.  Externally imposed standards or laws always seem to foster more 
grumbling, and thus increased resistance.  While presenting the case the 
way we do seems to promote every organization "reinventing the wheel", I 
suspect that they would do so in any event.

My other concern relates to  William's assertion:

I am being asked to point people to published metrics, research or studies 
that back up the claims we make in our benefits suite.  I am unaware of 
any.  (Can anyone point to such a study?) The fact that "We hold these 
truths to be self-evident..." is no longer cutting it with some of my 
potential clients.
