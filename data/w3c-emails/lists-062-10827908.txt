The old "bean counters" vs. "hand-wavers" controversy? The "metrics" for 
switching from a roomful of humans with T-squares and pencils to AutoDesk's 
CAM springs to mind. Each of the "benefits" actually pales in comparison to 
the single most significant argument: "It's the Law and programming is 
cheaper than litigation - by orders of magnitude". The fact that some of 
our target audience might grumble shouldn't make us avoid being aggressive 
in both attitude and claims. The tempering pitch of "it's just terrible 
that government sees fit to impose bureaucratic rules on private enterprise 
- but what can one do?" may be in order, but there's merit in the 
positivism of a presentation that avoids temporiz(s)ing the message. It's 
not just "true because we say it is", it is in fact true.
