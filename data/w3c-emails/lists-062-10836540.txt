The layout/bulleting in the "technical" document is a major step in the 
right direction. I think this started in the legal/policy document's "what 
policies may apply" section and should be a feature of all members of the 
suite.

While another quicktips card isn't especially called for, it would seem 
that the editorial principles therein might serve well as criteria for a 
section of each document and then perhaps a collection of those sections 
into a "quick overview"?
