The objective of the Business Suite, as I understand it, is to  assist organizations  to change their outlook towards   accessibility. That is why the Suite  groups the benefits under economic, legal, technical and social heads. Managers can develop their arguments using guidance from the suite and attempt to attach  measurable criteria (where  possible) that is specific      to their organization. When they do this phrases like "may benefit", "might reduce cost" and "may increase reach / market share" will become more tangible. As the WAI's Business Suite applies to   a variety of  orgs and institutions, it cannot be more  specific  in  figuring out  precise benefits. So I guess the tone of the doc is OK.
