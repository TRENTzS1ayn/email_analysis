Regarding the discussion about the possible Europe meeting in September, in 
todays phone meeting.

I would like to suggest the possibility of a meeting here in Spain. The 
ONCE Foundation would organise the logistics of the meeting. Confortel 
(www.confortelhoteles.com) is a chain of hotels, part of the ONCE 
Corporation, which I believe would give us a very favorable rate, and are 
all designed for accessibility and accustomed to organising events for 
disability groups.
