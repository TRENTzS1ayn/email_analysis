Dear all,

I think I've already asked you if using IRC channel in the EO meetings
could improve understanding and so communication for some of us (you know
who I mean :-) ... but I ask again.
I used 2 days ago IceChat (http://www.icechat.net/) for a
EuroAccessibility phone meeting. We had a phone meeting through a phone
platform (like the EO meetings) and on side we were all connected to an
IRC server.
As some people type faster than light speed (WAI training ?), all
participants could read on line and on time what everyone said: it is no
more than the minutes typing by someone (like the EO meetings). At the end
of the meeting, you juste make a "Copy and Paste" action and you keep the
minutes (waiting for the official ones with a summary of decisions taken).
I can tell you that for people who are not native English speaker, it is
WONDERFUL. I know that one topic could be : is there an accessible IRC
interface somewhere ? If not, I'm sure it is not so hard to develop.
Reading English is much easier than listening.

best,
