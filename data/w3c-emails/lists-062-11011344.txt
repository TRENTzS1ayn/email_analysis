Dear Pierre,

Palo Alto is located in the middle between San Jose and San Francisco
airports.  Choose the most convenient and the cheapest flight you can find.
As a rule of thumb, flight to San Francisco is usually cheaper because SFO
is the main Bay Area aiport and San Jose is a smaller one and does not have
a lot of international flights.

Unfortunately, we do not have hotel courtesy shuttle bus from the airport to
the hotel and the taxi will be costly - up to $80-100 per trip.

However, we have regular shuttles which you can reserve over the phone.  It
is much cheaper : from 27 to $30
VIP airport - 408-885-1800
Super Shuttle : 415-558-8500
Bay Porter : 415-467-1800

Please let me know if you have any additional questions

Dear all,

in http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/2003/07-eowg-agenda.html, it is written:

 >From San Jose Airport via Highway 101 to the meeting site:
Follow the signs to highway ......

B. From San Francisco Airport via Highway 101 to the meeting site:
Follow the signs to highway .....

Does it mean that there is no direct bus to the hostel ?
Other solution could be: I catch a taxi . Do you know prices for both
solutions A and B ?

Another question: what is the best airport for going then to hostel (in
terms of time and money) ?

thank you very much for your answers as I have to buy my flight ticket by
the end of the week.

Best,

Pierre
