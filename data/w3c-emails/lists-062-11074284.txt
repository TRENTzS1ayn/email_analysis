Dear all,

I need you :-)

The French Ministery of Education has contacted BrailleNet about the
writing of accessibility requirements for "Electronic School Bag" (ESB) in
France (online workspaces set up at schools and universities for the needs
of teaching, learning, communicating, sharing documents, ...let's say:
allow to study in a virtual class).
The whole report (including basic functionalities, technologies to be used
for interoperability between differents ESB in France, accessibility
process to be followed for quality guarantee, ...) will be then sent to
all French schools and universities. It should be read by numbers of
people. It will help them to make choices.
So, it is very important that BrailleNet has been contacted about the
accessibility issues of Web sites, integrated services, process to select
a technological solution, process to advice companies about what is Web
accessibility, process to train end-users (students, parents of students,
teachers, school and universities employees and top management) , .....
I'm wondering if anyone has some experience in writing this kind of report
and/or if in your country this report has been already written (and if you
have a copy of it :-). I have some ideas about it (for instance, send a
formular to teachers and students with disabilities to get their needs
back) but I have a short time as my report has to be finished by 10th of
July.
So, thank you very much if you have any suggestions to help me to write
the best possible report.
Best regards,

Pierre GUILLOU
