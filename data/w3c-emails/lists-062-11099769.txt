I just called the hotel and the numbers are correct but they provided us
with additional number if you have problems with the ones listed on the
site:

650-213-4250  Jay Cota
or you can send an email to jcota@creekside-inn.com

You need to dial 1 before you dial the 800 number and use the country code.

Please let me know if you have been successful.

Natasha, Shawn,

I have tried without success to call the hotel in Palo Alto by using
information published on the WAI web site:

Creekside Inn
Reservation: 800 492-7335
Tel: 650-493-2411
  Fax: 650-493-6787

May you confirm me the numbers ? Maybe I have to dial other numbers from
Europe ? Is there a web site ?

Thanks a lot !

pierre
