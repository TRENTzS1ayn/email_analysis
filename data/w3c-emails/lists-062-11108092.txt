EOWG:

FYI, here are some notes from our meeting last Friday (20 June 2003) on how 
to approach the discussion of the Training Resource Suite during our 16 
July face-to-face meeting in Palo Alto:
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/2003/07-eowg-agenda.html

I re-integrated what I heard during our meeting into a framework for our 
July discussion (so please do not consider these our meeting minutes, those 
will be available separately)

- Judy

...........................

conceptual categories for discussing training resource suite at july f2f 
meeting:
         [suite: http://www.w3.org/WAI/training/ ]
         [changelog: http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/trainingchangelog.html ]

1. "first do no harm":
- don't tear the resource suite apart
- don't throw anything away

2. dust it off (identify items that require minimal discussion, mostly just 
editing)
- fix the format & navigation bars
- update the links, including pointers to our latest work where relevant
- re-examine the titles (gently, without re-doing them all)

3. add a few new gems (these items may require eowg discussion)
- update the learning objectives & audiences
- ask for trainers to re-approve their tips & maybe add a few new ones
- consider adding a sample registration form & sample reading list

4. consider related resources (these items require prioritization & discussion)
- re-examine planned deliverables in light of training needs
- consider additional ideas for deliverables
- re-prioritize in light of available resources

5. ideas for how to discuss this at july f2f meeting
- during the best practices training exchange, ask trainers to comment on 
whether & how they use the planning steps in the resource suite
- charmane will organize a summary of the change requests from the jan - 
mar 2002 training change log so that we have a cleaner list of ideas to look at
- present framework of 1 - 4 above, plus charmane's summary, and ask for 
feedback in categories #2, 3, and 4 above
