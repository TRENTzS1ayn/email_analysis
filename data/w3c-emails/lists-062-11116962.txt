Bill,

The difficulty in the current title of this resource suite is that we were 
looking for another way to say "here's a resource kit from which to build a 
customized business case for use within your organization," and not "we're 
trying to convince you that there's a solid case for accessibility." And so 
we came up with "Building the Case for Web Accessibility." I agree, 
particularly after reading your comments, that this is ambiguous, and that 
coupled with the tone of some parts of the suite, will give the wrong 
impression to some readers.

With regard to the tone of the suite, we should be able to fine-tune it as 
we get the thing edited and polished up. But even then, I think you're 
right that we may create misunderstandings among some of our audience just 
by the title alone.

Therefore, has anyone got any better ideas for the title for the suite, 
that we haven't already tried yet?

Regards,

- Judy
