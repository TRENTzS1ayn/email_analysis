Hi all,

Outreach update:
Our online ongoing website monitoring has an English version. See www.design4all.org

Changes in 'Gallery form': www.design4all.org/gallery (username: eowg, password: will be given in the call if applicable) 
Not all changes we discussed and agreed on are yet made due to the holidays.

Changes that are made:
- Following the link of reviewer name in the 'View Result' page and you will find the complete evaluation report.
- Deleting an evaluation report of a specific reviewer or web site by the administrator is possible.

Still to be done:
- Possibility to display extra information of a given URL e.g. page selection to be evaluated, or other remarks (by the administrator)
- Possibility to display extra information of the used browser by the reviewer

Regards,
Henk
