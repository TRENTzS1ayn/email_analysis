Dear colleagues,

The Gallery evaluation form is improving, not yet perfect. The next things are fixed or changed:
- The base URL of a site has an extra field for quoting the page selection or additional remarks;
- In the 'View results' page you can follow the link of the reviewer name and you will find the complete evaluation report. In this full report/checklist are links to the right place of each checkpoint in the techniques document;
- In the 'Checklist' page the reviewer has to select which browser(s) (are) is used for the evaluation, instead of being confronted with two named browsers;
- For people who want to check a web site page by page, we made the checklist 'printer friendly'. "Print one checklist, collect the results of the pages of the page selection and fill in the form online" is a good methodology we think.
- We started to make a help file, ...still in process. 

Please help us to use the right words and phrases for the different things or other wishes or remarks.

URL of the evaluation form is www.design4all.org/gallery

The six web sites, given a few months ago by Judy, are put in as examples.

username: eowg (for reviewers)
username: administrator (for the superuser)
passwords will be given in the call (if aplicable)


Regards,
Henk
