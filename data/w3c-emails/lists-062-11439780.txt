Hello All,
Here are my thoughts of how to understand public and private parts of EOWG

-Define that public part determines the policy and work of the EOWG
etc for WAI and excludes private from public areas responsibilities.  
-Define what areas are constituted as 'private'.
-Define who can do the private and what they can and cannot do.  

Two areas I'm aware of in the private area are:

Work - Define what makes something private to be approved. Example Gallery

Contacts - And what they provide and why that is to be private. Example,
individuals from various countries who provide information about policy. 
Thanks, 
Doyle Saylor
