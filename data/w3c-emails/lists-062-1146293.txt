To underline the points about the changing visage of our perceived audience:

More "how" than "whether" is now being called for. In fact, the "whether" 
part is so admirably covered by the Appendix Andrew is working on that we 
might examine whether with slight term modification (a school might not 
call it "market share"?) this could cut across most/all of the 
organizational categories?

In fact this "appendix" furnishes such a nearly irrefutable set of 
arguments that the "business case" side of things might have become moot. 
Thus the implementation considerations can be afforded the attention they need.

This is based on the widespread feeling amongst our participants in U.S., 
Canada, Australia, and Europe that there's a "resignation" to the fact that 
accessibility of Web materials will be implemented and the help sought 
isn't in convincing somebody to do it, but telling them what must be done.
