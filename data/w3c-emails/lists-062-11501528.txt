Hello Harvey and EO folks.

> I wonder how many cards have been distributed all-together.

In the order of 5000 per language in Europe (for the 10 major ones).
For the English version, I think it's more in the order of 100000
(Judy has the exact count).

No, of course. We always use the English inline.

I removed the second gif which doesn't correspond to anything real
graphically speaking (it's was just the first mockup I'd done years
ago in ps I think, but never printed like that).

And I'll try to scan a more recent one (and with a better resolution
too) soon.

I made a couple of other changes: the link "Translations" at the top
goes directly to the translations page, instead of to the middle of
the How to order section (always found that confusing).

I removed the Sample section which had just one gif now and put the
link to the card gif inline (but I kept the anchor for linking
reference from outside).

Please have a look at the page, I think it's leanier and easier to
use now.
