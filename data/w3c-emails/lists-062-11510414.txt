Wrap up(?) Online Overview of Web Accessibility Initiative
http://www.w3.org/Talks/WAI-Intro/
http://www.w3.org/Talks/WAI-Intro/slide1-0.html

I had to go to Opera or Netscape Navigator to see entire slides on screen.
MSIE wouldn't let me resize so I wouldn't need to scroll to see each page.

Judy, when you are "driving" through this presentation, do you normally 
skip slide 2,

     "Some Tips for Using t[T]hese the Slides"

the navigation description? Possibly all that is needed for that is a 
pointer to
an offline description -- I believe that is one of our goals to use consistent
navigation, (aided by sidemaker) so a description in one place would suffice.
