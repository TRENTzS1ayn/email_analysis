I'm the one who works with the printer who produced the samples for us. 
I'll check -- the printer may have sent us updated samples but they just 
didn't get posted. Otherwise we can get new ones.

Daniel's been very careful to coordinate the translations to the most 
recent versions of the actual Quick Tips text, so I don't think that's a 
concern.

Thanks for noting this,

- Judy
