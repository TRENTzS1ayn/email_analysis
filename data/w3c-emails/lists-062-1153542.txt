The latest version of this business case appendix is available at :

http://members.optushome.com.au/amja/wai/

Note that the tables have improved accessibility thanks to Sylvie,
Jean-Marie and Graeme Turner for suggestions and testing.

However, you will note several sections with @@ in front of short notes -
any suggestions for wording for these sections will be gratefully received
and appropriately incorporated.

Assistance is particularly sought for
+ Support for low literacy levels
+ Support for Semantic Web
+ Be Socially Responsible
+ Avoid Legal Wrangles - alternative title suggestions are also sought for
this section.

Cheers, Andrew
