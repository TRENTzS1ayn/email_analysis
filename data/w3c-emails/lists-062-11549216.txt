I feel that we should have also some images in these slides.

What I have done successfully couple of times is starting with an example 
page with images and then trying to present what a page would look like to 
someone who cannot see (or hear the presentation). And then what it would 
look like when accessibility is added.

the first slides here try to mimic what I do although this also talked 
about semantic web ( I just have problems in getting the layout that I want):
