Sean, Aaron (and even little old me) explored (and even started) SWAG 
(Semantic Web Agreement Group) whose first project is still floating out 
there somewhere: the SWAG Dictionary.

What brought this on was whether you can think of a way to make the 
glossary "distributed" rather than central (it's a Web, not a tree!) in 
keeping with SW notions? That way everybody with any notion of glossary 
illumination could "volunteer" contributions thereto.
