One recommendation and one follow-up from discussion today:

1. A recommendation that I didn't think was worth taking up time on the
call

Repeat the explanation of the asterisk ("* indicates documents that are
stable at this time.") as a footnote at the bottom of the page. 

Reason: Some people will not read it in the text. People commonly look
to the bottom of a page for explanation of an asterisk indicator.


2. Follow-up on space between list items

Here's one way to put space between items in a list:

in style sheet: 

li.spaceafter {
padding-bottom: .5em;
}


in page HTML:

<li class="spaceafter">


for example: http://www.uiaccess.com/resources.html &
http://www.uiaccess.com/uiaccess.css

Cheers,
