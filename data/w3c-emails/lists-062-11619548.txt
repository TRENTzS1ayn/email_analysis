Hello all,

On remark on the WAI overview slides located at:
http://www.w3.org/Talks/WAI-Intro/slide1-0.html

In slide 2, "Some Tips for Using these Slides", we could tell the user that 
shortcuts to the main links are available.

For example:

"? Use the right-arrow button ("On to..." link), or press alt+n to go to 
the next page."

In the slide about EO work, is the order the deliverables are listed 
deliberate, or does it have a logical order?

Regards

Sylvie
