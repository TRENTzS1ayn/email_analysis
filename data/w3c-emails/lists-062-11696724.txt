SD: I would either propose :

- first list ressources, then strategies. That could be :
how people with disabilities use the Web, Quick tips, curriculum, FAQ, how 
to evaluate web sites,
alternative browsers, policy reference links, implementation planning, 
developing organizational policies, selecting and using authoring tools, 
and other deliverables.

- or we could sort them according to the document status: first those that 
are finished, then those that will be finished in the first quarter, second 
quarter... Then those which will be redrafted.

What do you think?

Regards

Sylvie
