Kathleen,

I actually did mean 'industry organisations' - refer to previous discussion
re 'peak bodies' - see archives circa April 10.

We could possibly expand to mention/include policies and guidelines that
individual corporations/organisation may have. However, at this stage I
would be reluctant to do so, prefering to keep it to national/regional
'consortiums' that have an agreed and shared approach to accessibility
issues. Member companies/organisations would be expected to follow the
agreed 'consortium' policy.

Andrew

Andrew:
In the "Avoid Legal Wrangles" section, you say: "an increasing number of
industry organisations". Do you mean 'industry organisations', as in
consortiums, or do you mean 'industries and organisations'?
