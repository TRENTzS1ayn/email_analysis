Sylvie and list

As far as I can see we only have to move How people with.... up before
Implementation planning...  to list resources before strategies, and I'm not
sure if this makes it better.
I noticed 2 incorrect links on the slide: How to evaluate... links to events
and  How people... links to Developing organizational policies....

Judy and all,
On slide 21 "Conducting Education and Outreach":

SD: I would either propose :

- first list ressources, then strategies. That could be :
how people with disabilities use the Web, Quick tips, curriculum, FAQ, how
to evaluate web sites,
alternative browsers, policy reference links, implementation planning,
developing organizational policies, selecting and using authoring tools,
and other deliverables.

- or we could sort them according to the document status: first those that
are finished, then those that will be finished in the first quarter, second
quarter... Then those which will be redrafted.

What do you think?

Regards

Sylvie
