Hello! I took a stab at reworking our definition of Web accessibility. Mainly I took Judy's language and moved it around some. Feel free to add, edit, shred!

What is Web Accessibility?
-------------------------------

An accessible Web can be used by people with disabilities.

To this end, Web accessibility is an effort to integrate accessible components into the Web. These components include:
- content that is presented in a way that can be perceived, operated, navigated, and understood by people with disabilities;
-software used to access the Web that can be used by people with disabilities, and that works with technologies that some people with disabilities use; and
-software used to build Web sites that can be used by people with disabilities, and that supports the creation of accessible Web sites.

Web accessibility also:
- benefits other users of the Web; and
- is a requirement for some Web sites and Web applications in certain countries.
