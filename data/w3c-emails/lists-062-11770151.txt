After all these years, I really think that this should be at the top 
(rather than as an "oh, by the way" item) - in the form "Web accessibility 
benefits all users of the Web" (incidentally, even including PWD).

The real/main/important/primary/inclusive/overarching feature of "Universal 
Design" is that it is in fact UNIVERSAL. That in some enlightened places it 
is also the law matters some. That it's nice not to exclude people who have 
traditionally been overlooked (except for their exclusion) is secondary to 
what WAI has pointed the way to: a Web that is usable by everyone and has 
its semantics stored therein.

As we undertook to formulate guidelines for the purpose of making the Web 
accessible for PWD we discovered that what we proposed should be done 
routinely so that everyone could use the Web. The absurd "resistances" we 
encountered along the way merely reflected ancient prejudices within most 
(all?) cultures that demean/overlook/exclude PWD.

There has never been any logical reason that the semantics of Web content 
not be available and when we did XAG we even found an abstract way to 
express this - in very general, but concrete terms.
