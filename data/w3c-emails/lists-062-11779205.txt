Hi all,

I will make a try too...

++++++++
Web accessibility means that everyone can use the functions of a web site; 
* regardless of disability and the use of assitive technology; 
* regardless of the operating system and the user agent (browser, PDA, WAP, TV) that is used.
Web accessibility includes the content of a web site, the authoring tools of web design and the user agents to explore the web.

+++++++++

In this definition main stream and special use is included (some people like that a lot).
I know that some of you do have a problem with the wording *everyone can use...*, but what about the Tim Berners-Lee slogan? (see below)

"The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect." Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web 

Regards,

Henk
