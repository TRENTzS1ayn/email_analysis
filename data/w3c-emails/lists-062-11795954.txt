My feedback regarding Henk's statement is that the idea of making the
definition inclusive is a powerful one.  I especially like the idea that is
presented with the statement, "The power of the Web is in its universality.
Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect." 

What are the thoughts in including -- perhaps even leading with the
inclusive statement and then transition to the requirements to meet the
mission.  Or, stated differently, if the web is universal and everyone
should have access, here are the things that are required...we then follow
up with the detailed list:

So the basic structure would look something like (please note, the example
below is more about "structure" than integrated content. This takes Henk's
description and combines it with Blossom's in order to demonstrate the
structure..):

___________________________________________________________
"The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless
of disability is an essential aspect." 

Web accessibility means that everyone can use the functions of a web site"

* regardless of disability and the use of assitive technology; 
* regardless of the operating system and the user agent (browser, PDA, WAP,
TV) that is used.
* Web accessibility includes the content of a web site, the authoring tools
of web design and the user agents to explore the web.

An accessible Web can be used by people with disabilities. Web accessibility
includes:

-- Creating content that can be perceived, operated, navigated, and
understood by people with disabilities.

-- Making browsers, multimedia players, and other software used to access
Web sites more usable by people with disabilities.

-- Developing software for producing Web sites that can be used by people
with disabilities and that support the creation of accessible Web sites.

Web accessibility also:
-- Benefits other users of the Web.
-- Is a requirement for some Web sites and Web applications in certain
countries.

Hi all,

In this definition main stream and special use is included (some people like
that a lot).
I know that some of you do have a problem with the wording *everyone can
use...*, but what about the Tim Berners-Lee slogan? (see below)

"The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless
of disability is an essential aspect." Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and
inventor of the World Wide Web
