Hi All,
I like Henk's definition in many ways, but Henk asks about the term
universal access, and I think Judy raised the point that cognitive
disabilities might not allow one to 'think' all content. We do not claim
that everyone 'thinks' alike anymore than we claim everyone can see.  We
don't claim everyone uses content alike.  This is my version of a
definition,

Web Accessibility is "all" the diverse methods people use to know content as
a single unified technology system of guidelines that keeps open channels of
communication for everyone to know a web site in their specific way and
need.

Hi all,

I will make a try too...

++++++++
Web accessibility means that everyone can use the functions of a web site; 
* regardless of disability and the use of assitive technology; 
* regardless of the operating system and the user agent (browser, PDA, WAP,
TV) that is used.
Web accessibility includes the content of a web site, the authoring tools of
web design and the user agents to explore the web.

+++++++++

In this definition main stream and special use is included (some people like
that a lot).
I know that some of you do have a problem with the wording *everyone can
use...*, but what about the Tim Berners-Lee slogan? (see below)

"The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless
of disability is an essential aspect." Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and
inventor of the World Wide Web 

Regards,

Henk
