EOWG:

An agenda for our upcoming meeting follows. This may be followed by an 
agenda with more detailed information and links, depending on connectivity.

Please note that W3C is currently experiencing intermittent server outages, 
particular through its MIT site. Therefore there may be additional 
disruptions in mail, or access to documents on the W3C site, between now 
and our meeting tomorrow. In any case we will hold our Friday meeting at 
our regularly scheduled time. If you have any problem dialing in, please 
notify me (which I may or may not receive) and try again 10 minutes later.

Time:           8:30am - 10:30am US Eastern Standard Time
