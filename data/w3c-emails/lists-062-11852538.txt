I like the condensed lead-in. But I think Sarah's "content that..." 
"software used to..." is easier to follow than "creating" "making" etc. 
It's not the process but the result that is our end goal. Other comments below.

i think this part reads better if we leave out the "also"

i don't understand the contradiction; it _is_ about wai, but necessarily 
talking wai involves talking about web accessibility.

pretty long; still don't understand why clarification is necessary. are 
other people getting a jolt of surprise when they read the content of the 
presentation, compared to the name? any shorter ways that we could clarify 
this, if so?

needs to be updated and condensed. suggestions would be helpful.

we have already noted the need to send revision requests to the slidemaker 
tool editor (different w3c people have been working on recently) requesting 
repairs to the style sheet problems, and more caution with future revisions 
to the tool. when i revised the source file for these slides, the slides 
re-generated from a somewhat experimental version of the tool. this is a 
known problem that we are following up on. we have already received 
recommended style sheet fixes.

thanks
