depends on the extent of cognitive disabilities; many do allow one to 
understand web sites. the particular concern that i expressed in last 
week's meeting was when someone suggested that everyone would understand 
the content on a web site in the same way. given that people's life 
experiences and interests are different, that is rarely the case, 
regardless of disability.

interesting. this seems very focused on the user. i wonder whether the 
responsibilities of the content developers and software developers might 
not come through. but it is good to have the user's experience described as 
well.
