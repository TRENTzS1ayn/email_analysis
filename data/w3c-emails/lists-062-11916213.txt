attached mail follows:

... and what about telecommunications infrastructure, hardware capability
(new, old, oddball), language difficulties, etc.

Can we just include one line (into Henk's or some-else's version) that also
picks up all these non-PWD issues?

Hi all,

I will make a try too...

++++++++
Web accessibility means that everyone can use the functions of a web site;
* regardless of disability and the use of assitive technology;
* regardless of the operating system and the user agent (browser, PDA, WAP,
TV) that is used.
Web accessibility includes the content of a web site, the authoring tools
of web design and the user agents to explore the web.

+++++++++

In this definition main stream and special use is included (some people
like that a lot).
I know that some of you do have a problem with the wording *everyone can
use...*, but what about the Tim Berners-Lee slogan? (see below)

"The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless
of disability is an essential aspect." Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and
inventor of the World Wide Web

Regards,

Henk
