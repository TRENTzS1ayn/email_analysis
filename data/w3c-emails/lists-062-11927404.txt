EOWG:

An agenda for our upcoming meeting follows. This may be followed by an
agenda with more detailed information and links, depending on connectivity.

Please note that W3C is currently experiencing intermittent server outages,
particular through its MIT site. Therefore there may be additional
disruptions in mail, or access to documents on the W3C site, between now
and our meeting tomorrow. In any case we will hold our Friday meeting at
our regularly scheduled time. If you have any problem dialing in, please
notify me (which I may or may not receive) and try again 10 minutes later.

Time:           8:30am - 10:30am US Eastern Standard Time
Bridge: (Zakim): +1 617 761 6200
