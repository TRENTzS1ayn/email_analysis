EOWG:

Our latest version, as of today's discussion, and on which I'll be asking 
for feedback on from the WAI CG (Coordinating Group):

What is Web Accessibility?
-------------------------------
An accessible Web is one that can be used by people with disabilities, and 
also benefits other users of the Web. Web accessibility includes:

- content that is presented in a way
         * that can be perceived, operated, navigated, and understood by 
people with disabilities;
- software used to access the Web
         * that can be used by people with disabilities,
         * and that works with technologies that some people with 
disabilities use
- software used to build Web sites
         * that can be used by people with disabilities,
         * and that supports creation of accessible Web sites;
- technologies that underly the Web (HTML, CSS, SMIL, XML, etc)
         * that support accessible Web content and software.
