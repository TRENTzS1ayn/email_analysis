Query: 'regardless of' ,

we are resolving plenty of problems relating to the issues:

disabilities and assistive technologies
  and the configuration of the OS the UA is running in,

Placing them outside the remit of WAI is unhelpful, as in the UK at 
least dissemination of this information is at best slight.

WAI could be a more useful place to exchange information on these 
topics.
though probably regardless of is a slight exaggeration
