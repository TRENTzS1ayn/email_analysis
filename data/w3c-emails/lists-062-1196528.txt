Kathleen,

It wasn't meant as a prod, but just for clarity.

If you are going to start compiling these things then organising them by
Industry grouping (I suggest basing this around the International Standard
Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities <
http://esa.un.org/unsd/cr/family2.asp?Cl=2>  for international consistency,
maybe start with the first level (A-Q) and see what turns up before going
to the second level), rather than country. this approach will make the
polices & guidelines more transparent across countries by industry.

It will be interesting to see what turns up - which countries are most
active AND which industry groups are most advanced.

Andrew

Andrew:
Thanks for the clarification and the memory jog. I have started collecting
individual industry accessibility policies or statements, but nothing on a
larger, collective scale. I will start searching.
