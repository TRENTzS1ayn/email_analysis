What is Web Accessibility?

An accessible Web is accessible to all, including people with disabilities.
To the best of their ability, all users can successfully:

-  perceive, operate, navigate, and understand content - written, visual,
audio, etc. - presented on the Web

-  direct the course of and attain the outcome offered by Web content and
interactive sessions

-  use Web software and other tools, including technologies used by some
people with disabilities, to access the Web and to build accessible Web
sites

Web accessiblity also includes the underlying Web technology - HTML, CSS,
SMIL, etc. - that supports accessible Web content, software, and hardware.

Regards,

Blossom
