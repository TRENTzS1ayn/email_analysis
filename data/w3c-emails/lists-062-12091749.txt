From WCAG 2.0 draft

Expalanations of the terms we are discussing:

   1. Perceivable. Ensure that all content can be presented in form(s) that
      can be perceived by any user - except those aspects of the content
      that cannot be expressed in words.
   2. Operable. Ensure that the interface elements in the content are
      operable by any user.
   3. Navigable. Facilitate content orientation and navigation
   4. Understandable. Make it as easy as possible to understand the content
      and controls.
   5. Robust. Use Web technologies that maximize the ability of the content
      to work with current and future accessibility technologies and user
      agents.
