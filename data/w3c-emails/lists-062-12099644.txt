Russia

There is a Russian governement law that stipulates that people with
disabilities are entitled to live their life to full potential and that
special means for achieving this goal should be developed  (Federal
Government law 24.11.1995 #181-fz).  It is very general without any
reference to the web accessibility.

There are no specific Russian government of industry standards for web
accessibility.

http://www.disability.ru is the portal that is designed for people with
disabilities providing various kind of information re government
regulations, policies and everything related to this topic.  It was fo
founded and developed by Pavel Lapin.

Pavel has created his portal, gathered information regarding best practices
and best devices for disabled developed world wide. Portal has been
developed specifically for screen readers.
He was able to solve the main problem: lack of communication between people
with disabilities and lack of any organization for them.
He created chat that is accessible by blind people. He claims that this is
the only chat that is accessible in Russia and, as far as he knows, in the
world. At this moment, he is working on a new version of chat with the
virtual keyboard.

"In fact, there is a problem in Russia to create normal web site for common
users :)
Only 3...5 agencies can do normal web sites. So picture of web industry in
Russia is:
- 7...15 (may be a bit more) web sites which more or less comply
accessibility standards
- 100...150 web sites have normal/good usability 
- all other web sites have problems with usability & accessibility"
