Hi Harvey,

I was referred by 
<mailto:browser-china-arf@sun.com>"browser-china-arf@sun.com" to contact 
you on the subject.

As far as we've learnt from CDPF (China Disabled Persons' Federation - 
<http://www.cdpf.org.cn/>http://www.cdpf.org.cn/),
there are no public policy on information accessibility with national scope 
available in China at this point.
However, Director of Information Center from CDPF (Ms. Hui-Ping Cui, 
<mailto:chuihuiping@cdpf.org.cn>chuihuiping@cdpf.org.cn),
expressed CDPF would be very interested in being posted about progress on 
this from W3.  She mentioned
the common practice in China on such guidelines/policies should be 
initiated & driven by both CDPF &
Ministry of Information Industry (MII), and submit to National Congress for 
final approval & announcement.
You may consider to take her as one contact if you'd like to get further 
info. on this.

Please let us know if you have any further questions.

Regards,
Fang
