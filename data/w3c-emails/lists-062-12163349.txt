EOWG:

We have no meeting Wednesday, 19 February, as had been indicated on the 
EOWG home page. The meeting schedule is now corrected.

In fact, this time now conflicts with another WAI meeting, and I will send 
a separate message inquiring into people's availability for once-or-twice 
monthly EOWG meetings on Tuesday afternoons at 4pm US EST instead of 
Wednesdays at that time.

Our next teleconference is scheduled for Friday, 28 Feburary, 2003, at our 
regular time, 8:30 - 10:30am US EST.

Regards,

- Judy
