Vision Australia has started the year with a flurry of activity in
Tasmania:
- a full day workshop providing an overview of accessibility, common
issues, solutions, and an quick look at assessment tools. This workshop was
attended by 32 web people from state and federal government departments,
University of Tasmania and a single private developer.
- a half day workshop for the state government introducing them to
assessment tools and techniques and providing hands-on experience and
exercises. This workshop was well received and we hope to repeat it with
other groups.
- a "Business Briefing" under the IT-Test banner
<http://www.it-test.com.au/> with the state government's Intelligent Island
team to make small-medium ICT firms aware of the international
accessibility issues they might face as exporters.

Brian Hardy presented a paper about web accessibility at the (libraries)
OnLine2003 conference in January and demonstrated the Web-4-All system <
http://www.web4all.ca/>

I participated in the Accessibility Forum
<http://www.accessibilityforum.org/> earlier this week hosted by Apple in
Cupertino. The presentations should all be archived shortly along with the
webcast which will include the discussion following each presentation.
