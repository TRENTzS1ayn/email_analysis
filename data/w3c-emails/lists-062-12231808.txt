The www.blindprogramming.com site is popular among vision impaired users who have a proclivity for programming.
There are Word and text files   for a variety of programming languages / related topics. An HTML offering will make them more useful.
Most  formal IT training programs are very inaccessible to vision impaired students- (class room presentations, handouts etc) unless these are made available ahead of time in a form  preferred by the student.
Thanks,
