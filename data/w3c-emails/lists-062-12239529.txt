EOWG:

There is an updated draft of the business case resource suite for our 
discussion at the face to face meeting tomorrow, available at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/Overview.html

Many thanks to Andrew Arch, Alistair Garrison, Miguel Bermeo and Shawn 
Henry for contributions to the pages in this draft. Pages include:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/pol.html
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/econ.html
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/soc.html
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/tech.html

You'll note many areas on each page where work is still needed. I look 
forward to a good discussion on this at our meeting tomorrow.

Regards,

- Judy
