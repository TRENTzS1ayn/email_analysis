Knowbility.org is the producer of the various Web design competitions
around the U.S.  The schedule of upcoming events is listed on their Web
site.
      http://www.knowbility.org/airevents.jsp

Again, I would recommend that EO and/or WCAG WG approach Knowbility about
doing a rally with a draft of the WCAG 2.0 as a pilot and/or part of the
candidate recommendation phase.
