Please accept my sincere regrets for Friday's meeting due to illness. It
was good to meet many of you in person last week.

Re Business Case:  Alistair and I have discussed the Change Log and
developed a timetable that would see a new version available for discussion
before the next meeting on March 28. Could any additional comments or
feedback please be made available to me at the earliest possible
convenience after the meeting.

Regards,  Andrew
