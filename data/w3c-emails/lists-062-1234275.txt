EOWG:

An additional link for our discussion today follows. I have put up a first
draft of the appendix on evaluating sites for Web accessibility. Much of
the content is derived from Appendix A of WCAG 1.0. I have a number of
questions for our discussion today, with regard to how to make this section
more effective. 

Once we have made it through a draft or two, we will  also want to ask
input & feedback from the Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group (ERT
WG) and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (WCAG WG). 

The URL is:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/rev.html

You can also get there from the appendices page of the business plan, e.g. 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/ap
and I have updated the auxiliary benefits link to lead to Andrew's latest
version of that as well, so they are easier to find.

(I figured that if I put up a really really raw draft, maybe it would
encourage other people to post their own really raw drafts for group
perusal <slight grin>. We need to get initial drafts up of more pieces of
this document...)

Talk with you soon,

- Judy
