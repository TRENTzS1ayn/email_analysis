Dear appreciated scribes (minute takers),

The minutes template at 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/2003/template.html
now includes a draft attendee list, as well as in-page links at the top
to subcategory headings throughout.

Let me know if there is anything else I can do to make the minute taking
and posting easier and more efficient.

Please send minutes (in any format - don't have to use HTML template) to
both Judy and me at:
jbrewer@w3.org
  shawn@w3.org

Kind regards,

~Shawn
