EOWG,

Andrew and Alistair have made some updates to the "Business Case" and
Andrew expects to provide more soon. We will probably discuss these
during the teleconference on Friday. Below is the latest information for
anyone who wants to get started reviewing it.

Please keep in mind that these are still rough drafts and as such we are
looking for high-level comments, not copyediting or detailed
"wordsmithing."
