Hi all
Once again I have to skip part of the meeting, The chairman of the
Danish Association of the Blind has to retire because of illness and I
have to go to his farewell reception tomorrow (my boss and my college
are on their way to South Africa for the O&M world conference) So could
we once again change the agenda and do the business case before we talk
about the meetings and events planning.
I hope to be back and able to join our meeting at 9:30.
Just for your information there has been a change in my conference
planning so I will not be in Budapest for the WWW2003, by skipping
Budapest I will have more funds to spend on workgroup meetings and more
specific V.I. and ICT related things.
Cheers - see you to morrow, an hour late.
