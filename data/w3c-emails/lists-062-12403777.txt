...

Done quite a bit on the Econ doc tonight and 
made some changes to the Overview one too - I'll 
try and get you a "DONE" listing from the 
Changelog tomorrow (I've been ticking them off 
on a printout).

Could you please advise EO of this latest update 
as this email doesn't give me access to the EO 
list.

Cheers,  Andrew
