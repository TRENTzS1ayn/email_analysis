Hello All,
1. Business case: I think the words "business case" must not be there in the document title. 
This phrase appears to have been used with a very broad meaning to mean "justification" or " 
making a case".
"Making a case for Web accessibility" or " Justifying An Enterprise's Web Access Initiative" 
may be more appropriate.
2. The document at http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/pol.html needs a pointer to edu 
institutions   that have Web access policy.
Sample  of edu sites with Web access policy:
Oregon State University Web Accessibility Guidelines. 
Available at: http://tap.orst.edu/Policy/web.html 
Draft of Regis University's Web Accessibility Policy 
http://www.regis.edu/regis.asp?sctn=ars&p1=dis&p2=webaccessibility
MIT's Web Accessibility Policy 
Was available at: http://web.mit.edu/ada/waccess.html#policy
Looks like it has moved... I cannot find it.

3. On  social factors page
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/soc.html
It is important to elaborate "using Web is empowering and convenient" by  adding 
"offers privacy and independence to perform tasks that most take for granted"or  say that it 

allows PWD to perform tasks for which they needed assistance. Illustrate it with  :
- Review items, descriptions  and prices   in a store without physically visiting the store
- Complete and submit forms   online without moving out of their  home/ work place, etc
Helps them to avoid /reduce travel and hustle-bustle of commuting etc.
 This is important as some of those unfamiliar with the world of PWD may not be able to 

imagine these.
