About a week ago I gave a talk about the importance of promoting the 
business case  for Web accessibility to a group of high-level management- 
and IM/IT-consultants.  Most seemed to appreciate it could be a value-added 
feature for (at least) Canadian government clients and any private-sector 
clients who wish to have dealings with the US, EU and Australian government 
organizations.

The management consultant crowd seems to be a relatively untapped area for 
our education and outreach effort.  Management consultants are often the 
people who sell the "big" process re-engineering and IM/IT projects to 
upper-middle and senior managers in many organizations.  In my experience, 
it has been the middle-management players that are most resistant to and/or 
least aware of the requirements and realities of accessibility  (after all, 
it's usually their budgets that will have to cover the work).  If we can 
get more management consultants pitching access (even as an afterthought) 
we might see more movement in the middle.
