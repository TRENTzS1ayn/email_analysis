EOWG:

I have prepared an updated draft of the renewed EOWG charter, for 
discussion during the 28 March teleconference today.

I believe that it incorporates all comments received to date, and is 
hopefully ready to move to the next stage of the approval process. We will 
review the changes and discuss briefly as needed in the teleconference today.

It is available at:
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/charter3.html

Regards,

- Judy
