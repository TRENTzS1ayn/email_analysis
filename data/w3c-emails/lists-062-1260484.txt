Remember this? Actually, there is a link from the EO deliverables page to
something by that title, but it has only got information on an idea for a
process for looking at sites and putting them in one.

Anyway, there was a thread recently on the WAI IG list where someone asked
for sites that people liked for accessibility, starting with:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2001JulSep/0153

A list of sites people offered (these are not vetted by anyone, they are just
things people liked) is part of the thread at:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2001JulSep/0182

In addition, there was a competition hosted recently by the Danish
association for the blind, who awarded 25 000 DKR to http://www.ams.dk (an
employment service) for being accessible. More information is available in
Danish at http://www.dkblind.dk/Nyheder_Udgivelser/Nyheder/websitepris.htm
for people who can read it).

And the RNIB are reportedly happy with the site http://wwww.tesco.co.uk (I
believe) following revision of that site to address accessibility concerns.

There is also Karl Hebenstreit's links to pages claimng triple-A conformance
to WCAG.

And finally, I was impresed by the IBM-built site for the 2000 Australian
Tennis Open, during the time that the tournament itself was taking place.

All these things seem like good candidates for review - the question of
"where is there an accessible site" comes up very often, and it would be nice
to have some answers that other people agreed with. I also think it would be
useful to document the process of having done reviews, to explain to people
what that process is.
