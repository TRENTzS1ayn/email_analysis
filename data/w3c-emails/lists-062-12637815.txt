Finally back in the office after nearly a month of travel - whew :-)

Last week Vision Australia Foundation presented a very successful workshop
in Brisbane to around 20 folk from state and local government and tertiary
institutions on web accessibility - what it is, why do it, guidelines, what
to avoid, and how to start testing.

With some of our staff we have also just returned from AusWeb03 on the Gold
Coast where several sessions addressed accessibility issues and I gave the
opening keynote address - quite a privilege. The papers are available from
http://ausweb.scu.edu.au/aw03/conf/program.html.
The keynotes were videoed and are also available (but not accessibly).

Regards Andrew
