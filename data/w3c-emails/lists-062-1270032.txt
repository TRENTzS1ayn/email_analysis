Hi Charles
The European Agency for Development in Special Needs Education
http://www.european-agency.org/ has put the AAA conformance logo on their
site. I did a Bobby check on the site last Friday and it came out with
several priority 1 errors, haven't had time to try it with JAWS 3.5. My
point is that stating compliance with the WCAG isn't necessarily the same as
the site being accessible. In the EOWG we talked about this last Friday and
have started work on the review/evaluation document. See Judy's email from
13.07.01:  EOWG: First (raw!) draft of appendix on reviewing Web sites

"I have put up a first
draft of the appendix on evaluating sites for Web accessibility. Much of
the content is derived from Appendix A of WCAG 1.0. I have a number of
questions for our discussion today, with regard to how to make this section
more effective. 

Once we have made it through a draft or two, we will  also want to ask
input & feedback from the Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group (ERT
WG) and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (WCAG WG). 

The URL is:

See changelog from the meeting.

Subject: Gallery of accessible sites...

Remember this? Actually, there is a link from the EO deliverables page to
something by that title, but it has only got information on an idea for a
process for looking at sites and putting them in one.

Anyway, there was a thread recently on the WAI IG list where someone asked
for sites that people liked for accessibility, starting with:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2001JulSep/0153

A list of sites people offered (these are not vetted by anyone, they are
just
things people liked) is part of the thread at:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2001JulSep/0182

In addition, there was a competition hosted recently by the Danish
association for the blind, who awarded 25 000 DKR to http://www.ams.dk (an
employment service) for being accessible. More information is available in
Danish at http://www.dkblind.dk/Nyheder_Udgivelser/Nyheder/websitepris.htm
for people who can read it).

And the RNIB are reportedly happy with the site http://wwww.tesco.co.uk (I
believe) following revision of that site to address accessibility concerns.

There is also Karl Hebenstreit's links to pages claimng triple-A conformance
to WCAG.

And finally, I was impresed by the IBM-built site for the 2000 Australian
Tennis Open, during the time that the tournament itself was taking place.

All these things seem like good candidates for review - the question of
"where is there an accessible site" comes up very often, and it would be
nice
to have some answers that other people agreed with. I also think it would be
useful to document the process of having done reviews, to explain to people
what that process is.
