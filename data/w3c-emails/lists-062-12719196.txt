Hello

I recently joined the EOWG. I look forward to meeting with you all over 
the coming days. I am the Information Architecture and Accessibility 
lead on Cisco Systems' Intranet Strategy Team.

If at all possible, I would appreciate a bit of guidance on where to 
focus my energy for the benefit of the greater group. I would like to 
utilize the flight time to ramp up on anything I need to for the 
upcoming discussions.


Thank you,

Michael Lenz
Intranet Strategy Team
Cisco Systems, Inc.
