Hello,

Just came across the following article by Tristan Nitot - supports many of
the Auxiliary Benefits and some of the Business Case arguments.

The Business Benefits of Web Standards

"More with less seems to be the mission impossible for web designers:
Addressing more customers, a broader audience, more diversity in terms of
browsers, more accessibility, users asking for more speed, while spending
less to maintain or redesign a web site. Caught between a rock and a hard
place, web designers face a formidable challenge. Yet they are finding an
unsuspected ally in the battle: web standards. "
