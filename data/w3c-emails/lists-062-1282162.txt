Hi Helle,

yes, I did note that message from Judy, and it is relevant. I thought it
would be useful to have some test cases, and to carry out review of them,
probably in conjunction with ERT and WCAG, as part of the development of that
material. At the same time, I would still like to find some answers to the
question "what sites would you put in a gallery", and document how the
decision to include a site is made.

cheers

Charles

  Hi Charles
  The European Agency for Development in Special Needs Education
  http://www.european-agency.org/ has put the AAA conformance logo on their
  site. I did a Bobby check on the site last Friday and it came out with
  several priority 1 errors, haven't had time to try it with JAWS 3.5. My
  point is that stating compliance with the WCAG isn't necessarily the same as
  the site being accessible. In the EOWG we talked about this last Friday and
  have started work on the review/evaluation document. See Judy's email from
  13.07.01:  EOWG: First (raw!) draft of appendix on reviewing Web sites

  "I have put up a first
  draft of the appendix on evaluating sites for Web accessibility. Much of
  the content is derived from Appendix A of WCAG 1.0. I have a number of
  questions for our discussion today, with regard to how to make this section
  more effective.
