>Dear WAI Interest Group Participants:
>
>A new Working Draft of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 
>2.0) was published 24 June 2003 and is available for your review. WCAG 2.0 
>addresses accessibility of Web content for people with disabilities. It 
>will apply to a wider range of Web technologies than WCAG 1.0 and is 
>intended to be understandable to a wider audience.
>
>Since the previous public Working Draft of WCAG 2.0, published on 29 April 
>2003, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (WCAG WG), 
>chaired by Gregg Vanderheiden and Jason White, has incorporated comments 
>received and further developed the guidelines and checkpoints in WCAG 2.0.
>
>W3C Working Drafts provide opportunities for public comment during the 
>development of a specification. The earlier in the development process 
>comments are received, the greater impact they may have. The WCAG WG
>invites you to comment on their latest Working Draft, available at:
>     http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-WCAG20-20030624/
>Send comments to the public comments mailing list by 10 September 2003:
>     public-comments-wcag20@w3.org
>
>The Working Group received many helpful comments on the previous draft and 
>is interested in more comments on the following questions. These questions 
>are similar to those published with the previous Working Draft and are 
>intended to encourage general discussion and review of the Working Draft.
>
>          1.  In general, is this WCAG 2.0 Working Draft easy to understand?
>               Please identify sections or phrases that are difficult to 
> understand.
>               Please suggest alternative wording for the Working Group to 
> consider.
>
>          2.  The conformance structure of this WCAG 2.0 Working Draft differs
>                from WCAG 1.0 and from the previous WCAG 2.0 Working Draft.
>                Is the concept of Core and Extended checkpoints easy to 
> understand?
>                Is this an effective structure?
>
>          3.  If your site or organization already uses WCAG 1.0, do you
>               think it will be difficult to migrate from WCAG 1.0 to WCAG 
> 2.0, based on
>               the current draft? Please note that the Working Group is 
> developing
>               supporting documents such as technology-specific techniques 
> documents
>               and checklists for WCAG 2.0.
>
>Please send your comments by 10 September 2003 to:
>          public-comments-wcag20@w3.org
>The archive for that mailing list is available at:
>          http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-comments-wcag20/
>
>We would also like to bring your attention to "Requirements for WCAG 2.0" 
>which explains the Working Group's goals for WCAG 2.0 based on feedback 
>from WCAG 1.0, including improving the usability, understandability, and 
>applicability of the guidelines. It is available at:
>        http://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2-req/
>
>When sending comments, please:
>          - State the issue as clearly and simply as possible.
>          - Provide links to specific examples or references.
>          - If possible, suggest solutions.
>          - Remember that the Working Group welcomes volunteers
>             to help with the work.
>
>When waiting for responses to comments:
>         - Track your issue in the open issues list
> 
>http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/condensedreports/wcag2_issues.php
>         - Follow up on the mailing list if you don't find your issue in the
>           open issues list.
>
>Please let us know if you have any questions. Many thanks in advance for 
>your comments. Additional information on the Working Group is available at:
>          http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/
>
>Note:
>We expect WCAG 2.0 to become a W3C Recommendation sometime in 2004. Until 
>then, WCAG 1.0 will continue to be the current and stable document to use. 
>If your site currently conforms to WCAG 1.0, be assured that conformance 
>to WCAG 2.0 will not require a complete redesign of your site but it will 
>likely require some tweaks.
>
>Note:
>This message may be circulated to other lists, avoiding cross-postings 
>where possible.
