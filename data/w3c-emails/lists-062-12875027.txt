EOWG:

For discussion in our teleconference today, and/or comment online -- I've 
updated the Social Factors page from Presenting the Case for Web 
Accessibility again.

Please note: Only the Introduction is fully updated to reflect our recent 
change requests -- although the changelog itself is not completely updated 
to reflect the latest edits. (The rest of the page has quite a ways to go 
still, as does the rest of the suite.)

Following our discussion in Palo Alto, I searched a bit on the term social 
responsibility. It seems to be used widely in the business community at 
least in Asia, Europe, and North America, so I think it's safe to use it if 
we at least provide a definition in place. Here is a starter reference:
