Digital Divide in Australia

Defining the Digital Divide

  "Access to and the ability to effectively use information and
  communications technologies (ICTs) to obtain information and services are
  becoming increasingly important to fully participate in contemporary
  Australian economic, political and social life.

  The global consensus on the positive contribution of ICTs to economic and
  social developments is rising. The role of ICTs in development highlights
  the major social changes they have on the way people conduct their daily
  activities in work, education, health and at home. ICTs have changed the
  way people view and use information. Information-based goods and services
  are increasingly becoming major sources of wealth, as information becomes
  the driving force of the information economy. "
