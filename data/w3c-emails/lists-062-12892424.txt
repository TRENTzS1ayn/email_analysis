Hello Shawn,
1. You did say you had a fair idea of what was wrong with the Web pages proposed to be tested. Do you intend to implement those changes before testing?
Also testing with  automated  tools might help to bring some problems to the surface. I think these should be fixed and then functional testing with users
should be done. They will be able to identify usability issues  and those that need exercise of human judgement.
2. Also you might consider using more than one vision impaired user because:
- research suggests that they are the most  challenged of surfers;
- more than 50% of the guidelines relate to accessibility  barriers faced by vision impaired users;
Block quote start
- the remediation needed to obviate these barriers, mainly, providing keyboard access, text alternatives and alternative navigation mechanisms help several
categories of users.
 Thanks,
