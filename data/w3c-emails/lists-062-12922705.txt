EOWG:

At our teleconference last week, we agreed that we would discuss the 24 
June 2003 WCAG 2.0 Working Draft at our EOWG teleconferences on 8 August, 
15 August, and also 29 August if needed.

Several people said that they would start reading the draft to help start 
the discussion for this week, and I promised to send out the questions that 
we'd brainstormed on our 1 August teleconference. While I'm not getting 
those out as early as I'd hoped, they are listed below, for your reading 
pleasure. Comments on these questions to the EOWG mailing list are also 
welcome.

The 24 June 2003 WCAG 2.0 Working Draft is available at
         http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-WCAG20-20030624/
and the call for review which was sent out on the WAI Interest Group 
mailing list is available at
         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2003JulSep/0196.html

Suggested questions for EOWG discussion follow:

1. Are the guidelines and checkpoints understandable?

2. Is the terminology used translatable?

3. Is the conformance model clearly defined and implementable?

4. What would the impact of the guidelines and checkpoints be on EOWG's 
Evaluation Resource Suite?

5. What would the impact of this draft of WCAG 2.0 be on other EOWG documents?

6. Is the structure of the document easy to understand and follow?

7. Is it easy to find specific topics within the document?

8. Is it easy to find associated documents such as the Techniques documents?

9. How clearly does this draft explain questions regarding the transition 
between WCAG 1.0 and 2.0?

10. How clear and appropriate is the overall presentation of the document?


Regards,

- Judy
