For your consideration:
Q3. Is the conformance model clearly defined and implementable?
Answer:
1. Rationale of what constitutes core and extended   like WCAG 1.0 has a structure of P1, 
P2, P3. Need to explain why   some are core and some are extended, like 
Core checkpoints : if not complied with, one or more user groups may find  it impossible to 
access content
Extended: these enhance (usability)   or facilitate navigation and  provide more efficient  
access to content.
While on the subject, the single A, double A and triple A conformance levels are primarily 
intended to aid developers on focussing on  more critical issues before tackling those that 
are only desirable as per WCAG, although  all checkpoints  enhance accessibility. Now WCAG 
has two categories core and extended instead of the three. These   will also  convey the 
same message to the developers: core are very important for accessibility and should be the 
focus of their attention. So this framework isnot a big change over A,AA,AAA or P1, P2, P3 
method of WCAG 1.0. So is WCAG 2.0   achieving a whole lot more by reducing the conformance 
levels from 3 to 2? And is it really a reduction when we consider that  Core+N may be 
another level one can claim?
In fact mapping 1.0 to 2.0 checkpoints has given rise to an unresolved issue : inconsistencies  in relating priorities to  core and extended framework.
2. It appears that  there is a shift away from  accessibility for PWD to universal access. 

Consider that:
i. Five WCAG 1.0 checkpoints including 3 P1  map to an extended   WCAG 2 checkpoint 4.2 
about declaring  technology/providing alternative content.
ii. WCAG2's  checkpoint 2.4about navigation mechanisms maps to 13 checkpoints of WCAG 1.0 
some of which are P1 and some are P2. Checkpoint 2.4 of WCAG 2 is categorized as extended 
and not  core.
iii. On the other hand, checkpoints 4.1 and 4.3 relating to language   in WCAG 1.0 now have 
become  core under  3.1 of WCAG 2.
