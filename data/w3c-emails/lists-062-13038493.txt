For your consideration

Q9. How clearly does this draft explain questions regarding the transition between WCAG 1.0 and 2.0?
Answer:
I guess a developer or other user of WCAG 2 will be confused  if he has used WCAG 1. WCAG 
1.0 tells him that certain things are absolutely necessary for accessibility and  now WCAG 
2.0 relegates those to "extended" status. Then some that were regarded as only as  desirable   for accessibility by WCAG 1.0 have suddenly become core in WCAG 2.0.
Consider that:
i. Five WCAG 1.0 checkpoints including 3 P1  map to an extended   WCAG 2 checkpoint 4.2 
about declaring  technology/providing alternative content.
ii. Five P2 checkpoints make a core 4.1 checkpoint on usage specs.
iii. One P1 and two P3 checkpoints make an extended checkpoint  3.3 under Wcag 2.0 on 
content complexity.
This has given rise to an inconsistency and the first unresolved issue stated on the page 
for 
"Checkpoint Mapping Between WCAG 1.0 and the WCAG 2.0 Working Draft"
That is why it is necessary for the document to say why some checkpoints are core and some 
are extended.
