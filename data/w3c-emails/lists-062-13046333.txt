Q4. What would the impact of the guidelines and checkpoints be on EOWG's
Evaluation Resource Suite?
Q5. What would the impact of this draft of WCAG 2.0 be on other EOWG documents?
Answer to 4 and 5:
How will answers to Q 4 and 5  be of relevance to WCAG-WG? Do we need to evaluate this now 
before Sepp 10?
