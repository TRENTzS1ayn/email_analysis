EOWG:

A condensed list of EOWG discussion questions for the WCAG 2.0 Working 
Draft follows, based on our conversation at last week's teleconference.

Again, the 24 June 2003 WCAG 2.0 Working Draft is available at
         http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-WCAG20-20030624/
and the call for review which was sent out on the WAI Interest Group 
mailing list is available at
         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2003JulSep/0196.html

Please carefully read the whole draft document before our teleconference 
tomorrow. Comments onto the EOWG list are encouraged.

Regards,

- Judy

1. Are the guidelines and checkpoints understandable?
(WE DISCUSSED THIS ONE ALREADY.)

2. Is the terminology used translatable?
(WE DISCUSSED THIS ONE SOME, AND SHOULD JUST CHECK BACK IN BRIEFLY ON IT.)

3. What would the impact of the guidelines, checkpoints, and conformance 
model be on:
- EOWG's evaluation resource suite?
- other EOWG documents?

4. Is the structure of the document easy to understand and follow:
- is it easy to find specific topics within the document?
- is it easy to find associated documents such as the Techniques documents?
- how clear and appropriate is the overall presentation of the document?

5. Does the conformance model appear to be:
- clearly defined and implementable?
- clearly explained with respect to questions people may have regarding the 
transition from WCAG 1.0 to 2.0?
