There are many perspectives from which the conformance model in WCAG 2.0 
can be examined:
- is the conformance model understandable and usable by a content developer;
- is it understandable and usable by a Web site designer or developer;
- is it understandable by an authoring tool developer who is trying to 
develop ATAG-conformant tools that produce WCAG-conformant documents;
- is it understandable and usable by someone in charge of an organization's 
Web site policy who is trying to set some goals for accessibility;
- is it understandable and useful for a representative of a disability 
organization who is trying to determine why various governmental, 
commercial or non-profit Web sites may or may not be accessible to people 
with disabilities;
- etc.

Presumably the WCAG WG is doing their best to think about all of those 
audiences while they write WCAG 2.0, but part of EOWG's work includes 
helping WCAG WG communicate their intentions to certain of those audiences 
as clearly as possible.

Given that the conformance model is relatively new and still evolving, and 
their draft includes several questions regarding how the conformance model 
might best be defined, it seems a worthwhile exercise to examine how 
they're communicating their conformance concept to different audiences, and 
how well that concept might be accepted and usable by some of those audiences.
