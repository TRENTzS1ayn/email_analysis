The WCAG 2.0 document is 32 pages on my browser...22" monitor about 1200 x
1024 Far too many pages.

The document sets the bar too low/high - in the wrong place.  If I have to
scroll down more than 5-10 pages, it is candidate for a different
structural delivery but this document says 50 pages.

Required Success Criteria for Checkpoint 2.4

In documents greater than 50,000 words or sites larger than 50 perceived
pages, the following are provided.


I suggest that this document itself would allow easer navigation and things
would be found more easily with a layout option more like the one below:
