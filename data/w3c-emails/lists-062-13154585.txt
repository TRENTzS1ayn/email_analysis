"World Wide Web Consortium Process Document" provides an example of
providing both a primary contents page that links to multiple files and
a single file that contains all, as well as a short contents list and an
expanded contents list.

1. main page:
http://www.w3.org/2003/06/Process-20030618/

includes paragraph: "This document is also available in these
non-normative packages: single HTML file, self- contained gzipped tar
archive, self-contained zip archive."

and "Table of Contents" with 14 items, immediately followed by "Expanded
table of contents"

2. single HTML file with all is at:
