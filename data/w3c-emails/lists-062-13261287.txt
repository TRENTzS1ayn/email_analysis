Although we are immersed in the details of 2.0, we keep coming back to the 
notion that it might very well be worthwhile to reconsider (at the WAI 
level, at least) whether there is actually a *need* for 2.0 and its 
attendant radical transmogrification of the recommendation. Perhaps not 
really an EO concern, but I would like to recommend that *somebody* 
re-assess the decision to make HUGE changes in 1.0 (maybe just a 1.1 is in 
order?). I know this was discussed at length before, but perhaps CG could 
take a new look even if only in order to placate one old person?

I really think that 2.0 undermines some of the great things that have 
accrued from the very existence/acceptance of 1.0. It makes any future 
recommendations look sort of "tenuous" because of such fundamental changes 
that, while attempting to re-define "normative" (how can something 
normative be so evanescent). The new version seems somehow less 
substantive, but I can't put a finger on it - just that if we were so 
"wrong" before, why should we be believed now?
