Outreach Update - last week I spoke at the Australian W3C Day in Sydney
organised by the Australian Office (http://w3c.dstc.edu.au/) about
accessibility needs, Guidelines and developments, and Australian policy and
practice.

Regrets - unfortunately I will not be able to join you in Dublin next week.
I'm sure you'll have a fruitful and productive meeting.

Andrew
