The Education part has two distinct components: 1) educating about what 
accessibility is/does; 2) educating how to make stuff accessible.

I suppose (1) is more like Outreach and (2) might be the documentation 
interpreting the various guidelines? At any rate, I hope that our training 
session methods/materials are checked by the WGs in the same sense that we 
check the guidelines.

Or maybe I've just been in the sun too long?
