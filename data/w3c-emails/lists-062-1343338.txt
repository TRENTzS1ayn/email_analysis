aloha, judy!

to Section 2, "Goals and expectations for review", of the document located
at:
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/rev.html>
i would add, as the bullet point:

<PROPOSED>
* to provide assurance that a Web site will maintain a required level of
  accessibility;
</PROPOSED>

hmm -- i'd like to think that "assurance" is the word we should use, rather
than a phrase such as "a reasonable expectation"...

PS: i'll send more comments when i re-read the document, but on first
listen, it sounds quite good -- thanks, judy, for finally throwing all the
stuff that's been floating around up on the wall...
