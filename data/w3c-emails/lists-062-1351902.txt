CMN: And the RNIB are reportedly happy with the site http://wwww.tesco.co.uk
(I
believe) following revision of that site to address accessibility concerns.

GJR: tesco actually developed an alternative interface:
<http://www.tesco.com/access/>
for accessibility's sake...  it is one of, if not THE, success story of the
Royal National Foundation for the Blind's "Campaign for Good Web Design" --
the project which julie howell described at the EO face2face meeting held in
amsterdam on 22 june 2001 -- more information on the RNIB's role in site
evaluation/quality assurance/activism-cum-guidance can be found at:
<http://rnib.org.uk/digital>

from which one can find the an announcement that the Tesco Access site has
won the RNIB's first
"See It Right Accessible Website Award":
<http://www.rnib.org.uk/whatsnew/pressrel/may2001/tesco.htm>
which (obviously) contains information about the Tesco Access site and its
genesis, as well as a link to RNIB's "See It Right Pack":
<http://www.rnib.org.uk/seeitright/>

in addition, there is an announcement entitled "Tesco Access: the creation
of an accessible online shopping experience" located at:
<http://www.rnib.org.uk/digital/tescoevent.htm>
which describes an event at which anyone who books a spot via the
aforementioned URI and who is in London can hear about the "Tesco Access"
project directly from nick lansley, the IT and "New Technologies Manager"
for tesco.com
