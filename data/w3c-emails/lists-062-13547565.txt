4. Face-to-face meeting planning
         - discuss options for meeting in first quarter 2004, including:
         * Madrid, best practices evaluation exchange in January 2004?
         * W3C Technical Plenary, early march, in France?
         * CSUN, no EOWG meeting following, but WAI IG?
         * (intial ideas for later in 2004 -- north america? asia?)

5. Presenting the Case for Web Accessibility
          - discuss terms (wording) for updated Economic Factors page (see 
below)
         (updated draft will be available before the meeting)

Specific questions for discussion of Economic Factors page of Business Case:

--- Is "Economic Factors" the appropriate term for the business case
audience? Economic is at a higher level, rather than at a specific
organization level. Organizational departments are called "finance" and
"accounting." Within a specific project these issues are called "costs"
or "resources." Would a more appropriate title for this section be
"Financial Factors" or "Cost Factors" or "Investment Factors"?

--- Are the following terms appropriate across different cultures and
environments:
----- "human resource costs" (as in: "The following are common human
resource-related costs associated with an initial investment in
accessibility: Providing training and skills development...")
----- "capital expenses" (as in: "Potential initial capital expenses
include: Accessibility evaluation tools... Assistive technologies...")
----- "retrofit" (as in: "When retrofitting an existing site, assessment
of existing Web site accessibility is a common initial cost...")
