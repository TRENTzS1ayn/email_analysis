On Thursday September 26 about 30 folks participated in an effective session
on Accessibility checkers.

Prof. Norm Coombs, of Project EASI chaired the session. The purpose was to
demonstrate accessibility checkers and encourage their use.

Dick Banks presented the screen captures he had prepared including
WAVE, Bobby, and Cynthia Says. A-Prompt was not included, though mentioned.

For some of the audience, this was a first introduction to accessibility. 
For them,
the mass of detail from the checkers, and the presumed knowledge behind them,
may have been overwhelming.

Interesting conference technique used: Ivocalize Web Conference text chat 
window,
including audio for discussion and screen information:

     on top the presenter's display focus,
     at the bottom the IRC, and audio (I used headset with microphone)
     shared voice, normally the presenter's:
         with "push Ctrl" to take your turn to talk
         (one at a time, others heard a chime at push.)

[That page begins with a summary of Project EASI, and the on-line seminars they
provide. At the bottom is the link to the subject telecon.]

One participant planned to use Via Voice for re-dictating (using his already
trained voice) of the material to a text transcript (I haven't seen the 
result yet.)
Nor have I heard the audio transcript that both Norm and Dick captured.

I was the only one present representing WAI. Norm and Dick were quite 
appreciative
of my presence and comments.
