On Wednesday I got this from an OCLC mailing list and thought it may be
interesting to some of you "over there" It's a rather long text so if you
are interested let me know and I'll forward it. 
Here is a short clip from the text:

"...The goal of the Web Document Digital Archive project is to create a
sustainable service to provide long-term access to web documents...

OCLC is seeking direct input on the project from a variety of institutions
already focused on the issue: The U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO); The
Connecticut State Library; and the Joint Electronic Records Repository
Initiative (JERRI), a partnership of the State Library of Ohio, the Ohio
Historical Society's State Archives, the Ohio Supercomputer Center and the
Ohio Department of Administrative Services.

"Participants will be collaborating with OCLC on system user requirements,
evaluating working prototypes through 'hands-on' experience, and developing
policies and practices for long-term retention in concert with current best
practices established through other digital archive projects
internationally," said Taylor Surface, director of OCLC Content Management
Services.  "Long-term retention and access to documents published on the
World Wide Web have universal appeal to libraries and people seeking the
information in them." ... "
