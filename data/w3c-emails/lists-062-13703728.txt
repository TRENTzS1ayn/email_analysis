Dear EOWG, 

Just a quick note for interest...

Quoting from a EuroAccessibility Press Release: 

"EuroAccessibility: a first step toward a harmonised methodology for evaluating Web site accessibility
Web accessibility experts from across Europe have agreed on a harmonised approach for evaluating Web site accessibility. The 3-day technical workshop took place in Zeist (Netherlands) on the 23-25th September as part of a larger EuroAccessibility meeting.

The new EuroAccessibility document produced from this meeting is part of the evaluation procedure to test the accessibility of a Web site for people with disabilities and the elderly. This approach brings harmonisation a step closer in Europe, allowing a more inclusive society. The draft version of the document is made openly available for comments by anyone involved in making Web sites accessible on the TF3 pages of this WebSite".

With the draft document referenced being EuroAccessibility Web Accessibility Evaluation Checklist Document - Version 0a1 (Draft) (at http://www.euroaccessibility.org/EACEvaluationChecklist0a1.html).

Very Best Regards 

Alistair
