Hello Judy,

I spoke at the Victorian Tertiary Web Managers Forum yesterday about
accessibility issues and how they could get started with identifying issues
on their own sites. The Forum (http://www.latrobe.edu.au/its/webmanagers/)
was held at La Trobe University with over 50 web managers present from 12
different institutions. I used the WebAIM video
(http://www.webaim.org/info/asdvideo/) in my introduction as it contains
interviews targeting tertiary institutions. I introduced WCAG and some
common issues and then told them (and showed them) some simple techniques
to start testing their sites.

Andrew
