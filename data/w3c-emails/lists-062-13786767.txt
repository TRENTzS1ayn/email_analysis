I must regret this week --- BUT  -- may have an interesting Outreach to
report.

Trying to reschedule a meeting here at DoS, which was cancelled due to the
hurricane, about -> 
"... opinions on whether the Department should adopt the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C) standards (HTML, XHTML, CSS, XSL, DOM, etc.) for ALL DoS
websites ...".

Needless to say, my vote is YES... and I will expand their "etc."
