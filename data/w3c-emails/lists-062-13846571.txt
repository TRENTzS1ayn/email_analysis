EOWG folks,

At the upcoming EOWG teleconference, we will be discussing two aspects
of the WAI Web site usability testing protocol (the plan for the test).
Specifically, we will:
- review WSTF (Web Site Task Force) recommendations for participant
(users) criteria
- discuss WSTF draft tasks (what the usability testing participants will
do with site)

Draft participant criteria and tasks is available at:
- http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/UCD/wai-ut

Regards,

~ Shawn
