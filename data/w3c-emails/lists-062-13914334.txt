Hello, The following is Brian Hardy's report on his involvement in an
APEC-TEL forum in Taiwan last week:

Andrew, For Outreach at the EOWG:

Last Saturday (4 October 2003) I presented at an Accessibility Workshop for
the Telecommunications Working Group of the Forum on Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC). It was attended by 40-50 senior people from many of the
21 APEC Economies.

The Media Release is at
http://www.apecsec.org.sg/apec/news___media/media_releases/031003_ct_apecinternetforum.html

Details of the Workshop are at http://www.apectel28.com.tw/ There were
several interesting papers presented from member economies and experts.

The one from Chinese Taipei is particularly interesting. The Taiwan
Government has embarked on a major effort to make government online
accessible to all. They intend to provide an example to lead the private
sector in Taiwan. As part of the process they have provided training in
accessibility for 3,500 people and conducted a review of nearly 300
government websites to provide a baseline to measure the success of the
project.

Papers from all the presenters are linked from the Accessibility Workshop
program. The Workbook prepared for the day is also interesting. (Please
note that the Workbook is still in development - until March 2004 - so any
comments would be welcome.)

There will be a follow up session at APEC TEL29 in April 2004 and I hope
there will be considerable action in the meantime. There was real interest
in accessibility across both the developing and developed economies of the
APEC Region.

For interest, the 21 APEC Economies are: Australia, Brunei Darussalam,
Canada, Chile, People's Republic of China, Hong Kong China, Indonesia,
Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea,
Peru, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand, United
States, and Vietnam.
