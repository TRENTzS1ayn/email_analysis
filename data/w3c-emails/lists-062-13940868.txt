I've been reading and trying to rewrite this document
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/standard-harmon.html

It occurs to me that what we actually want is one unified standard, right?
Not a series of seperate but harmonized standards. I suggest that it might
be better to talk of unification rather than harmonisation. I don't think it
comes across in the document. I realise that we don't want to brazenly claim
that WCAG is the one and only true standard, but perhaps we can say
unification and still be diplomatic. I'm also wondering about using
"divergence" instead of "fragmentation."

My work so far is at:
http://www.infoescena.es/achuter/acceso/drafts/standard-harmon_akc.html

I've dived into it where inspiration hit me, at the end of the introduction,
but the changes are clearly marked with <ins> and <del>.

I think it could be more readable if we assume that after a couple of
paragraphs the context is clear, and find a way to substitute phrases like
"standards harmonization" and "web accessibility" with something shorter
(like "it" or "this").

regards to all,
