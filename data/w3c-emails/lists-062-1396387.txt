EOWG 

Have done some more revision of evaluation appendix, prior to today's meeting:

http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/rev.html

In particular, added content at "simple review" section during an initial
brainstorm with Wendy, and we have an invitation to run this appendix
through the WCAG WG and ERT WG after another few revisions here.

Also changed intro and re-organized most of the rest of material on the page. 

Some of it is still very raw, obviously.

- Judy
