1. Another approach to implement Natasha's idea is to  clearly
distinguishbenefits under two headings along the lines of:
- increased audience   reach among PWD/AT users/seniors ... the category
that is supposed to benefit  from WCAG etc.
So the  later half of the content under "Increased site use" can be
moved here.
- increase general Website usability
 
SLH: done
 
 2.  I suppose the words "In addition to the direct cost benefits
addressed above, can be dropped. 
 
SLH: left for now as transition. will revisit during later editing.
 
3.   It is not appropriate to say "realize direct and indirect cost
benefits ". Suggest that it be replaced with "realize direct and
indirect financial
benefits " in
"most organizations realize direct and indirect cost benefits from
increased Web site use."
 
SLH: yup, I caught that even before i read your mail
 
 4. Consider adding  customer support services as an example under the
para that begins "Increasingly, Web sites are used to cut costs...". 
 
SLH: added 
 
 5. Another term for effective usage: intense use / encouraged to
explore  the site's features / offerings. 
 
SLH:  added "use the site more thoroughly,"
 
 6.  Need to include following as a benefit:
 
SLH: Should be covered in detail in Technical Factors, and is referenced
here as: "Decreases the cost of upgrading to new technologies in the
future, as a foundation for future Web"
 
 (Outreach: Last week  at a corporate presentation I was at, the
company's top execs just bought the "right thing to do" argument as they
perceived it was
in line with their values, leadership position  and  their image as a
customer/market responsive / friendly company.) 
 
SLH: cool. interesting.
 
 
Thanks, Sailesh !
