SLH: edited based on this & Sailesh's comment

(kinda - costs are fixed costs at org level as well as training &  such
also as org level, as opposed to lots of additional costs for  each new
project)

SLH: I took it out all together, based on other comment.

SLH: Covered that in "Upgrading technologies and tools"


> Sentence becomes:

this knowledge increases initial  development and testing time to ensure
interface interactions  and cross-browser support. Long-term costs can

SLH: took the benefits out of this section, based on other  comments

SLH: took it out of this section altogether, based on other  comments
abot not repeating the point here

SLH: added "rather than costs required for each individual  project" so
it now says: "Most of the costs are early  investments at an
organization level, rather than costs required  for each individual
project. There are usually few costs  associated with accessibility at
the project level once  accessibility is integrated in Web development
throughout the  organization."

SLH: changed to <DL> with full sentences

SLH: seems a bit too detailed. Does the rewrite make it less of  an
issue?

SLH: based on previous comments, too it out of this section  altogether
