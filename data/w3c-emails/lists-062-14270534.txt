Shawn wrote - 1. Outreach updates (brief)

Brian Hardy presented a session to an Australian Commonwealth Government
Inter-Departmental Committee on "Flexible Work Practices" including a
discussion and presentation on assistive technologies and the implications
for (ICT) working tools that a staff member with disabilities may rely on.
The Committee is looking at flexible work practices in general, but also
the implications for employees with disabilities and how work can be made
more flexible both on and off-site.
