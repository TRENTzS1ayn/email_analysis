Unfortunately I shall be unable to attend the phone meeting today - we are 
running user testing all day and for the following week.

NB: I should be able to perform short tests (1 or 2 tasks) at the end of 
the testing session for the WAI site. If there were any issues arising from 
the recent testing that we could benefit from more data on. I have 6 people 
with a range of disabilities taking part in the testing. Please let me know.

regards

Jon
