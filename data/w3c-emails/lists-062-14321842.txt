Hi- 

I started a group to study the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
(version 1.0.) The group is for technical communicators who need to
consider accessibility issues when designing Web sites.

Our first meeting was November 17. 

For more information: 

1. Go to www.stc-boston.org 
2. Click "Events." 
3. Click "SIG Meetings." 
4. Click the AccessAbility SIG icon (butterfly). 

Let me know if you want to be added to my distribution list. 

Thanks, 

- Lori

Hi everybody, 

On november 12th, I held a 4 hours lesson about WGAC 1.0 guidelines in a

course organized by the CABI Project
http://marciana.venezia.sbn.it/CABI/
<http://marciana.venezia.sbn.it/CABI/> . 

It was a very interesting occasion to test what developers think about
WAI 
and WCAG 1.0, and what they are expecting from WCAG 2.0. 

My best regards 

Roberto Castaldo
