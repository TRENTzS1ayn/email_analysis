Hello, all -

I find the current version of Financial Factors hard to access. So, here's
my two cents. Rewrites include:

1.  Removing redundant content and multiple ideas in one paragraph.
2.  Attempting to group like ideas together.
3.  Improving flow.
4.  Changing bolding to focus on headers.
5.  Removing confusing structure. The document is hard to scan, and the
structure is not truly hierarchal:
          - Inconsistent use of bullets and definition lists.
          - The bullets and definition list indentations are different,
creating visual hierarchy confusion.
          - Misuse of definition list for formatting and not structure. (In
particular, JAWS tells users they've reached a definition list and the
number of items in the list, which is confusing as the information is not
words or concepts with their respective definitions.)

I may have unintentionally omitted content.

Attached is a zip file with the revised HTML version. I've also included my
Word working copy, which tracks all changes.
 <<financial_factors.zip>> 
If we can't make this document clear and easy to read, people won't read it!

Regards, 

Blossom
