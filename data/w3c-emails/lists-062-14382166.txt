I'm actually teaching in a course about Web Design in a TelecomItalia Learning Services (www.tils.it) project, in L'Aquila (Italy).

The original course plan was not based on web accessibility, but I'm also speaking about accessible web design, web standards, WAI and WCAG 1.0.

So I won't be able to meet you in today's conference.

My best regards,
