EOWG Update for WAI CG July 24 meeting

- Additional work & discussion on Business Case and Implementation Plan for
Web Accessibility
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/changelog
including discussion about splitting the document & appendices into two
- business case + relevant appendices (demographics, cost, auxiliary
benefits, etc)
- implementation plan + relevant appendices (developing policies,
evaluating sites, etc)
in particular, work progressing on evaluation of sites
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/rev.html
EOWG will need to coordinate with WCAG WG and ERT WG on this
also progressing on benefits of Web accessibility

- UAWG reminding us that they need a more referenceable version of How
People with Disabilities Use the Web
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/PWD-Use-Web/

- EOWG planning meetings in Berlin in September and DC in October...
probably... not settled yet... urgent to settle Berlin meeting

- updated EOWG home page to get back closer to the originally recommended
nav elements: Introduction/Charter - Deliverables - Meetings/Minutes -
Membership/Mailing list
also updated deliverables section
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/#deliv
and will try to use that to drive schedule better
also updated active member page (members in good standing) and added
pointer to section on members-in-good-standing from W3C Process document,
to clarify situation:
