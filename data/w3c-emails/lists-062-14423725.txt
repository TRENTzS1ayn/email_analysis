Did anyone pick up the proposal for developer certification in the UK? See
http://www.bwdma.com/403 & http://www.icdri.org/News/bwdma.htm

"The first ever accessibility accreditation scheme for suppliers of web
design services is to launch early next year. The scheme has been developed
by the recently formed accessibility and usability working group of the
British Web Design and Marketing Association (BWDMA).  The accreditation
will enable the digital industry to identify qualified suppliers in what is
a legally essential requirement for all companies on the web."

Does anyone know anything about this? What will be the basis for
certification?

A quick look indicates they to employ some 'certified' developers
themselves.
