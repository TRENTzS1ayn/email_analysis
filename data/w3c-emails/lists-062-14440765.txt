Andrew,

Although RNIB has been reported as being involved with this we weren't
actually at the meeting where this was discussed and agreed so our input
at this stage has been negligable.

It is probably best to contact the chair of the group, Leonie Watson of
Nomensa at lw@nomensa.com for further information.

Best regards

2 million people in the UK experience sight loss or blindness. Poor
design prevents many disabled people from getting the most from the web.

Did anyone pick up the proposal for developer certification in the UK?
See http://www.bwdma.com/403 & http://www.icdri.org/News/bwdma.htm

"The first ever accessibility accreditation scheme for suppliers of web
design services is to launch early next year. The scheme has been
developed by the recently formed accessibility and usability working
group of the British Web Design and Marketing Association (BWDMA).  The
accreditation will enable the digital industry to identify qualified
suppliers in what is a legally essential requirement for all companies
on the web."

Does anyone know anything about this? What will be the basis for
certification?

A quick look indicates they to employ some 'certified' developers
themselves.

Andrew
