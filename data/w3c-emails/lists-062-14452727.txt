I have been reluctant to report Outreach when it is specific to the US's
Section 508 standards.  However, during the working group call this AM,
other participants mentioned it so the following are some issues we are
struggling with and I am certain the issues are global.   My office was a
nominee for the award mentioned in the last article (see page two of the
Press Release) (we lost L) and we had a booth (called a POD) at the
Interagency Disability Educational Awareness Showcase (IDEAS) convention for
both days.  Talked to a lot of vendors who also had PODs displaying their
latest and greatest.  Lots more at:  <http://www.gcn.com/accessibility/>
