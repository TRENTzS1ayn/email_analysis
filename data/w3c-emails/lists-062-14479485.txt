Because I am chairing the "Web site Usability and Accessibility for 
Government" conference in Ottawa, Ontario this week I will have to miss 
Friday's conference call.

Also a late outreach update: The week of November 24 I participated in the 
Dagstuhl Seminar on "e-Accessibility: new Devices, new Technologies and new 
Challenges in the Information Society" held in Germany.  The conference was 
organized by, among others, our colleague Carlos Velasco.  The Web access 
world was well represented by such people as Jutta Treviranus, Helen 
Petrie, Gottfried Zimmermann, Janina Sajak and others.  See 
http://www.dagstuhl.de/03481/ for details of what went on.

Regards,
