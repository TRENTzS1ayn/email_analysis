> An agenda for our 12 December 2003 teleconference follows.
> 3. WAI Site Redesign Project report and discussion

Dear EOWG folks,

The WAI Site Task Force (WSTF) is completing the vision analysis, user
analysis, and task analysis. We are particularly eager for EOWG to
review the vision statement, the user roles list, the task list, and the
WAI site contents list to help ensure that they are comprehensive and
that they represent EOWG's perspective.

We have over an hour in the upcoming teleconference to discuss the
WSTF's work, which provides time to discuss your questions and input on
the process and the documents, yet does not leave time for you to read
all of the documents during the meeting. Feel free to send comments
before the meeting to the list, or have them prepared for discussion in
the teleconference.

Please review the following documents in preparation for the WAI Site
Redesign Project report and discussion at the upcoming EOWG
teleconference.

WAI Site Task Force (WSTF) is using in redesign

important one is missing

f. WAI Site Contents List

Looking forward to your feedback!
