Nice work, simplify repetitive references to Rubin   .... Rubin ibid.

    * is welcoming, encourages visitors to use the site; draws people in - 
into the site, into WAI process, into Web accessibility
too much "into"  another bullet list level instead.

"Managers and assistants to managers" -- Managers and their staff

A group that isn't clearly covered is those who trust their software 
(Microsoft Word for example)
to make their html web pages. Possibly an amateur, say working for a 
non-profit organization,
who has only secondarily the task of making a web-page. Good luck. Need to 
point to
where help is available.

Suggest put the table coding before the table to which it applies.

Politics aside, Dean has an effective and important popular use of his 
website.

     http://www.deanforamerica.com/

where most accessibility issues have been addressed. I'm not prepared to 
write about
politicians, though this is an important example. It is a bit format-heavy 
-- as noted by WAVE 3.0.

[By the way, the write-up of WAVE is quite dated in the resources page.].

Suggest some grouping of the task list, and link to user matrix row that 
explains it.

Nice way to show the site with its top-level links. Is its generation from 
a public tool?
