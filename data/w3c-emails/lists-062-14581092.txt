The "fallacy" of accessibility as dealing only with taking content from the 
Web rather than including a strong statement about being able to put 
content onto the Web must not be perpetuated in any definition. What I'm 
trying to say is that "Web Accessibility is the process of making Web 
content in a way that can be used, without issue or consequence, by people 
with disabilities" is necessary but not sufficient. PWD are not passive 
consumers of "broadcast" top-down information, they must also have access 
to the means of production.
