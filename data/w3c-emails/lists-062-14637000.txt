At the end of the teleconference last week we had a scribes meeting and
agreed on a rotating scribe schedule. The scribes list, notes on how it
works, and tips for scribes is at:
http://jigteam.w3.org/WAI/EO/2003/scribes.html

To navigate to the scribes page:
1. from the WAI EO home page ( http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/ ), the end of
the Meetings and Minutes section, click "Minutes from previous meetings"
3. from the Minutes page, in the related pages navigation at the top,
click "scribes list"
(the link to the minute template is there, too)

Elizabeth, Libby, Chuck: If you have any questions or concerns, please
feel free to e-mail or call me in January.

Best,

~ Shawn
