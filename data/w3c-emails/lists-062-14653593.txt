Here are the most interesting points of the new italian law:

1 - Tha law is applied to public administrations, public and
telecommunication services with state  partecipation web sites

2 - In a time of 90 days, implementing regulations will be developed and
published, under the control of many associations (people with disabilities
associations, web developers association - IWA/HWG). These rules will be
based on the European Union accessibility guidelines; these guidelines
enforce all states to adopt WCAG 1.0 AA guidelines. So, this law is based
upon WCAG 1.0 :-)

3 - A control commission is going to be created (90 days max); this
commission will apply the guidelines on the public administration web sites,
and also on those private ones whose managers who will ask for its "opinion"

4 - Should any organization involved in this law not apply the rules, all
the contracts which do not contemplate web accessibility as a structural
requirement will be considerated as not existent, they will be  simply
cancelled, and the manager will be considered fully responsable for the
damage occurred to his organization.

Oggetto: Approved italian law on accessibility


Today is a good day for web accessibility: in Italy, we have a brand new law
concerning accessibility which enforces pubblic administrations websites to
be accessibile.

I've had the pleasure to work with Roberto Scano and two italian deputates
(Campa and Palmieri) in writing the first law draft in jan 2003; then the
technology Minister (Lucio Stanca) has presented his own law  proposal, but
has fully accepted our addings and editings.

My best regards,
