Dec 17, Presentation by Dr William Gribbons and Beth Loring
of Bentley College, where they offer a MS in Human Factors

Their program includes usability and accessibility.

Topics of their presentation included considerations of low literacy, and
of aging on use of internet.

I expect that the STC will post their powerpoint presentation slides,
which including many good ideas. I'll post it when I learn where it is.

The US Department of Education estimated that 40 to 44 Million
US Adults are left behind because of low literacy. They have no advocates.
Few will ever improve.  70% of prison population are learning disabled.
For writing to be understandable to 90% of the population, write at the
third grade level.

They have a sub-group on accessibility, Boston-IA (Information Architecture,
on Internet Accessibility.)

PJ Gardner heads this group:

     adaptive technologies
     comparison of Section 508 and WCAG 1.0
     selected accessibility links (including WAI)

Waltham will be Mike Paciello, on

     "Usability Test Methods for Accessible Interface Design"
