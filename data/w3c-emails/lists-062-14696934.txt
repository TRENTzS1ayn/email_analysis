This is something that we have discussed many times in EOWG and other parts 
of WAI. Given that the requirements of people with disabilities are so 
often overlooked when one is addressing the needs of "all" users, WAI does, 
in fact, focus specifically on accessibility of the Web for people with 
disabilities and for others such as elderly who sometimes have related 
functional requirements, but may or may not consider themselves "disabled."

However, the business case supporting Web accessibility is indeed very 
broad, and includes many benefits to non-disabled as well as to disabled 
users. The example that you cite -- having only a low-bandwidth connection, 
while using a dial-up modem, and therefore benefitting from certain aspects 
of accessible design -- is a good example of an "auxiliary benefit" of Web 
accessibility. There are many such examples, and this is why the business 
case for Web accessibility is so broad.

You say "all WCAG guidelines are designed to prevent frustration in all of 
us, ..." To clarify this, WCAG guidelines are designed to meet the 
requirements of people with disabilities; but they have the additional 
benefit of increasing usability for all users.
