EOWG:

Please take a look at the updated draft of "Why Standards Harmonization is 
Essential to Web Accessibility."
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/standard-harmon.html

I cut the overall length by 25%; re-shuffled the order; eliminated and/or 
re-integrated some sections; and tried to shorten most of the long 
sentences. I didn't work straight from the change log but will go back over 
it later.

There are still some redundancies that I was not able to shake out of the 
document yet.... perhaps we can give points in the EOWG teleconference 
today for every redundancy that anyone can find...

Talk to you soon,

- Judy
