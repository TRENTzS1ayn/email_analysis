Following up on Helle's comment:

Overview, Paragraph. 4: to reduce redundancy and clarify the sentence... my
suggestion is:

Standards harmonization helps drive improvement of tools to evaluate
accessibility: better evaluation tools can speed the repair of Web sites.

Comment to section 4 in the Overview chapter:

"Standards harmonization likewise helps drive improvement of tools to
evaluate Web site accessibility, which helps improve the accessibility of
Web sites. It enables sharing of implementation and training resources for
Web accessibility. It enables the development of shareable knowledge
repositories from which one can develop accessible and re-usable online
learning modules."

I'm not sure I understand the meaning of this, maybe it's just the word
"likewise". I'm not comfortable with the first sentence and not quite sure I
understand it. Let's talk about it on the call.
Cheers

EOWG:

Please take a look at the updated draft of "Why Standards Harmonization is 
Essential to Web Accessibility."
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/standard-harmon.html
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/standard-harmon.html> 

I cut the overall length by 25%; re-shuffled the order; eliminated and/or 
re-integrated some sections; and tried to shorten most of the long 
sentences. I didn't work straight from the change log but will go back over 
it later.

There are still some redundancies that I was not able to shake out of the 
document yet.... perhaps we can give points in the EOWG teleconference 
today for every redundancy that anyone can find...

Talk to you soon,

- Judy
