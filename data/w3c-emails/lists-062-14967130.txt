Notes for reviewing the business case resource suite and status as of 2
April 2004 follow.

STATUS
The status of all 5 pages is:
- ready for final content review (questions below)
- will do copyediting after content finalized
- recent changelog items and comments sent by e-mail not yet
incorporated (per below)

Focus questions for content review:
* does the format work?
* are the topics covered appropriately in the appropriate
section?
* is the content accurate? does it pass "reality check"?
* is any statement likely to be misinterpreted negatively?
* are there comments we might get from outside reviewers that we
want to address now?

1. www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/Overview.html Overview
2. www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/soc.html Social Factors
3. www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/tech.html Technical Factors
4. www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/fin.html Financial Factors
5. www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/pol.html Legal & Policy Factors

In order to facilitate reviewing, documents will remain stable through 7
April; that is, there will not be any changes posted until after
Wednesday. Status changes and additional review notes will be recorded
in the changelog at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/changelog#review


PENDING EDITS
Pending edits are in the changelog and in the mail archives. Notable
pending edits include:

1. all pages: change title to Developing a Web Accessibility Business
Case for Your Organization:...

2. all sub-pages: Identifying [xyz] Factors for a Specific Organization
("questions") section: streamline so mostly just includes the
explanation of question, to provide conceptual support, but not get
bogged down

3. Social Factors: examine discussion of CSR so more on action, not on
appearance - and also not financial factors

Other pending edits in the changelog start at:

COMMENTS AND LISTS
Please send comments by Wednesday 7 April 2004 to the appropriate list:

these lists, since the list setup has changed.)
