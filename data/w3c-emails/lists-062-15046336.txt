I am responding to the questions that Shawn posed on April 2, 2004. I really
like format and I think that the topics are in the appropriate sections.
Here are a few suggestions:

On the page: http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/Overview.html
Should the term "custom" be used in the heading "Developing a Custom
Business Case"? If we want to use this meaning, then the word should be
"customized." But, I don't think that this section speaks to "customized."
It addresses the business case in various environments. 

On the page: http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/tech.html
The heading says "Enable Content on Different Configurations." But the text
below the heading says "in different configurations." Which is correct "on"
or "in"?

On the page: http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/tech.html
Beneath the heading "Be Prepared for Advanced Technologies," change "as
follows" to "such as" or "for example."

On the page: http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/fin.html
Change the heading "Decreases cost of translating" to "Decreases Costs of
Translations."

http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/fin.html
Suggest change heading "What stage is the organization's development?" to
"At which stage is the organization's development?" or "When should
organizations address accessibility?"
