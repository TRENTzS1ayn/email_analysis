Hi group,

On april 8th, I've spoken 30 minutes in Lugano about Web standards and Web
accessibility, during the "Lugano Communication Forum"
http://www.ti-info.ch/gio_lcf.asp

It was not a very crowded conference, but I was told that Web accessibility
is not well known in Switzerland. 

Anyway, it has been a good occasion to talk about W3C, WAI and WCAG
guidelines.

My best regards,

Roberto Castaldo
