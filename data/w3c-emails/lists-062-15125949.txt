On April 8th I gave a half-hour presentation on the state of WCAG 2.0 to 
Government of Canada Web managers to help allay rising concerns over future 
transition issues.  I drew examples and supporting information from the 
publicly available WCAG 2.0 drafts, 2.0 requirement document, planned 
working draft announcement, and supplemented those with some general 
background on WCAG 1.0 and an overview of W3C Recommendation-track 
process.  I called strongly for a concerted effort to comment on the March 
11 public working draft (if possible), and absolutely on the anticipated 
June draft.

Regards,
Chuck Letourneau
