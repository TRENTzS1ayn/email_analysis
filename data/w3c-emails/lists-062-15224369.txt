I don't understand what Henk is proposing.  The draft WAI-Glossary 
[http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/Glossary/printable.html] already contains [all] 
the terms included in the list he provided.  Is the suggestion to extract 
that subset of terms into a separate reference document?  I admit I have 
not been a party to any of the discussions about the Glossary so perhaps I 
am missing some context.
