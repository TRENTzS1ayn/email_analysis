EOWG,

Below is a proposal for the business case acknowledgements, which we
will discuss on the teleconference.

At the last teleconference we discussed having the acknowledgements a
separate page that is linked from the bottom of each page in the
resource suite. In it we would list people who wrote sections of the
suite or provided written feedback during the document development. We
would not link to the EOWG participants in good standing list since that
does not reflect who worked on the document in the past, and the list
will change in the future.

The main question is: Who is missing from the list below? 

Regards,

~ Shawn
