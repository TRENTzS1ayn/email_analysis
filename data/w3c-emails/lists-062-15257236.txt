Under the heading "Tabbing through structural elements (scenario -- ", it is stated that:
1. "...one strategy for rapidly scanning through links, headers, list items, or other structural items on a Web page is to use the tab key to go through the items in sequence." 
Comments:
- As I know, whether one is using  AT or not, one can only tab through anchors (hyperlinks) and form controls  on a page and not to headers, list items, or other structural items .

2.  Refer to next statement :"People who are using screen readers -- whether because they are blind or dyslexic -- may tab through items on
a page, as well as people using voice recognition."
- the statement needs to be reconstructed so that "people using voice recognition" is listed before the words "may tab through".
