Hello Allan,
But the doc specifically  refers to the  tab key. With screen readers too one can jump to headings, lists, tables etc using alphabet keys or number keys but that is not "tabbing through the doc". That's why I made the suggestion.

  Opera allows the user to do what Internet Explorer does with the Tab key 
  (with the A and Q keys) but also through section headings using the S and W 
  keys. Whether readers of the document will know this is another matter.
