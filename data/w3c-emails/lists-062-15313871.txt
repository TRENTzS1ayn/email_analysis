I have always liked that quote.  Now that Tim is back in the worldwide news 
with his recent honour of the Millennium Technology Prize it seems a good 
idea to keep the reminder of his feelings on the site - the home page seems 
right to me.  I sometimes wish the year he made the quote was included in 
the citation --  I believe it was in 1997 for the WCAG 1.0 release.  I 
suggest this because people keep reprinting the quote and on one occasion I 
have seen it dated as if Tim just said it this year.

Also, for clarification, by "above the fold" do you mean "on the first 
screen-page" (i.e. before scrolling)?

If so, I think it should remain "above the fold".
