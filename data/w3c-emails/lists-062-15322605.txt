The straw proposal above doesn't really roll off my tongue.  It seems kind 
of stiff and formal (especially if we are looking for "pizzazz").  Most of 
the other suggestions I found on the list (clipped below) use "accessible" 
or "accessibility" a lot. Only Shawn's two suggestions manage to use it 
only once (twice if you expand the A in WAI).

I kind of like Carol's first sentence: "WAI is your resource for Web 
accessibility." (Charmane's plug for it being the "primary" resource is 
perhaps too bold... I agree it should be, but can we be 100% certain it 
is/will be?)  Once the site is redesigned and effective it may be "Your 
BEST resource" <grin>.

Sadly, I can't seem to craft a pizzazzy alternative myself so for the 
moment I guess I favour Shawn's second suggestion (the one with the linked 
bullets).  She tell us what WAI is in the first sentence - without being 
too pedantic - and provides practical links to what the site contains in 
the remainder.
