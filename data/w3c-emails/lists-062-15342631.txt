I think highlights can be effective and interesting - if you are interested 
in Web accessibility writ-large and not just visiting to look for some 
specific resource.  I am a user of the site that is interested in the 
view-from-space, but not many of the web developers I deal with regularly 
are.  So, when you develop the user-customizable "My WAI Home Page" I will 
certainly include the "highlights".  I like all of the highlight 
suggestions you included in the discussion note.
