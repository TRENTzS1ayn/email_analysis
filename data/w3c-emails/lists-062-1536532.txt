The second requires judgement. It includes accessibility evaluation, 
identification of problems, and assessment of site acceptability. It is
significantly more work, in that there may be many judgement calls.
When compounded with integrating the differences in accessibility among
URIs on the same site, it needs a comprehensive evaluation. I'd not
hide the fact. Rather I'd clearly limit the preliminary review to the
"black and white" cases that assessment tools can clearly resolve.

I prefer this to keep the distinction clear.
