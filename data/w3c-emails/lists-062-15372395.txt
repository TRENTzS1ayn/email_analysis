1. WAI site "purpose"
A "straw proposal":
WAI provides guidelines and resources to make the Web accessible to people
with disabilities. WAI is an international collaborative forum to help Web
content providers, Web software developers, business and policy leaders, and
others create an accessible Web.

Roberto:
I'm not sure I agree with the suggestion of creating some kind of
description text on the WAI page explaining what WAI does; if we really
decide to do, it should, in my opinion, be very attractive, and give users
some more reasons to go on and visiting WAI's web site; that's why I think
that the "straw proposal" I've read tends to be too "distant" from the user
and doesn't catch him at first sight. 

We should be able to build up an appealing sentence, basing itself on the
concept that accessibility is a fundamental part of the web universality.


Shawn:
2. Quote on WAI home page
The current WAI home page (http://www.w3.org/WAI/) has in a prominent top
position this quote: "The power of the Web is in its universality.
Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect." -- Tim
Berners-Lee, W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web


Roberto:
That quote is attractive, world famous and it's been translated in every
language; Tim's quote has become the best WAI's testimonial in many
accessibility web sites all over the world.

That quote is, in my opinion, the best we could ever create and should
positioned immediatly under "Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)" text, as it
represent the best WAI's welcome to the user, and moreover offers
universality and accessibility ideas in the right order. 


Shawn:
3. Highlights on WAI home page


Roberto:
Highlights may be a great tool to make people know the great quantity of
resources WAI's web site offers and to keep users informed about new
resources, new policies and so on.


My best regards,
