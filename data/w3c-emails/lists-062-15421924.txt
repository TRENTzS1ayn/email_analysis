I saw on the change log that I was supposed to send something to the 
list about content management systems being problematic for standards 
harmonization. I do not recall for sure what that was about. Huge 
apologies but here is what I think is the issue in my opinion.

Content management systems set up templates that allow certain users 
to change only the content. That way the templates and certain items 
that are common across the site are not inadvertently changed. This 
is true in very large and expensive content management systems as 
well as very inexpensive and user-friendly systems.  The problematic 
issue is this. The accessibility must be properly coded into the 
template and the style sheet. If that is not done then every page is 
theoretically going to be not accessible.

We have one unit on campus that purchased a very expensive content 
management system that, for some reason, have the templates changed, 
and is not able to make it compatible with lower end browsers or 
accessible in certain ways. It would seem that it could be changed 
but then the question could be at what cost to the owner.

Some accessibility is coded in the style sheet, some in the template, 
some in the content, some in the data base, etc. How the content is 
to be delivered may drive how the accessibility is set up and who 
would have to take responsibility for it in the development process. 
Canned templates are helpful only to the degree that they would allow 
the users to insert accessibility coding.

If this is off target, my apologies....
