EOWG:

There is now an updated and copy-edited version of "Why Standards 
Harmonization is Essential to Web Accessibility" available for review and 
discussion at our 7 May teleconference and on the EOWG list following the 
meeting.
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/standard-harmon.html

It incorporates almost all the change requests from recent EOWG meetings, 
though a few change requests need additional discussion:
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/standard-harmon-changelog.html

Most sections have been significantly copy-edited for readability and flow, 
but with no substantial changes in meaning.

This is likely close to its final form, so please review it carefully over 
the next few days. Note that this is still not intended for circulation, 
but should be soon.

Thank you,

- Judy
