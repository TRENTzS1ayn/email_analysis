Yes, agreed. I think it gives an important message.

  Andrew,

  I'm wondering, though, whether that wouldn't just leave people more likely
  to pick the first one ("well we'll just use the preliminary review
  approach, since comprehensive evaluation looks excessive, like another
  animal entirely").

  I'm tempted to call the first one "preliminary review" and the second one
  simply "evaluation" -- in other words, the second one is the only approach
  that properly evaluates a site.
