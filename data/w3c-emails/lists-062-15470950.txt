Regrets

Actually I am in Padova where (6-8 of May) there is the Webbit 2004
http://www.webb.it, the most important italian web related exhibition, where
IWA/HWG Italy will have a large stand and will have 39 conferences, 15 of
them concerning Web accessibility. A great occasion to divulgate
accessibility and meet people.

I'm going to have two conferences, i'll keep the grout updated about.

My best regards,

Roberto Castaldo
