In better flowing text Sailesh wrote (see original 28 April version at
bottom):

She uses the speech output, combined with navigation by headings (3.5) on a
page, to quickly orient herself to the contents and its structure  for
rapid scanning of a document, and has become accustomed to listening to
speech output at a speed that her co-workers cannot understand at all. She
uses refreshable braille output to check the exact wording of text, since
braille enables her to read the language on a page more precisely.

She uses special key combinations of the screen reader that makes it [the
screen reader] announce the title (13.2) of every unfamiliar page that
loads. It also reads other information like number of links, headings and
forms on the page  that helps her determine a navigation strategy. She tabs
through the links on a page or often uses a feature of the screen reader to
list all the links and then uses first letter navigation to quickly   get
to the one she needs to. She can do this because the targets of every link
is terse and clearly identified. (13.1) Much of the information on the Web
documents used at her company is in data-tables, which can sometimes be
difficult for non-visual users to read. However, since the tables on this
company's documents are marked up clearly with column and row headers ( 5.1
and 5.2) and captions and summaries (5.5) which her screen reader can
access, she easily orients herself to the information in the tables.

Her daily tasks include usinng Web based forms  to enter  journal entries
into the company's accounting system. She knows what data she needs to
enter in each input box as she tabs through them as their field labels are
read out to her because the labels are explicitly associated with the
controls. (12.4) Since the insurance codes she must frequently reference
include a number of abbreviations and acronyms, she finds the expansions of
abbreviations and acronyms the first time they appear on a page allows her
to better catch the meaning of the short versions of these terms. (4.2)

As one of the more senior members of the accounting staff, Ms. Laitenen
must frequently help newer employees with their questions. She has recently
upgraded to a browser that allows better synchronization of the screen
display with audio and braille rendering of that information. This enables
her to better help her colleagues, since the screen shows her colleagues
the same part of the document that she is reading with speech or braille
output.

I suggest that Accountant with blindness be redone to bring out more
clearly how a blind user  surfs the Web. It refers  to more checkpoints
(listed at end). Of course if it is acceptable then it can be  put in the
format as the rest of the personna.
Rewrite of Accountant with blindness:

She uses the speech output, combined with
navigating by headings (3.5)on a page , to quickly orient herself to the
contents and its

structure  for rapid scanning of a document, and has become accustomed to
listening to

speech output at a speed that her co-workers cannot understand at all. She
uses
refreshable braille output to check the exact wording of text, since
braille enables her to

read the language on a page more precisely.
She uses special key combinations of the screen reader that makes it
announce the

title(13.2) of every unfamiliar page that loads. It also reads other
information like number

of links, headings and forms on the page  that helps her determine a
navigation strategy.

She tabs through the links on a page or often uses a feature of the screen
reader to   list

all the links and then uses first letter navigation to quickly   get to the
one she needs

to. She can do this because the targets of every link is terse and clearly
identified.

(13.1)
Much of the information on the Web documents used at her company is in
data-tables, which

can sometimes be difficult for non-visual users to read. However, since
the tables on this company's documents are
marked up clearly with
column and row headers ( 5.1 and 5.2) and
captions and summaries (5.5)
which her screen reader can access, she easily orients herself to the
