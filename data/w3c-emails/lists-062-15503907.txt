Harmonized standards, and authoring tools and browser [should be plural?] 
conforming to those standards,

Effective interoperability with assistive technologies is necessarily 
[shouldn't be an adverb?] for users of specialized technologies to be 
[strike "be"?] know when there is accessibility information or features 
available on Web pages and to be able to interact with that information.

...continued obligation to maintain and update those guidelines into the 
future. [I think "into the future" after "into" is sort of clumsy, implying 
that the guidelines are somehow "placed" into something called "the future"?]

... this can lead to more widespread Web accessibility at an earlier date. 
[slight confusion - perhaps "...widespread and sooner..."?]
