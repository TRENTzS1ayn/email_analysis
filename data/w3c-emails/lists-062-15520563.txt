Hi group,

as I told some days ago, I've been in Padua (Webbit 2004 http://www.webb.it
the most important italian web related exhibition) where IWA/HWG Italy has
had a large stand and hold 39 conferences, 15 of them concerning Web
accessibility. 

I've had two conferences: 

1 - "Teaching Web Accessibility"; I spoke about creating didactic paths and
how to biuld up a good course concerning accessibility; I widely based my
speech on the WAI resources, with particular focus on "Curriculum on Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines" and "Planning Web Accessibility Training",
and on the great job we're making in the E&O working group.

2 - "Web Standards for the enterprises";  I spoke about all benefits an
enterprise can count on by adopting W3C standards in creating and managing
theis web sites.

My best regards,

Roberto Castaldo
