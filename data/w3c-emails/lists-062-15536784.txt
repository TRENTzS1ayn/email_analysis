EOWG,

Please be prepared to discuss the issues below at the EOWG
teleconference on Friday 14 May. Feel free to comment on the list ahead
of time, especially if you are not able to attend the teleconference.

Regards,
~ Shawn for the WAI Site Task Force (WSTF)


At the 30 April teleconference we discussed a purpose statement for the
redesigned WAI home page. Please review the e-mail introducing that
discussion at: 

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-eo/2004AprJun/0044.html
Minutes from the meeting are available at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/2004/0430

Rather than a long purpose statement, we came up with a nice, short
tagline: "strategies, guidelines, and resources to make the Web
accessible to people with disabilities" 
Below are two additional items for discussion.

1. one or two short sentences answering, "What is WAI?" 

notes:
- will probably be near the tagline, don't need to repeat that
information
- will be with a link "About WAI" that would go to the page with lots
more details

drafts:

* short version: WAI, a W3C domain, is an international forum for
collaboration.

* longer version: The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) is an
international forum for collaboration between industry, disability
organizations, accessibility researchers, government, and others
interested in Web accessibility. WAI is part of the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C).

===

3. one or two short sentences about participating in WAI

notes:
- will be with a link that would go to the page with lots more details
- one purpose is to help debunk the myth that WAI is a closed
organization
- there is a separate section listing sponsors and linking to more
information on sponsoring

drafts:

* more formal version: WAI welcomes participation from individuals and
organizations around the world. Participation opportunities range from
reviewing, implementing, and promoting guidelines to participating in a
working group as a W3C member organization.

* casual "you" version: There are many opportunities for you to
participate in WAI, from implementing WAI guidelines to contributing
techniques to a working group.

related question:
- should the link be "Participating in WAI" or other?
