Hi group,

Here are my first impressions about the proposals and the draft Shawn sent:

The tagline "strategies, guidelines, and resources to make the Web
accessible to people with disabilities" sounds direct and not too formal,
but I'd prefer a more involving and attractive one; maybe those will be the
first words any user will read about WAI, so they are the most important,
and we should be able to make the user feel the scent of all he's going to
find inside our site.

I've no extraordinary idea at the moment, but we could follow the "you"
version: "Here you will find strategies, guidelines, and resources to make
the Web accessible to people with disabilities"

> * short version: WAI, a W3C domain, is an international forum for
collaboration.

I don't like it, I find this sentence ice-cold (I hope my english is not too
ugly)

> * longer version: The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) is an
international forum for collaboration between industry, disability
organizations, accessibility researchers, government, and others interested
in Web accessibility. WAI is part of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

This sounds better to me than the short one.

> 3. one or two short sentences about participating in WAI

If one of our purposes is to help debunk the myth that WAI is a closed
organization, we should take the user by the hand and talk to him in a very
direct, warm and attractive way; that's why I prefer the casual "you"
version, and that's why the link "Partecipating in WAI" may be substituted
by: 

"Take part to WAI" or 
"Be part of WAI"
"Be involved in WAI" or more simply,
"Join WAI"


My best regards
