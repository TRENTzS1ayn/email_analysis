EOWG:

There is a newly updated version of "Why Standards Harmonization is 
Essential to Web Accessibility" available for review and discussion at our 
14 May 2004 teleconference and on the EOWG list following the meeting.

Note that it is substantially reorganized and appears at a DIFFERENT URI:
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/standard-harmon1.html
The previous draft is available at the regular URI for comparison
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/standard-harmon.html

It incorporates almost all change requests from our last EOWG meeting, 
though a few change requests need additional discussion:
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/standard-harmon-changelog.html

Note that this is still not intended for circulation, but should be soon.

Thank you,

- Judy
