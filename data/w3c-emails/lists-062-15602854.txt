Although I'm not a "member in good standing" I would like to note that the 
current draft is in the "OK but" category.

I think the last two bullets under "current situation" are not parallel 
with the five preceding ones and should be "teased out" in some fashion.

I think somewhere should be an explanation of just what "evaluation tools" 
are, even though it should be clear from the context, since they seem from 
the document to be central to the issues, but may not be well understood - 
and because there are no W3C guidelines for them.

Oh, step 5 has a gratuitous "g" after its full stop.

I also find that within the writing style that is adopted for this document 
it flows very nicely and has an essential completeness/coherence that help 
make it easy to read for what I take to be its intended audience. It could 
also form the basis for a sort of "contest" to see if it could be 
"almost-monosyllabized" as an exercise in conforming to the clear/simple 
guideline.
