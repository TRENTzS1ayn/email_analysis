Okay, but recommend the following changes:

  6. Redirect energies from development of parallel standards to 
building awareness and providing implementation support for Web 
accessibility  ***[add " initiatives discussed above" or something to 
that effect].

Otherwise the sentence seems to support web accessibility generically 
not W3C WAI efforts specifically.

Otherwise, I think the document is very cogent and gets very high 
marks on a very tough subject!
