Hello Judy and all,

After a careful re-reading of the document, my vote is:
>         2. Okay, but recommend the following changes


1. In the "overview" section, at the end of the third paragraph, the 
following sentence is too long and needs several times reading for me to be 
understood. Is it possible to make it shorter and easier to understand?
"Widespread availability of improved authoring tools can enable accessible 
design to become the prevailing design mode even for Web developers 
initially unaware of
the need for accessibility or disinclined to learn guidelines and 
techniques for achieving accessibility."
2. In the section "Web developers", I have a problem with following 
sentence in the second paragraph:
"For instance, inconsistent initial support in browsers for Cascading Style 
Sheet (CSS) features
such as CSS positioning led many Web developers to rely on less accessible 
design solutions for layout for many years."
Proposed rewording:
For instance, for many years inconsistent initial support in browsers for 
Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) features,
such as CSS positioning, led many Web developers to rely on less accessible 
design solutions for layout.

3. In information repositories, first paragraph, I have difficulties 
unerstanding the following setence because of its length:
"If the content in an information repository conforms to a consistent 
accessibility standard, then that content can be shared among an unlimited 
number of users, and re-purposed and personalized according to user 
profiles which may include information on prefered learning styles and the 
accessibility requirements of users with disabilities."


Regards

Sylvie
