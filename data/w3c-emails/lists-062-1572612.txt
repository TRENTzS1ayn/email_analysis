Brian Hardy and I met with Charles McCathieNeville earlier this week and
discussed the possiblities of a 2-day Web Accessibility
workshop/conference/seminars in November 2001 if the WCAG w/gp meets in
Melbourne. Vision Australia Foundation would be very keen to be involved in
assisting to oganise and stage an event of this nature.

Charles also filled me in on the other activities currently underway across
WAI, which was greatly appreciated, and we exchanged ideas on assessment,
tools, implementation, etc.

Vision Australia Foundation has also had discussions recently with several
Usability firms about the close relationship between usability and
accessability and opportunties for future collaboration.
