One problem is that a confusing array of so-called accessibility
'standards' can be difficult for non-specialist organisations to evaluate,
said Tom Adams, senior digital media consultant at the Office of the e-
Envoy (OeE -
http://www.e-envoy.gov.uk). "
Although the World Wide
Web Consortium's Web Accessibility Initiative guidelines
[http://www.w3.org/WAI] have become the de facto international
standard for accessibility, they were only ever intended as guidelines
and as such are open to interpretation," he said. While the OeE has
produced its own guidelines on accessibility
(
http://www.e-envoy.gov.uk/webguidelines.htm),
based on standards
such as e-GIF and the WAI guidelines, he admitted that "we, like
everyone else, are slow in adopting and adhering to the guidelines."
