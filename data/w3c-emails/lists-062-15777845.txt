Judy,
Use of term "fragmentation":
I know we discussed this but  I am still uncomfortable with its use.
Example: Under Sec 508  standards, there are sections covering  software apps, Web content, etc. If they were  made into separate standards, I would regard it as fragmentation.
Likewise, can it be argued separation of the trio into separate docs - WCAG, UAAG and ATAG is fragmentation? In fact accessibility depends on interplay of content, browser behavior and assistive tech  features and an accessibility guideline should encompass all of them.
When different countries or orgs come up with their standards, it is true they depend heavily on W3C recommendations  / guidelines  and adopt a lot of their content.
They may add some  items into the standards that are not in the WCAG or choose to exclude some  checkpoints. 
But  in the end their respective docs are regarded  by them as the complete standards for their own purposes.
So I consider these to be "multiple standards" and not fragmentation.
