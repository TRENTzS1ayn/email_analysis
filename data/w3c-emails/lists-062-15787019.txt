Dear EOWG members,

WAI-EO is planning to have a 'WAI-Glossary' to explain words used in
WAI documents that might be difficult to understand by readers of
several countries and backgrounds. 

For the discussion in next teleconference here is a draft of the
sub-glossary requirements with some A/B choices we have to choose
between or take both we will see.

Regards,
Henk

A. Requirements for a concise "WAI sub glossary"
B. or is "Introduction to (common) WAI terms/words" a better name?

Status of this document
This is a second draft of the requirements for a concise WAI sub
glossary (26-05-04)

Introduction
The WAI has a glossary of terms at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/Glossary/printable.
The purpose of that glossary is to allow comparison of definitions, and
potentially to provide a single glossary for all the accessibility
guidelines. The various WAI working groups and individual readers of
more than one guideline will benefit from a consistent use of terms.
The WAI glossary contains more then 500 words in total. 
A. The Education and Outreach Working Group is considering composing an
"introduction to common WAI terms" containing only approximately 30-40
most common words or concepts as a quick introduction to newcomers to
web accessibility.
B. The Education and Outreach Working Group is considering composing an
"extended explanation for complex WAI terms" containing only
approximately 30-40 most common words or concepts as a aid to non-native
English speakers and to translators of WAI documents.

Primary audience
- Readers of WAI documents not yet familiar with web accessibility and
its terms. 
- Readers of several countries and different backgrounds having
problems with the translation of not common words or phrases.

Secondary audience
- Translators of WAI documents? (or do they need the full glossary
anyway)
- Readers who are not familiar with some US-English terms.

purpose
A. The purpose of a WAI sub glossary is to explain common words used in
WAI documents that might be difficult to understand:
- to readers who are not familiar with most common accessibility words
or terms.
- to readers of several countries and backgrounds whose primary
language is not English. 

B. The purpose of a WAI sub glossary is to aid translators who may have
trouble with some of the less common, or more technical terms used in
the original WAI documents.


Approach
To decide what words should be in the glossary the following approach
can be used:
- Words not findable in a general dictionary
- Words with a (WAI) specific or contextual meaning
- Words with synonyms in non-US English languages

scope
- Words occurring in top ten of most read (beginners) WAI documents

Content 
The sub glossary will contain:
- Entry: word or term
- Origin: context or document(s) containing the entry
- Description: 

Format for Listings
Basic format:
Word or term [context or document(s) containing the word]
Description

Example

Device-dependent [WCAG20] 
Used to describe event handlers that require a specific kind of input
device. For example, onDblClick requires a mouse; there is no keyboard
equivalent for double clicking. Input devices may include pointing
devices (such as the mouse), keyboards, braille devices, head wands,
microphones, and others. Output devices may include monitors, speech
synthesizers, and braille devices. Scripting should be
device-independent or provide multiple input and output options for
different devices.

Audio Description also called described video or video description
[UAAG10]
An audio description (called an "auditory description" in the Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 [WCAG10]) is either a prerecorded
human voice or a synthesized voice (recorded or generated dynamically)
describing the key visual elements of a movie or other animation. The
audio description is synchronized with (and possibly included as part
of) the audio track of the presentation, usually during natural pauses
in the audio track. Audio descriptions include information about
actions, body language, graphics, and scene changes.
