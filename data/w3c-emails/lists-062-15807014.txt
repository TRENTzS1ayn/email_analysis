Hello,

Earlier this week I presented a seminar to around 100 staff from the
University of Melbourne about web accessibility. including who benefits,
what the legal and policy situation is, and what the common issues are for
staff and students. The University is in the process of revising its
Disability Action Plan
(http://www.services.unimelb.edu.au/disability/laws/unipolicies/actionplan.html)
 and the Web Centre (http://www.unimelb.edu.au/webcentre/) is actively
promoting online accessibility and is in the process of updating the
University's web templates to improve their accessibility.

Andrew
