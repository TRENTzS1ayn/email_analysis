> 2. Introduction pages
>          - e-mail to be sent to list before meeting

The WAI Site Task Force (WSTF) is in the early stages of drafting new
Intro pages for the WAI site. Before we go further, we would like to
discuss the concept with EOWG.

At the upcoming teleconference we will discuss the basic concept of
Introduction pages. Most of our discussion will center on the
Requirements for Introduction Pages at:
www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/UCD/intro-pages

To help frame the discussion, we have some very early rough drafts:

- UAAG Intro page, very early rough draft of content only (without any
site navigation or style):
www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/sketchpad/uaag

- Components of Web Accessibility, requirements and very early rough
draft of content:
www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/UCD/components

- Requirements for WAI Online Overview Intro page follows:

Purpose
The purpose of this page is to introduce the HTML slide set, Online
Overview of the Web Accessibility Initiative. The slide set is an
introduction to the Web Accessibility Initiative and to web
accessibility in general.

Audience
- Primary audience for this document is anyone visiting the Web
Accessibility Initiative web site. For the most part, it is expected
that people new to web accessibility would be interested in going
through the slide set.
- Secondary audiences include people using the slide set as the basis of
their presentations in various situations or those attending conferences
and special sessions where this slide set is used as talking points.

Approach
This page will provide a page to launch the Online Overview of the Web
Accessibility slide show and related pages. The related pages
(slidemaker and all slide in one file) were not easily reached in the
past and this will consolidate the pages in one location. It also puts
the directions on how to use the slides outside of the slide set the
convenience of the user.
