Nice work. I approve, though the following  would have helped me

Nits:

Authoring tools

The  last paragraph  is properly written as subjunctive -- don't we wish AT 
were followed!
My wistful thinking/diatribe:

The excuse/alibi that AT evolution awaits WCAG 2.0 is getting stale, given 
that WCAG 1.0 has been
generally ignored. The long development cycle for  changing AT is also, as 
newer releases aren't
much improved in the tools I've tried to use.

          http://www.w3.org/WAI/translation.html
      which might be mentioned under related resources below.

I believe it needs a pointer to where in WAI to find the guidelines 
referenced throughout.
