Dear EOWG collegues,

Here a next version of the requirements for a concise "WAI sub
glossary" or "Accessibility lexicon". 
I have put the emphasis on the translators of WAI documents, but we
have still a choice to discuss about the title of the document. What
name will fit to what we want to have, without confusing people with the
existing WAI Glossary.

Regards,
Henk Snetselaar

A. Requirements for a concise "WAI sub glossary" or "Accessibility
lexicon"
B. Requirements for the document "Accessibility expressions (or
vocabulary) explained"


Status of this document
This is a third draft of the requirements for a concise WAI sub
glossary (June 2, 2004)

Introduction
The WAI has a glossary of terms at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/Glossary/printable.
The purpose of that glossary is to allow comparison of definitions, and
potentially to provide a single glossary for all the accessibility
guidelines. The various WAI working groups and individual readers of
more than one guideline will benefit from a consistent use of terms.
The WAI glossary contains more then 500 words in total. 
A. The Education and Outreach Working Group is considering composing an
"extended explanation for complex WAI terms" containing only
approximately 30-40 most common words or concepts as an aid to
translators and to non-native US-English peolple dealing with WAI
documents.

Primary audience
- Translators of WAI documents 
- Readers who are not familiar with the US-English (WAI) terms.

Secondary audience
- Readers of WAI documents not yet familiar with web accessibility and
its terms. 

purpose
The purpose of a WAI sub glossary is to aid translators by describing
the meaning of (technical) terms with a 'WAI contextual meaning' used in
the WAI documents. 
An additional purpose is to aid non-native US-English people to give
some background on specific US-English accessibility expressions.

Approach
To decide what words should be in the glossary the following approach
can be used:
- Words not findable in a general dictionary
- Words with a (WAI) specific or contextual meaning
- Words with synonyms in non-US English languages

scope
- Words occurring in top ten of most read (beginners) WAI documents

Content 
The sub glossary will contain:
- Entry: word or term
- Origin: context or document(s) containing the entry
- Description: 

Format for Listings
Basic format:
Word or term [context or document(s) containing the word]
Description

Example

Device-dependent [WCAG20] 
Used to describe event handlers that require a specific kind of input
device. For example, onDblClick requires a mouse; there is no keyboard
equivalent for double clicking. Input devices may include pointing
devices (such as the mouse), keyboards, braille devices, head wands,
microphones, and others. Output devices may include monitors, speech
synthesizers, and braille devices. Scripting should be
device-independent or provide multiple input and output options for
different devices.

Audio Description also called described video or video description
[UAAG10]
An audio description (called an "auditory description" in the Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 [WCAG10]) is either a prerecorded
human voice or a synthesized voice (recorded or generated dynamically)
describing the key visual elements of a movie or other animation. The
audio description is synchronized with (and possibly included as part
of) the audio track of the presentation, usually during natural pauses
in the audio track. Audio descriptions include information about
actions, body language, graphics, and scene changes.
