EOWG: 

I updated the appendix "Evaluating Web Sites for Accessibility"

http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/rev.html

We can discuss it on the teleconference tomorrow but comments on the list
are appreciated as well.

I believe this incorporates almost all (see changelog) requests from July
20 teleconference, as well as finishing the text in the three tips sections
at end (during development, ongoing monitoring, frozen sites).

Please review critically. We may want to circulate this soon, and we should
make sure the content of the recommended review/evaluation processes is
appropriate. Please test the approaches with a few sites if you can. 

With regard to evaluation steps, my suggestion is that we look for things
to take away, rather than to add, since the number of steps is already
high. But all comments welcome.

- Judy
