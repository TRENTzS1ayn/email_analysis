>
>Most of the changelog items have been incorporated into the business
>case and it is pretty much done. The latest version is at:
>http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/Overview
>There are just a few open items, which I think will only change a
>paragraph or two in the Social Factors page. I'm not sure when those

>business case soon. It is _much_ better to get comments earlier rather
>than later.
>
>Therefore, if you expect to submit comments, please do so as soon as
>possible. To help focus your review, note that the major changes since
>the last review are listed under "[DONE] Additional changes made 12
>April - 12 May 2004" at:
