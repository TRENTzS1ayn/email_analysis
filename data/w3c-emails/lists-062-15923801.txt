I will only be able to attend for about an hour again this week as I have
another conference call to attend.

I'll miss June 11 due to the UPA Conference - that is the week I believe I
am up to be the scribe.   If someone would be so kind as to sub for me
(Shadi?), I
will scribe on the June 18th call.

Thank you!
