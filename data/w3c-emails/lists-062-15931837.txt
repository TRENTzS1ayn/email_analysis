I'll be traveling on June 11 as well. Libby (next on list), would you be
available?

Thanks,
  Shadi

I will only be able to attend for about an hour again this week as I
have
another conference call to attend.

I'll miss June 11 due to the UPA Conference - that is the week I believe
I
am up to be the scribe.   If someone would be so kind as to sub for me
(Shadi?), I
will scribe on the June 18th call.

Thank you!
