Dear WAI Interest Group Participants:

Registration is now open for the WAI-TIES Web Accessibility Best
Practices Exchange Training on 6 July 2004 in Paris, France. The
training precedes the ICCHP 2004 conference. The facility is provided by
Universit? Pierre et Marie Curie and additional logistical help is
provided by BrailleNet.

The hands-on Web accessibility evaluation training will be held in
English and will cover the following topics:

- An overview of resources that are available to help carry out an
evaluation review
- Detailed directions on evaluating links, tables, on-line forms,
images, and scripts
- Evaluation and repair of sample Web pages using automated tools and
manual reviews

There is no registration fee for the training; however, pre-registration
is required. There are a limited number of spaces, which are available
on a first-come, first-served basis. Registration will close when spaces
are filled.

Detailed information and required pre-registration is available from:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/2004/07/training.html

This message may be circulated to other lists; however, please avoid
cross-postings where possible.

Regards,

Shadi Abou-Zahra
and
