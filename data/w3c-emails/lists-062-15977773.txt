Oggetto: business case status, review


EOWG,

We discussed the status of the business case in the EOWG teleconference on
Friday 28 May. For those who missed it:

Most of the changelog items have been incorporated into the business case
and it is pretty much done. The latest version is at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/Overview
There are just a few open items, which I think will only change a paragraph
or two in the Social Factors page. I'm not sure when those will be
completed.

However, I would like people to review the current version without waiting
for those edits. We will be asking for your "sign off" on the business case
soon. It is _much_ better to get comments earlier rather than later. 

Therefore, if you expect to submit comments, please do so as soon as
possible. To help focus your review, note that the major changes since the
last review are listed under "[DONE] Additional changes made 12 April - 12
May 2004" at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/changelog#changes

Thanks.

~ Shawn
