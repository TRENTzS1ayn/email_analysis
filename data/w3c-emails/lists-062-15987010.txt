Hi all,

I was not able to take part to today's meeting, so here're my two cents
about the agenda and its issues:

> 2. Glossary requirements and title
> - please see Henk's draft #3 of requirements for WAI glossary subset.

I dislike "sub glossary", as it may seem to be a secondary glossary, not as
important as the "not sub" one, and it says nothing about its purpose. 

"Lexicon" maybe's better, but if I found on the same page two different
links, "WAI Glossary" and "WAI Lexicon", I'd have some difficult in
understanding their use and, most of all, the difference between those
links.

I think we should enforce and give the user a good guide adopting a
consistent terminology for both glossaries; if we're going to create a
glossary for translators, we may simply name it "Translators WAI Glossary".

Then, if I was not familiar with the US-English (WAI) terms, I would expect
to find a localized version of this glossary to help me improving my
knowledge; is the immediate translation of this glossary scheduled in next
agendas? If so, please count on me for its translation into italian.

> 3. How People with Disabilities Use the Web

This seems to me to be a really great document; it's complete, easy to read
and presents many useful examples of Web sites fruition.

My best regards,

Roberto Castaldo
