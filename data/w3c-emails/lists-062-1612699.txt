Andrew, all,

This is my homework (ignoring spelling errors <grin>). Actually these 
are my 2 cents, so disregard whatever you feel to.

A general comment is that you mention all over the place "a master 
stylesheet", when the reality is that there are more than one, 
specially for huge websites. I would suggest to change that to plural.

* Section 1:
1st paragraph: last sentence "Web apps", I would say "web content".
2nd paragraph: "technical workings of your Web applications" should be 
changed to "performance of your web services".

* Section 2-"Improve usability for non-disabled visitors":
Item: "Clear and consistent navigation", first element. I would add a 
third element on the list of kicking-off factors: "a home page only 
browsable through third-party plug-ins"

Item: "Device independence because of situational usage", I would say 
"Device independence"

* Section 2-"Support for Low Literacy Levels":
1st paragraph: "the language of your website is not their first", 
shall say "the language of your website is not their mother tongue".

1st Table:

I think there should be a "YES" in the crossing of "Device 
Independence" and "Low Bandwidth".

That's all. I hope it helps.

Regards,
carlos
