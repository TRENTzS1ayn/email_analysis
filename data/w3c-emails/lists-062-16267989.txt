On today's call I mouthed off about the deliverables schedule being "too 
optimistic" and I think a careful comparison with previous estimates of how 
long stuff would take might tend to confirm this evaluation.

However, there is something to be said for having one's reach exceed one's 
grasp so I'll let it go.

It seems to me that what is getting shorted are things that are currently 
"wishlist" items like the various FAQs whose 
updating/maintenance/dissemination might be actually more on point than yet 
another document explaining the "why" of accessibility at a time when 
emphasis on the "how" could serve both purposes.

As I read the glowing "testimonials" about ATAG and compare the 
vision/promise with the reality/performance of the tools used to produce 
Web material I am struck by the gap. This many years later and still no 
really "killer app" type authoring tool.

I would like to see our noses chafed by the grindstone of getting stuff 
into the hands of PWD and being unrelenting about getting organizations, 
particularly those who are W3C members, to fulfill their lofty promises.
