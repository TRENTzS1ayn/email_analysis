EOWG: FOR COMMENT PLEASE

I have updated the "Preliminary Review" section of Evaluating Web Sites 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/rev.html#prelim
according to today's change requests
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/changelog.html#20010727-eval

Please reply on list to the following questions AND/OR raise other comments
(I'm going to send separate thread-starters for the other sections of the
document, but if in doubt, go ahead and raise comments wherever on EOWG list)

- is the tone of intro paragraph better now?

- is the representative sampling of pages ok w/ the entry page added?

- I moved the note about reviewers with disabilities sometimes needing to
pair up (to second step of preliminary review); does that work?

- in the sub-list of five "browser tricks," are the instructions about what
to do clear and useful?

- I added a note about "experienced users of screen readers" in step #3,
with a little bit of caution in different directions, to try to work in
what Carlos was saying since this seems to be a way to fit it in even in
the preliminary review 

- for a "preliminary review," I'm assuming it is not necessary to add a
summary/reporting step, since this is really focused on a
"do-it-yourself-without-getting-up-from-your-desk approach, and the
intended audience is probably the person doing the review. Unless it makes
sense to briefly advise the reviewer how to sum up the results of the
preliminary review, e.g. something like "5. Summarize review results, being
careful to emphasize that this is a preliminary review only and not a
determination of conformance level" -- reactions?

- other comments on preliminary review section of this document?

Thanks,

- Judy
