Hello Olle,

I have done some research on this, over time. You can use a reverse-link 
option in a search engine to look at the current status, breaking the 
search down by different types of domains and different regions.

In general, currently it is common to see people over-claiming their 
conformance by one or more levels, which is one reason we encourage people 
to do more comprehensive self-testing, as described in:
