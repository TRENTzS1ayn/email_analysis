Karl,

thanks for the URI to your page.

Your remark is of course valid. I.e., when I naively suggested that a 
simple syntactic check of pages would be enough, is actually not enough, 
as it fails to distinguish between
    (1) "claiming conformance via the logo" and
    (2) "making a reference to the logo"
I.e. in (1), the logo is making a statement  about the page, while in 
(2), the page is making a statement about the logo.

So a little more subtle approach should be taken. Perhaps a manual 
inspection of a random selection of the pages that have these logos, to 
determine  the proportions of the two categories above.

And thanks Judy for also hinting at how available search engines can 
provide (albeit approximate) answers to many of our questions about 
"demographics" of the web.

Regards,

/olle
