>For me, this underlines the importance of emphsizing broad accessibility and
>usability and not limiting people's attention to people with disabilities. My
>approach has morphed in the following ways:
>(1) do mini-audits of web sites and talk about both WCAG compliance and
>business factors, especially simple things like good alt tags and search
>engines, as well as a few usability examples;
>(2) use short, compelling handouts that outline the percentage of people with
>disabilities (over 20% in the US) and the relative percentage of hidden
>disabilties, then mention how the same solutions can help people with
>literacy issues, people who's native language is not the dominant one, and
>many others;
>(3) mix examples of inaccessibility, using a lot relevant to people with
>disabilities, since a lot of the solutions came about as a result of paying
>attention to them, but adding examples from other groups as well, including
>people who don't have up-to-the-minute hardware and software.

>I miss the weekly teleconferences, and hope to participate again in the

> > The Abstract is as follows:
> > The World Wide Web has opened up many doors for people with disabilities.
> > However advances in technology, such as multimedia and graphic intensive
> > Web sites, are now starting to erode these benefits of the World
> > Wide Web for people with disabilities. Primarily this is due to
> > designers creating their Web sites in such a fashion which does not
> > make them accessible to people with disabilities.
> >
> > Research to date has not specifically examined the factors that
> > impede and propel an organisation to adopt Web accessibility.
> > Therefore, the primary objective of this research study is to
> > identify these factors. A single case study of Web accessibility was
> > adopted. The case study involves focusing on a Government
> > organisation that develops Web sites aimed at an educational audience.
> >
> > An analysis of the case was accomplished and a series of recommendations

> > organisation. Many of these issues were not mentioned in the
> > existing literature and as a result a set of recommendations to
> > overcome the factors impeding the adoption of Web accessibility were
