Looking for EOWG testers

We will get more people to test this once we circulate it for broader
review, with more background, shortly, but can a few EOWG members volunteer
to give the Preliminary Review a preliminary test over the next few days?

The idea would be to take what's written at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/rev.html#prelim
pretend that's all you knew about evaluating Web sites, and that you'd
never used or downloaded these tools before, and try to follow the process,
step by step, writing down comments about anything that's confusing or
annoying.

[See also the questions below, as possible ways to focus your comments]

Thanks,

what to do clear and useful?

with a little bit of caution in different directions, to try to work in
what Carlos was saying since this seems to be a way to fit it in even in
the preliminary review 
>
>- for a "preliminary review," I'm assuming it is not necessary to add a
summary/reporting step, since this is really focused on a
"do-it-yourself-without-getting-up-from-your-desk approach, and the
intended audience is probably the person doing the review. Unless it makes
sense to briefly advise the reviewer how to sum up the results of the
preliminary review, e.g. something like "5. Summarize review results, being
careful to emphasize that this is a preliminary review only and not a
determination of conformance level" -- reactions?
