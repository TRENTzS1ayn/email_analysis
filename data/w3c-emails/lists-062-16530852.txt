Social Corporate responsibility:
An org with  an inaccessible website tends to strengthen the feeling among PWD that   they are being excluded from society. An org with  an accessible website  on the other hand conveys that it is sensitive to the access needs of a diverse society. It empowers PWD in the society  and enables them to independentlyreview content about the org's offerings: products, services,performance data, employment opportunities   and so forth. This would engender goodwill for the org in the long run and  encourage other orgs to emulate it. Thus an org's accessible website can make a difference socially in its  operating environment.

I believe this section should not talk about  an org's motivation to make its website: financial gain or legal requirement, etc.
