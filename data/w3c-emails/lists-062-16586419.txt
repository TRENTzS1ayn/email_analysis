Shawn, I just took off the red text that I believe can be omitted in
this
case.  Below is the text I propose.

Please let me know if you have questions.

>

"Corporate social responsibility (CSR), also called corporate
citizenship
and other terms, is about operating an organization in such a way that
treats internal and external stakeholders ethically, conducts business
in
the ethical way, increases human development, and positively impacts
society
and the environment. Web accessibility is anintegral part of CSR because
it
demonstrates company's commitment to providing equal opportunities for
all
people regadless of limitations in all aspects of business.  Each
company
should have either CSR statement, policies or program that demonstrate
its
respect for all people and commitment to providing equal opportunities.


> Below are some of the points that should be included into CSR policies

customers,

standards

image
