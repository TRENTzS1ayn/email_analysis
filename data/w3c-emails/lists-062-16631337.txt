Hello, all -

I think "digital divide" could be deleted from Social Factors and that the
document would be more accurate without the phrase. It's only mentioned four
times:

1. Barriers to Web Use subheading, third paragraph - "These socioeconomic
factors that limit use of information and communications technologies, such
as the Web, are often referred to as the 'digital divide.'" 

This sentence can be deleted. It simply describes "digital divide," and the
paragraph would be clearer without it. 

2. Barriers to Web Use subheading, fourth paragraph - "Many people with
disabilities are impacted by several aspects of the digital divide related
to Web use." 

Change "the digital divide" to "barriers," so the sentence reads "Many
people with disabilities are impacted by several aspects of barriers related
to Web use."

3. Scope subheading, second paragraph (in brackets) - "In addition, since
the benefits of accessible design also extend to other groups affected by
the digital divide and other limiting situations...." 

Use "barriers to Web use" instead of "the digital divide": "In addition,
since the benefits of accessible design also extend to other groups affected
by barriers to Web use and other limiting situations...."

4. Web Accessibility Benefits More Than People with Disabilities header,
first paragraph - "While the main focus of Web accessibility is people with
disabilities, accessibility also benefits people without disabilities,
including those in groups disadvantaged by the digital divide." 

Change the digital divide" to "barriers to Web use," and rewrite sentence to
read "While the main focus of Web accessibility is people with disabilities,
accessibility also benefits people without disabilities, including those in
groups disadvantaged by barriers to Web use."

Not only do these changes avoid the digital divide clich? and inaccuracy,
but they also use a concept (barriers to Web use) that is an important part
of Social Factors. The language used in Social Factors says it better!

I apologize for the last-minute email. It's been a hectic week!

Regards,

Blossom
