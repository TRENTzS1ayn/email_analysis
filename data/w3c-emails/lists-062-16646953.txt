Some additional points that we include in our "selling" of accessibility in
Australia (with comment from Shawn [SLH] and sometimes an additional
comment from me [AA])

Hi, Andrew,

Below are very quick replies. Do you want to send to the EOWG list any
that you think we should discuss for Social Factors. And send to
eo-editors those for the Technical & Financial Factors.

cheers,

SLH: a bit of a stretch; however, does fall under digital divide... perhaps
should discuss briefly with EOWG

AA: not so much the digital divide, but rather these folk benefit from all
the good usability stuff that comprises a significant part of WCAG
(including things like 'clear links')

> # People with 'non-standard' equipment (eg PDAs, WAP, Macs)

SLH: not a really a social issue, I think, should be covered in technical
factors and referred to from financial factors

> # People in restricted access environments (often corporate
> situations with locked-down desktops)

SLH: not a social issue. could be covered in technical or financial

> # People with temporary impairments (eg from accidents, disease)

SLH: not really a social group per se, how about covering in financial
factors

AA: but don't these folk fall into the same category as many elderly? Many
of theme are actually disabled for a period of time (although they will
recover). E.g. broken arms/legs, temporary sight impairment or blindness,
stroke, etc. in Australia this has been estimated as a signiicant, if
changing, group in the population and as high as 15% of the population
according to some estimates.

> # People who are coping with environmental distractions (eg
> noise/light)

SLH: not really a social group per se, perhaps worth mentioning in
financial
factors under increased use

SLH: not really a social group per se, how about covering in financial
factors. could add one sentence that other situations/groups are
addressed in financial & technical factors

AA: if we move issues/groups to these sectiuon, then fine
