Hello all,

YES

Why "including Bobby". I suggest to put this Note at the end of the section
at the same level of 1,2,3. This note is applicable of all the tools mention
it this section.

I vot for OPTIONAL

YES

The page is supposed to be readable without style sheets.
Sscripts and applets not loaded,  for ?valuation of the NOSCRIPT description
and alt text description for APPLETS. The content must be equivalent.

It's the same situation in Quebec whit JAWS, but I think it's better
"additive". It's not replace voice or text browser.

YEW

If you can keep it short and simple, I think it's a good idea to propose
headings for a typical summary.

NO
