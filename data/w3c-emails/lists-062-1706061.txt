If the page not fit on the screen in low resolution, the user have to scroll
horizontaly and it's not easy for many, particularly people with motor
disability.

If you want to compare, you have to view the two and I think for the
preliminary review is the right goal. In the section for "evaluation", on
the third step, this will be more appropiate to emphasize this precaution
for JAWS and Home Page Reader. HPR display in the same windows the graphic
view and the text view and the user can't deactivate it, bu he can turn off
the monitor.
