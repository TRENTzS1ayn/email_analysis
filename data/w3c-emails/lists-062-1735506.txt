Judy,
Having done these kinds of evaluations before (for Qwest) I know that lots
of people don't know how to turn off images, increase font sizes, etc. on
their browser, and that every browser has the commands/instructions located
in different menus and calls them different things (for example in Netscape
you turn images off in preferences, but in iE you unselect the show pictures
option on the advanced tab of the Internet options pop-up).  I also know
that I forget between times I do it and waste a lot of time rediscovering
the process... So I think there should be more instructions for how to do
the things that we are telling users to do: turn off images, change the font
size (larger and smaller) in the browser, turn off the sound, and change the
display color to black and white. The instructions will have to be browser
specific - so I guess we have to decide how many browsers we want to give
directions for.  Maybe this could be hyperlinked (Ex: link = for
instructions for testing your web page with X browser).
Am I the only one who has difficulty remembering how to do these things?
Lila
