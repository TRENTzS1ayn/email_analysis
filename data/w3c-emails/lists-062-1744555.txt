Lila, I too forget and fumble. It looks like you have a good start to a
worthwhile resource. Since WAI should not be exclusionary, the set of
expected behaviors should be taken, say from the UAAG, and the request
made to any browser supplier to describe how that behavior is achieved
in the form of instructions for achieving it.

The advantage of inviting the supplying vendors is so we can be as 
inclusive as we get contributions, and not leave anyone out. As we 
advertise that
we are making a comparative document, I believe that the vendors will
want to be properly included.

Note that such a document is transitory, with need for updates as products
get updated. That too is to the vendor's advantage, if we provide a
means to make new versions.

The problem of non-standard names for the desired effect suggests that the
WCAG/UAAG checkpoint text have its alternative if any given for each browser.

Browser suppliers should be invited to augment a starting list of these,
contributed however incompletely by anyone who has the experience and
organization to pull it off.

The WCAG, ATAG, and forthcoming UAAG guidelines have associated
"techniques" showing that some implementation is feasible for each
checkpoint. There is no requirement that the method to meet a checkpoint
is described for all browsers/AT.

A place for vendor input could well be the User Agent Accessibility
Guidelines Techniques document. This is expected to be changed more often
than the Guidelines themselves.

An answer from a browser supplier could be "depends on/requires some
attached assistive technology."

Descriptions of methods can be convoluted, depending on interdependent
user settings and author/source desires. For example the style cascade
of CSS2.

Example:

Description of some capabilities, such as font size, are treated
differently:

     IE:         Smallest, Smaller, Medium, Larger, Largest
                 The default seems further adjusted by styles, say for hN.
                 Accepts absolute font sizes, in keeping with the
                 desire to round-trip from MS Word without loss of
                 presentation. Not sure of precedence among explicitly
                 included size in the document, stylesheets, and user
                 preferences. Not sure of persistence across loaded
                 documents with and without stylesheets or explicit
                 size in document markup.

     Opera:      21 percentage choices, 20% to 1000%, setting persists
                 for new loaded document.

     NSC 4.74:   smaller: Ctrl-[ larger: Ctrl-]  unlimited? sizes,
                 setting persists onto new loaded document. May not
                 affect content with specified font sizes.
