Judy/All,

I think all three sections are essential as they address different phase of
a site's life-cycle and/or history. However, section 4 is not the main
purpose of this document, so the level of detail is probably about right.
As William says, the 'public' review will bring in more comments any. in
the meantime here are a few suggestions from me:

Development

"Evaluation during the development process is essential to reduce the
reworking that may be required after the project is completed. Working
closely with the Web developers can ensure that accessiility is built into
the design from the start and carries through into all the development
phases. Effective evaluation during the deisgn phase can include:"

Ongoing

Point 5 - do we want to insit on a separate (email I preume) address for
accessibilioty feedback, or just include accessibilty as one type of
feedback among many?

Frozen

Point 3 - let add priorities to resource and timelines

Cheers,  Andrew

EOWG: FOR COMMENT PLEASE

For discussion on the list, since we did not get to discuss in
teleconference today:

Please review section on "Considerations for specific contexts" which
includes:
- Evaluation during the development process
- Ongoing monitoring
- Evaluation of "frozen" sites

Starter questions:

- first piece of intro (development process) seems too wordy, can it be cut
down

- are the points listed in each of the three sub-sections relevant and
important?

- is the section on ongoing monitoring adequate for ensuring the really
tough goal listed up in the overall introduction to this piece, e.g.
providing assurance that a site will maintain a given conformance level in
the future (note that I added a pointer from that goal down to this
section)

- is the section on frozen sites significant, or should it be thrown out?

- other comments?

Thanks,

Judy
