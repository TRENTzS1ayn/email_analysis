Hello All,
First just noticing various spelling issues waiting for the spell
check.

Under - support for the semantic Web - 

Clear Content & Text Alternatives I wrote this paragraph;

For Businesses the Semantic Web expands the market place through the clarity
of the meta data during seamless content management in all alternative
routes "anytime anywhere".  Following the WAI guidelines ensures clear
alternative routes by way of the Semantic Web to textual meanings archived
in data bases.

Otherwise I agree with William the text stands by itself.  I believe the
text is ready for wider review.
thank you
Doyle

A new (complete?) version of this appendix is now available from the usual
place (http://members.optushome.com.au/amja/wai/).

This version picks up all the recent discussion and contributions (thanks to
those who did email me with suggestions). The final links from the tables
have not been incorporated (nor have the linear tables been generated) -
this will be done after the content is 'signed off' as ready for public
comment.
