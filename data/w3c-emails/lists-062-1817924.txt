EOWG: Proposal to split business case and implementation plan

1. Pros/Cons:
Pros:
- clearer & shorter name for the resource suite(s)
- only one set of modules/samples per set
- reduced set of appendices per set
- easier to find what you need
- shorten time for completion of one resource suite
- it divides naturally anyway

Cons: 
- would take a bit of work to do
- it might (or might not) make it harder to find the relevant sections

2. Here's what the two documents might look like. Notice that in this
proposal, the samples/modules become the appendices and the other material
becomes the primary content.

A. Business Case for Web Accessibility 
   * Overview page
   * Business benefits of accessible design
   * Factors affecting cost of
implementation
   * Demographics of disability marketplace
   * Legal requirements
   * Sample business cases:
- Corporate
- Government
- Education (basic & secondary)
- Education (higher)
- Non-governmental
organization
- Web design business
- Software development company

B. Implementation Plan for Web Accessibility
   * Overview page
   * Developing organizational policies
   * Selecting authoring tools
   * Evaluating Web sites for accessibility
   * Sample implementation plans:
 - Corporate
- Government
- Education (basic & secondary)
- Education (higher)
- Non-governmental
organization
- Web design business
- Software development company

3. Here's what the split would involve, logistically:
- put the implementation plan pieces under their own URL
- change suite nav bars
- change tocs
- change internal links
- revise some of the introductions
- split change log after a given date
