1. ...
There are a variety of tools and approaches for evaluating conformance to 
the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0. No single accessibility 
checker yet provides
          automatic
comprehensive information or captures all problems with regard to the 
accessibility of a site; therefore evaluation involves a combination of

     "is the information presented in a similar logical order"
if one has no (visual) basis for comparison.

The downloaded Bobby will check linked pages, in same
folder or external. Tidy can check multiple pages. WAVE
when locally installed and active checks page by page as
they are loaded.
