Suggestion for 3.1.2 (http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/rev.html)

"identify a "page selection" which includes at least one
 of each different type of page on the site, and all top pages or entry
pages
 to the site"

Identify a "page selection" which includes at least one of each different
type of page from the site including all top pages or entry pages to the
site. Also include selections from the major "subsites" and "subsections",
especially where these have a different look-and-feel or design, or have
been created by different developers or teams.
