Greetings,

I asked around amongst various people concerned with the
intranet/internet in our company.  With regard to the term "page selection"
the following remarks helped clarify for me what an employee might think
about page selection.

One concept concerned the selection criteria of Mission Critical.  A
page would be selected because it was Mission Critical to the business in
order to generate sales.  Roughly defined as what minimum number of pages do
consumers have to hit in order to make a basic transaction.  A second area
involves risk.  A page which consumers access to find out about company
policies even though sales may happen without the public reading that page.


Typically someone trying to meet such criteria might choose pages
with a form, frames (navigational elements), image maps, dynamic pages with
templates. 
thanks,
Doyle Saylor

Suggestion for 3.1.2 (http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/rev.html)

"identify a "page selection" which includes at least one
 of each different type of page on the site, and all top pages or entry
pages
 to the site"

Identify a "page selection" which includes at least one of each different
type of page from the site including all top pages or entry pages to the
site. Also include selections from the major "subsites" and "subsections",
especially where these have a different look-and-feel or design, or have
been created by different developers or teams.

Andrew
