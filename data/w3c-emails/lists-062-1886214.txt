I sent this last night - not sure why it didn't go through - so I'm trying
again.

Another suggestion for 3.1.2

"Page selection" should also include pages that are generated by scripting
from a database, which would cover sites that are entirely database driven,
as well as individual pages on a site that are generated on the fly as a
result of a query to a database..
