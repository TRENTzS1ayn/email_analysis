Database systems for producing content are authoring tools, and the work of
the Authoring Tools Accessibility Guidelines working group was intended among
other cases to provide a specification that these systems could be tested
against. Since each large system is essentially a special case of an
authoring tool, it makes sense to evaluate such systems against ATAG
(although that includes some fairly significant WCAG evaluation of result
pages).

  Another suggestion for 3.1.2

  "Page selection" should also include pages that are generated by scripting
  from a database, which would cover sites that are entirely database driven,
  as well as individual pages on a site that are generated on the fly as a
  result of a query to a database..
