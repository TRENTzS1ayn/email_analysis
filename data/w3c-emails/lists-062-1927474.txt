Here are several outreach activities. The University of Southern Maine
has made two presentations on Web accessibility and hosted an
informational table for representatives from over 300 colleges and
universities at a conference sponsored by the U.S. Department of
Education in Washington, D.C. Copies of the quick tips were distributed.
Next week, we will make a presentation on Web accessibility to
participants in a conference in Arizona sponsored by the Digital Library
Earth System Education (DLESE) group. DLESE collects and distributes
information on earth system science education. The quick tips will be
distributed.
