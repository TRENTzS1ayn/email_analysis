aloha, y'all!

a far clearer picture of lynx -- with full (parsing/rendering) functionality
and inherent limitations intact -- can be obtained by actually using lynx,
courtesy of a publicly accessible telnet connection which leads directly to
the browser -- all you need to use a public version of lynx is a telnet
client...

unfortunately, such resources are dwindling in number (action GJR: bring
issue of W3C/MIT hosting publicly accessible lynx as an evaluation & repair
tool to the CG) -- the one which i would recommend most highly is the one
which is available via:
   <telnet://sailor.lib.md.us>
which features Lynx 2.8.3 (which, if sailor holds true to form, will shortly
be upgraded to the latest [17 july 2001] release of lynx, 2.8.4)

note: if anyone should attempt to use this service, here's some advice: when
your telnet client makes the connection, simply ignore the initial strings
of punctuation -- if you are currently using speech, squelch it and do a
"speak-line" and you should hear the login:  prompt -- login as
"guest", then simply hit ENTER four times, and you're running the latest
full release of lynx, set to "show hyperlinks as numbers" and with
"show_cursor" turned on -- both of which are important settings for speech
access -- and with the color settings (if your display supports ansi) which
were reported (after lots of testing) by many low vision users to provide
high contrasts...
