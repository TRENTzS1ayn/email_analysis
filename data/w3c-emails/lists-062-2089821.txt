in particular, i want to draw your attention to one of the statistic on
blindness in china

<quote
href="http://www.who.int/inf-fs/en/fact230.html"
title="extract from WHO fact sheet number: 230"
date="September 1999">
China accounts for about 18% of the world's blind. The country is estimated
to have the largest number of blind people in the world ? around 5 million.
By definition, these people cannot walk about unaided.

Against the background of a huge population, estimated by the UN at some
1267 million people, these figures do not look impressive. Indeed, the
current prevalence of blindness in China ? the total number of blind people
at any given time expressed as a percentage of the total population -- is
around 0.4%. However, in absolute terms, the country's ever-increasing blind
population has
already surpassed the total population in such countries as Denmark, Finland
or Norway.

if we could get a demographer to take the available evidence and extrapolate
for all functional limitations/disabilities, the number would be quite
staggering...  (oh, and the bit about how much services for the blind cost
china is also quite interesting, as well)
