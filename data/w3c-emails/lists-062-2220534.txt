None in Dublin Core. A good issue.

At the Evaluation and Repair meeting this morning I learned:

1. William Loughborough suggests Platform for Internet Content
Selection (PICS(tm))

     <http://www.w3.org/PICS/>http://www.w3.org/PICS/

PICS enables labels (metadata) to be associated with Internet content.
its original purpose was to restrict pornography, but has wider
potential.

2. Wendy Chisholm points to how this has been thought of, and a potential
solution proposed for WCAG assertions:

The following extract is from the
Errata in Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0
     <http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WAI-WEBCONTENT-ERRATA>http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WAI-WEBCONTENT-ERRATA

(informative, not part of WCAG10)
=== extract ===
     7. Meta data conformance schemes.
Added: 27 January 2000.
Type: Clarification.
Refers to: Conformance claims, section 5 in the 
<http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505/>5 May 1999 version.
Description (and correction). Authors may wish to claim conformance using
meta data rather than or in addition to the conformance icons. Refer
to 
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999AprJun/0161.html>Daniel 
Dardailler's PICS schema.
     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999AprJun/0161.html
The following example claims Double A conformance:


<META http-equiv="PICS-Label"
       content='(PICS-1.1
       "http://www.w3.org/wai/wcag-conformance"
       labels exp "1999.12.31"  for
       "http://www.foo.com/foo.html"
       by "jow@foo.com"
       ratings (c 1))'>


=== end extract ===

I have no idea if this has actually been used. Since the example above is
part of the unofficial errata, and not part of WCAG1.0, its form and
content is subject to revision.

3. Wendy took an action item to release to EO the introduction to EARL
that I mentioned at the EO meeting last Friday.
