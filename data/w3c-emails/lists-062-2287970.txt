I suggest: "From a strategic point of view, anything you can do to increase
the
likelihood that your site will be found over others is a
positive benefit" or "found amog others".

A socially-minded corporations want to be found over or among other
resources. The word "competitor" is too strong but among all web sites on a
topic, the corporation that develop and maintain a web site want to be seen.
