There is an updated version of the "Evaluating Web Sites for Accessibility"
resource as of just before our meeting today, 17 August. 

It incorporates most, but not quite all, of the change requests from our
last meeting which was Friday August 10. 

It is available at 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/rev.html

The changelog has also been updated and is available at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/changelog.html

Regards,

- Judy
