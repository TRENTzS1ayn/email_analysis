Demographic Yearbook. New York: United Nations, 1948- . Annual
The Demographic Yearbook is a collection of international demographic 
statistics. It presents tables on basic demographic statistics, 
distribution and trends in population, natality, fetal mortality, infant 
and maternal mortality, and divorce. In some tables, data are shown by 
rural/urban residence. Each annual volume covers basic demographic 
statistics plus one or a few special topics. Special topics covered in 
recent years include aging and the situation of elderly persons, disability 
statistics, and population migration.

Chartbook on Work Disability in the United States. Washington, D.C.: 
National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, 1991.

state, level of education, and occupation.
