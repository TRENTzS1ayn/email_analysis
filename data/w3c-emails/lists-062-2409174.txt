Hi Judy & all,

After the Friday discussion of the Review doc (and targetting WCAG1.0
conformance), it occured to me that maybe we need to prepare another doc
about disability-usability issues such as horizontal scrolling, tiny link
targets, etc.

eg (extract from a newletter I subscribe to):
To Scroll or Not to Scroll
Is there any way to make the page look the same on a 13 inch monitor as it
does on a 17 inch, without the need to horizontally scroll?

Cheers,  Andrew
