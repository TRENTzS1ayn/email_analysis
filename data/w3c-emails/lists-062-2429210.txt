hi kathleen,

question on the the auditing function.  this would be 
considered a plus to track changes.  i do not think 
these tools export or integrate into Software 
Configuration Management Tools. 

Is there a report generated to one HTML or Word 
document or Spreadhseet?  this could be used and then 
attached to or referenced for change request.

What authoring tools do these products support and 
how do they integrate.  Commands on the toolbar?

do they find issues AND make recommendations? or 
provide options or changes to code?

have you looked at macromedia's acessibility plug-in 
for evaluatin and repair?  understand "Ultradev" has 
it now and will soon be incoporated into Dreamweaver.

Does SSB Technologies  they have a client list and 
have you checked references for its installation and 
support, plus ease of use/training?

Would be interested ina product comparison between 
SSB's and Macromedia's product.


cheers, rob
