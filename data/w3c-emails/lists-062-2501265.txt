Hi Robert:
I should be able to answer most of your questions by the end of this week -
we are downloading the demo and running it here against some live sites on
Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. I will be happy to post a write-up that
answers your questions and generally describes how the demo went, including
installation and ease of use.

I won't however, be able to give a comparison between SSB's products and the
Macromedia accessibility plugin, as we don't use Macromedia's products.
