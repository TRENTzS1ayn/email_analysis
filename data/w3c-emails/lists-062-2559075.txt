Dear all,

This is my first attempt to present brief guidelines for any big or small,
centralized or flat organization to deploy accessibility standards
companywide.

In the future I can elaborate on it but it seems to me that it would be
beneficial to have a list of things a company needs to do to accomplish the
task.

Looking forward to talking to you tomorrow and having your feedback.

Best regards,



Natasha Lipkina
