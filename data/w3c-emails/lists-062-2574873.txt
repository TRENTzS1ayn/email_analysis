Natasha,

Thank you for posting a draft of a corporate implementation plan for Web
accessibility, for discussion at our call today.

Because not all members of the list can read MS Word documents, I have
re-posted the contents of your attachment as an appendix to this e-mail
message below, so that it is available in text format. (We generally work
on drafts either in HTML or text formats.)

A few immediate comments:

- This provides helpful additional detail to complement the current draft
corporate implementation plan that we have been working on 
http://fit.gmd.de/~velasco/wai-eo/ipcorporate.xml
and appears to cover a broader range of centralized/decentralized businesses

- We should avoid the word "guidelines" here, I believe, given the risk of
confusion with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines themselves, and the
other accessibility guidelines

- Since Section 508 is a US-specific statute, which only applies to certain
kinds of organizations (federal agencies and state agencies), and the W3C
is international in focus, instead of direct references to Sec 508 I
suggest we use something like "and any applicable local requirements" 

Again, thanks for giving us this draft for discussion.

Regards,

- Judy
