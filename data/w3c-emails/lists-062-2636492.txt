i appreciate andrews's comments and have one coment 
that is open for discussion on table width. 

andrew advises to use relative over fixed.  while i 
agree with his anlaysis, i disagree using relative. 
froma retail and content environemnt, i set table 
width to 600.  this ensures that it can be printed on 
every printer.  if the graphics and other content 
push the width to over 600, then it does not print 
well.  the customer will have a poor customer 
experience.  

i have seen this width many retailers that use table 
width set to 645 or over 700.  i have had problems 
printing pages with relative tables.

i would be inclined to suggest there may be a 
techinique here to state how best to use relative 
tables.  does anyone have any thoughts here?
