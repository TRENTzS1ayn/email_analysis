Future conferencing will increasingly depend on video connection
and interactive drawing (virtual whiteboard) capabilities.

Accessibility aspects of video conferencing and virtual whiteboards
include:

1. Provide aural description of whatever is purely visual.

2. Train participants to use the descriptive techniques
as now used with descriptive video.

3. Consider speech to text to transform words into text for
alternative display. These include braille, enlarged text
overlay layer under user control, or alternative display
for visual.

4. Integrate pre-existing textual sources with visual and
generated text material for merged description.
