Subject: video conferencing and virtual whiteboards


> Future conferencing will increasingly depend on video connection

> 
> Accessibility aspects of video conferencing and virtual whiteboards
> include:
> 
> 1. Provide aural description of whatever is purely visual.
> 
> 2. Train participants to use the descriptive techniques
> as now used with descriptive video.
> 
> 3. Consider speech to text to transform words into text for
> alternative display. These include braille, enlarged text
> overlay layer under user control, or alternative display
> for visual.
> 
> 4. Integrate pre-existing textual sources with visual and
> generated text material for merged description.
