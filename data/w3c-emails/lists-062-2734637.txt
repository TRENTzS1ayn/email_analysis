One of the "evaluations": $25,000 for the software, $200/seat; annual 
maintenance fee of 18% of original
cost and additional fees for hosted Web service.

I think I'd rather just telecon and maybe for f2f just get the phones to 
work better. Judy and Andrew making edits online and in time works great. 
Just need longer calls with breaks. Skip a bunch of airplanes.
