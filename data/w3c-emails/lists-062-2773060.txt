Hi Judy and all,
Concerning the links order at the beginning of the page, it seems to me 
more logical to introduce the FAQ after the WCAG guidelines.

I wonder if we should not add an explanation about the different guidelines 
provided by the WAI web site, or a link to the page explaining that.
The page introduces the WCAG 1.0 but not the authoring tools guidelines.

What about making a link to the page "evaluation and repair tools"? I would 
add it to the section "How accessible is my web site?"

Regards
Sylvie
