The draft scenario about the clerk was written as a combined effort, drawn 
from experience of several members of the EOWG with people that they knew, 
and experience with Web based shopping systems.

The employment situation of people with developmental disabilities varies 
across different countries. Not all of the scenarios are valid for each 
person with a disability in any given country, nor are they intended to be.

However the scenario has problems for technical reasons, which we 
discovered after further inquiries into Web based shopping systems. Those 
technical problems have been discussed in EOWG meetings, and as a result 
the EOWG agreed to either substantially change, or to replace that 
scenario, the next time we revise this draft.
