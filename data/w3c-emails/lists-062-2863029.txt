I'd be happier if the scenario was removed asap.
I do recognise there are good reasons for things remaining stable.

However I advised against this scenario at the time, and frankly find it
offensive to be associated, even remotely with it.
It appears to have been included as a token gesture, at the time.
If those members who promoted it are not willing to be identified it says
little for their credibility.

Perhaps in future we could have a more open system where proposals are from
named individuals, who are responsible to the group for their proposal.
Clearly we need to discuss possible scenarios, and although I submitted one
quite some time ago, I've yet to receive any response.

My suggestion related to accessing multimedia, music, films
An example where symbolic links are used without any text by a large
commercial organisation is: http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/
It is intended for a mainstream audience, yet remains accessible to LDD
users.
Unfortunately as no text alternative is provided, and many of the links
cannot be tabbed to, we probably shan't be able to use it.

thanks

ps could you please refrain from copying me into eowg mail, I have received
