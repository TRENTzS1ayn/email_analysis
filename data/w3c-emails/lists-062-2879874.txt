Jonathan:

You don't appear to be associated with this scenario; you are not listed in 
the contributors
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/PWD-Use-Web/Overview.html#ack
nor in the EOWG Members in good standing
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/EOWG-members.html
so I am unclear regarding your urgent concern that you would be associated 
with this scenario in this draft.

The history of who has proposed what is publicly available on the EOWG 
mailing list
         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-eo/
and in minutes of meetings and change logs which reflect group discussion. 
You are as welcome as anyone else to look at who contributed to EOWG work, 
so kindly do not offend EOWG Members by implying otherwise.

Some proposals received since our last draft have already been discussed 
and will be incorporated in our next draft. If there are others that have 
been received but not yet discussed, we will discuss them, and if 
appropriate incorporate them before moving the document out for public review.

I don't know why your email client is receiving multiple copies. You should 
receive no more than two from me with this message, which is the same 
number that I receive when you send messages addressed to me and the list.
