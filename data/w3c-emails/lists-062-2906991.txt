Judy,
you are being somewhat disingenuous.
you sent me copies of an email to ig and gl twice that makes 8 copies, which
is somewhat ridiculous.

I was listed as an active member at the time the scenario was being
discussed.
I asked at that time who was contributing the scenario, and received no
response.
Certainly no initial email for discussion containing the scenario was read
by me.
You chose not to list me as a contributor, though I had submitted an
alternative scenario.

This has been a major factor in why I no longer listed as an active member
of eowg.
If you would like contributions from me on eowg perhaps you will consider
raising this issue once again.
If you are not willing to address this issue there is little point in me
remaining on the eowg mailing list.
