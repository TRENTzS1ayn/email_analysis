Judy & all,

Vision Australia delivered four very successful Web Accessibility Workshops
in Canberra last week (see http://www.vicnet.net.au/disability/training/).
Two of these emphasised the issues of regional Australia and others with
technological disadvantages. Each day included an Introductory workshop in
the morning and an InDepth workshop in the afternoon.

Meet with you all again on the 12 Oct - in the Outback between times
