If I've learned anything by being on the planet this long it is that such 
disadvantages will be shorter-lived than has been access to shoes and 
indoor plumbing - you can use a cell phone in an outhouse.

In my youth a wrist-watch was an unimaginable luxury and now they're 
essentially given away (to pay for their packaging and delivery some small 
price is placed, but...). The as-yet-only-dreamt-of "wearable computers" 
will experience a similar fate and there will be 6,000,000,000 portable 
servers fully equipped with all manner of sensors and interconnections 
forming one giant computer.

Our job is to insist on full inclusion at this early stage so that the 
dream won't be a nightmare for some (most?) of us as we age, etc.

Anything we write that will further that is worth our while

Keep on keeping on.
