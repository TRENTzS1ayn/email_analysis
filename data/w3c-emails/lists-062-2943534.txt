Helle, Sylvie,

Change requests to "Getting Started" from our EOWG 28 September 2001 
meeting are now done, and it is republished in its regular location, at
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/gettingstarted

Changelog updated
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/gettingstartedchangelog

The document is now stable again and ready for translation.

As soon as a translation is available, I will add back in the line about 
availability of translations at the top of the document.

Regards,

- Judy
