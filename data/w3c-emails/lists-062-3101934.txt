No.  Until some sort of W3C patent policy is passed -- such as one
that allows W3C working groups to choose a RAND or RF policy --
then it's beyond the scope of _individual_ working groups to 
address patent policy.

In other words, while the W3C is working out a framework by which
policy decisions would happen, it would be very bad for individual
groups to start making policy decisions, especially those which may
or may not be compatible with the eventual policy which the W3C
will adopt sometime in the future, whatever that will be.

So my suggestion is that if you are concerned about patent policy
you should make your opinions known in the manner provided by the
W3C, but hold off on trying to organize working group consensus
until such time as there is any _point_ in organizing that type of
consensus.
