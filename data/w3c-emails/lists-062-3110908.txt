The presumed mode of WAI groups to date has been RF (Royalty Free).

This is not currently specified in WAI charters, but can indeed be so 
specified in charter renewals, regardless of pending overall discussions on 
W3C patent policy.

Also, with regard to Carlos' original question about the draft Patent 
Policy Framework, which included:
>I have not read the whole document in
>depth,

it is important to actually read the document, carefully. Please note that 
as with all W3C draft documents, public comment is invited.

This message is also a reminder to not cross-post on WAI lists, even if 
replying to previous comments that have done so.
