Many readers, ADD or otherwise, learn by practice, the
importance of following the references. For a first reading,
often such references are skipped.

I do not understand why an ADD reader wouldn't be taught
that practice.

This suggests some clue on the links (important|informative)
much as WCAG had suggested to warn of links that lead to costly
info.

In the Digital Talking Book DTD we have an attribute on
prodnote:
     render (optional|required) #IMPLIED
that can give the book reader a preference choice to skip:
     <prodnote render="optional">...</prodnote>.
The book producer can mark some as required presentation:
     <prodnote render="required">...</prodnote>.

In HTML or XHTML if we used a stylesheet to sense and perhaps
display differently < a href="..." class="optional">...</a>,
that might help any reader, not just the ADD reader, to sense
the significance of that link.

We habitually use the "meaning" of the text in the
<a href="...">...</a> as an indicator of what is being linked.

I expect that can pile up if there are several. and need
differentiation. [but the model for this use is footnote
references, identifying marks usually at the end of a sentence or 
paragraph. They are less obtrusive, so one may easily skip
over whatever they reference.]
