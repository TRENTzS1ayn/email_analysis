On Tuesday I did a presentation on WAI, Eeurope and Danish activities for a
group that are taking a diploma education in Digital Public Administration.
Telling them why accessibility is important and necessary and where to find
the information, I started the 2-hour talk with a JAWS demonstration. You
can see my slides at
http://www.visinfo.dk/Info/organisation/medarbejder/hbj/ they are mainly a
collection of links to the resources I think are most useful when you want
to know about accessible web design and how to get started. I've made the
Getting started page as a hand out (in Danish) and I think it's useful as a
quick overview of where to start.
On Wednesday the minister for IT and Research presented the rewards to the
sites that have won this year's competition connected to the
