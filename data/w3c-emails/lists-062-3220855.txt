Natasha,

If you would like comments from the EOWG on your draft, could you please 
send your file to the group either in HTML or text. These formats are more 
accessible to members of the working group.

People can then place their comments on the list, and their input will be 
identifiable by their comments.

Also, please be very careful if you are generating an HTML file from an MS 
Word conversion. You will need to check the source code to make sure that 
the structural markup is used correctly and that the remainder of the code 
is valid.

Thank you,

- Judy
