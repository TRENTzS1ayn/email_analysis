Note: Upcoming meeting dates/times are posted on EOWG home page

including a link to Daylight Saving Time change-overs in different countries
         http://webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/b.html
since there are often a few weeks at the end of October when we get out of 
sync with each other, given that DST change-overs occur at different times 
in different countries.

Regards,

- Judy
