EOWG:

At our meeting today we will discuss Natasha's draft of the corporate 
implementation plan. She has sent this to the list in HTML but for some 
reason it seems to not be available in the archives. Please note message at
         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-eo/2001OctDec/0018.html

Also I am re-sending her file attached to this message, and will check to 
see if it archives on the EOWG list this time.

Please note that we have discussed several versions of this (changelog 
notes available at):
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/changelog

including whether to do a combined version of centralized/decentralized 
implementation planning, and that we have a previous version of a 
centralized implementation plan available at:
         http://www.fit.fraunhofer.de/~velasco/wai-eo/ipcorporate.xml

Also, please note that we need to start checking the wai-eo-editors 
archives each week. They are at:
         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/wai-eo-editors/

Regards,

- Judy
