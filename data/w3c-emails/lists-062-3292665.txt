EOWG:

Reminder, meeting today 19 October 2001:
         Time:   8:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. US Eastern Daylight Time
         Bridge: +1 617 252 7000

Minutes from last week are available at
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/2001/1012-eowg-min.html

Agenda:

1. Outreach updates

2. Merged implementation plan outline
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/impl/
         I was not sure I would be able to put out a merged draft before 
today's meeting,
         but here it is, in incomplete draft form. Much detail for specific 
contexts to be added still.
         This incorporates some but not all of our requested changes, and 
visually it needs lots of work.

         We should discuss:
         - how effective is the merged outline approach?
         - what level of additional detail is essential to supplement this 
list?
         - is the split (away from the business case umbrella page) effective?
         - what specifics should be added to illustrate specific contexts?
         - how much more work is needed on this before sending it around 
for review?

         Note that this rolls together information, though not completely 
yet, from previous drafts

         In addition please recall our discussion of splitting the business 
and implementation sides, from August

3. Review & discussion of replies on wai-eo-editors archive.
         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/wai-eo-editors/2001Oct/

Note again: Upcoming meeting dates/times are posted on EOWG home page
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/#meetings
including a link to Daylight Saving Time change-overs in different countries
         http://webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/b.html
since there are often a few weeks at the end of October when we get out of 
sync with each other, given that DST change-overs occur at different times 
in different countries.

Regards,

- Judy
