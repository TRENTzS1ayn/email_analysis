A general note about the implementation plan. It would benefit greatly 
(IMO) from a narrative about how MicroSoft went about it plus one from a 
much smaller place (a school in the Netherlands, perhaps) did its 
implementation. You've been fairly close to the process as MS went from a 
"commitment" by its leader through the present and maybe one of our Dutch 
pals has something from there?
