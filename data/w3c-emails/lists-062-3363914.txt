Browser Sniffing? this is an impossibility, there are no mechanisms (until
(if) CC/PP becomes available) the HTTP_USERAGENT is not appropriate for
this.  As you seem to be suggesting ASP, then hopefully by now the
relevant Microsoft Knowledge Base Articles have added a disclaimer that
this doesn't work even for "standard" browsers, let alone issues like
browser configuration (no images, no script etc. etc.) or Accessibility
technology based on top of them.  For example Jaws for Windows, makes
IE5.5's capabilities radically different.

The majority of uses for client-side scripting either already have server
duplication (form validation), or are not duplicatable in the server
(popup menus, rollovers, etc. etc.)

Just about every form, on any page has form validation with server side
validation aswell as client (if it doesn't then the server has a
problem...)
