Hi Chuck, all,

First, another argument for those that complain about server load when 
using server-side scripting: client-side scripting also requires to 
serve bigger pages, because you must send a few Kbs of JavaScript to the 
client (and I have seen pages with more than a few Kbs, but close to 
50kbs of extra JavaScript code due to complex validation form techniques).

As already said, browser sniffing will not work, because you are not 
able to determine from the HTTP request whether the user has JavaScript 
activated. Therefore, the only "reasonable" technique, also from an 
accessibility standpoint, is server-side scripting. If you are receiving 
100,000 requests a day, you better have a good server with load 
balancing, otherwise you are in big trouble.

In regard to the solution that Judy wants to implement for the document 
we were discussing, the solution we use is X(HT)ML+XSLT (Apache + 
Cocoon). But I do not know which server is W3C using. But I am sure, 
Charles does <grin />

Regards,
carlos
