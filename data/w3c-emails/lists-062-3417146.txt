Regrets for tomorrows meeting. We are having a meeting in the Danish Web
accessibility Guidelines Group at The State information office; if the
meeting ends early I'll try to join the call for the last hour or so. If you
discuss face to face meetings to morrow I think The Plenary session in
France is a good place but also I will suggest a meeting after CSUN like
last year, I've seen that WCAG have scheduled a meeting at CSUN and then
maybe we could have a cross group meeting with them, and I think there will
be some different folks in France and in L.A.  Judy: In France will it be
possible to invite some of the eEurope people like in Amsterdam?
A few meetings ago we talked about Language tags in translations of "Getting
Started" apart from finding out about the right language code for Danish did
I promise to put in the missing language tags in the Danish Translation of
"Getting Started"?
