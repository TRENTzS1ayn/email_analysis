Metadata Search: Report Update

     Metadata, structured information about documents, can improve search
     engine results significantly. This report covers metadata and search
     engines, including new resources such as XML and RDF metadata, the
     Dublin Core NISO standard, Adobe XMP metadata within files, and
     topic maps.
