Dear Natasha
Thanks for the links, The content of your links and mine are hopefully the
same but your links are for the ISO organization where I due to my
background prefer the library Community when presented by Library of
Congress <GRIN>.
Hopefully you put in a wrong link for the language; otherwise you are
wrongly using country codes for both country and language.
Best wishes 
Helle

Dear Helle,

Just FYI, we are using the following site for the ISO country standards
http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/index.html  and
http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/index.html for the language

I am very much interested in the direction W3C is moving. If somebody finds
out this information pls let me know,

thanks a lot,

Subject: Language codes and country codes in (translated) WAI documents


I have consulted my former colleagues who are the Danish experts in Dublin
Core and Meta Data. They say language and Country are two very different
things and we shall use the ISO 639-1 or ISO 639-2 for language codes.
According to Dublin Core one can use either the 2 letter or the 3 letter
code (they explained something about the schema defining end transforming
between the 2 or 3 letter codes, I'm sure some of the Semantic Web- XML -
Meta Data- and Schema folks can explain this to me and others) You can read
more about the language codes on Library of Congress web site
http://www.loc.gov/marc/languages/ and
http://lcweb.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/langhome.html  about the ISO639-2
and ISO639-1 standards.  This means in translations one must write either da
or dan for Danish and e.g. en or eng for English and for French: fra (the
terminology code), fre (the bibliographic code) or fr. Are we going to use 2
or 3 letter codes ? What are the W3C/WAI recommendations?
