EOWG:

I updated the content of
         Implementation Plan for Web Accessibility
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/impl/
according to our discussion in last week's EOWG meeting
and have updated the change log
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/impl/changelog
with the help of Dominique Haza?l-Massieux from W3C's Systems Team,
who implemented some static xslt transformations,
the page now has expandable/collapsible detail.

Obviously there are a few things that are not absolutely ideal with regard 
to the focus,
such as the viewport shifts that occur, or the fact that you can't expand 
things cumulatively as you go;
but I'm hoping that this is an improvement over the original.

Before our next meeting this Friday Nov 2, could you please:

1. Try out the page, and send comments to the eowg list about the format;

2. Look over the collapsed and expanded content carefully, and send 
comments to the list if you have additions or changes (please note that we 
don't say much about education or Web design businesses yet, and several of 
the other environments need better representation in the comments;

If we have enough conversation on list this week, and then go over things 
at our meeting this Friday, who knows maybe we'll be able to get another 
deliverable out for review shortly.

In the meantime, several folks here would like to better understand the 
reported crash concerns for some screen readers with client-side scripting 
& style sheet usage for hiding and displaying detail on a page. Could 
people who commented on that at the last meeting please provide more detail 
as to the screen reader product and versions and the scripting markup that 
seemed to cause the problem?

Thank you,

- Judy
