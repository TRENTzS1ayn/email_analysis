While discussing the Business Benefits of Accessible Web Design draft,
Lisa Seeman made some good points, which basically boiled down to
whether or not she felt the arguments in the draft document were
persuasive and effective.

This got me thinking -- and that's always dangerous -- and I whipped
up a quick test form as a proof of concept, to propose this idea to
the E&O list -- take a survey via the web, and see if we can figure
out which of the arguments presented are particularly persuasive,
and which ones aren't.

Naturally, this is not "scientific" and will simply be a straw poll,
but even straw polls are effective if their status is kept in mind
when weighting the results.

Here's the URL -- would something like this be useful to your group?

(Replies are currently sent to me, and I will keep the results on
file if you like!  Or it's an easy change to forward them to a list
member, the list itself, etc.)
