Please accept my Regrets for this weeks meeting - I've been travelling all
week and don't think I'll last until 12:30 am Australian time (meeting
start) this week.

WRT "Implementation Plan for Web Accessibility" can I suggest that the ALT
text for the "expand detail" icons be tailored to the section that will be
expanded, else some people will not know which 'expansion' to select (see
screen grabs showing a. screen with ALT text, and b. Links List from JAWS
with 5 'expand detail' links):
