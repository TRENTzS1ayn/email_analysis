Kynn,

Given that the EOWG hasn't yet heard the feedback (we will be discussing it 
shortly), and may choose to do a pass through the document on its own 
first, it may be better to do the kind of exercise you suggest after the 
EOWG has had a chance to respond to the comments.

Could be an interesting excercise for later though. Let's see what the 
group wants to do.

- Judy
