Vision Australia Foundation presented a one day workshop to over 35 web
managers and developers from the Dept of Health and Aged Care (a
Commonwealth Government Department) during the week. The morning session
stressed what web accessibility was about and why it was important and
introduced WCAG, the afternoon session highlighted common issues and
presented evaluation techniques to help them assess their own sites and
improve their quality assurance. It was quite a lively session with a lot of
interaction as all participoants came from the same Department but had
varying opinions and a wide range of different issues that they were facing.

Overall feedback at the end of the day was that their understanding of web
accessibility had increased and they had gained some skills to help improve
their individual sub-sites.

The Department's site is http://www.health.gov.au
