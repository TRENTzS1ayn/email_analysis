* Check initial caps in headings

* Add some more links, such as at

  in 1. Intro: first mention of WCAG 1.0. (and possibly
      at subsidiary references to it.)

  in 2. Market share: Point to page with demographic info

     in Improve Search Engine...

      Point to site(s) that describes what search engines look for.

      Text alternatives==bullet 2  suggest need both "visual"
      D link and longdesc URL (what browser uses longdesc?.
      (Discussed more in Assisting access.) Candidate for
      deferment to there.

   in "Semantic Web"

       need pointer. Also perhaps to William's intro to it.

   in "Repurpose Content"

       need pointer to CSS

   in 3. Improve Efficiency

   Does have pointers to XML, SVG and SMIL

       Pointers to XHTML and XML accessibility

       Surprising link to Authoring tools that Support WAI
       standards actually goes to XML Accessibility Guidelines.

       Address server-load
         bullet 1  link style sheets to CSS
         bullet 3  more longdesc & D link redundancy
             presumptive that users will turn graphics on
             or off.  (seems redundant with next)

       Address server-bandwidth
         some redundancy with prior issue.
