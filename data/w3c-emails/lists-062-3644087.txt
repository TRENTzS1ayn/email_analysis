I'm attaching yet another version of the Expanded Implementation Plan
for Web Accessibility. In this version, I've removed references to
"small organizations," "corporations," "educational organizations," etc.
I hope that this does not confuse the discussion but, I think it could
be helpful not to make distinctions between specific types of
organizations.
