?Promotion and Marketing:
A strategic alliance will be pursued with mainstream 
disability organizations and those organizations 
specifically supporting disabled musicians to market 
the event. This would result in a collateral 
marketing effort where they would hype the inaugural 
webcast and eventually the series as a regular on-
line event potentially sanctioned by the 
organizations. Using TVWorldwide.com/AbleTV&#8217;s past 
audience tracking data and our databases of listservs 
and e-mail listings, we would hype the event prior to 
the webcast. On-line participants would be tracked 
and be utilized and expanded for subsequent annual 
programs in the series. Presence at upcoming 
disability trade conferences would be considered as 
additional promotion. Two PRNewswire and Internet 
Wire press releases to 2500 media outlets worldwide 
will be distributed prior to the event.
