Hello all,

I have reviewed document "Implementation Plan for Web Accessibility" from
the perspective of small organizations and I have nothing to add.

Some points are less pertinent for small organizations like :

Identify representatives from key departments
Establish a coordination team with communication plan

But, it is implicit from the detail of  "Assign a lead coordinator".

Also, other points are less pertinent but I think it is not necessary to
precise it for each point.
