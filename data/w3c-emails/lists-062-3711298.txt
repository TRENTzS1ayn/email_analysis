Hi Judy

Please accept my regrets for this meeting due to participation in OZeWAI
2001 (http://www.sunriseresearch.com.au/OZeWAI_2001/).

Outreach update - participated in the WCAG working group meeting in
Melbourne (http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2001/11/f2f-agenda.html) and reported on
EOWG activities during the Interst Group session.

Benefits - slow progress due work, conference and a dead computer.

Cheers,  Andrew
