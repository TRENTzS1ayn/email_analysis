Hi all,

These are my comments to the document:

1) Introduction - 2nd paragraph
I would change the word "Web Services" for "Internet Services". Nowadays 
the term web services have some technical implications

2) Increase market share ...
1st paragraph: sentence 2 and 3 contradict among themselves somehow, I 
would make one with only a figure.

* Improve usability for non-disabled and disabled visitors.
   "Text alternatives": replace "boon" (not common term for non-native) for
   benefit
* Support for Low Literacy Levels.
   1st paragraph: "... is not their first" replace by "is not their
   mother tongue"

Regards,
carlos
