Afraid I'm a regrets again - too many 1am's this week with WCAG WG and
OZeWAI.

> 1. Outreach updates

The OZeWAI conference (http://www.sunriseresearch.com.au/OZeWAI_2001/) was a
great success with around 140 people in attendance. Several attendees have
also expressed interest in joining various WAI working groups and Wendy,
Charles and I will follow up with them in coming weeks.

Now the conference is out of the way, I can work on this again. I will
endeavour to incorporate the changelog notes and EOWG list input by end next
week. Could minute takers from 14 and 16 November please let me have any
relevent notes from the teleconference discussions. I also had fruitful
discussions with a few members of WCAG WG during the week and have a good
sense of some of their concerns. Wendy Chisholm will be visiting Vision
Australia Foundation on Monday and we will discuss this document further.
(BTW Wendy gave a very good presentation at OZeWAI based around its
content.)

Cheers, Andrew
