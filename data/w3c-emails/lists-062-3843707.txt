Hello! Here is the URL for the Accessible Design Guidelines I mentioned at our meeting today:

http://www.dartmouth.edu/~webteach/resources/download.html

My aim with these guidelines is to take some of the more general guidance presented in the WCAG and pull it down to a practical, what to do, why to do it level that I think may be useful to the people who are writing Web code. I won't fill your mailboxes with all the usual disclaimers, but I do want to note that this is *very* much a work in progress and that I have not had adequate time and resources to do the job thoroughly. But I do continue to update and refine the document and would greatly appreciate feedback and suggestions from the group.

Best regards,
Sarah
