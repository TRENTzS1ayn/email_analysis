EOWG:

I'm forwarding, with Sarah's permission, a revision that she did to 
"Implementation Plan for Web Accessibility"

It should appear as an attachment to this message, and also be archived in 
the mailing list
         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-eo/

Her description about the changes follows, for those who want the details. 
But it may be easier to just look at the attachment, where the revisions 
are all integrated.

I think that this revision version reads much better!

Let's discuss this at our meeting today.

- Judy

>Hi Judy.
>
>I've enclosed an HTML version of the Implementation Plan document with my 
>revisions (implementation-SH.html). I also list the edits I made below, 
>with the original sentence first and my edit following, preceded by an 
>asterisk. I wasn't certain what your established procedures are re> 
>revisions so I tried to be really thorough in keeping track of any changes 
>I made.
>
>The main thing I did was to remove the categories, or to incorporate them 
>into the item where appropriate. Many times I found that the qualifier was 
>simply not necessary, but there were instances where one was needed and 
>for those I pulled it into the sentence. The other thing I did was to 
>standardize the language so that the level 1 bullets are more cryptic 
>(e.g., no articles) and the level 2 bullets are full sentences. That 
>seemed to be the convention so I just tried to apply it consistently 
>throughout the document.
>
>I think this is a highly useful document and I enjoyed getting to know it 
>better!
>
>Best regards,
>Sarah
