Hi Judy
Here is a summery of the comments I got on my first draft: From the Danish
web developing company:
it would be nice if we could some kind of certificate to use on the company
PR materials that shows the company is certified. ( we have talked about
this and I know it's impossible to put in the Implementation plan) In this
company they look for new employees who know about WAI and web
accessibility, and they encourage them to keep up-to-date in this area both
national and internationally ( I think it is because it's a rather large
company and they have many clients from the public sector) they always use
Bobby test  on new pages if the client has asked for accessibility in the
contract.
*Always make first drafts and concepts which are supposed to be shown to
clients according to WAI guidelines and recommendations. If the first draft
of a web page is made by graphical tools make sure that the use of color and
contrast is according to WCAG and always check before showing to clients.
Use internal checklists for different groups of staff or if few employees
make different checklists for different work areas e.g. graphical design,
programming, layout (CSS). This will make it easier to get an overview of
the checkpoints relevant for different pieces of work. Make sure that the
client have specified to what level of conformance the web site much comply
to and if necessary specify for each page..
Have contact to a group of end users from different disability communities
that can help with testing and tell staff about the use of AT and
demonstrate HPWD use the web. Establish contact between staff and other
accessibility experts e.g. by encouraging staff to use different existing
networks locally.

I have looked  at the Impl draft of October 29 and have some suggestions
Establish Responsibilities:
        Web design business: ..... for accessibility and any new
requirements from government e.g. legislation. If selling to other countries
keep track of development in these countries as well and remember EU
recommendations and/or legislation.
Select Software
        Web design business: When developing templates/content management
systems for clients to input content make sure they comply to ATAG and that
the pages they produce also are compliant with WCAG e.g. always prompt for
an ALT tag when inserting graphics.

I think we miss something about testing and monitoring for web design
business  like the bit starting with always  make first draft...* and
contact to persons with different disabilities for end user testing etc.
regards Helle
Sorry for the delay

Hi Helle,

Was wondering if you could send, or re-send if I missed them, the other
comments about implementation advice for Web design businesses. Thanks!
