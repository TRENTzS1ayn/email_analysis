Hi Sarah,

A few comments on what is done in Australia:

Government:
* web manager mailing lists
* web manager meetings
* external speakers - often attract wider audience
* setting minimum stds, and requiring reporting against them
* requirement for online action plans (see
http://www.govonline.gov.au/projects/strategy/AvailabilityOfOnlineActionPlan
s.htm)

Industry:
* awareness through industry action plans (eg Bankers, Multimedia)
* open forums (eg. CHISIG -

Cheers,  Andrew
