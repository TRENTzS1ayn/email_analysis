EOWG:

We have been getting low attendance at our monthly Wednesday afternoon 4:00 
p.m. (US Eastern Standard Time) EOWG meetings (the alternate time that we 
had established for those for whom the Friday morning 8:30 a.m. (US EST) is 
either too early or too late in the day).

My impression is that my lack of reminders sufficiently in advance has not 
helped attendance at these alternative time-slots, but also that those most 
wanting the alternate time slot had had a string of meeting conflicts which 
might not be a regular thing.

Rather than going ahead on short notice with the originally planned meeting 
for tomorrow afternoon, I'd like to ask for some feedback:

1. *Just* for those for whom EOWG's regular meeting time is inconvenient 
(8:30 a.m. EST on Friday) --  is 4:00 p.m. EST on Wednesday _generally_ a 
good time for you to meet? If not, what times would be better?

2. How many EOWG members would be available to attend an EOWG meeting next 
Wednesday December 12 at 4:00p.m., *regardless* of whether our regular time 
is convenient for you or not?

Please send individual responses to jbrewer@w3.org , unless you'd really 
like to discuss some part of this on the list.

Thank you,

- Judy
