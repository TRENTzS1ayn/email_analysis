One of the auxiliary resources that we have needed in order to complete the 
resource suite for "Implementation Planning for Web Accessibility" 
is  "Selecting Software for Developing Accessible Web Sites."

I've written a first draft of this, based on our discussion last week. 
There is no simple answer to give people on this issue at this time, but 
I've tried to capture some guidance on how to find out more information and 
make decisions about software selection.

Please note that it is set up as though it were part of the implementation 
planning resource suite, even though the other documents in the suite do 
not yet have matching navigation bars, nor are they linked to this draft yet.

Please take a look and let's discuss it at our meeting today:

Thanks,

- Judy
