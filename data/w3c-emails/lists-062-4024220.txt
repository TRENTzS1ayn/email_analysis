This is in fact derived from some W3C Working Drafts, and standard in EOWG 
drafts, although due for a change, but still for something as short as 
possible.

Date is there, at bottom of document, and serves as version identifier. 
There is a lobby to move it near top. There is another lobby to keep tops 
of WAI Resource docs free of as much doc status info as possible so reader 
can fall in. May re-try status links from doc top [editor - status - 
updated - copyright] to info at bottom of doc.

WAI Resource docs are edited in place, rather than w/ latest version URI's.

Experimenting w/ shortened version of all the nav links. Good to know which 
ones become the most confusing.

Right.

OK.

Difficult to tell which are up to date. Some of the dates are quite old & 
not clear whether there are later product versions.

Why not complete reviews?

Right.

This might leave some procurement people puzzled, particularly the part 
about trying to predict the future. But we can experiment with different 
tweaks of this.
