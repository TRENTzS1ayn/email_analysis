Comments on Sarah's excellent revision:

1. In: Establish Responsibilities (bullet 1)
         Establish coordination team with communication plan.

I can interpret this as either :
a) Establish coordination team and give it a communication plan.
or
b) Establish coordination team at the same time as a communication plan.

Which is the intended meaning? (My guess is the former, but since there is 
no further mention of a communications plan in that section, it is a little 
unclear to me.)

2. In: Select Software (bullet 1, sub-bullet 1)
         Organizations with decentralized software procurement practices 
may need guidance on the selection process rather than centralized purchase 
of software.

I'm not quite sure what this sentence means.

3. Would it make sense to have an internal link between the first mention 
of ongoing promotion plans in the "Develop Organizational Policy" section 
and the more detailed "Promote Organizational Awareness of Web 
Accessibility" section later in the document?

Chuck Letourneau
