I don't think this is a true assumption in the absolute sense of true. It is
often the case, but it is complicated by the fact that often big CMS
developers have millions of dollars of contracts at stake over accessibility,
and small companies do accessibility because of general design philosophy, or
to break into a niche market, or ignore it for similar reasons.

  Is this a true assumption? In some CMS it would be fairly easy to make some
  templates for user input that complies to WCAG or ATAG or both. The bigger
  problem as I see it is with the part of the CMS that involves some of the
  database stuff.
