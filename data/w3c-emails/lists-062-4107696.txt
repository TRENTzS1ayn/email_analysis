I think it is also really important that wherever the general feedback about
the site comes to, the people who are looking after accessibility have ready
access to it or get it automatically (according to workflow preferences,
etc).

  Hi Judy, Harvey, all,

  I agree with Harvey that all staff in an organization should have at least
  some mechanism for giving feedback on the accessibility of the
  organization's web site.  In order to do that effectively, all staff need
  sensitizing to the basics of web site accessibility or at least an overview
  (or three or four) on why this is a good idea.
