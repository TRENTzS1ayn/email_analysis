If you are not usually able to attend meetings at this time, you do _not_ 
need to send regrets; but please join us on Friday December 21 at our usual

>>EOWG:
>>
>>We have been getting low attendance at our monthly Wednesday afternoon 
>>4:00 p.m. (US Eastern Standard Time) EOWG meetings (the alternate time 
>>that we had established for those for whom the Friday morning 8:30 a.m. 
>>(US EST) is either too early or too late in the day).
>>
>>My impression is that my lack of reminders sufficiently in advance has 
>>not helped attendance at these alternative time-slots, but also that 
>>those most wanting the alternate time slot had had a string of meeting 
>>conflicts which might not be a regular thing.
>>
>>Rather than going ahead on short notice with the originally planned 
>>meeting for tomorrow afternoon, I'd like to ask for some feedback:
>>
>>1. *Just* for those for whom EOWG's regular meeting time is inconvenient 
>>(8:30 a.m. EST on Friday) --  is 4:00 p.m. EST on Wednesday _generally_ a 
>>good time for you to meet? If not, what times would be better?
>>
>>2. How many EOWG members would be available to attend an EOWG meeting 
>>next Wednesday December 12 at 4:00p.m., *regardless* of whether our 
>>regular time is convenient for you or not?
>>
>>Please send individual responses to jbrewer@w3.org , unless you'd really 
>>like to discuss some part of this on the list.
>>
>>Thank you,
>>
