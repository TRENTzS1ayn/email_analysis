hi all,

Since I missed last Friday's call, I send a couple of short comments (minutes 
are not posted, so apologies if this is closed).

In the section "Make Your Web Site Accessible," I would word the first point:
     *  Build accessibility into first drafts and site templates.

I consider the rest, a very good reference.

I would add an additional point in the section "Vendor Queries", in the category 
"When selecting new or replacement software", I would reword:
     Which applications are more conformant with ATAG 1.0?
into:
     Which applications are more conformant with ATAG 1.0, or at least
     do not overwrite markup introduced by the author?

Just some thoughts.

Regards,
carlos
