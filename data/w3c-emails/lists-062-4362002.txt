On April 23 I am speaking on Web accessibility at a Smart Communities 
conference in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada:

Smart City Summit http://www.smartcitysummit.com/
An international meeting of communities, companies and leaders. The Smart 
City Summit held in Ottawa is a major showcase of solutions that businesses 
will rely on in the next phase of the new economy.

For more information about the Government of Canada's Smart Communites 
programme see its web site: http://smartcommunities.ic.gc.ca/
Accessibility is a component of the programme.
