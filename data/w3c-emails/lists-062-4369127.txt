Some suggested changes after discussion on 5/Apr/02. Andrew

3. Conformance Evaluation

Introductory paragraphs with changes as discussed go here ...
  1.. Identify the targeted conformance level for the evaluation and clarify the scope of site to be evaluated: 
    1.. identify the target conformance level of WCAG 1.0 
    2.. choose page selections for manual checks and user testing if you are unable to carry out these tasks for the entire site. 
    These selections will include, at a minimum, representative pages for each different type of information presentation and interactive function on the site, and all top pages or topic entry pages to the site. 
    3.. identify an expanded page selection, or preferably the entire Web site for evaluation with semi-automatic tools. 
    If the entire site cannot be evaluated, then suggestions for inclusions in this expanded page selection are: pages from different sections of the Web site; pages representing different "look & feel"; pages representing different development tools and processes including those generated from databases; pages produced under different guidelines; pages produced by different groups in the organisation; "contact us" and "feedback" pages; interactive pages such as "search" or "subscribe"; pages critical to your business; etc. 
    4.. If any area of a site is excluded from evaluation, be sure to disclose this information.
