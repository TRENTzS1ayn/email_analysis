Hi all!

Here are a couple of tries to get us started on this item....

From 12 April 2002 change log:
Change log original wording:
"[20020412] for pages that are generated as a result of a query to a 
database, the source generated as the page is rendered should be fed back 
into the evaluation tool -- [requires operator intervention] "

Audrey's first passes - 12 April 12, 2002:
If the site permits queries of databases, for example seeking results from 
"submit" or "go" buttons or commands, feed the page resulting from the 
search back into the evaluation tool manually to check its accessibility, 
since it will not have been tested.

Or

Many sites permit queries of databases by means of "submit" or "go" buttons 
or similar commands. In these cases, feed the page resulting from the 
search back into the evaluation tool manually. Tools do not do this 
automatically and human intervention is needed.
