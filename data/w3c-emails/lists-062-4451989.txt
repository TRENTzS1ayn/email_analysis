These are sources for some of the bookmarkets (each tool is a small
JavaScript application which you can bookmark directly) that I was referring
during today's meeting to (not all accessibility related, but often good for
development and debugging):

1. http://www.508compliant.com/tools.htm
2. http://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/webdevel.html
    (and others at http://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/)
3. http://www.esatclear.ie/~phiznlil/opera/bookmarklets.html
4. http://www.sam-i-am.com/work/bookmarklets/dev_debugging.html
5. http://www.studioid.com/projects/bookmarklets/

Even EARL is in on the act - http://infomesh.net/2001/05/earl/bookmarklet/

Try your favourite search engine and look for "bookmarklet" - you'll be
surprised what turns up.

Cheers,  Andrew
