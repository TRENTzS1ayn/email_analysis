Has anyone seen this book? Is it as good as the WebReference review
indicates?

"Constructing Usable Web Menus" By Andy Beaumont, et al., Published by
Glasshaus

There is a good review at WebReference
(http://www.webreference.com/new/020411.html) which includes the "12 Rules
for Web Menu Usability" from the first chapter:

1.  Menus must be considerate of the user's main task
2.  Menus must be distinct from content
3.  Menus must be clearly readable
4.  Menus must be easily scanned for information
5.  Menus must be easily operated
6.  Menus must behave as your target user would expect
7.  Menus must load quickly as possible
8.  Menus must be consistent across a site
9.  Menus must put a higher premium on usability than branding
10. Menus must be localizable
11. Menus must be accessible to the handicapped
12. Menus must work on multiple browsers

Not a bad list.  Andrew
