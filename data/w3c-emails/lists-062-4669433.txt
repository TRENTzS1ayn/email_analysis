Hello Sarah and all,

I agree entirely with you about the importance of flexible design for peope 
with low vision.

In your suggestion :

>Change window width and screen resolution and observe whether the page 
>contents remain visible within the width of the browser window without 
>requiring horizontal scrolling. If not, check the page source for table 
>attributes and style sheet properties that are defined using absolute units.

I just replace "window width and screen resolution" by "window width or 
screen resolution".

Thanks for your contribution.
