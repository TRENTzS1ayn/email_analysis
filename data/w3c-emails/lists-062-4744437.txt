My belated regrets for last Friday's meeting. April 25th was ANZAC day in
Australia (http://www.anzacsite.gov.au/ &
http://www.dva.gov.au/commem/anzac/france.htm) and I took advantage of the
long-weekend to get out of Melbourne.

On April 17 Vision Australia Foundation held a successful "Designing for an
Accessible Web" workshop in Melbourne with 17 participants. It was one of
our most lively sessions so far with terrific interaction from the
participants - a mixture of public servants and web developers. In May we
will be running workshops in Perth and in Sydney
(http://home.vicnet.net.au/~webacces/#dates).
