In  http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/impl/eval/ - Introduction, first 
paragraph, first sentence:

I suggest we add "(WCAG 1.0)" after "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 
1.0" to associate the acronym with the expansion.  This is necessary since 
the acronym is used later without association. The alternative would be to 
use the <acronym> or <abbr> element on the first occurrence of "WCAG 1.0" 
later in the introduction.

By the way, is WCAG an acronym or and abbreviation? Some of us pronounce it 
as "whu-kag", which would make it an acronym, but some of us spell it out 
as "W. C. A. G." which would make it an abbreviation.  Please note: this 
question is not intended to distract anyone from more important editing 
efforts.  If anyone even mentions this on the conference call, I will hang 
up. <grin>
