I like its organization, and content including rationale explanations for 
the points
included. I'd like some graphics in it, with both alt text and link to long 
description,
to show the way to make them accessible.

I'm surprised that it includes a basic delivery form of PDF as well as the 
html version.
PDF is not the most accessible form. Internally the content allows PDF with 
the
expectation that it can be accessible.

"Use of ...PDF... is permissible if used in accordance with the standards
outlined in this document." Does that mean that the presence of the html
alternative means that the PDF version needn't be?
