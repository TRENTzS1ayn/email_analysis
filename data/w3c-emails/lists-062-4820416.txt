Currently:

Reviewing software procurement practices:
# Do procurement policies within the organization encourage or require
purchase of applications with more advanced support for accessibility?
# For organizations with a concentration of purchasing power, is there an
avenue through which to communicate the organization's interest in
ATAG-conformant software to vendors, so that they are aware of the demand
for these features?

Suggestion (statements vs questions):

Reviewing software procurement practices:
# Ensure that your organization's procurement policies encourage or require
the purchase of applications which are accessible and support accessibility.
# For organizations with a concentration of purchasing power, communicate
your organization's interest in ATAG-conformant software to vendors and
developers.

If this works for folks, then we may want to look at the rest of this
document in terms of statements (as suggestions) rather than convoluted
questions.

Cheers,  Andrew
