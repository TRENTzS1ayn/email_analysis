Outreach update:

On June 6 I will be presenting (in Ottawa) on Web accessibility to between 
35 and 60 Government of Canada communications officers and Web developers 
all from one organization.

On September 27 or 28 I am presenting at the PLAIN Conference 2002 
(sponsored by The Plain Language Association International) in 
Toronto.  The topic of my presentation will be how  WCAG encourages and 
facilitates "plain language" on the Web.
