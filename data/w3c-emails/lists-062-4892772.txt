Hello

I was wondering if anyone on the list can help me with this enquiry.

A member of staff at a local council in the UK has contacted me.  They are
putting a legal document on the web.  The document features use of
'strikethrough' to indicate to people reading the document that some phrases
are no longer valid.  However, some screenreaders are unable to interpret
strikethrough correctly.

Can anyone suggest an effective solution?  I was wondering about the acronym
tag... should this be used to support the strikethrough text so that
screenreaders can read it?
