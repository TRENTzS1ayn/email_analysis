The del element is correct HTML for dong this - applying a strikethrough
style to something else is risky and contravenes a WCAG priority 1
checkpoint. (So the question becomes whether there should be a specific note
that some screenreaders will not give a correct presentation of the
document).

Many browsers do implement ins and del - Lynx inserts a word at each end, and
most visual represenations I have seen use strikethrough.

  What about <del> (and <ins> for insertions) tag in html? Would that work?
  Then it would be possible to use CSS to present the del as strikethrough.
