  3. Regarding 2.2.5:

           questioning what printing page accomplishes (2.2.5) [20011030]
           [20020412] it is useful for some people, so we will leave this in,
  however it's not required and you don't have to use it.

  My concern isn't with the change log comment (which I agree with). The
  point currently reads "change the display color to black and white (or
  print out page on black and white printer) and observe whether color
  contrast is adequate."
  Question: Isn't black and white (i.e. 2-color) display or printing
  unrealistic or extreme?  Would this be better as "change the display color
  to gray-scale (or print out page on a gray-scale printer) and observe
  whether color contrast is adequate." ?

Well, 2 color is about the extreme limit of conditions that people have. On
the other hand, there are people who need that kind of setup, so I would
think it is a reasonable thing to do.
