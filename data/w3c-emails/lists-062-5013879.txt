Vision Australia Foundation ran a successful Web Accessibility Workshop in
Perth earlier this week.

Next week we are participating in the OZeCulture Conference
(http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/conference/) and running a
post-conference workshop
(http://home.vicnet.net.au/~webacces/0205-ozeculture.html)

On June 4 we are running a workshop in Canberra
(http://home.vicnet.net.au/~webacces/0206-canberra.html) in conjunction
with the National Framers Federation (http://www.nff.org.au/)

We are also currently working with The Learning Federation
(http://www.thelearningfederation.edu.au/content/index.asp) to assist
develpers of online educational modules to meet the highest practical level
of accessibility.
