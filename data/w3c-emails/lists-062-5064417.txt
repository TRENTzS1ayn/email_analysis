Hello chuck and all,

I just had a look at the document you pointed to and I am not able to find 
the changes you mentionned.

For example, you mention in 1. you changed the "as above" as suggested in 
the change log but I can't see the change.


I think if you repeat each time the list of tools in 3.3.2.1 and 3.3.3.1 
the document should be longer to read. I think it may be more simple to 
have a link to the list of tools.

I find this formulation ok, but still can't find the changes in the doucuments.
