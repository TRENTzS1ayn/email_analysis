well, people are relying on similar algorithms. This is a bit like asking an
inexperienced user to check with a speech browser - most users take a while
to learn how they work, so most tests only show how a small minority of naive
users will experience something. But I think it remains a useful test..

  I think my concern with two-color viewing or printing is that the algorithm
  that decides whether to replace a color with black or with white may lead
  to unrealistic contrast displays.  It would seem likely that some color
  combinations that would appear very similar in a good gray scale rendering
  (and thus be shown to have too low contrast) could be rendered very clearly
  if black and white were the only choices the system had.

  Maybe this is too unlikely a scenario. Unfortunately, I  don't have an
  example I can point at to support my concern - just a memory of having
  encountered the problem at some time in the past six years.  I don't think
  we need to pursue this further unless the working group has strong feelings
  about changing the point.

  Cheers!
  Chuck
