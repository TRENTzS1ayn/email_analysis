Hi all,

The URL from the GSA web site for the links to sites claiming AAA 
compliance, under the aegis of Center for Information Technology 
Accommodation (CITA), is 
 http://w3.gsa.gov/web/m/OLD_cita.nsf/Links/WCAGLevelAAA You have to dig to 
get here, but people are still going to do so, as I did.
By the way, we may also want to comment on the "Accessibility Aids" linked 
from the bottom of the GSA home page, 
http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/accessibilityaids.jsp  I think this page gives 
the impression that these plug-ins can assist with making a site compliant 
with Section 508.

Audrey
