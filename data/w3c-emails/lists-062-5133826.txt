As I mentioned on this morning's call, I used the three-hour hands-on
workshop scenario at http://www.w3.org/WAI/training/cr.html#designers  as
the basis for the class I taught to state vendors this week.

As I went through it, I found a couple of places where I would suggest some
additions:

1. Have participants display and navigate through an inaccessible site using
a screen reader OR a text-based browser -- OR -- show people the output of
an inaccessible Web site as generated through a Lynx emulator (~10 minutes).

I would change this to:

Have participants display and navigate through an inaccessible site using a
screen reader OR a text-based browser -- OR -- show people the output of an
inaccessible Web site as generated through a Lynx emulator. (new) If these
technologies are not available, use any browser with images turned off. (~10
minutes).

I would add a new #3 -

Ask participants to navigate several sites using streaming audio and/or
video with the speakers turned off.
