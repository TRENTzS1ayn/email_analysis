I think that simply stating, "don't use lynx on data tables" is not the 
solution to this change request.

The "problem" with using Lynx to evaluate the accessibility of data tables 
arises because it does not (in the release I use) expose accessible markup 
that an author may have added (i.e. headers, id, scope, etc.) that 
(theoretically) make the table accessible to web agents that support such 
code.

On the other hand, LYNX can still be used to show whether an author has 
designed a table to make sense when linearized.

Therefore I propose that something like the following note be added to both 
the preliminary and comprehensive sections (links to checkpoints could be 
added):

- start of note -

NOTE: LYNX cannot be used to verify compliance with WCAG Priority 1 
checkpoints 5.1 and 5.2 .   To do so, use a Web agent or assistive tool 
that can interpret advanced table markup.  If such a tool is not available, 
manually inspect the source code to determine if advanced table markup has 
been used.  Then, when a suitable tool becomes available, revisit the 
tables to ensure that the markup is reporting properly.  LYNX can, however, 
be used to verify compliance with WCAG Priority 2 checkpoint 5.3.

- end of note -

Comment 1:  I am not certain that any tools fully (or consistently) support 
all advanced table mark up yet.  Thus it is doubtful whether even visual 
inspection of code is entirely useful since we are essentially guessing how 
the markup might be interpreted by some future tool.  This is an enduring 
problem for people trying to achieve Double-A.

Comment 2: All this begs another question: should we distinguish between 
how we recommend the use of LYNX in a preliminary review and in a 
comprehensive review?

Discussion would be appreciated.
