I have updated the copy of "Evaluating Web sites for Accessibility" with 
changes we discussed on the May 24th call.
The URL is: http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/eval1.htm

1. Internal references from the comprehensive section to lists in the 
preliminary section have been replaced with the actual lists.

2. Wording for the color-contrast test has been changed.

3. As agreed, no further changes were made to the point about link 
availability and clarity.

Regards,
Chuck Letourneau
