Dear Judy and EOWG Members:

Greetings from Denton, Texas.

My regrets for tomorrow's meeting (technical support for classes/work,
including the Texas Woman's U. Library School's Accessible web design course -
I will be distributing W3C Quick Tips cards...) and the  June 14th meeting.  On
June 14th  I will be at the American  Library Assn. [ALA] Annual Conference in
Atlanta, much, if not most, well, all of the time, advocating for accessibility

- accessibility of the ALA website - which according to ALA's own
Accessibility Policy - http://www.ala.org/ascla/access_policy.html  - SHOULD be
accessible. 

See for instance, the conference website:
http://www.ala.org/events/annual2002/

- networking at ALA's exhibits with vendors about accessibility of their
products such as online catalogs, databases ...

- networking at ALA's 2d annual Accessibility Pavilion 

- presenting a poster at the ALA Diversity Fair on "A for Accessibility:
Ensuring LIS Education for Diversity and Equity of Access"

- presenting as a panelist about recruiting people representing (what I call)
the universal diversity of doing things differently to the library and info.
science profession

- helping to honor our 3rd Century Scholar for 2002, Christine Baynes .. See:
http://www.ala.org/ascla/awards_current.html#century

I will need to order more Quick Tips cards to distribute ....

I am still investigating the accreditation process ...  My trip to ALA should
be helpful in this regard.


Thanks very much for your advocacy,

Ellen Perlow
