Hi all,

I am kind of scary writing this, because the document "Evaluation Web Sites for Accessibility" has already a big status. It is also a good document, but I have some questions.

It is a fact and a good thing to realize that most of the passed legislation in several countries, for web site accessibility, is based on compliance with WCAG  priority 1 or 1 and 2.
That means that web sites have to comply with the checkpoints of these WCAG 1.0 priorities and that many web sites must be evaluated whether they are compliant with WCAG or not.

Shouldn't we make the document "Evaluating Web Site for Accessibility" more clear on how to evaluate a web site observing these checkpoints. Shouldn't we even make a document that clearly explains how to evaluate the compliance of each and all the checkpoint of the WCAG 1.0 applicable priorities.

Regards,
Henk Snetselaar
