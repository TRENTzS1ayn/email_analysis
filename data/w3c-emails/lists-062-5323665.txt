In Chuck's latest version of May 30 he writes:

..."JAWS is the only screen reader translated into Danish, and therefore in
Denmark, a trained evaluator should evaluate the Web site using JAWS.".. has
been changed  back to the older version:

..."JAWS is the screen reader provided by the Danish government, and
therefore a trained evaluator should evaluate the Web site using JAWS."...

I would like us to stick to saying that one should evaluate with JAWS
because of the translation and not because of what is provided by government
- I'll explain more on the call if necessary
