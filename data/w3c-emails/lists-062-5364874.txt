In today's call a couple of people mentioned web banking issues, so I'm
sharing this information in case you find it helpful. At the end is contact
information for Lainey Feingold, the attorney who has lead much of the web
accessibility efforts in the legal cases for website and online banking
accessibility. I strongly recommend contacting her if you want more
information on legal aspects in the U.S.!
