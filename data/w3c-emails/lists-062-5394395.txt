The quicktips are not dependent on the guidelines unless there is something
in them which the guidelines no longer recommend. So they can be updaqted
independently.

I believe that EO still has responsibility for them, and are the right group.
But I do think that any revision must be checked by the WCAG group for
technical accuracy.

  I presume the right time to produce this is after it becomes a recommendation.
