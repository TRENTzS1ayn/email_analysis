While I believe that the quick tips will always conceptually address the
issues in any WCAG document for the foreseeable future, I think there may be
a time around the later stages of the document (say, in Candidate or
Proposed Rec) that we and EO get together and discuss perhaps reordering
them. The WCAG 2 document doesn't substantially differ from anything in the
Quick Tips, but it has moved to a structure (Perceivable, Comprehensible,
etc.) that could translate well into Quick Tips.

That is to say, maybe the content of the Quick Tips itself doesn't need to
be changed, but the way it's organized could be modified to harmonize better
with WCAG 2.
