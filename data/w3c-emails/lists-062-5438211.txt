Here is the URL to the article I mentioned on Friday:

http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/10/technology/10NECO.html?todaysheadlines

And here are the specific questions I have on the selecting software document, which can be found here:

From Change Requests from 11 Feb 2002
1 Is this item a "not"? Hard to tell from the changelog.
2 I added A-Prompt to strategy 2 but wasn't sure how to add it to strategy 1.
3 This item does not seem related to selecting software or even strategies for working around software limitations. It's more of an accessible Web page authoring strategy.
4 and 5 Unclear from changelog what to do about language issues.

From Change Requests from 13 Feb 2002
1.1 I was uncertain where this items belongs. Is this a vendor question? Is this something you ask webmasters when considering authoring tool selection?
3.2 I would like some suggestions about what we can chop in the intro.
3.4 I do not know what this means.

I look forward to your feedback!

Best,
Sarah
