I am having some difficulty assembling coherent text from the various 
comments in the change log (there are 4 or 5 distinct entries) regarding 
sample selection in section 3 (Conformance eval) 
[http://www.starlingweb.com/eval2.htm#clg ].  I think part of the confusion 
arises because the current draft states "do either the entire site, or an 
expanded page selection".  (Expanded would have to be bigger than entire, 
which is logically impossible)

I think the following proposed change both solves the problem and shortens 
the section (both good outcomes).  Please comment:

3. Conformance Evaluation to WCAG 1.0

[add to introduction...]
To achieve full compliance every page on a site must be evaluated to the 
targeted conformance level.  If this is impractical because the site 
contains an uncommonly large number of pages (or page combinations in a 
dynamically generated site), then a smaller, but highly representative set 
of pages may be evaluated.

3.1 Identify scope of site to be evaluated, and the targeted conformance 
level for the evaluation:

[replace current sections 3.1.1, 3.1.2, 3.1.3 with]

3.1.1. identify and clearly disclose:
the entire Web site including all pages at a base URL;
OR (but only if evaluating the entire site is impractical)
a page selection which includes at least one of each different type of page 
on the site, and all top pages or entry pages to the site. NOTE: on web 
sites with database driven dynamically generated web content, generate 
broadly representative samples, freeze, and test the output;
3.1.2 identify the target conformance level of WCAG 1.0
