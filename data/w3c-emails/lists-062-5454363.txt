I have published a new working draft (dated 12 June 2002) at:
http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/eval2.htm
The previous working draft is linked from the new document for comparison 
purposes.

Reference links in this message are to changes in the new draft. I also 
captured and uploaded a copy of the changelog to 
http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/changelog.htm
My version of the changelog includes links from newly "DONE" items to the 
corresponding place in the working draft copy. This may help in discussions 
or review.

1. For the first point in "Change requests from April 12, 2002" I added
"NOTE: on web sites with database driven dynamically generated web content, 
generate broadly representative samples, freeze, and test the output;"
in sections 2.1 [http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/eval2.htm#cla ] and 3.1.1 
[http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/eval2.htm#clb ]

2. My solution for the next three points in "Change requests from April 12, 
2002" was to add a new sub-section in section 4. Considerations for 
Specific Contexts:
"Evaluation of database driven dynamically generated web content"
[http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/eval2.htm#clc ]

3. Added
"NOTE: Some of these manual checks can be performed by changing settings or 
preferences in the browser, some may require changes to operating system 
settings, and some may require additional software."
in 2.2 [http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/eval2.htm#cld ]

4. Added:
"Notice: Sections 3 and 4 of this document are being considered for 
separate publication as a W3C "Note"."
in section 3 introduction [http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/eval2.htm#cle ]

5. Modified introduction to read:
"While it does not provide checkpoint-by-checkpoint testing techniques" it 
does include tips for evaluation during development of Web sites, and for 
monitoring of established Web sites.  Other resources will be developed for 
in-depth compliance testing."
