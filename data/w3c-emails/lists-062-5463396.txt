In 2.1 [http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/eval2.htm#cla ]  I added (as 
indicated in the change log):
"Note: on web sites with database driven dynamically generated web content, 
generate broadly representative samples, freeze, and test the output;"

Questions:
1a) Will "freeze" be understood?  (Will it translate?)
1b) If not, can anyone think of a different (better) way to state this 
requirement?

Regards,
Chuck
