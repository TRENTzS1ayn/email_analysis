I don't think the word "Freeze" is a problem, but can we expect  that the
person doing this kind of review knows how to "freeze" the generated
samples? Would it be better to explain how to collect the samples   instead
of just saying that one should freeze the pages - maybe my concern is part
of me being uncertain about how you guys would "freeze" a representative
sample of pages from a web site?
Cheers

Subject: Evaluating Web sites draft: freeze pages?
 

In 2.1 [ http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/eval2.htm#cla
<http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/eval2.htm#cla>  ]  I added (as indicated in
the change log): 
"Note: on web sites with database driven dynamically generated web content,
generate broadly representative samples, freeze, and test the output;"
Questions: 
1a) Will "freeze" be understood?  (Will it translate?)
1b) If not, can anyone think of a different (better) way to state this
requirement?

Regards,
Chuck
