I have had some useful discussions on this topic with Carlos Velasco, Alan 
Chuter and Helle Bjarn?.  New proposed wording:
Note: on web sites with database driven dynamically generated web content, 
generate broadly representative samples, capture and test the pages as 
rendered in the browser (i.e. templates plus content).

By the way, does anyone think we might have been referring to pages that 
automatically refresh with new content when we said "freeze"?

Regards,
Chuck
