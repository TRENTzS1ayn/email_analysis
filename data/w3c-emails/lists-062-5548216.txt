Judy,

In "1. Introduction"

In both the simple and comprehensive policy statement examples you create 
reference-links to the relevant guideline and conformance level.  In each 
link-pair both go to the top of the same document (i.e. the 
guideline).  This might be confusing if people expect distinct links to go 
to distinct targets.   Should these be combined to just one link in each case?

Also confusing: in the comprehensive example the same link text, 
"Conformance Level A",  links in the first occurrence to WCAG and the 
second occurrence to ATAG.  This un-distinct link text problem would vanish 
if each pair of links were combined.

In "4. Define scope of Web site(s)"

Second major bullet:  I don't think that ", but as part of main site" 
belongs inside the parentheses. But, whether inside or outside, I am not 
really sure what you are trying to say here.

Regards,
Chuck
