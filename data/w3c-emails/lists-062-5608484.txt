Here are some thoughts on assessment of dynamically generated page content:

1. Does the content of every dynamically generated page have consistent content
with respect to accessibility? If so a single sample can suffice. If not, seek
consistent classes that represent these differences for testing?

2. Does generated content drawn from database meet accessibility 
requirements for
all images, alt texts, and if needed the longdesc? [require these in database.]

3. Does the generated tab order from the template allow getting to the 
generated text
content effectively?

4. Do generated data tables have accessibility aids: captions, ids on th 
header cells
and axis idrefs in th data cells?

5. If generated video, is it captioned?

6. If generated audio narrative, is textual equivalent available?
