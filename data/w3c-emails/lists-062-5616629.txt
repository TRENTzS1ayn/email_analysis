You could be testing the database itself, too:

Does it produce alternative information? If not then the problem should be
fixed there first. If it does, proceed...

Does the database conform to ATAG 3.1 and require alternative information? If
it confirms to 4.1 (check for errors) you can then just ask it if there are
any objects that don't have the right alternatives.

If not, you need to test not only that it can do this for the relevant
combinations - images, audio description and subtitles/captions for movies,
etc - But you also need to test each entry in the database.

  Here are some thoughts on assessment of dynamically generated page content:

  1. Does the content of every dynamically generated page have consistent content
  with respect to accessibility? If so a single sample can suffice. If not, seek
  consistent classes that represent these differences for testing?

  2. Does generated content drawn from database meet accessibility
  requirements for
  all images, alt texts, and if needed the longdesc? [require these in database.]

  3. Does the generated tab order from the template allow getting to the
  generated text
  content effectively?

  4. Do generated data tables have accessibility aids: captions, ids on th
  header cells
  and axis idrefs in th data cells?

  5. If generated video, is it captioned?

  6. If generated audio narrative, is textual equivalent available?
