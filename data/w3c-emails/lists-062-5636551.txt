Hello Andrew,

You Wrote: How do your sites store images and objects for later retrieval?
Does the database insist on having ALT text and other image or object
attributes stored with the images/objects? Does the http server always
retrieve these attributes and send them back to the browser with the built
page?

Doyle:  One of our technicians replied 'No, the database does not insist on
having alt text and other image or object attributes stored with the
images/objects'.  This person has a visual disability.  He has some
awareness of the issues involved.  

His observed that retrieval depended upon whether or not the coders did the
retrieval coding concerning the built page.  I discussed with him how the
law requires those things, and he started to get a different picture of what
the programmers are supposed to be doing.
Thanks,
Doyle
