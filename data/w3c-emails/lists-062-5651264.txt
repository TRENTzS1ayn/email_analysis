Checkpoint 11.3 - - Provide information so that users may receive documents
according to their preferences.
http://www.w3.org/WAI/wcag-curric/sam89-0.htm states:
"If it is not possible to use content negotiation at a server level, in HTML use
'hreflang' with the <A> or <LINK> elements to identify the language of the
target documents."

To meet checkpoint 11.3 for a site without content negotiation, is it sufficient
to use 'hreflang' in all <A> links to content?  Further - if Checkpoint 4.3 is
met, will 11.3 also be met if 'hreflang' is only used in <A> links to content in
languages other than that for the referring document?
