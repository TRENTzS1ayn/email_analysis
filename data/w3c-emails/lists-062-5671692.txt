I agree that we should drop 'features'. It indicates testing 'things' rather
than characteristics of the whole page. Accessibility 'issues' or 'aspects'
might be better.

I like the phrase 'usability testing under accessibility conditions', it
captures the idea exactly, in a way that just 'usability testing' doesn't.

It needs to be clear that this is ultimately about sitting a real person in
front of the terminal.

In reference to the following messages:

From: Chuck Letourneau

Changed "usability testing" to "user testing of accessibility features" at
[http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/eval2.htm#clj ].
Also changed heading for section 3.4 from "Usability evaluation" to "User
testing of accessibility features" at
[http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/eval2.htm#clk ]

"usability testing" and "user testing of accessibility features"
are different. Maybe "accessibility testing by users" is more precise. The
term "accessibility features" gives me this impression that only specific
features concerned with accessibility are tested, which is very different to
usability testing.

I second Alan's concern with "user testing of accessibility features"

First issue: many people use the term "user testing" to mean "usability
testing". So there is really no distinction between the two for most people.
And I feel very strongly that "usability testing" is a much better term than
"user testing". (Which I can elaborate on if necessary.)

Second issue: limiting it to "accessibility features" could be interpreted
as just testing a specific accessibility feature (e.g., when I change font
size in browser, thee fonts change on the page) versus the usability of the
entire page under "accessibility conditions" (e.g., that large fonts don't
cause unnecessary horizontal scrolling).

So, the question is: What was the intention behind the change? Was it only
to specify usability testing for accessibility issues, versus general
usability testing? Was it to clarify that we mean usability testing under
accessibility conditions (e.g., with person who is blind and uses a ascreen
reader, etc.)?

OK, now I'm suppose to suggest wording to provide a concrete "strawman" for
discussion - so here goes:

location: 3. 4. title
working draft 13 June: "User testing of accessibility features"
suggested change: "Usability testing for accessibility"

location: first sentence in 3. Conformance...
working draft 13 June: "A comprehensive evaluation combines semi-automatic,
manual, and user testing of accessibility features."
suggested change: "A comprehensive evaluation combines semi-automatic,
manual, and usability testing."

location: 4. ... Ongoing monitoring, NOTE at end of section
working draft 13 June: "Steps like repeated user testing may only be
required after major template or content changes."
suggested change: "Steps like repeated usability testing may only be
required after major template or content changes."
