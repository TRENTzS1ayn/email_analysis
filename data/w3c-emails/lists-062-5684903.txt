is the well-written.excerpt, Chapter 4 Accessible Techniques in the 
Financial Industry.
At the original recommendation of the Canadian National Institute for the 
Blind, a nearly
blind employee  years ago helped get support from RBC Financial Group. 
Stories from other
RBC employees are included. I have ordered the book and look forward to 
reading it.

====
I note that that page from Amazon is particularly and unnecessarily 
inaccessible! It has 153 tabs,
no alt text, and content starting after tab 124.

Their main page has 160 tabs (according to the WAVE view) of which tab 1 
provides a list of  34
tabbed topics, and some others are also lists of topics. Number 158 gets a 
Text Only version, with only 133 tabs. The good news is that if you ever 
find the text-only version and select it, sometimes
that choice seems to persist to subsequent pages.

I've just written to Amazon about the opportunity they have to provide more 
accessible web pages.
