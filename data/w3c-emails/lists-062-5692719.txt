Thanks to Alan Chuter and Shawn Lawton Henry for their discussion on this 
topic.  (See thread).  In spite of that, your editor is having some 
difficulty in working out the fine distinctions being suggested and would 
appreciate some help. Any chance the the working group could review this 
thread and reach a consensus on the wording?  I have assembled the thread 
here for ease of reference:

>I second Alan's concern with "user testing of accessibility features"

>First issue: many people use the term "user testing" to mean "usability
>testing". So there is really no distinction between the two for most people.
>And I feel very strongly that "usability testing" is a much better term than
>"user testing". (Which I can elaborate on if necessary.)
>
>Second issue: limiting it to "accessibility features" could be interpreted
>as just testing a specific accessibility feature (e.g., when I change font
>size in browser, thee fonts change on the page) versus the usability of the
>entire page under "accessibility conditions" (e.g., that large fonts don't
>cause unnecessary horizontal scrolling).
>
>So, the question is: What was the intention behind the change? Was it only
>to specify usability testing for accessibility issues, versus general
>usability testing? Was it to clarify that we mean usability testing under
>accessibility conditions (e.g., with person who is blind and uses a ascreen
>reader, etc.)?
