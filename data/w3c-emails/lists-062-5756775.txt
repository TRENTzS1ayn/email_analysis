After three days, my ISP's server is finally back up. Here are some changes 
I made on June 17.

Draft working copy is still at http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/eval2.htm

Change log references are to http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/impl/changelog

Changes:

DONE/20020617/CL [eval-001]
DONE/20020617/CL [eval-002]

I redrafted section 3.1 as per to June 14 discussions. See 
http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/eval2.htm#eval001
Also:
         - removed "expanded page selection" from 3.2.1
         - removed "expanded page selection" from 3.4
         - retained "expanded page selection" in 3.5.1 because it makes 
sense here to refer back to the new "note" in 3.1.3

DONE/20020617/CL [eval-003]
Added a note expanding "disclosure" at 
http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/eval2.htm#eval003

DONE/20020617/CL [eval-004]
replaced occurrences of "freeze" with "capture content" equivalent.

DONE/20020617/CL [eval-005]
added note to explain "relevant checkpoints" in 3.3.1. See
http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/eval2.htm#eval005

DONE/20020617/CL [eval-006]
revised 3.3.3 to clear up the confusion between voice and text browser 
testing.  See http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/eval2.htm#eval006
Also see related question on list with "Subject: Evaluating Web sites: 
clear and simple text"
