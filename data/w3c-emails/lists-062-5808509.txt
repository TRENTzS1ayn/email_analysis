Greetings,

I am a little delayed in doing this but ...

I am attaching the text version of the article I wrote on web accessibility
in About Campus, Volume 7 , No. 1, 2002 . This file has been revised to
match the published version.  If I have forwarded a copy to you in the
past, please discard it.

If you quote this in any way, please be sure to acknowledge About Campus
Journal. Hard copy of the Journal can be ordered from Jossey-Bass at
http://www.josseybass.com/cda/product/0,,0787962848,00.html If you are part
of a University, someone in the Student Services area might have a copy.
This is the Journal of the American College Professional Association.
