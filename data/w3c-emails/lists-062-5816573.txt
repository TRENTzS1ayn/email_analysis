Hi Harvey,

I have attempted to incorporate (most of) your suggestions into the 
Evaluating Web Sites for Accessibility document.  See Section 4 at 
http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/eval2.htm#dynamic

I added them as sub bullets under (I think) the appropriate 
bullets.  However, I am not entirely sure this level of detail is 
appropriate for this document.  Perhaps the group could discuss this on the 
Wednesday or Friday call.

Regards,
Chuck
