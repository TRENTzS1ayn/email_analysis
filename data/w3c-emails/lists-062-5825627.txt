Changes made on June 26.

Draft working copy is still at http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/eval2.htm

Change log references are to http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/impl/changelog

Changes to:

In section 4 subsection "Evaluation of legacy sites"
o clarify differences between #2 and #4 on legacy sites [20011030]
?       [20020426] clarify that step #2 is internal and step #4 is 
external. break apart #1.
Edits: I split point 1 into two points; made it clearer that point 3 (old 
point 2) is to inform the owner about needed changes; and that point 5 (old 
point 4) is to disclose publicly any unresolved accessibility problems.

In section 1 "Introduction"
o        provide more context [20011102]
[20020503] we try not to make our documents redundant with each other, but 
we will provide more pointers. need to add in a sentence to hang it on.
Edits: I added a sentence (with link): "For information about why making 
Web sites accessible is important read the Introductions on the WAI 
Resources page."

In section 3.2.2
  * I don't think you need the commas around "on page selection" in point 2.
Edits: I removed the commas.

In section 4, subsection "Evaluation of database driven dynamically 
generated web content", I took a stab at adding examples based on Harvey 
Bingham's note (see archive 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-eo/2002AprJun/0143.html)
