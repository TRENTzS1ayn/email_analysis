Hmm. Charmane located the problem and Chuck found out why it happened. So I
think I don't really deserve a massive amount of credit here...

It would seem that Charmane is using one of the broken browsers that don't
work if they can't find a stylesheet (there are a few versions of netscape
with this problem - are there others?). So I would recommend a slightly more
robust browser if possible. There are many newer versions of Netscape taht
don't have that bug (it was fixed in 4.something and they are now producing
7.0 as a public beta...)

  Interesting.  An artifact of IE's use of <title> to create the directory

  Thanks for debugging that, Charles.

  Cheers!
