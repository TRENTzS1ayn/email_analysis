Outreach Updates

I have just spent two days in workshops with four new developers engaged by
The Learning Federation (http://www.thelearningfederation.edu.au/) to
develop online learning modules for mathematics. TLF require all modules
developed under contract to be as close to Triple-A as possible - an
admirable goal, but a trifle difficult as most developers have chosen to
use Flash. One of Vision Australia Foundation's tasks will be to translate
WCAG to Flash where applicable to ensure that the WCAG principles and
guidelines are adopted as far as possible.
