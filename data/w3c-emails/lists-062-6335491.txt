EOWG:

There is a new & improved
         "New & improved "Selecting & Using Authoring Tools for Web 
Accessibility"
at:
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/impl/software4.html
which will be part of our agenda for Friday January 18;
comments welcome on the list as well.

Latest features include:
- improved navigation... hopefully...
- cleaned up text in existing sections
- new section on
         "working around limitations of existing authoring tools"
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/impl/software4.html#limitations
- and in that section you'll find
         "examples of strategies to work around limitations of existing 
authoring tools"
         based on discussion in our Wednesday January 16 meeting
         (minutes coming)
Please review carefully.
Changelogs to check what's done & undone:
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/impl/changelog#20020116
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/impl/changelog#20020111
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/impl/changelog#20020104
Note some remaining questions in changelogs.

Note also the navigation mock-up for "suitenav2" at
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/impl/training
         which can also be accessed (temporarily) by the suite nav bar on
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/impl/software4.html
         this nav set-up seems to still need help.

Please note also that the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines Working 
Group is interested in meeting with us on this resource.

Please read & comment; let's get this one done.

Thanks,

- Judy
