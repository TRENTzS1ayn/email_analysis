Whenever the document uses generic references make such links to examples 
thereof; e.g., when mentioning "...WYSIWIG HTML
editors;conversion tools..." link those to a "for example" list. In 
particular the proposal for genericizing "document format, presentation, 
mixed media" in example 4 of "Examples of strategies" could link to the 
"for example" list Chuck suggested so that PDF isn't singled out in the 
base document but appears along with its counterparts elsewhere - same for 
PowerPoint and Flash.

Although this will create a forest of inline links, it will make much 
faster reading for anyone who knows what's referenced without having to 
wade through a list of conversion tools in the base document.
