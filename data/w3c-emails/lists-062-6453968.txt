  If the structure and meaningful content are standardized, as with
  Dublin Core, then the values can be used. Are there any authoring tools
  to help generate and validate such metadata?

CMN There is a reference in the techniques information to using metadata for
searching multimedia files - look in the techniques references for the name
"Hunter" (Jane Hunter is the author of the paper in question) from teh latest
techniques draft at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/ATAG-TECHS

  Metadata is a possible subject for joint EO/AT discussion.

  Has the Authoring Tools group assessed the RDF Site Survey (RSS) work,
      http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-dev/files/specification.html
  which includes modules for Dublin Core metadata and Syndication.

I don't think the group has specifically considered RSS. It is true that the
group should work more on metadata techniques, especially in light of WCAG
checkpoint 13.2 - which implies that WCAG should work more on them too, for
example in explaining what kind of data is required by that checkpoint.
