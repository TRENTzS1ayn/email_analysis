Development of ANSI/NISO Z39.86-200x V1.0.0
"File Specifications for the Digital Talking Book"

    http://www.niso.org/standards/resources/Z38.86-200X.html

Six XML document type definitions (DTDs) are being developed for the draft NISO standard, Z39.86-200x, Version 1.0.0, File Specifications for the Digital Talking Book (DTB).

    http://www.loc.gov/nls/z3986/v100/index.html

These draft documents are currently being updated as a result of public comment. All but one of the over 40 public member comments approved the progressing to standard.

My contribution has been to the XML Application for marking up the text
of books. Soon the revision to the dtbook100.dtd -- dtbook110.dtd and
its accompanying documentation  -- dtbook110.htm  will be available,
from the site.
