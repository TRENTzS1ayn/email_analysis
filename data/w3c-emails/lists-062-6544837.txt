  Selecting and using Authoring Tools
  (http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/impl/software4)

        Selecting new or replacement software:
           extra question - Can a suite of tools be established to provide
  the accessibility that the prefered authoring tool lacks?

The tools listed as repair tools atthe ER group's page for such things
http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/existingtools.html would be a starting point. That
group was initially created with a charter that included producing such a
suite, as I recall, but there isn't a complete suite yet.

        Working around limitation of existing tools
           Do we need to include a point about 'correcting accessibility
  issues' as part of hte last point?
           Examples
             3. "... in conjunction with a caption ..."
             4a. "print media (...)" -> "print media (pagemaker, quark
  express, acrobat)"
             4b. "rich media (...)" -> "rich media (flash, director)"
             4c. "presentation formats" -> "presentations"
             6/7. dtd & css tools - should we point to any?
             8 - what about the WAVE  for checking?

  Cheers,  Andrew
