I hope it has not gone unnoticed that I've chosen a rather small/personal 
means of protesting a trend I abhor in W3C. It is summed up by Lawrence 
Lessig in recent alarms, including a book. The fundamental message is at 
http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/future/ and my semi-withdrawal from "things 
consortium" is a (quixotic?) tilting at what so many of my "surrogate 
grandchildren" have helped build: a hopeful road to inclusion - everyone, 
everything connected.

The groups to which I still subscribe (but only minimally participate in) 
are central to preventing a disturbing slide by W3c towards the abyss that 
has swallowed many past promises. I urge each of us to do whatever is 
possible to stop this trend with a new dedication to inclusion. We cannot 
hope to "change the world" if "the world" is allowed to step into/upon our 
doings. We have to eat our own dog food.

Love.
