If one uses the URI http://www.w3.org/WAI/flyer/  (WAI flyer information
page)  there is a link to a list of all the available translations, and
links to ordering information and more. I suggest we use this URI to the
flyer instead of the present http://www.w3.org/WAI/flyer/flyerfront  which
takes you directly to the English version of the  WAI Flyer document. I get
the English from my PC at work, and not the Swedish I got from my PC at
home, last Friday.
