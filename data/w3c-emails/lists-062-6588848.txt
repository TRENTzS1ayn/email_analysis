W3 has a corporate ethos, and unfortunately the european-open 
source-"socialist" version isn't yet nascent.

The commons originally would in all probability have had a wider gamut.
Once named it became circumscribed, and that is the object of w3.

The 'true' commons will arise out of the actions of the people, not the 
representatives of corporations.

thanks
