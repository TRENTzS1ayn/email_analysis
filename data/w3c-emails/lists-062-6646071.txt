AUWG, EOWG,

For Monday, 11 February 2002, AUWG meeting, part of the meeting's agenda 
will concern the EOWG draft resource:
         "Selecting and Using Software for Web Accessibility"
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/impl/software4

(FYI this is part of an implementation planning resource, the latest draft 
of which is at:
         http://www.dartmouth.edu/~shorton/eowg/implementation/10jan2002.html
also viewable in its "collapsed" format (but currently with older content), 
which will be the first format people arrive at if going to the suite:
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/impl/ )
(Note -- the links & back-links between versions are not up to date)

For EOWG members, a reminder that this is a joint meeting with AUWG today, 
at their regular meeting time, which is:

         12:00 p.m.(noon) US Eastern Standard Time
         Telephone: +1.617.761.6200
         Conference number: 2894

The EOWG is interested in AUWG's feedback about the "Selecting and Using 
Software..." resource. EOWG plans to circulate this document shortly for 
broader feedback.

- Judy
