I agree with Charles's second comment:

I also think that the point about whether the review is up to date or not
is in the review page maintained by ATAG, so EO should just point to it
with perhaps a small mention about the purpose that ATAG maintains the
list.

Some additional comments:

a. One page & 3 columns.  The 7 guidelines for ATAG should be moved out of
the introduction and into the checklist.  Some of the other introductory
materials in the later section could be moved into the Into section so the
whole document could be collapsed to one page.  Using a visual one page of
information is key to communicating to the masses.  I believe a 3 column
approach would also be helpful here, that of course transforms gracefully
to a linear mode.

b. More graphics.  Need more graphics or diagrams or something besides so
much text.  EO should be concerned about communications, and pictures are
better to communicate with the masses of non-blind web developers and
managers.  The alt text can and should transform to the text-heavy version.
Besides, the technical stuff is in the guidelines and technique docs and
should not be so "technical looking" in the EO materials.
     - for example; the checklist should look like a checklist, not a
simple numbered list [1]
     - another example; use the ATAG icons for types of authoring tools [2]
