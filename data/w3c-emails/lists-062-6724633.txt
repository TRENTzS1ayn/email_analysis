>This is an incredibly important topic for the future of the web, and I'd

>CSUN 2002 (http://www.csun.edu/cod/conf2002/proceedings/195.htm), which

>The other issues raised in this thread of software design/development and

>been enough emphasis given designing and developing quality
>software the first time, so almost all software has to be "retrofitted"

>(http://www.sei.cmu.edu/collaborating/spins/).   The major barrier to 
>standards compliance, intertwined with the intellectual property issue, is
>that the software industry is still locked into the prevailing paradigm of 
>the Industrial age (ruthless competition over exclusive physical 
>resources, excessive wasting of natural resources, information hording, and
>mass-market manipulations).   I believe the work of Paul Hawken, Amory and 
>Hunter Lovins provide insights into an emerging paradigm to challenge at 
>least some of these practices (see Natural Capitalism link
