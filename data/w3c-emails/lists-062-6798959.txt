The AUWG site has two different pages listing web authoring tools: 1)
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/2002/tools 
2)  http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/tools   and a third named Authoring Tool
Conformance Reviews  http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/reviews/ .
1) is a table and includes information about reviews; this is also the
newest page date February 5 2002. I haven't checked if this page contains
more tools than 2) the tools are grouped different on the 2 pages. I'm not
on the AU-list but maybe Jan or others from the AUWG can explain the
differences and tell us which link we should use in our document? Personally
I prefer 1) where you can see all the tools, if there is a review and the
date of the review. I haven't checked if the table is accessible. On the web
authoring tools document we link to Authoring Tool Conformance Reviews
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/reviews/  here you can't see the date of the
reviews in the list, maybe we should ask AU to change the review page to
include the information about versions and dates of reviews?
