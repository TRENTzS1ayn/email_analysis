Hi, EOWG folks-

I recently activated in EOWG and am writing to introduce myself. A bit is
below and a more detailed bio blurb is at
http://www.uiaccess.com/profile.html.

I began focusing on accessibility about 4 years ago and have worked pretty
much exclusively in accessibility for the last 2+ years. I am now an
independent consultant (although not originally by choice, I'm much happier
now without having to deal with company shtuff). Previously I worked for
Optavia Corp (www.optavia.com) and before that Compuware Corp. Most of my
work experience is related to user interface design. Initially I worked
mostly with software, and now most of my work is with web pages and web
applications.

Most of my efforts are spent teaching and mentoring people in IT
accessibility. I've run a few dozen accessibility workshops for
organizations and presentations for conferences (listed at
http://www.uiaccess.com/pres.html). My particular particularly interest is
in bringing together the needs of individuals and the goals of organizations
in the design of human-computer interfaces.

Early on I worked with Wendy Chisholm and promotion of W3C WAI activities
has always been paramount in my work. I haven't been able to actively
contribute much to WAI in the past because my company couldn't afford the
time and I had no energy because of health limitations (from multiple
sclerosis). Now that I'm free from having to account for all my time to a
company and I'm in remission, I plan on helping where I can.

I look forward to working with you!

Cheers,

- Shawn
