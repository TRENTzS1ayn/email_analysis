Some time ago you asked for items for discussion at the CSUN Face-to-Face
of the EOWG in late March.

Andrew Arch and I thought it might be useful to begin discussions about how
best to promote the issue of accessible design into the mainstream software
development industry. I am thinking of things like a resource material for
Tertiary Lecturers to incorporate as part of their courses; a structured
strategy across the world to get a place at key mainstream IT conferences;
a concerted attack on the IT media, including "testimonials" from those few
in the mainstream industry that have done some good work; "awards" events
and so on.

With the work on the business case nearly complete, we now have the
material we need to begin a more assertive approach to proselytising. Up
until now we have made minimal impact on the mainstream industry (at least
in Australia). I believe we need to focus on getting some more value out of
the great work that the EOWG has done over the past few years.

What do you think?
