after converting some HTML files into XHTML - i tested the pages in 
Bobby and they failed. yesterday i emailed cast.org and asked about 
this...

here is their response:

"Thank you for your comments. We hope to accommodate XHTML better in a 
future version. Part of the problem is finding a suitable parser. "

How can CAST claim that their validation tool is W3C compliant and not 
support the new mark-up standards?  

Can developers be asked to be W3C compliant when the testing tools are 
insufficient? 

Does anybody know of a validation tool that parses XHTML?


Solid validiation tools need to be developed and made available for the
general public.
