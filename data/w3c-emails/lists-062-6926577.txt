Sean,

Great, thanks for working on this. Comments below:

Aha, great.

Well, I wonder if the "clear" is even necessary, that was added by a 
colleague to avoid a different problem, and I'm not sure that problem would 
have actually happened. But if <P> works, so be it.

Ah, I had had that, but taken it out at some point thinking, erroneously, 
that it might have contributed to the jumping problem.

Doesn't work in my old Opera either.

This is deliberate. The idea is to be sure to have some redundant way of 
differentiating the hovered-over or active link. For people who can't pick 
up the yellow highlight, the dropping out of the underline is also a cue. 
The fact that the dropping out is transitory means that people can still 
observe the underlining most of the time.

Shawn, this is really helpful. I will try this on a few other pages, and 
then ask for more feedback and for confirmation that the phantom jumping 
hover doesn't re-emerge from the swamps. Actually, what I'll do now that 
I've gotten back access to direct style sheet editing through emacs, is to 
build these into one style sheet which we can tweak, rather than tweaking 
individual pages which is not the way we ordinarily do our site here.
