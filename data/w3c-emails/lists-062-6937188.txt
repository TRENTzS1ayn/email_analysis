EOWG:

Several people have emailed me that they had difficulty dialing into the 
phone bridge for today's call. I did not see these messages till after the 
call; sorry.

I will be arranging to have our call moved to a different bridge in the 
near future, but in the meantime, if you tried to dial in today but could 
not get through, would you please send mail to me at jbrewer@w3.org.

Thank you,

Judy
