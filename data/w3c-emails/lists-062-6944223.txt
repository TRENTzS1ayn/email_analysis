On another WAI list, Al Gilman refers to this excellent video by Neal Ewers 
that should be on
the WAI Resources page. It certainly makes clear why what WAI is doing is 
important.

If you are facing a group that systematically hasn't got the first clue ... 
I recommend
something like Neal Ewers's little video:
     "Introduction to the Screen Reader "
