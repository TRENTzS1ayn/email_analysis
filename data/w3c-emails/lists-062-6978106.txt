EOWG:

Due to schedule conflicts we will not be meeting this Wednesday March 6 or 
Friday March 8.

However, in order to attempt to fit in two more teleconferences before our 
EOWG face to face meeting at CSUN, I have added a Wednesday meeting next 
week (March 13) for those able to attend, in addition to our previously 
scheduled meeting next Friday March 15.

Updated schedule:

A reminder that if you plan to attend WAI meetings following CSUN, 
preregistration is required:

Thank you,

- Judy
