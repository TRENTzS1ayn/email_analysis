a number of people present at the f2f asked for a link to the mencap
resources on accessibility, inclusion europe and an accessible drop down
list.

geert freyhoff is the director at http://www.inclusion-europe.org

a good example of an accessible drop down list is linked from here:
http://www.learningdifficulty.org/develop/w3c-scripts.html#navigation

a few mencap resources are linked from here:
http://www.mencap.com/html/services/accessibility_services.htm

these include:
'Am I making myself clear?': information about making your communications
more accessible for people with a learning disability (this document is a
PDF)
'Making your website accessible for people with a learning disability':
guidelines for web designer (this document is in Rich Text Format)
'Accessing the Web': a Mencap and Nokia report on website accessibility for
people with a learning disability (this document is in Rich Text Format)
'Using the Internet': a guide on how to use the internet which is accessible
to people with a learning disability (this is a PDF document)


my small library on special needs and the web also includes:

ict changing education chris abbott
internet for all david baines and richard walter
symbols now chris abbott
making the web special chris abbott http://www.sed.kcl.ac.uk/special/

valuing people UK white paper

I believe all of this is and more is available from
http://www.learningdifficulty.org, perhaps more is the problem?
