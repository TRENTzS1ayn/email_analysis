EOWG:

Do not open the attachment in the message titled: "W32.Klez removal tools"

It is in fact a viral worm:
         W32.Klez.E@mm
which was sent to the w3c-wai-eo@w3.org mailing list last night, via a 
spoofing of my email address.

This did not come from my computer; however, I regret that you have 
received this via my address over the EOWG mailing list.

Information about this worm, and instructions on how to protect from it, 
and/or remove it if it has installed itself on your computer, are available 
at the Symantec Web site:
         http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.klez.e@mm.html

Regrets,

- Judy
