There are some efforts to address this issue, via the National Task Force 
on Technology and Disability (NTFTD) in the US, and a Design-For-All 
Curriculum effort in the EU. Neither of these efforts are yet full-fledged 
though.

Developing the actual curriculum for this effort may be mainly beyond the 
scope of WAI's EOWG; however, I see no reason why we could not consider 
eventually adding additional modules to the "Planning Training for Web 
Accessibility" resource suite
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/training/
that might outline approaches for how to address the topic of designing 
software that conforms to the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 
and/or User Agent Accessibility Guidelines.

Actually, unfortunately it's not. What's nearly complete is the appendix 
page "Auxiliary Benefits of Web Accessibility" which is just a part of the 
business case. We put aside the majority of business case work in order to 
finish the Implementation Planning Resource Suite. My guess is that the 
business suite will take us most of 2Q 2002; see proposed time-lines at 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/EO-Deliverables

I agree with your sentiment; I just think that it will take us a little 
longer to get to where you're thinking we are already, and furthermore that 
we will need to identify a scope that is appropriate for us to take on, 
without taking on the entire challenge of promoting accessible design 
across the software industry.
