> Agenda:
> 1. Outreach updates

Vision Australia Foundation ran two successful workshops on web
accessibility in the last fortnight:
# Canberra on March 7 with 21 people present
# Sydney on March 12 with 15 people present (this was run in conjunction
with the Performance Technologies Group -
http://www.performancetechnologies.com )

Both workshops included a number of staff from web development firms, a
trend we want to encourage.

On March 22 we are conducting a short techniques workshop for staff and
volunteers from community groups responsible for maintining their
organisation's web site.

Details of future workshops are available at
