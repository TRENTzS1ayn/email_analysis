Hello. There are some "details" on this thread here:

MSNBC: AOL testing Netscape browser.
America Online has begun testing a software version that uses the Netscape Web
browser, a signal that it may be considering dropping Microsoft Corp.'s
Internet Explorer this fall when an upgraded version of the online service is
rolled out.

The change hasn't happened yet -- I read an article on it just the other
