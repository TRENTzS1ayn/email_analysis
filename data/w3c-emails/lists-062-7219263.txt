Hey, whatever happened to giant companies behaving like a monopoly.
Guess AOL doesnt fear an anti-trust suit.  What if I want to use
Internet Explorer. Sorry, couldn't resist.

Hello. There are some "details" on this thread here:

MSNBC: AOL testing Netscape browser.
America Online has begun testing a software version that uses the
Netscape Web
browser, a signal that it may be considering dropping Microsoft Corp.'s
Internet Explorer this fall when an upgraded version of the online
service is
rolled out.

The change hasn't happened yet -- I read an article on it just the other
day....of course now I can't remember where.  If I find it again, I'll
send
it to you -- there are more details.
