I am talking about the AOL web browser only and not any way other means
like netsacpe or interent explorer. I have run across customers that are
not aware of anything other than the web option to surf in AOL.  TO
clarify so everyone is aware of what I mean, this is the same toolbar
that has an input block that states, " Type Keywords or Web Addresses
here".

Hi, Rob:

Are you talking about the IE client that AOL uses for Web browsing, or
are you talking about the AOL client that is used for just viewing AOL
content (like the log-in screen, etc.)?  If the former, you can just
open IE outside of AOL and make display changes to the regular IE
browser.  These will carry over when you use IE from within AOL.

Is that what you're asking, or am I missing the point?
