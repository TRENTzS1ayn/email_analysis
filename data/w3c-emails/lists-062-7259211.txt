Andrew,

Thanks! This is very helpful information as I look at the training section 
of the implementation suite. I was very frustrated that the cognative 
simulation required Flash, but at least they said they're working on it.

BTW, my "real" web site is being done by someone who does accessible 
design, since I don't even code. In the meantime, I played around with the 
site design tool provided by my web hosting company, hostway.com. Pretty 
disastrous, as far as accessibility is concerned. I'm going to use it as a 
"what not to do" example and also point out the problems to the company. I 
shudder to think how many people are blissfully using such tools. And it 
occurred to me that this is just another layer of web activity promulgating 
inaccessible sites. Our audiences seem to be proliferating at a greater 
rate than we're educating people.
