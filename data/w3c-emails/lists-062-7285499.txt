I am collecting information on the accessibility of online newspapers.
I would like to hear from you on or off list on how your assistive
technology will read newspapers.  The reason for the inquiry is am
exploring the complexity of tables and how non-knowledgable designers
and coders bring the print design over into the web medium.  I think
there are some newspapers and retailers who have some great layouts but
want to understand more how the screen readers and other devices render
these.
 
When using tables for layout I try to use simple tables coupled with
stylesheets. However the newspapers used highly complex tables that uses
stylesheets as well as forcing the tables to be used to control
presentation verses the stylesheet. My outcome is to try to replicate
that look and feel using simple tables and style sheets, where the
techniques can be shared.
 
Wendy, is there someone or goup we can involve in this from the CSS
group?
 
I greatly appreciate your time, rob
