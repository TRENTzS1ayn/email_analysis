  after converting some HTML files into XHTML - i tested the pages in
  Bobby and they failed. yesterday i emailed cast.org and asked about
  this...

  here is their response:

  "Thank you for your comments. We hope to accommodate XHTML better in a
  future version. Part of the problem is finding a suitable parser. "

  How can CAST claim that their validation tool is W3C compliant and not
  support the new mark-up standards?

  Can developers be asked to be W3C compliant when the testing tools are
  insufficient?

  Does anybody know of a validation tool that parses XHTML?


  Solid validiation tools need to be developed and made available for the
  general public.
