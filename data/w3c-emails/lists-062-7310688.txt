To:w3c-wai-eo@w3.org

the navigation at http://www.peepo.com is about to be changed.

my concern relates to users with some sort of 'reader':
I imagine listening to the 'standard' navigation links, which are on 
every page is slow and boring, so that that first you have an option to 
go to the 'standard' navigation, then the 'page specific' links, then 
the 'standard' navigation links.

There will be some kind of relation between the visual and auditory 
navigation, and I'd like some really clear examples.
can someone point me to any?

thanks
