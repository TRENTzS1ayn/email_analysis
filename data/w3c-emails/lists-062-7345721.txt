As discussed a couple weeks ago, I will be sending messages to webmasters
about accessibility, specifically scalable text. (This was my New Years
resolution - to tell the offending sites' webmasters about it instead of
just yelling at my innocent laptop.) The draft is at
http://www.uiaccess.com/notice-1.html. Suggestions welcome!

Cheers,

- Shawn
