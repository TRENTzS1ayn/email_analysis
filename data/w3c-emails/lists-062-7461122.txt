Pearson and Toronto Island are both fine. You are more likely to find a cheap
ticket to Pearson International, but the Island Airport is actually closer to
downtown. So if you manage to find a flight to and from the Island, grab it.
(The island airport is very small, and serves regional airlines.)

If one is flying to Toronto, is the Pearson International Airport the one to
fly in to?
