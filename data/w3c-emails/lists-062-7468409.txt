I would appreciate any information about the meeting as I have to book my
flight as well as the hotel. Maybe I missed something at the end of the
phone meeting. Does anyone what hotel we're going to yet?

Pearson and Toronto Island are both fine. You are more likely to find a
cheap
ticket to Pearson International, but the Island Airport is actually closer
to
downtown. So if you manage to find a flight to and from the Island, grab it.
(The island airport is very small, and serves regional airlines.)

If one is flying to Toronto, is the Pearson International Airport the one to
fly in to?
