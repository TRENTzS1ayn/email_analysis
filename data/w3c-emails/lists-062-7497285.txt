Hello Judy and EO members,

Due to circonstances out of my control, my tasks at work have been modified 
and I will work for another project for the next six months. It is not 
entirely out of the domain of Web accessibility, but accessibility is just 
an aspect of this project.

Consequently, I'll can't participate regularly to the working group 
conference calls and face to face meetings. However, I'll continue to read 
the EO list and give some input when I can contribute.

I can also participate to french translation of documents as a volonteer, 
when documents will be in final stage.

I hope I'll be able to resume participation on a regular basis around the 
beginning of 2003.

Regards to all,

Jean-Marie
