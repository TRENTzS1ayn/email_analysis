Outreach updates for Wednesday July 10 2002 meeting

I attended the AusWeb02 (http://ausweb.scu.edu.au/) conference where I
presented a workshop which was attended by a range of University folk from
around Australia. I also presented a paper on the usability aspects of WCAG
1.0 (http://ausweb.scu.edu.au/aw02/papers/refereed/arch/index.html).  I'll
make my presentation available shortly - but basically showed lots of sites
and why they were unusable by a wide range of people, not just PWD. The
demonstration made a lot of people think twice about their own sites - so
we'll see what follow-up I get.

And, yes, they know about their inaccessible pages - I've offered to
support their improvement.

We are also working closely with The Learning Federation now on supporting
the development of accessible online learning objects for P-12 students.
Our first task will be to develop principles and guidelines for the concept
and functional development stages - all developers appointed to date will
be using Flash primarily. We'll start with W3C and NCAM material. I think
we have located all the obvious guidelines relevant to web, multimedia and
education - but any URLs would be appreciated. Anything vaguely relevant is
welcome - better to receive duplicates, than miss something important.
