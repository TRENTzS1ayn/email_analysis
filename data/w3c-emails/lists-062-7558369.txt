DEar W3C WAI:

My regrets for today's (Wed.'s) meeting ... work ...

Question:  Has anyone else had difficulty accessing the W3C HTML Validator at
http://validator.w3.org/ ?  I can access other W3C AND W3C WAI pages fine .  I
contacted WAI's Wendy Chisholm who has been very helpful.  I receive an error
message that the system is not responding ...

Thanks very much,

Ellen Perlow
