Dear all,

I need your assistance and expertize in resolving the issue of using a
character as an identification of a link.  We know that the best solution is
to create an image but we can't go that way because it would be detrimental
to the performance.  We wanted to put a character outside of the link but in
some of the modes Jaws still read the character.  

Are you aware of any solution we can provide to blind people while using a
character?

would really appreciate your input,

Best regards,

Natasha Lipkina
