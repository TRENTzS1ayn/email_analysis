Proposed substitute paragraph for section 1 of conformance evaluation:

1. Identify the scope of the Web site to be evaluated and the targeted 
conformance level for the evaluation.
          1. Identify the target conformance level of WCAG 1.0.
          2. Identify a page selection, for manual and user testing, which 
includes at least one of each different type of page on the site, and all 
pages on which people are more likely to enter your site. Page selection 
for dynamically generated Web content is addressed separately below.
          3. Identify the entire Web site, including all pages at a base 
URL, for automatic and semi-automatic evaluation. NOTE: If testing of the 
entire site is not feasible (e.g. because of its unusually large size or 
dynamic page generation) identify an expanded page selection, to be 
disclosed publicly along with any public conformance claim. Suggested 
inclusions in this expanded page selection: pages from different sections 
of the Web site; pages representing a different "look & feel"; pages 
representing different development tools and processes, including those 
generated from databases; pages produced under different guidelines; 
"contact" pages; pages critical to business operations; etc. If any area of 
a Web site is excluded from evaluation, disclose this information along 
with any conformance claim regarding the site.
