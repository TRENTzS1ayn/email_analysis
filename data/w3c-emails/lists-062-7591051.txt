Judy,

Regrets for this evening's meeting - I have a prior engagement, but may
join you later.

WRT agenda:
I support the proposed paragraph below for "evaluating" document.
Our staff have raised a concern about the "evaluating" document -
Conformance 2.1 suggests that at least one validation tool should be run
across the entire site, however none of those that we mention are capable
of doing this automatically. I don't have a solution, but we should not
tell people to do things they can't with our suggested approach/tools.

Andrew

Proposed substitute paragraph for section 1 of conformance evaluation:

1. Identify the scope of the Web site to be evaluated and the targeted
conformance level for the evaluation.
          1. Identify the target conformance level of WCAG 1.0.
          2. Identify a page selection, for manual and user testing, which
includes at least one of each different type of page on the site, and all
pages on which people are more likely to enter your site. Page selection
for dynamically generated Web content is addressed separately below.
          3. Identify the entire Web site, including all pages at a base
URL, for automatic and semi-automatic evaluation. NOTE: If testing of the
entire site is not feasible (e.g. because of its unusually large size or
dynamic page generation) identify an expanded page selection, to be
disclosed publicly along with any public conformance claim. Suggested
inclusions in this expanded page selection: pages from different sections
of the Web site; pages representing a different "look & feel"; pages
representing different development tools and processes, including those
generated from databases; pages produced under different guidelines;
"contact" pages; pages critical to business operations; etc. If any area of

a Web site is excluded from evaluation, disclose this information along
with any conformance claim regarding the site.
