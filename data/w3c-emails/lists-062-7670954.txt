Hi all
 I'm trying to catch up with all the good work you've all been doing while I
was away on vacation, just want to give you this bit of information on what
has happened in this part of the world while I've been admiring the under
water world of the Red Sea.

A European Secretariat for the Design for All e-Accessibility Network
(ESDeAN) has been established in Denmark. I'm going to meet with their
Secretariat Manager: Cathy Toscan next week. Maybe Judy met her in Linz?
 
From their web site: "The European Secretariat for the Design for All
e-Accessibility Network (ESDeAN) was established in July 2002, in accordance
with one of the specific goals of the eEurope 2002 Action Plan".
For more information see: http://www.e-accessibility.org/
