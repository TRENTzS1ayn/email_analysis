Dear Everyone:

My regrets for today's (7/26) meeting ... work ...

Update: This past weekend I attended the annual planning meeting for the Texas
Library Association Annual Conference (the next one: in Houston, April 1-4,
2003). I distributed the W3C WAI Quick Tips both at the central handout table
by registration and at the Diversity Committee meeting that I attended. I also
prepared and distributed a handout on the newly revised State of Texas Web
Accessibility Guidelines - effective June 17, 2002:
http://www.dir.state.tx.us/standards/S206.htm - which refer to W3C WAI
guidelines. I noticed that many copies of the Quick Tips and Texas handout were
taken.

The Chair of the Texas Library Association Publications Committee held a focus
group meeting about the Texas Library Association website
(http://www.txla.org/).  Since I was unable to attend this particular meeting,
in advance of the meeting, I left an envelope for the Chair with a number of
copies of the WAI Quick Tips Cards and the State of Texas Web Accessibility
guidelines handout. I subsequently spoke with the Texas Library Association's
webmaster who told me that the Publications Chair had given her some of the
Quick Tips cards and State of Texas web accessibility handouts : "Accessibility
of the Texas Library Association's website will be on the agenda" for the focus
group meeting.

I submitted a program proposal to hold the second annual Accessibility
Pavilion as part of the 2003 annual conference's Exhibits ... 8000 attendees.

---------

Last Wednesday, I presented an Accessibility/Assistive Technology 1 1/2 hour
workshop to a graduate health studies class at my university.  I distributed
the WAI Quick Tips cards and handouts on the Section 508 standards and the
Texas accessibility guidelines to the class and spoke about the importance of
designing webpages from the beginning the right way= the accessible way.

A very receptive audience as I have found all health professionals to be.
