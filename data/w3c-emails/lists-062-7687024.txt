Questions for consideration for the face-2-face discussion on 30 August
about Auxiliary Benefits:

Q. is the tone credible?
Q. can we substantiate all the statements?
Q. in what areas do we need substantiation?
Q. should some sections be moved to other documents?
Q. how do we reference external (non-W3C) materials?
Q. what disclaimers do we need?

Get an initial framework established for linking to external references -
use this as pointers to where people can find out more.
A draft will follow if possible following tonights meeting - URL will be
posted later.
