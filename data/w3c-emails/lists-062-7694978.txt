EOWG:

The agenda for our upcoming face-to-face meeting in Toronto has been 
updated, mainly to reflect some time shifts to accommodate availability of 
editors of specific documents we will be working on.

It is available at:
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/2002/07-agenda

Please note, if you will be present at the meeting, that the meeting 
location is about six short city blocks away from the hotel. For those 
who'd like to go over together to the meeting site, please meet in the 
lobby around 8 a.m.

A number of documents are already linked from the agenda; please download 
these before you travel and have them available during the meeting. There 
may be one or more additional drafts available before the meeting starts, 
for those who are online before the meeting.

People willing to scribe part of the meeting, please notify me individually 
by e-mail.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you,

- Judy
