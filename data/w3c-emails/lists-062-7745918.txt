During our discussion about "Increased Market Share and Audience Reach", I said I didn't feel that benefit was applicable to state government agencies.  At the end of that discussion, Doyle and I had a side-conversation and I realized I was focusing only on those state government agencies that serve state residents and constituents. The "Increased Market Share" *does* come into play when state tourism and economic development agencies are competing with other states (and other countries) to bring tourism dollars and new businesses into their own state.
