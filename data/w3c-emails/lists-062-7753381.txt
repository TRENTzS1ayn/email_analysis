EOWG: Notes on planning WAI site design

This is the outline of planning steps that we discussed on July 30 of the 
Toronto face-to-face meeting, for WAI site design.

1. have at least a brief planning discussion at an eowg meeting in august, 
with shawn & vidya, to prep a longer presentation/discussion at an eowg 
meeting in september;
2. go ahead and do clean-ups for consistency of nav bars, interim wai 
search utility, etc., in the meantime;
3. invite a few representatives from other parts of W3C to sept discussion 
(e.g. comm team rep, webmaster);
4. shawn & vidya do a presentation at an eowg meeting in sept, including a 
preliminary proposed plan for UCD (user-centered design) redesign of WAI site;
5. discuss & agree on plan for UCD;
6. recruit resources for doing UCD;
7. clarify roles & expectations, including EOWG contributions in 
identifying messaging & promotion objectives, reviewing redesign proposals, 
etc.;
8. implement in WAI space;
9. explore possibilities/requirements for consistent UCD in other areas of 
W3C space.
