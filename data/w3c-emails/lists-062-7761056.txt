As I mentioned in Toronto...

Regarding the "Market share / Audience reach" claims in the introduction to 
the document: An increase in audience reach (i.e the size of the potential 
audience) is made possible because of the reduction of barriers to use.  An 
increase in market share (as I understand it) is a possible consequence of 
reaching a wider audience, but not a given.  Increase in audience reach for 
an organization is a first-order consequence of conformance, while an 
increase in market share is a second-order consequence.

To further refine  the concept of "increased audience reach", it should be 
clear that that does not necessarily mean that you will increase the actual 
size of your audience, but it means that of the pool of Web users who are 
amongst your constituents or customers, you will now include those who 
found your site inaccessible previously.  Thus the overall client base will 
not increase, but the proportion of those who can benefit from using the 
Web will increase.  I think this addresses the concern that Kathleen expressed.

Chuck
