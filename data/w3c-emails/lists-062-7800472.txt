I'm always struck by how "honest" we seem to be about things like this. 
Instead of "Increase your profits four-fold by making your site accessible" 
we insist on a disclaimer for the rather intuitively obvious claim that 
increasing audience will increase market. It's as though we are packaging 
accessiblity with a demurrer of the "your mileage may vary" sort.
