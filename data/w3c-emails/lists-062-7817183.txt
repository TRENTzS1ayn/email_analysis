This text is not so difficult when it comes to translation which is very
good as we argue several times that simple and clear language is very
important in order to  reach a wider audience. We found 2 examples to
demonstrate how things change in translation.
Here is the result thanks to my very helpful colleague Dorte.
First you get the text from the document then the translation to Danish and
finally an example of translating back to English

1: Original English text:
" 2. Increase market Share and Audience Reach
Increasing discovery, access and usability of your Web site for all visitors
is a major benefit from applying many of the WCAG 1.0 checkpoints."

Danish translation:
"2. Udvid din markedsandel og dit publikum
En af de v?sentlige fordele ved at benytte mange af tjekpunkterne i WCAG 1.0
er, at dit netsted bliver mere synligt, tilg?ngeligt og anvendeligt for alle
brugere."

Translation from Danish to English:
"2. Expand your market share and your audience
One of the major benefits from applying many of the WCAG 1.0 checkpoints is
that your web site will become more visible, accessible and usable for all
users."

2: Original English text:
"In an expanding global marketplace, ignoring or alienating potential
clients or customers in other countries may be detrimental to your business.
the WCAG 1.0 describes a number of techniques that can enhance your ability
to reach this global audience."

Danish translation:
" P? et voksende globalt marked kan det v?re ?del?ggende for en virksomhed
at ignorere potentielle klienter eller kunder i andre lande eller at st?de
dem fra sig. WCAG 1.0 beskriver en r?kke teknikker, der kan forbedre din
evne til at n? dette globale publikum."

Translation from Danish to English:
" In an expanding global market it can be detrimental to your business to
ignore potential clients or customers in other countries or to alienate
them. WCAG 1.0 describes a number of techniques that can enhance your
ability to reach this global audience."

FYI: I asked her to translate "Business case suite".  This is her answer:
"What do you mean by that?"  This made me think if we should find an other
expression for Business case suite at least I would like to see some
alternatives or a definition.
