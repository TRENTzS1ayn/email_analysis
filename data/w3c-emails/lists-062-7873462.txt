Sure you can. It's the inverse of the following statement, which I consider
valid:
An inaccessible site decreases site traffic.

It appears to me that you're saying something comparable to "one can't claim
that traffic to a store would necessarily increase just because the owner
unlocked the front door." Eventually, someone is going to enter where they
couldn't have before.

Now, imagine that all of your competitors' doors are locked, while yours is
open. (This is arguably the status quo in web accessibility in many areas.)

So, back to my original statement:
An inaccessible site decreases site traffic -- by virtue of turning away
willing visitors.
Lost traffic represents decreased market share.
Therefore,
An accessible site increases site traffic and market share.
