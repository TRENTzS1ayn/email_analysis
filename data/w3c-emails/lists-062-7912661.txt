Actually I don't think that the initial traffic increase is what is important
- getting people to your home page is only the first step. The point about
accessibility is that it allows people to do something when they are there
instead of searching for a competitor.

I know that I personally have dropped several companies from my list of
places to do business because their inaccessibility caused problems for me,
and there are others I try to avoid if possible becuase it is annoying to
stay there.

Rather than the analogy of the door lock, think of the customer service
person sitting on the desk saying "we're not interested in talking to you, do
everything yourself or go away". Now, why do we not see that very often in a
successful business or service?

(It isn't true that I can't use inaccessible sites - most of the time I can
if I only install a new browser some software I don't have. But I don't want
to - it is easier to find a competitor in most cases. If I had a real
accessibility requirement, of course, I would simply make a formal
complaint.)

Cheers

Charles
