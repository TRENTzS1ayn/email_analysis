In whatever case, the problem I was trying to address is our tendency to be 
"too objective" in these matters. The tone of the document could be, while 
not actually confrontational, at least almost enthusiastic about these 
benefits without necessarily emphasizing their possible "vaporosity".

Charles' example of being turned away by the support desk is spot on. But 
we don't need to emphasize that there's no hard evidence that an accessible 
site will enhance market share.
