Dear all,

Following today's call, these are the pending issues in the draft of the 
"Business Case for Accessibility Support in Authoring Tools":
http://www.fit.fraunhofer.de/~velasco/businessCase.html

1) Executive summary: Is it necessary to include interim pointers to 
reports from non-European (or European) sources in the actual wording? 
(coming from the Toronto F2F).

2) (Andrew Arch) - Executive summary: What about adding in "people in 
remote locations"?

3) (Jan Richards) - What is an Authoring Tool? pointing to ATAG 1.0 
categories instead of "Wombat's" categories.

4) (Jan Richards) - State of the art (title to be changed for the next 
draf). Replace actual paragraph:

"Discuss the existence of auxiliary implementation tools. The 
transformation of the business case in a real business or implementation 
plan needs to identify elements that facilitate this process. Describe 
existing cooperation agreements with third parties that include 
additional functionalities in the tool (e.g. plugins), or existence of 
Open Source tools that help accessibility implementation."

for the following:

"Discuss the existence of third party accessibility tools (e.g. plugins, 
Open Source software, etc.) that might be useful in facilitating 
implementation of ATAG into the base authoring tool (e.g. to handle 
accessibility evaluation and repair)."

regards,
carlos
