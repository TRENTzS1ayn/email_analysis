Dear All-
Below are comments regarding the new draft. Some areas appear to be 
comments for the author or the group. If comments are written for the 
working group within the document it would be helpful if they were 
noted as such by perhaps enclosing them in something like:

 **BEGIN COMMENT** 
maybe we should include a 
section here on blah 
**END COMMENT**

or some other indicator. The document seems to be a transition - i'll be
happy to take another look at it when its been revised again.

Cheers,
-grace


-- Executive Summary --
1. 'summary' nav should match heading name 'executive summary'

2. 'responsible of' should read 'responsible for'

-- State of the art --
1. Change heading name to something more meaningful/explicit

2. This section seems to be offering evaluation methods for managers. 
If it is so, the copy needs to be much more direct with bulleted 
actions.

-- Opportunities and threats --
1. Change heading name to something more meaningful/explicit
