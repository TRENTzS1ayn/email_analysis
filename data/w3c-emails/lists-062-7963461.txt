FYI Lou Rosenfeld visited MSU a few months ago.  This is well worth
attending - particularly at that price!

>Academic Computing at Dartmouth College is pleased to offer the following
>Web design conference as part of the October Conferences at Dartmouth:
>
>Built Environments on the Web: Structure, Access, Wayfinding, and Delight
>Wednesday, October 30, 2002
>9:30 AM - 4:00 PM
>Alumni Hall, Hopkins Center, Dartmouth College
>$60 (includes lunch); parking on your own - approximately $10
><http://www.dartmouth.edu/~october>
>
>Anyone who has participated in building planning in the "real" world knows
>that a great deal of time and attention is given to identifying and
>planning in features that optimize the accessibility and usability of the
>built environment. Web building, on the other hand, is generally
>approached in a haphazard fashion, and consequently, Web structures often
>resemble the Weasley's Burrow from Harry Potter -- an assemblage of pages
>of shaky structural integrity that is not enterable by some, is difficult
>to get around in, and is a bit of an eyesore. Because of a lack of
>forethought and attention, many "virtual" environments are not universally
>experienced as accessible and usable.
>
>For this conference, Web design experts Lou Rosenfeld, Sarah Horton, Steve
>Krug, and Patrick Lynch will focus on four of the main constructs to
>building well on the Web. In Structure, Lou will focus on the integrity
>that underlies the best Web structures. In Access, Sarah will discuss the
>elements that enable universal access to Web spaces. In Wayfinding, Steve
>will talk about ways to assist people with spatial problem solving on the
>Web. And in Delight, Patrick will talk about the aesthetic of Web spaces
>that make them a pleasure to move around in.
>
>People who are involved in Web development on any level -- from writing
>code to hiring consultants to approving designs -- will find great value
>in this Web design conference.
>
>ABOUT THE PRESENTERS
