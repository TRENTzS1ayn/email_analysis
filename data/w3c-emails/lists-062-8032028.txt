I've begun working on the policy document.

I've posted the updated document and a changelog
http://www.infoescena.es/achuter/wai/policy.html
http://www.infoescena.es/achuter/wai/changelog.html

The US page isn't there as I haven't done anything to it yet.

Before moving ahead further I think it would be useful to consider the
scope of this document. Does it cover only legislation or is it more 
general? Policy is a wide-ranging title. At present the entries range 
from national legislation to reports (one of the documents in the EU 
section is the results of a survey).

I would appreciate hearing from people in individual countries who are 
prepared to alert me to changes in the situation in their respective
countries. This is especially important for the US and countries outside
North America and the EU.

I have listed the members of the European Union and included a summary 
of the EU legislative process. My thinking is that the Euro Parliament
and Council, at the request of the Commission, pass legislation which is 
then implemented by individual countries. It would be interesting to 
trace the progress from the Commission's initial communication, through 
the Council and Parliament, to individual state legislatures. I would 
like to show how all the countries move forward together. So far I've 
found it difficult to trace back.

Perhaps the EU countries should have a separate page, like the US states.

I would appreciate any comments about any changes to the scope or 
organization of this document before getting to far ahead.
