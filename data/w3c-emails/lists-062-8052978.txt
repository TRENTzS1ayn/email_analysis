I addressed around 90 web managers from the Victorian Better Health Channel
partners (http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au) today about what
accessibility means and they might get started doing some preliminary
assessment of their own sites. Pointed them to
http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/Overview.html.

Other speakers talked about Usablity and Statsistics/Evaluation. A very
good session.
