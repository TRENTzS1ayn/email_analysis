Alan

Thanks for getting this going.

Before commenting on the questions here though I'd like to ask for some 
discussion and coordination; for instance, incorporating the backlog of 
change requests that have already come in before asking for that same 
information again from various contacts in the public; also, making sure 
that the change requests come in to a w3c address so that they can be 
archived & not lost if an individual contact name changes over time.

Also some of the background that you ask for, e.g. on EU process, we 
already have; just needs to be coordinated to get it in.

Let's make sure to get this some time on an EOWG meeting agenda soon.
