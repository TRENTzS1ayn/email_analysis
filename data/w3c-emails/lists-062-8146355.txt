Hello All,
I like Charles' suggestion.  The substitution of 'anybody' works well in
describing a key feature of accessibility, and helps to make clear what

  Accessible authoring tools allow anybody to create web content that can be
  used by anybody, regardless of whether the author or user might have a
  disability.

(this avoid using accessible three times in a row...)
