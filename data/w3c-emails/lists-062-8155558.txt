Dear WAI EO working group and "public-evangelist" participants.

First, since I think this is the first cross-post through these two
lists, let me introduces each other, just in case:

The WAI Education and Outreach Working Group - http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/
has been around for a long time (since 1998 IIRC) and has produced a lot
of important resources for WAI education (I'm sure many of you know the
WAI quicktips card, for example).

public-evangelist - http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-evangelist/
is the (rather young) list of the Quality Assurance Interest Group's
EO activities, born to host discussion and coordination about "Web
standards Education and Outreach" at large.


Now to the point : about one year ago there was an little, yet
interesting initiative to add "quick tips" to the HTML Validator's
results. Since the validator is the first service at W3C in terms of
hits, it is believed to be a very efficient EO service. 

See : http://www.w3.org/2001/06tips/

The new validator, including this quicktips feature, will be sent
for beta testing in a few days, so now is, I believe, a good time to
speed up the quicktips initiative. Some submissions and ideas were
sent already, and today a few tips are completed (many are still on a
"someday pile").

The (rather straightforward) Quicktips submission process is given at : 
http://www.w3.org/2001/06tips/#process

On the same page is the list of completed tips, and a list of candidates
for future tips.

I encourage everyone to have a look at this, and if you like, please
submit a new tip (fully documented using the submission process, or just
an idea) or write up one in the todo list and send it to the QAIG's
public list www-qa@w3.org.


Thank you very much,
olivier
