Hi Alan 
Maybe the EOWG should discuss how to present the information from the
individual countries? Suggestion: under each country we write the titles in
the original language and present the title in English in [ ] If it's not
available. If there are translations or the country is multilingual we can
link from the titles in the languages the document is available in . For
Example under Denmark there is a link to a report only available in Danish:
Rapport fra Arbejdsgruppen om tilg?ngelighed og grafiske brugergr?nseflader
(Report from a working group on accessibility and graphical user interfaces)
Here we would have to change the bracket to square brackets [ ] but not make
any links as there are no translations available. Another example from the
Danish titles is Action for Change: IT Policy Plan it would look something
like this:  Handling gi'r forvandling. IT-politisk handlingsplan 97/98
English translations see: Action for Change: IT Policy Plan . All the coding
regarding language tags etc.  naturally  have to be correct !
Kind regards

Subject: Languages of Policy Document Links


I'm working on the Policy document
(http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/Policy). One of the characteristics of the
document is that there are links to documents in many languages. I'd like
ideas about the best way to indicate the language before the link. Some of
the documents are available in two languages.

My idea is to use the ISO language codes
(http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/iso639.htm) in square brackets [EN][ES]. A
list at the top of the page could explain, or the form <abbr
title="English">EN<abbr>. Although the abbreviation form would have to be
outside the link text (wouldn't it?). But then I don't want to have to
repeat the title for each language version.

[EN] New French Legislation, [FR] New French Legislation.
which repeats the title
[EN] New French Legislation, [FR] La Nouvelle Legislation Francaise.
which looks better, but is really the same
or

[EN][FR]New Legislation in Country
but then the link text doesn't make sense out of context

thanks
