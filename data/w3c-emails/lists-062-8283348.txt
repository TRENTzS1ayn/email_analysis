AGENDA

[marathon-agenda warning... but some of these items may be brief]

1. Outreach Updates
         Briefly. Send to list in advance if possible. Thanks.

2. Evaluating Web Sites for Accessibility
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/impl/eval/Overview.html
         We thought we were done. But we've gotten multiple requests to
         reconsider, in place of naming specific tools as examples, plus
         linking to generic tools lists, instead making only generic
         reference to:
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/existingtools.html#Evaluation
         albeit with a few changes to that document so would be easier to 
land on.

3. Discussion of updated draft of "Auxiliary Benefits"
         Background & links to latest drafts from Andrew are on list at
         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-eo/2002JulSep/0081.html
         and note that there are already some responses on the list (thanks!)
         Please be prepared to discuss re-distribution of some material 
into other sections.
         Comments on the list in advance would be good as well.

4. Discussion of updated draft of "Business Case for Accessibility Support 
in Authoring Tools"
         Background & links from Carlos are on list at
         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-eo/2002JulSep/0075.html
         Please comment, and possibly look for another updated draft

5. Scheduling next face-to-face meeting
         Discussion of possible November dates

6. Brainstorming about Gallery framework/disclaimers, as time allows

Reminder: Schedule of upcoming meetings is available at:
          http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/#meetings

Regards,

- Judy
