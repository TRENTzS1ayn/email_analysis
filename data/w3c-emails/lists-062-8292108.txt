I might get to the telecon, but in any case there is one point I'd like 
discussed. Although the document seems to be for an extremely narrow 
audience (designers of the target software), it seems important at every 
opportunity to lobby for the people looking into "business case" reasons 
and actions to DEMAND that the tools they are looking to buy are compliant 
with these principles.

"This document provides guidelines and pointers to information resources on 
how to build a business case for integrating the Authoring Tool 
Accessibility Guidelines in the design and development process of an 
authoring tool."

I would ask if there were some way to include the potential purchasers of 
such tools in this mix?
