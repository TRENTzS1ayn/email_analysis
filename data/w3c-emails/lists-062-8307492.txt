2. Evaluating Web Sites for Accessibility
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/impl/eval/Overview.html
         We thought we were done. But we've gotten multiple requests to
         reconsider, in place of naming specific tools as examples, plus
         linking to generic tools lists, instead making only generic
         reference to:
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/existingtools.html#Evaluation
         **Wendy has just edited the format of this document to make it 
easier to point to.

         **note that this affects sections 2.3-4, and sections 3.2, of 
Evaluating Web Sites

         ** See list of additional candidate change requests for tools
