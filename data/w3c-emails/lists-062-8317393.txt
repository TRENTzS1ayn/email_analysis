Dear EOWG, 

Sadly, I will be unable to sit in on this Friday's (23/08) meeting (I was hoping for it to be my first), however, I shall read the minutes with interest - especially those relating to Agenda Points 2 & 6, and let you know if I have any comments.  Otherwise, I look forward to meeting everyone on the next occasion...

Very Best Regards 

Alistair
