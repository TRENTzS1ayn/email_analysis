Hello All,
Doyle will be participating in AIR California (Accessibility Internet
Rally).  For those familiar with gaming rallies it is a get together in a
local High School all day on a Saturday to a challenge to build an
accessible web site for non-profits or institutions who lack the resources
for staff to make their sites accessible.  Held for the first time in
California it has been going on in Austin Texas for five years.

Phil Jenkins of the WAI Steering Council conducted a training in Berkeley of
new rally participants for the September Rally.
Thanks,
Doyle Saylor
