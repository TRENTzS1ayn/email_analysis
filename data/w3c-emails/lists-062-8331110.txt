Judy
Could we have both the meeting in DC by the end of October and a meeting in
connection with the IST for Europeans like we had in Amsterdam and Cannes.
It is my impression that we actually get some very different audiences when
we meet in USA and in Europe, and if the regular members from Europe
generally can attend the meeting in DC I think that most of them will be in
Copenhagen for IST because there are so many other things going on.
I'm trying to CC to the EO-list but normally I'm rejected when using my
private-mail

Regards
Helle
