Reminder, we are NOT scheduled for a meeting tomorrow, Friday August 30, 2002.

However, there's plenty to do online, for those who are interested. Please 
see separate, topic-starter messages on the EOWG list, starting with 
Gallery topic.

The schedule of our upcoming meetings is available at:

Please note that I have added in Wednesday meetings on September 18 and 
October 16, as well as some of our possible dates for face-to-face meetings.
