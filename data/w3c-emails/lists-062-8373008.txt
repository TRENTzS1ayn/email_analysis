EOWG:

Let's see what we can get done online on the Gallery framework. I think 
we've already done most of the brainstorming we need to, but we need to 
fine-tune some of the approaches. Please see links and questions below.

Please start any postings on this topic with [Gallery] at the beginning of 
the subject line.

Thanks,

- Judy

Premise: We want a gallery of sites that have been _reliably_ reviewed for 
accessibility.

Fodder for discussion:
         Compilation of disclaimer-type ideas, under "cautionary 
approaches" near bottom of page
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/Gallery#cautions

         *****Initial sample framework for discussion******
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/Gallery#framework

Background:
         Background info on Galleries
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/Gallery

         Background on Review Teams (necessary for Gallery)
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/Review.html

         Draft description of Review Teams
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/review/reviewteams.html

         Changelog for Review Teams
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/review/changelog.html

Questions:
         In the draft document section:
         *****Initial sample framework for discussion******
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/Gallery#framework

1. Would the disclaimer approach be sensible? effective? feasible?

2. Are the criteria for site inclusion sensible? effective? feasible? etc...

3. Are there better ways to address any of these issues?

4. Other thoughts or comments?

Again, please start any postings on this topic with [Gallery] at the 
beginning of the subject line.

Thanks
