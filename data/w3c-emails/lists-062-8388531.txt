Dear All, 

Would it be a good idea to create a template for a Web Accessibility Evaluation Report which captures (in a generic format) the procedures used, and results collected, from the tests suggested in the 'Evaluating Websites for Accessibility' document (http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/impl/eval/Overview.html).  Effectively, in a similar manner to the 'Common Industry Format for Usability Test Reports' (http://zing.ncsl.nist.gov/iusr/documents/cifv1.1b.htm) used for Usability testing (listed in the Evaluation & Repair section under Related Resources)?

As I see it two clear reasons exist for standardisation, firstly, it allows anyone undertaking 'repair' work to pick-up, and easily work with, any evaluation report coming from any Evaluation Centre, and secondly, it introduces an element of Quality Assurance.  

Please let me know your thoughts...
