Dear All, 

Thank you for your full response, I have read again with interest that it is possible to turn Earl into human-readable formats for people doing manual repair.

Could I ask if any human-readable report templates have been created so far, and if they have if I could be sent the URLs?  If they have not would it be a good idea to create a standard interrim (non-EARL) template for a human-readable Web Accessibility Evaluation Report? 

I only ask because in would make sense for evaluators to start producing evaluation reports based on future standardised formats.

Thanks again...
