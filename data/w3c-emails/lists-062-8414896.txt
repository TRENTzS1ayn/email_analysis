Alistair -
I'm glad you raised this issue again.   For reference, please visit the
thread from about a year ago:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2001Aug/0005.html

Regarding passing URLs to tools, maybe one of these days I'll get a
chance to revisit the tools front-end I had developed a couple of  years
ago.  It's kind of interesting to see how much has changed since then.
It's still available at the following URL:
http://w3.gsa.gov/web/m/old_cita.nsf/CheckYourPage

I still get occasional e-mails about the W3 logos links I had as part of
that site.  This page provides links via several search engines to
identify pages that are linking to the W3 logo pages.   Either these
pages are claiming compliance at the corresponding level, or they are
raising awareness by pointing to the WAI logo pages -- Note:  Google,
AltaVista, and HotBot still actually work!):
http://w3.gsa.gov/web/m/old_cita.nsf/RefLib/WCAGLogos

Direct links to Google to search  for A, Double-A, and Triple-A
compliance:
