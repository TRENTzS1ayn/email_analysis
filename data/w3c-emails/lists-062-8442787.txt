In April I had mentioned that the State of Connecticut had implemented a new requirement of web design vendors that they be trained in making Accessible Web Sites in order to be qualified to bid on state web design/development contracts. The requirement went into effect on July 1, 2002. The State of Connecticut provided the training to the vendors at no cost. The training began in May and the weekly classes ended on August 14th. I will be teaching the class once a month as waiting lists fill up. To date we have trained 81 consultants representing 35 companies. The course was based on the Accessible Web design -- Web designers -- three-hour hands-on workshop http://www.w3.org/WAI/training/cr.html#designers

On August 13th, I met with a group from the City of New Haven (CT) to talk about how to get a Web Accessibility Project started for the city web site(s). I recommended they first make a decision about what level of WCAG compliance they wanted to achieve. Their head webmaster was also planning on running their site(s) through Bobby WorldWide to see "how bad it really is". In Connecticut, municipalities can purchase off the commodity contracts negotiated by the State, and they are thinking very strongly that they will limit their contracts with web design firms to the ones that have been trained by the State.
