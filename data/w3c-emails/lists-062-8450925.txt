Regrets for today's meeting.
I can make it to both the suggested face-to-face meetings, and can help with
the one in Copenhagen if necessary e.g. finding a host, hotels and other
practical stuff.
If any news on the Evaluating web sites doc, please mail it to the list or
me, I'm really waiting for the final version.
 Kind regards
