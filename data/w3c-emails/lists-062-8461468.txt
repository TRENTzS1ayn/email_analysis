The City of Greater Bendigo (http://www.bendigo.vic.gov.au/) hosted a web
accessibility workshop last week in regional Victoria as part of their
Rural Access program. local business, organisations and community groups
were invited to participate. About 30 people participated in a very
successful and informative day, and we had a nice country visit.
