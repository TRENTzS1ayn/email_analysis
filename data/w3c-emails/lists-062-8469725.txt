Can we use this as a possible way of limiting our scope?

1) Home page must be accessible
2) Any page that is linked from the home page that is IN THE SAME DIRECTORY 
must be accessible
3) MAY - select one directory that is linked off of the home page and apply #1 
and #2 above

Essentially, the home page and Tier I page must be accessible.  As a plus, we 
may also highlight one directory of pages that comply to #1 and #2
