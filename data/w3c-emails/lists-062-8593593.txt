EOWG:

We met yesterday, Wednesday Sept 18, as noted at
         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-eo/2002JulSep/0128.html
and made good progress on the business case for authoring tool 
accessibility support
         http://www.fit.fraunhofer.de/~velasco/businessCase.html
which Carlos has been developing. You can see the change request log from 
our conversation yesterday;
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/atagchangelog.html
I don't think that these comments are integrated into the draft yet, but it
will give you an idea of the direction we are going. We need a little more 
time to finish.

The meeting schedule page showed a meeting for tomorrow, but we discussed 
this last week and said we wouldn't meet. So let's compromise, and do only 
one hour tomorrow to finish discussing the authoring tool business case 
document and a few other things. Sorry for the contradictory information. 
The meeting page is now updated:
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/#meetings

We have a variety of drafts available online. If people review the 
available documents, raise issues online, and work towards agreement online 
we may be able to move through these more quickly. If you're fine with how 
a new draft looks, it may be useful to say that online, as well.

AGENDA:
