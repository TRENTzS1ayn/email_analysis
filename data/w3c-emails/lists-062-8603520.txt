Judy/All

My regrets for Friday  - on my way to Tasmania for 2 Accessibility
Workshops (http://home.vicnet.net.au/~webacces/) and various discussion
with the University and State Government Depts.

Also, belated regrets for the midweek meeting.

Outreach updates
- presented as part of a panel at a Victorian Government e-Thinking seminar
on the importance of accessibility and its incorporation into one
Department's (Office of the Public Advocate -
http://www.publicadvocate.vic.gov.au) recent redevelopment project.
