I have been through the change log from the Wednesday (18 September) 
meeting and with the exception of item 9 being confusing, the rest seem to 
me to be valid comments or suggestions.

However, in reading through the September 17 draft I have the following 
additional comment.

I think that the H3 subsection "Introducing Accessibility in a Business 
Case" currently under H2 "Background: Authoring Tools and Accessibility" 
should actually be the first H3 section of a new H2 "Developing a Business 
Case".  Then the H2 "Implementation Status" could be demoted to H3 (which 
might help with the concern raised in Item 10 of the changelog).

Regards,
Chuck
