A coupla years ago in L.A. I attended my last F2F of EO and at that time 
several members, in particular Andrew Arch made strong moves towards 
getting off the "cap in hand"/"right thing to do"/"it's the law" arguments 
for accessibility "business case" concerns and onto a track in which it was 
posited that beyond all the moral/legal/ethical issues it might very well 
be that these concerns addressed such things as efficiency and usability 
that traditional "costing" analyses (without examination of subtle benefits 
to be gained from our approach) essentially ignored.

We must continue aggressively in this regard. The reasons to implement ATAG 
in one's authoring tools offerings must include not just the fact that our 
"recommendations" are beginning to gain the status of legal (as well as 
ethical/moral) "requirements" but that they make good technical (and 
therefore, business) sense.  Some of this attitude is inherent in the 
present instance and I'm not sure how to (or even if) modify it, but I 
think it very important not to weaken it in any way and to be out front 
with it.

Sorry not to be specific but I'm sure you get the idea.
