Basis: Updated draft (September 16) incorporating last Friday's change 
requests:

     http://WWW.W3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/galleryintro.html


Nominated Web Sites  Who can nominate? If not the owner, how can assurance be
gained on notification of site change, as asserted in the second paragraph 
of Review Process?.

Under Web Gallery Websites, make clear that the first one is the main site, and
the other four are subsidiary sites, preferably linked from that main site.

Under Review Teams do you expect to list individuals and the teams they are on?

Regards/Harvey
