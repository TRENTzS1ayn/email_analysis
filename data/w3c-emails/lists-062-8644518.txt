I have reviewed the WAI Gallery [Draft] document http://WWW.W3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/galleryintro.html 
and would like to make the following comments regarding this updated version:  

1) A suggested change to the 'Welcome' paragraph, as we really need to emphasis that the included 
Web sites have been nominated by the general public.  We could try...

"The WAI Gallery contains publicly nominated Web sites which are judged as clearly demonstrating 
integrated 'Web Accessibility Best Practice". 

2) A suggested change to the first 'Sites Included' paragraph, as I believe this paragraph currently restates 
what's in the 'Welcome' paragraph.  We could possibly try...

"All Web sites included in the WAI Gallery must show that they have been designed to be accessible to 
people with disabilities.  We believe the WAI Gallery will be most rewarding if we aim to select the best 
real-world examples of how 'Accessibility' features have been truly integrated into even the most complex
Web designs, without the need to resort to 'text-only' pages.   

To help us achieve this we have stipulated 'AA' conformance to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
1.0 (all Priority 1 & 2 Checkpoints) as the minimum entry requirement needed by a Web site for display in 
the WAI Gallery".   

3) I suggest that we remove the following sentence as it does not really need to be stated.  We don't 
want to put people off looking at the Gallery. 

"Since it is resource-intensive to evaluate and monitor sites on an ongoing basis, we present here just a small
number of sites, and these sites may change from time to time."

4) A suggested change to the 'Nomination' paragraph: possibly delete the following sentence as we don't 
want to put people off nominating Web sites.

"We regret that we cannot respond quickly, nor respond to all requests". 

5) Potentially change "We do not reveal the names of sites that have been nominated and reviewed but not 
selected." to "We do not reveal the names of those websites which have been nominated and/or failed the 
selection process".

In addition: As part of the behind-the-scenes process I suggest a very quick test is undertaken upon receipt 
of a nomination to make sure that the nomination is actually worth considering, i.e. maybe that it passes an 
automated evaluation.  Otherwise, valuable time and effort will be spent assessing under-conforming Web sites.   

Please let me know if you have any comments...

Very Best Regards
