Please look at the following draft template and consider whether it might 
be useful for presenting understandable, consistent and comparable results 
from conformance evaluations for WCAG 1.0.:
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/review/reviewreport.html

While experimenting with conformance evaluations from multiple reviewers as 
a prelude to assembly a first set of Web sites for the Gallery, it became 
apparent that we needed a consistent format for reporting what we're 
finding. I've put this template together for your reaction, incorporating 
some ideas shared by Sylvie, Allistair, and Marja.

Let's discuss during section #2 of today's agenda.

Thank you,

- Judy
