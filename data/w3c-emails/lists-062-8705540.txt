I can vouch for the fact that attendance is lower due to a wealth of
information that is already available online, particularly from the WAI
group.  Companies that I deal with now have considerably more internal
expertise than say, a year ago.

2) Travel budgets have been slashed across the board.  All types of
conferences have been affected.

3) There are few accessibility evangelists, such as Jakob Nielson with
usability, that have a "name brand" which draws a crowd.  I've often heard
feedback that a lot of accessibility recommendations still don't have "real
world" applications, and that the business cases presented for it have still
not been fleshed out enough (except 508, of course).

4) Conferences are often used for networking, and a lot of times certain
ones tend to draw the same people and become redundant.
