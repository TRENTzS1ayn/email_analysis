I didn't do it, but there was a nice article in the IT section of the
Guardian in the UK yesterday.

I did talk to some Microsoft developers about accessibility in .NET-based
systems - effectively it was about designing content management systems to
support accessibility. At some stage I hope to write it up for the Authoring
Tools working group.
