Hello All,
Here are some questions that occur to our research staff about what we want
to ask vendors concerning development tools.

1.  Would the Accessibility features conflict with or disallow something in
the application?

2. Does the application enforce or set to optimal accessibility utilization?

3. Is there a built in accessibility evaluator?  Reporting features?  Point
out problems and solutions?

4. Does the compliance feature auto-correct problems as a web site is built?

5. Can the compliance feature distinguish between 508 and custom made
guidelines for an industry?  Customizable?

6. Is there a built in reference manual in the help features?  Brought up on
demand and auto pop up?  Explain problems when popped up?

7. Do we know what standards the application is set to like Micro Soft MSAA
in regard to platform independence?

8. Is the application vendor hooked up in an on-going way with Accessibility
development technology?  (context being that a company that makes a product
that is fixed once and never updated costs a business a lot of money when
the company is committed to a product)

9. Are the Guidelines given to Vendors?

10. Is the package accessible to a specific group of people?  Navigation
accessible?  (context blind developers use this product?)

Thanks,
Doyle Saylor
