Dear all,

A preliminary agenda for the W3C/WAI Education and Outreach Working Group 
(EOWG) meeting, on 7 - 8 November 2002, in Copenhagen, Denmark is now 
available, at:
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/2002/1107-agenda.html

The focus of the 7 November meeting will be on exchanging information about 
promotion and implementation of W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 
(WCAG).

On Friday 8 November we will be conducting some training on evaluation of 
Web site accessibility, and inviting people involved in Web accessibility 
training to explain and/or demonstrate their best training approaches.

We welcome people who are engaged in promoting implementation of WCAG in 
Europe but who are not involved in the EOWG; likewise, we welcome people 
who are not currently providing Web accessibility training but who would 
like to start doing so. However, we request that all participants 
familiarize themselves with and be interested in coordinating their efforts 
with the EOWG by visiting the links to EOWG home page, charter and 
deliverables available from the agenda page. All participants must register 
in advance with W3C.

This EOWG meeting is held immediately following the IST 2002 Conference in 
Copenhagen. If you are attending that event, please note that the hotel in 
which the EOWG meeting is being held is one among the hotels available for 
the IST 2002 Conference earlier in the week.

Comments or questions on the agenda are welcome and should be sent to the 
links available on the preliminary agenda page.

- Judy
