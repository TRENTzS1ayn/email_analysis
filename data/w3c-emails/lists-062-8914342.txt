The Information Technology Technical Assistance & Training Center (ITTATC) is presenting a Live Web Cast with Real Time Captioning on October 22, 2002 from 1 - 3 pm ET. The purpose of the Web Cast is to provide information from selected state stakeholders on current experiences with electronic and information technology (EIT) accessibility challenges related to Web Sites, Application Development, Procurement, and Places of Public Access. ITTATC will also share some of the findings from its state needs assessment on IT accessibility "needs" and "barriers" as identified by State Assistive Technology Projects and State Offices of the Chief Information Officer.
