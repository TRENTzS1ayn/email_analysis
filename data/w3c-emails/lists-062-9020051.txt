Brian Charlton is Vice President for Computer Training at the Carroll 
Center for the Blind.

     http://www.carroll.org

Located in Newton, MA, it is a private non-profit agency which serves 
persons of
all ages who are blind or visually impaired. They have a recently opened 
facility offering
the latest in adaptive computer training for blind and vision impaired 
persons through the
traditional classroom instruction as well as through distance courses. I 
will explore with
Brian in what ways the WAI work is included.

Wednesday I heard Brian give an excellent demonstration of the computer 
accessibility tools he uses. They include software (JAWS, working with 
browsers, and email), and portable (brailler.) His audience was the Greater 
Boston Senior Computer Users Group.

He's a most impressive speaker. In his past he has worked with Judy Brewer 
and with Judy Dixon (National Library Service for the Blind and Physically 
Handicapped.)

He is aware of the DAISY work on digital talking books to which I 
contributed, leading to
the ANSI/NISO approved standard SZ-39-86-2002 (March 15, 2002), as 
described in its press release:
