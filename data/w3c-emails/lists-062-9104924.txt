A recent press release from Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity
Commission is titled:
"Internet still covered under Australian Discrimination Law"
(http://www.hreoc.gov.au/media_releases/2002/72_02.html)
which reinforces that the Web is covered by the Australian DDA.

Furthermore, the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission
has recently updated their notes in relation to the WWW and the Disability
Discrimination Act
(http://www.hreoc.gov.au/disability_rights/standards/www_3/www_3.html)

From Section 2.2:
