Outreach updates:

Vision Australia Foundation held a very successful Web Accessibility
workshop in Canberra last week with attendees from a wide range of
Commonwealth and State government departments as well as the devloper
community.

We also held a workshop in Sydney in conjunction with the Performance
Technology Group attended by State and Commonwealth government webmanagers
and developers.

On November 14 we are holding a similar workshop in Brisbane
