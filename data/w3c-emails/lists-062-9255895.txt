EOWG:

Because of a number of regrets received and consequent low turnout for 
today's meeting, and the nature of some of the topics on the agenda (eg., 
charter renewal), after a brief initial update on the Copenhagen meeting we 
are postponing the rest of today's discussion to this Friday morning, 15 
November when we should have a larger attendance.

Talk to you then.

- Judy
