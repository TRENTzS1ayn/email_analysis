Outreach updates:

On November 25 I gave an overview of WAI activities, working groups and 
recommendations to a mixed group of government, private sector and 
community professionals at a meeting of the International Commission on 
Technology and Accessibility (North America Regional Commission) in Montreal.

On December 3 Mary Frances Laughton and I had the opportunity to briefly 
mention the work of WAI, the IPO, and the relationship between WCAG and the 
Government of Canada's Common Look and Feel Website policy during a 
presentation to a mostly federal government audience at a conference on 
disability issues marking the International Day of Disabled Persons in Ottawa.

Agenda items:

Item 2:
         I looked at the latest Charter draft, and it seems fine to 
me.  Any concerns I may have had about the previous draft appear to have 
been fixed in this one.  Once Section 9 "Voting" and 10.3 "Intellectual 
Property Rights" sections are updated (as per Judy's internal notes) then I 
would vote to accept it.

Item 4:
         My personal wish would be to see #12. "How People with 
Disabilities Use the Web" moved higher on the list, say to #4 (or at least 
to #8).
         Regarding #4 "WCAG 2.0": is it wise to start soliciting 
translations when 2.0 is still so far from completion?

Regrets:
Family-related things this morning.
