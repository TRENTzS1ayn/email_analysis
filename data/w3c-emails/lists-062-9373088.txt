Judy, all,

Thinking about the issue of Team Expertise (see
http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/reviewteams.html) after tonight's meeting, one
area is missing - probably from supplementary, rather than core - and that
is a knowledge of ATAG 1.0. With many online systems enabling the creation
of additional content now, this is becoming of increasing importance.

What do others think?

Andrew
