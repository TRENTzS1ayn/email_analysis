EOWG:

We have a call at our regularly scheduled time this Friday, 20 December 2002.

At our last Friday's meeting, we agreed to cancel the planned meeting for 
today, Wednesday 18 December 2002, due to a number of scheduling conflicts 
for EOWG participants.

I have updated our EOWG meeting schedule through January; please remember 
to check the schedule of upcoming meetings regularly, and write these into 
your calendar:

Regards,

- Judy
