This updated list shows suggested priorities, based on our discussion last 
week, for volunteer translators of WAI materials.

The page with suggested priorities would include links to existing W3C 
policies on translations, document use, annotations, etc. The deliverables 
would include brief status notes so that potential translators would know 
how stable the document is before beginning translation. Length of each 
item would be noted. The list of suggested priorities should be updated at 
least quarterly. If/when available, the WAI policy for authorized 
translations would also be linked from this page.

Comments?
