Hello,
In order to maintain reader's focus on "economic factors",it may be ok just to state that accessible design enhances 
general usability besides enhancing access to PWD and not explain how this happens.      The detailing breaks the flow, I think. Ditto for the part on advanced Web that mentions metadata ..., structural markup ...,standards compliant code ... and  separation of content from presenation.
Similarly, consider knocking off the list following the statement on search engines. Likewise, stating that tech factors, social factors and QA have a beneficial impact is good enough with a link to those pages without listing how. The document should quickly get to the  part on costs and calculation of ROI. It should deal with likely problems(like objective assessment of some costs and benefits)  one might encounter in this process and  the possible workarounds. I believe this is the core of the business suite and  should make up the bulk of the doc.
It may be more appropriate for instance to discuss how  audience growth may be measured in this part of the doc than in the earlier part.
Thanks,
