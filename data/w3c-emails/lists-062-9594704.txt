Hello All,

Afraid I've been interstate for a few days and incommunicado.

Can we please look at the documents we didn't get to last week, i.e. social
(through to literacy) and technical

I have not yet tidied up documents discussed last week - hope to get a
chance this evening before the call.

Andrew

PS - like Helle I'm presuming that the 18th April meeting as listed is an
error (if it goes ahead, please accept my regrets in advance)
