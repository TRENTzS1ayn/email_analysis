JB: Offering the same functionality seems clearer than equivalent 
facilitation, which is borrowing a policy concept into a technical area. 
But both seem like technical and/or abstract terms that the average reader 
of these slides may not quickly grasp.

JB: a very important aspect, towards proliferating accessible Web sites, is 
the extent to which authoring tools facilitate rather than impede the 
production of accessible content and sites. Since the Web was intended to 
be interactive, authoring is, in principle, just as an important activity 
as browsing.

JB: We could provide links to things that some people may be less familiar 
with.
