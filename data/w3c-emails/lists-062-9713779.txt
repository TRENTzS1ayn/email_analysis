EOWG:

An agenda for our Friday 4 April 2003 teleconference follows:

CAREFUL OF DIFFERENT DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME CHANGES!

Europe changed to Daylight Saving Time last weekend; some other countries 
have not yet changed. So, for instance, 8:30am US Eastern Standard Time 
this week would be 15:30 in Amsterdam or Paris, with Daylight Saving Time 
there, instead of 14:30 which it usually is; and it would be 11:30pm in 
Melbourne... assuming I'm reading the charts right. Please check for 
yourselves, at:
         http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/
         http://webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/g.html

Time:           8:30am - 10:30am US Eastern Standard Time
Bridge: (Zakim): +1 617 761 6200
