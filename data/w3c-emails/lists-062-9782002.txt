Hello, all -

Yes, this is wordsmithing; but given that my changes below change emphasis
somewhat, I'm posting here.

Would suggest:

1. Placing the "thats" at the end of the first-level bullet phrases rather
than having "that" begin each second-level bullet phrase. (Less redundant,
begins each second-level bullet phrase with a stronger word, and makes each
phrase stand out more clearly.)

2. Capitalizing the first word of each second-level bullet. (Stronger
beginning than lower-case first letter.)

3. Deleting the semi-colons and the "ands" ending second-level bullet
phrases. (Bullets already separate the content, so they aren't necessary.
Also, the text looks cleaner without them, and each phrase stands out a bit
more clearly.)

4. No comma after "Web authoring tools"
