Good morning all,

Feel it is necessary to spell out  what empowerment really is. Will serve as an eyeopener for many in the audience unconnected withPWDs.   
Perhaps following content  can be incorporated into the doc.
Empowerment: gives privacy and independence to do tasks that most take for granted an tasks for which PWD is dependent on  individuals around him. PWD can avoid/reduce the rigours  of actually commuting/traveling.
Can participate in: 
shopping, 
job search and applying, 
education including distance
getting  news and doing Web based info search, 
banking and investment management
travel and hotel authorizations, 
looking up bus and train schedules
doctor appointments 
identify and participate in    social/ recreation programs of ones interest, and so on.
Thanks,
