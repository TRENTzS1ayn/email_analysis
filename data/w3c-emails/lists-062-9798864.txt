Hi all,

Sorry, in to days call I forgot to mention an interesting 'outreach-update' we had. To day the 11th of April the European parliament is meeting in Greece. One of the members of the European parliament was asked to hold a speech about accessibility towards the European ministers. A view weeks ago we had a talk with him about what he could stress in his talk. We talked a lot and asked him to emphasize on the need of harmonization of the accessibility initiatives in Europe and on the Authoring Tools Accessibility Guidelines.

Regards,
Henk
