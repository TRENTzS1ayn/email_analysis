For your consideration:
1. there is a need for consistency  in the doc titles and the opening statements in the 
introduction section of each doc. Are we presenting benefits or listing social/economic/tech 
considerations  as the title suggests? Is "factors"  equated with  benefits in the eco 
factors page?
I think we mean benefits and the doc title and the intro section should use this term.
However, the legal factors / policy page explains the motivation for various kind of orgs to 
pursue accessibility and it is not  a listing of benefits.
2.  The intro to the legal page  states that this is part of a suite of docs that comprise 
of...Such a statement must be included in the intro of other docs in the suite as well. 


I reproduce the  statements for ease of reference:

Doc title= Technical Factors for Consideration in a Business Case for Web Accessibility

implementing Web accessibility.
