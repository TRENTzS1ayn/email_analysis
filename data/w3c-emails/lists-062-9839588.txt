For your consideration:
A. Social considerations page:
- Is second part of doc necessary... portion which contains  references to a few checkpoints?The tone of the doc suddenly seems to change. Is it now  justifying a few of the checkpoints or suggesting how guidelines help to attaina few of the advantages listed in the doc? 

- By the way, "clearly identifying the target of each link " helps all users and text to speech AT users as well. Not just users of old technology. At end of doc see:
. Clear Navigation and Links - providing clear and consistent navigation and clearly identifying the target of each link is a major benefit to users who
have to utilize old hardware.

B. Technical factors page:
Are references to checkpoints necessary here to say how site maintenance, server loading and device independence are supported in the WCAG?
The docs become longer when checkpoints are reproduced here. In case we must, then it needs to be restated in  lay language... the WCAG language does not make    for easy reading (most frequent criticism).
I guess readers of business suite are  looking for conceptual inputs highlighting macro/micro level issues here.
