EOWG:

This is what we came up with in EOWG after considerable discussion several 
weeks ago:

---------------

What is Web Accessibility?

Web accessibility means access to the Web by everyone, regardless of 
disability.

Web accessibility includes:
- Web sites and applications
         -- that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, 
navigate, and interact with;
- Web browsers and media players
         -- that can be used effectively by people with disabilities, and
         -- that work well with assistive technologies that some people 
with disabilities use to access the Web;
- Web authoring tools, and evolving Web technologies
         -- that support production of accessible Web content and Web 
sites, and
         -- that are usable by people with disabilities.

--------------

I took this to the WAI Coordination Group (Chairs of all WAI Working 
Groups) given their interest in the topic. There was some concern about 
whether the term "access to" was adequate, and Jan Richards suggested 
"effective use," which the other WAI CG members thought would be effective. 
Here is a slightly modified version of something he suggested, for your 
further consideration:

--------------

What is Web Accessibility?

Web accessibility means effective use of all aspects of the Web by
everyone, regardless of disability.

Effective use means the ability to perceive, understand, navigate,
author and interact, by oneself or with appropriate assistive technology.

Aspects of the Web include Web sites and applications, Web browsers
and media players, Web authoring tools, and evolving Web technologies.

--------------

I'm wondering whether we can't just build the term "effective use" into our 
original slide?

Regards,

- Judy
