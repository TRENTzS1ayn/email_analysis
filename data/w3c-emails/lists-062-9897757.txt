EOWG:

Following today's meeting, I had a couple requests for the EO-Editor's
list address, so I'm sending this message to the entire list.

Please use the EO Editors list, wai-eo-editors@w3.org, for changes that
probably do not need EOWG discussion, such as "copyedit" changes
(spelling and punctuation fixes) to working drafts (such as the
currently in progress "business case"), and additions to list of links.
(Note that the archive for the EO Editors list is publicly available at:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/wai-eo-editors/.)

Please use the EOWG list, w3c-wai-eo@w3.org, for substantive changes
that EOWG members might want to see and discuss, such as changes in
content wording that changes the meaning, and document re-organization.
(Note that the archive for the EOWG list is publicly available at: 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-eo/.)

Please be sure to send messages to an archived list (such as those
above), rather than just to a single editor, as appropriate.

Thanks!

~Shawn
