Hello All,
I picked this up from http://slashdot.org/ <http://slashdot.org/> 

Slashdot News for Nerds.

RMH101 writes "The Register
<http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/69/34894.html>  has a story about a UK
initiative to create a country-wide wireless data network using street
lamps. It's come to pass through a government initiative
<http://www.gnn.gov.uk/gnn/national.nsf/0/8385FE9F51EB868280256C1700390C87?o
pendocument> to monitor all cars' speed and location, all the time,
everywhere. The company involved, Last Mile, are proposing an intelligent
mesh of smart street lamps embedded with storage and wireless networking to
create 200MBit network access across the UK, including remote areas not
reachable by conventional broadband. Work is due to start this year."
