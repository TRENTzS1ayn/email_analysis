Hello Judy and all,

I seem to have problems with my microphone today, so that you could not 
hear me speaking.

First, I wanted to say that I have the same problem as Henk, when clicking 
on the first link of the logos.

2. When I click on the "getting started" link, I come to the french version 
of the document.

For people who are new to this document, I think it is good to come to the 
document from their language.

nevertheless, there should be somewhere a quick note explaining how to get 
to another version of the document. Just as Judy is explaining:
"please type .nl at the end of the URL to get the Dutch version".

What do you think of this proposal?

Regards

Sylvie

>I have updated the content in the WAI Resources page:

>
>A list of edits is below, for review and comment during our teleconference 
>today.
>
>Please note that this is an update of the _content_ on the WAI Resources 
>page, and not an attempt to implement the re-organizations discussed and 
>proposed by the WSTF. Those suggestions deserve ample separate consideration.
>
>The updates to content were for the most part long overdue, and include:
>
>1. Added link to draft "How People with Disabilities Use the Web" and 
>labeled it Working Draft.
>
>2. Added implementation planning resource suite, with its two sub-pages on 
>developing organizational policies, and selecting and using authoring 
>tools for Web accessibility.
>
>3. Removed auxiliary benefits document (thought I had done this a long 
>time ago, after we determined that as a stand-alone document it created 
>some confusion; hopefully will be replaced shortly by a completed business 
>case resource suite)
>
>4. Slightly shortened the description of the ATAG FAQ.
>
>5. Changed "procure" to "purchase" in description of UAAG FAQ, for more 
>consistency of language level.
>
>6. Added links to WCAG 2.0 and ATAG 2.0 Working Drafts -- labeling them 
>clearly as working drafts not yet for reference.
>
>7. Added W3C Note on accessibility problems of visual verification to 
>"Techniques" section.
>
>8. Added nested links to sub-documents of WCAG Techniques suite.
>
>9. Indicated that "Techniques for Accessibility Evaluation and Repair" is 
>a working draft.
>
>10. Added nested link to example layer of WCAG curriculum.
>
>11. Removed WCAG and ATAG translation links and replaced with link to W3C 
>translations.
>
>12. Added "Translating WAI Documents" link
>
>13. Swapped "policy" and "events" section since "events" section is out of 
>date, and re-arranged links on nav bar (note: WAI home page needs to 
>change as well)
>
>14. Updated "search" link
