  It would have been really useful if it had done what its name suggests. But it has not really looked at  the  tools' ability / accuracy  in detecting/ correcting violations. That I believe is the essence of  such a study. User interface,reporting capabilities and platforms support are addressed  by the study and are useful factors for comparison when  the tools being compared  have  similar abilities and accuracy in detecting / correcting violations.
  I wonder  if WAI-E&R should  do such a study and  list strengths and weaknesses of desktop  / server versions of available   Web accessibility E&R tools. That will really benefit the community of accessibility developers / auditors.
