Hi,
 
Just wanted to provide my two cents re the report:
 
It seems that the results are out of date. This report was authored with
respect to InFocus 4.1.2, which supported only Section 508. 

The most recent version, 4.2.2, supports Section 508 and the WCAG P1, P2,
P3. 

Best regards,

It would have been really useful if it had done what its name suggests. But
it has not really looked at  the  tools' ability / accuracy  in detecting/
correcting violations. That I believe is the essence of  such a study. User
interface,reporting capabilities and platforms support are addressed  by the
study and are useful factors for comparison when  the tools being compared
have  similar abilities and accuracy in detecting / correcting violations.
I wonder  if WAI-E&R should  do such a study and  list strengths and
weaknesses of desktop  / server versions of available   Web accessibility
E&R tools. That will really benefit the community of accessibility
developers / auditors.
