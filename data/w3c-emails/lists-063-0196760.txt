Hello All,

I just had a look at the WAI resource page and would like to share some 
small comments.

1. One of the icons of the navitation bar has an alt="arrow". It is the 
icon for "wai resources". This text alternative seems not clear to me.

2. In the section on "techniques", the first link refers to 
"Inaccessibility of Visually-Oriented Anti-Robot Tests". Is there a reason 
to have placed this document as the first link of the list (to underline 
the importance of this document). All other lists of documents (guidelines, 
frequently asked questions..." begin with links to documents about the 
guidelines. I think it would be more logical to first have links to the 
guidelines techniques and to have after that the link to other 
documents  such as "Inaccessibility of Visually-Oriented Anti-Robot Tests".

3. The link to "Logos for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines " does not 
work (no change to last week). Some of my colleagues tested this link with 
other versions of IE, and they have the same error message as Henk 
indicated last week.

4. The link to "Frequently Asked Questions on Authoring Tool Accessibility 
Guidelines (ATAG)  does not work. It links to : "2000/02/ATAG-faq".  I get 
the message that my browser cannot open the page.

Regards

Sylvie
