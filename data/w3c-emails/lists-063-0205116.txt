EOWG:

I have updated the draft of "Why Standards Harmonization is Essential to 
Web Accessibility":
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/standard-harmon.html

The change log is up-to-date, indicating which items are done; which have 
placeholders in the text; and on which there are questions remaining:
