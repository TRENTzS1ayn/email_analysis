Brussels, Belgium
The conference will bring together decision-makers at the highest level to discuss the problems and potential solutions to open up the Information Society for all deaf, hard of hearing and speech-impaired people. The aim of the conference is to move towards a common European strategy in broadcasting and telecommunications and to start removing some of the barriers to opportunity and fulfilment. Enterprise and Information Society Commissioner Erkki Liikanen will be a keynote speaker at the event and Per Blixt, Head of Unit for Disability and Elderly People at Directorate General of the Information Society will chair the last of the plenary session.
