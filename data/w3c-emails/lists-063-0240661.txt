Dear EOWG Participants:

We need to cancel tomorrow's EOWG meeting. As I mentioned last week, I will 
be in other meetings at that time tomorrow, and Shawn has some health 
complications at the moment.

Please stay tuned for document drafts that we may be circulating to the 
list for comment, however.

Our next teleconference is scheduled for Friday 27 February 2004. Upcoming 
meetings are listed at:
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/#meetings

Regards,

Judy and Shawn
