5. Under "Barriers to Use"

That is, some people do not have the financial means to afford [decent],
regular [reliable] access to the Web, or the social environment that
encourages Web use.

CHG:   ...   Can we use reliable instead of regular.

SLH: i think the main focus here is on people who do not have any
Internet access in their home - so they have limited access from school
or work or library or such - so i think that is more like regular than
reliable...
