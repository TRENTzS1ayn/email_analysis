Very good points; however, I think this is going beyond the scope of
this document. This document focuses on how to make a business case for
Web accessibility, not telling organziations that they _should_ have a
CSR & Web accessibility policy. That might fit better in Developing
Organizational Policies on Web Accessibility
(http://www.w3.org/WAI/impl/pol.html ). yes?
