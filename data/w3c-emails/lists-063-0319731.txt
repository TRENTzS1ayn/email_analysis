EOWG:

I have again updated the draft of "Why Standards Harmonization is Essential 
to Web Accessibility":
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/standard-harmon.html

The change log is mostly up-to-date:
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/standard-harmon-changelog.html

I've incorporated some of our most recent change requests, moved Web 
Developers up ahead of Authoring Tools, redistributed some content between 
those sections, and done some general copy-editing throughout.

Note that there are two sections which still need text and could use some 
brainstorming. In addition, please note several sections marked "@@Needs 
Review," in particularly the "fragmentation" and "action" sections, 
although the whole document is still in that category as well.

In reviewing the document, please consider:
         - is the tone appropriate?
         - is the content accurate?
         - is the message clear?
         - is the rationale effective?

Thank you,

- Judy
