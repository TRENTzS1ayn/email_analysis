I certainly enjoyed the EASI web clinic 2004-02-26, which addressed many 
issues
that we are concerned with. Few WAI participants attended.

     The URL below is for the archive of that EASI Web Clinic.  If you 
attended,
you can listen again.  If you missed it, you can listen to a replay it:

     Making Distance Education Accessible
     http://easi.cc/archive/feb26/feb26.htm

A panel discussion with the authors of the recent book:

     Design and Implementation of  Web-Enabled Teaching Tools

Mary Hreiko, Kent State University
Sheryl Burgstahler, University of Washington
Lauri Harrison, University of Toronto ATRC

I've ordered the book -- good material on distance learning as well
as traditional teaching.

There is some setup required, so you can simultaneously see the slides,
hear the commentary, and participate in the discussion. It is available for
download:

You can get the special plug-in player needed (at least for Windows) at:

     http://www.rit.edu/~easi/webcast/weekarch.htm

On-screen below the slide window in two windows see the list of participants
on the left [with current speaker highlighted], and the commentary on the 
right.
In the past that right screen would have had concurrent transcription -- the
translator who had provided that service was recently laid off from whatever
company he had been working with.

Equal Access to Software and Information (EASI)

Project EASI is led by Prof. Norman Coombs and Dick Banks. Learn and
enjoy the many things they do well.

     http://easi.cc/

I look back joyfully to my first experience with distance learning in one 
of the EASI on-line
workshops on accessibility.

Project EASI has webcast archives of 88 of their talks and interviews. All 
use the special player/
viewer identified above, which you can get at the start of these.

     http://www.rit.edu/~easi/webcast/weekarch.htm

The next free clinic will be March 4, with Julie Howell, Digital Policy 
Development Officer,
Royal National Institute of the Blind. You need to sign up for it.

Special Day-long Webcast from the CSUN Tech and Disabilities Conference 
Thursday
March 18. EASI is hosting presentations at the California State University 
Northridge
Technology (CSUN) and Persons with Disabilities. You can join any time 
after 8 AM Pacific!

Read more and register at http://easi.cc/csuncast.htm

If you haven't had the privilege of meeting Prof. Norm Coombs, I encourage 
you to
seek him out and introduce yourself. In past years project EASI has 
sponsored an
evening reception as well. I'll miss going to CSUN and this highlight of 
the week.
