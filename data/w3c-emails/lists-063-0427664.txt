Roberto,

I believe you misunderstood the phrase and the intent. Additional comments 
below.

No. We are not searching for "authorized translators." We are establishing 
a process whereby authorized translations of W3C/WAI documents may be 
allowed in languages other than English. A draft policy on this has been in 
progress for some time, and those attending the EOWG meeting here received 
a brief preview of the draft process whereby authorized translations might 
be developed. However, as the policy is still under development -- and 
obviously so prone to misunderstandings -- we are not quite at the point 
yet of circulating it for comment.

We're already quite well aware of this problem, which is why we have been 
investing considerable time in developing a policy whereby it will 
eventually be possible to have authorized (official) versions of W3C/WAI 
documents in other languages. In fact our efforts on this question are a 
direct result of discussion with representatives of a number of countries 
including yours.

WCAG 1.0 is not an American document, regardless of the issue of normative 
language. As you're well aware, W3C is an international organization, and 
WCAG 1.0 received extensive international input while under development.

If we're listing real fragmentation drivers in the standards harmonization 
document, we obviously need to include this issue, since as you clearly 
agree, this is in fact a fragmentation driver.

If we are in the midst of developing a process to address the problem, we 
also can indeed also mention this fact in our document. It's apparently not 
yet expressed clearly enough -- however, the point of a draft is to try to 
arrive at clear ways to express things. Comments are welcome, but are 
particularly helpful when they don't assume the worst.

Roberto, this is exactly what we're working on.
