I expose my naivety here:

Might W3C offer an unofficial multi-language translation service as a starting
version for translating any of their documents? For example, the following 
link shows
a large selection of languages that might gain translations:

Translation Software: English to/from Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, 
Italian, Polish, Russian, Japanese, Chinese, and  Korean.

      http://www.allvirtualware.com/languages/index.html

Or must this function be only done by the individual who needs a 
particular  translation?
