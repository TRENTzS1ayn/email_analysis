Hi group,

here's my change request about fragmentation factors in "Why Standards Harmonization is Essential to Web Accessibility" document: 

Actual sentence:
"the lack of an authorized translation of a guideline in a local language -- yet for WCAG 2.0, W3C/WAI expects authorized translations to be possible; "

My proposal:
"the lack of authorized translations of guidelines and raccomandations in local languages -- W3C/WAI is actually working on a authorized translations protocol to allow local W3C officies to start and translating guidelines in local languages;"


My best regards,
