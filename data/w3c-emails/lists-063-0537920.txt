EOWG:

I have again updated the draft of "How People with Disabilities Use the Web":
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/PWD-Use-Web/20040302.html

The change log is up-to-date:
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/PWD-Use-Web/changelog.html

I've incorporated some of our most recent change requests from last week, 
and made more progress on the old change requests.

In reviewing the document, please:
         - check for internationalization of disability terminology
         - check for gaps in assistive technology and adaptive computing
         - review the "teenager" example
         - review (again) the "supermarket assistant" example

Thank you,

- Judy
