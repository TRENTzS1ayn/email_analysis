Including WCAG 2.0 gives the idea more weight, but if it doesn't happen, 
the effect could bethe opposite. Is the initiative only for WAI or is it 
for W3C in general? If it's only for WAI documents perhaps it won't be 
sufficient to satisfy legislators.

We could also say that translations are available and "managed" or 
"catalogued" by W3C and that there is nothing to stop governments approving 
these.

However, it is my understanding that here in Spain the law can not require 
organisations to comply with something that is not a normative standard. It 
isn't a language problem.
