I just asked a non-native speaker to read the supermarket assistant section 
and we think that the following are difficult to understand:

* "[he] finds the number of product choices overwhelming"
  maybe we could say somthing like
  "[he] finds that there are so many product choices that he becomes 
confused"

* Although the title is easier to understand with "supermarket", "store" is 
still used in the text.

* "rearranges its product layout"
  could be "changes the layout of the products in the store" or "He has 
difficulty finding products because they are often in a different place"

* "they used _consistent design_ and _navigation options_" the reader was 
confused by the link text as "consistent" becomes separated when reading 
the text of the second link independently (like "they used ... navigation 
options")

* "few fresh daily items" could be "few fresh items each day"

In the references (#intell, #supl, #search etc) the link text is still 
"clerk".

One problem I've had with internationalisation of disability information is 
"seizure disorders" which doesn't translate easily into Spanish.

best,

Alan
