I think that the translation problem concerns the whole W3C, and all its documents

Correct, also in Italy there is the same situation, but is overlapped by European Parliament decisions; an European Parliament document enforces all members to reach double A; local policies, like the italian one, can refer to EU raccomandations which are considered normative standards.

> It isn't a language problem.

This is a general problem, and Italy or Spain may represent only one of the many situations that can happen all over the "non-english" world; in this vision, language could not be the only problem, but IMHO is the common one.
