Hi Henk and list
I think these suggestions are very good and think we should try to
incorporate them in the document.
Regarding the deafness example this is also what the deaf student at the
panel in Madrid mentioned that deaf people very often have difficulties
reading because of the difference between sign language and written
language. Unfortunately I don't have a ready suggestion to how to
incorporate this into the deafness scenario but maybe we can come up with
something during the call.
Also there are some good points in Alan's comments. Maybe we have to take
yet another look in order to be sure we are keeping the language in the
document clear and simple.
Cheers
Helle

Hi EOWG colleagues,

Here are some suggestions for the PWD document:


1.)
The 'heading' above the overview of described scenarios (chapter 2) is
now:

The following scenarios illustrate the accessibility solutions listed in
parentheses (...) below:

Would it not be better to have the following?

The following is an overview of the described scenarios with their given
accessibility solutions:


2.)
Although the lack of alternative text of graphical information on
websites is a big problem for people with visual impairment, and the
'Alt text' guideline pops-up most when thinking of examples of website
accessibility issues, we did not imply or even mention this in the
described scenarios.

Although I realize that we can't cover every applicable accessibility
issue in each scenario, following the second paragraph of the scenario
of the 'Accountant with blindness' we could ad: 
Since a screen reader can't interpret the meaning of graphical
information Ms. Laitinen is dependent of the alternative text that has
been added to the images used for a better understanding of the textual
information and for the navigation system of the web site.


3.) 
In the list of barriers that people with low vision may encounter on the
Web (section 3) we use the phrase:

'imaged text that cannot be re-wrapped'
I think this is difficult to understand for people that do not have
English as a first language


4.)
Description of deafness in section 3

We do cover the captions or transcripts, requirements for voice input
and content-related images but not the fact that people with early
deafness can't cope with difficult and long words, sentences and text
portions. 
A few weeks ago I discussed this with the head of the resource center of
the university of Brno (Czech Republic) and he described it this way:
blind students I can help by sending lots of information by e-mail, deaf
students I have to SMS them to send them information. Meaning that the
loss of hearing at an early age gives in many cases more problems with
the textual communication as it is with the auditive communication.

5.)
According to my spell checker:
braille = Braille
refered = referred
labelled = labeled

EOWG:

I have again updated the draft of "How People with Disabilities Use the
Web":
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/PWD-Use-Web/20040302.html

The change log is up-to-date:
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/PWD-Use-Web/changelog.html

I've incorporated some of our most recent change requests from last
week, 
and made more progress on the old change requests.

In reviewing the document, please:
         - check for internationalization of disability terminology
         - check for gaps in assistive technology and adaptive computing
         - review the "teenager" example
         - review (again) the "supermarket assistant" example

Thank you,

- Judy
