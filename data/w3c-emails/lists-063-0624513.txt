Here are some comments:
1. Online shopper with cognition difficulties:  spawning new windows / Pop-ups  can be a barrier. So you can say the sites  have them or do not have them
2. For vision impaired users: 
- device dependent event triggers on forms make keyboard use impossible
- Links not grouped so skipping to content or desired group is a problem
- Text sections not marked up with headers so need to  read entire text
- required fields on forms  are bold faced or colored
- PDF files and  inaccessible Flash or multi media
3. For people with motor impairments
Ref: ". forms that cannot be tabbed through in a logical order (Note: "Tabindex" solution not yet well supported in browsers.)"
SP:Tabindex works at least with IE 5.5 and above  (more than 90% market share?)
4. For people who are deaf:
-audio webcasts that do not have transcripts  
5. Assistive Technologies and Adaptive Strategies
I think accessibility features built into OS like sticky keys, filtter keys, fontsize  and color setting, sound sentry, mouse keys are not mentioned.

General note:Will it be more helpful for all to get the documents for review at least 24 hours before the meeting  ? It will surely help me to read the doc and have my comments  ready before the meeting.

  Subject: Updated "How People with Disabilities Use the Web" for review in 12 March 2004 Teleconference



  EOWG:

  I have again updated the draft of "How People with Disabilities Use the Web":
           http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/PWD-Use-Web/20040302.html

  The change log is up-to-date:
           http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/PWD-Use-Web/changelog.html

  I've incorporated some of our most recent change requests from last week, 
  and made more progress on the old change requests.

  In reviewing the document, please:
           - check for internationalization of disability terminology
           - check for gaps in assistive technology and adaptive computing
           - review the "teenager" example
           - review (again) the "supermarket assistant" example

  Thank you,

  - Judy
