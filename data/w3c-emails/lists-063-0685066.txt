EOWG folks,

The 4 main sub pages of the "business case" (Social Factors, Technical
Factors, Financial Factors, and Legal & Policy Factors) are ready for
final content review. (I will do one more pass at "wordsmithing" and
copyediting of these pages.) I have not edited the Overview at all and
it needs a rewrite, and the new References page is just notes dumped in
and needs lots of work.

For the Friday 26 March teleconference, please focus your content review
on the following pages:
- http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/soc.html >Social Factors
- http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/tech.html >Technical
Factors
- http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/econ.html >Financial
Factors
- http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/pol.html >Legal & Policy
Factors

and the following issues:

a. Are all topics covered? How is the depth of coverage (not too much,
yet enough to explain)? Are the topics covered in the right page? Are
the appropriately referenced from other pages in which they apply?

b. How does the new format (having customization questions first) work?
(It seems to me to work very well in Social Factors. In Legal & Policy
Factors, it is too repetitive with the "Considerations for Different
Types of Organizations" section (in a previous e-mail I offered ideas
for addressing this). In Technical Factors the questions section doesn't
seem necessary, but I think OK to leave for consistency. In Financial
Factors, it seems a little bit redundant with the rest of it, but
probably will be good after a little tweaking.)

Please also see additional review questions in e-mail sent to the list
on Monday 15 March, archived at:

IMPORTANT NOTE: Please send comments to the appropriate list.

discussion to:
