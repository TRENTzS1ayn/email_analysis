Introduction  fifth bullet, make text parallel with others:

     it helps organizations avoid liability in cases where there
     are legal or policy obligations for accessibility of
     information and communications technologies.

I note that in the next section, its list starts out with that liability topic.
Suggest list parallelism in order. -- as this is a business case,
I recommend making that [attention-grabbing] topic first in the 
Introduction too.
