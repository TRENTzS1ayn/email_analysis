Please read and consider the following proposal with regard to the name of 
the business case resource suite. I've provided some background for those 
who may ask why we are raising the topic of the suite name again.

At our 5 March 2004 EOWG face-to-face meeting, we at one point had roughly 
the following discussion about the name of the business case resource suite:

1. You know, "presenting the case for Web accessibility" still doesn't seem 
to describe exactly what this resource suite is -- people may land on these 
pages and still not realize what it is until they read it for a while. 
Maybe we should look at this again...

2. We've already renamed it a number of times, and in each case, we noted 
that each name could be misinterpreted one or more different ways, for 
instance:
         * business case for web accessibility (sounds like this is a 
ready-to-go business case, already prepared)
         * customizing a business case for web accessibility ("customizing" 
isn't widely understood)
         * building the case for web accessibility (sounds as though we're 
trying to fabricate a case)
         * presenting the case for web accessibility (sounds like it might 
be presentation tips for business cases)
The last time we renamed it, we noted that that still might not be the best 
final name, but we wanted to at least change it from what "building the 
case" because of the possible negative interpretation that there wasn't 
already a good case to be made

3. Okay, let's brainstorm a bit and see if we come up with something 
better.... No, we're wasting our time talking about renaming it yet 
again... We should just be describing what the document is -- why does that 
seem to be so hard? Hey, wait, what if we just describe it clearly, and 
call it "developing a web accessibility business case for your 
organization" -- after all, that's how we describe it to people to whom we 
point out the document, so it should save us some trouble explaining what 
the document is if we just call it that.

4. So then the proposal to consider, page by page through the suite, would be:
         Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case for Your 
Organization: Overview
         Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case for Your 
Organization: Social Factors
         Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case for Your 
Organization: Technical Factors
         Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case for Your 
Organization: Financial Factors
         Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case for Your 
Organization: Legal and Policy Factors
         Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case for Your 
Organization: References
-- or -- we could use a shorter version for the sub-pages, but if someone 
lands on those directly, then they'll still be confused.

Thoughts?
