>Presenting the Case for Web Accessibility

I likely will sleep through the conference!

I would like to comment on a feature that is addressed in two different 
ways throughout the resources, having to do with the relationship between 
the "liability" and "social responsibility" points of view. Although my 
usual stance has sided with the "it's the law!" viewpoint, I also recognize 
the merit of complimenting folks on their being "good citizens" in these 
matters so:

In the overview document introduction section "... Web accessibility helps 
organizations avoid liability" seems too much like the sort of advice one 
gives to help miscreants
avoid prosecution or evade taxes! Later in the "Identify the Organization's 
Interests" section this stance is "softened" to "...wanting to show its 
leadership as a socially responsible organization" and later under "Sample 
Outlines for Different Environments" is the somewhat colder "avoidance of 
legal exposure" bullet.

I think some way should be found to use language that doesn't appear 
threatening, but still informs the reader that this stuff is now, and will 
likely increasingly become, THE LAW. Whether this is accomplished by 
commending "good citizenship" or pointing out the sanctions of regulations 
and public opinion, our choices of approach should be carefully chosen.
