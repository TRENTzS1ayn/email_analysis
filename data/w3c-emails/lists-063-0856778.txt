EOWG participants:

We are close to wrapping up the business case resource suite.
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/
Please review and comment on the full resource suite before our 
teleconference this week. At last week's EOWG teleconference I mentioned 
(several times, I think) how useful it had been for me to read through the 
whole suite, top to toe, to see how things are fitting together. I then 
sent some comments to Shawn, which she has processed and sent to the 
wai-eo-editors@w3.org list:
         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/wai-eo-editors/2004Mar/0029.html

Please read Shawn's reply to my comments to see how this works. She's noted 
in brackets [...] how she dealt with each of my comments, and any questions 
that she has about what I meant. Note that in my comments I tried to 
briefly but clearly indicate the location within the document of anything 
that I was commenting on.

In addition, I tried to provide a suggestion on how to fix anything I 
thought needed fixing -- though I know that as the document's editor she's 
not necessarily going to find that all of my suggestions work well.

Finally, I tried to prioritize what I commented on, and didn't get into a 
lot of copyediting since I know that she's still doing copyediting on the 
document, and what I mainly wanted to do was comment on things where the 
document seemed to be communicating something different than the group 
might intend, based on our conversations, or wasn't communicating clearly.

We will be setting up some kind of survey of EOWG participants in good 
standing
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/EOWG-members.html
for sign-off on this document shortly. This is a last chance for 
substantive comments on the resource suite before moving ahead to get 
consensus on it.

Thank you,

- Judy
