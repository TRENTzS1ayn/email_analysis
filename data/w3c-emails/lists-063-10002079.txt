Hi all,

Someone told me that he heard that in May there is a WAI meeting in
Amsterdam.
Can someone tell me if this is true and where I can get more details?

I'm member of a new group of poeple in the Netherlands who try to get
more attention for Internet accessibility problems for the disabled and
the WAI guidelines.
