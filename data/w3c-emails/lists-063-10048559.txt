This ties the items in the bullet list to the condition "Where we can not 
find a tool..."

Actually, we'll want to do these even if there is a tool somewhere that 
does implement a technique.  It's just that lacking such a tool, it's even 
more important to do one or more of these things.

Also, these aren't exactly "deliverables" in the sense of a document or 
piece of software.

How about making this a list of

Related Deliverables.  These are deliverables that are not necessarily 
products solely of this group, but are rather deliverables to which we make 
a contribution.  Our contribution may include, but are not limited to
      - design or code for open source software such as Mozilla, Amaya, etc.
      - development of a prototype to test a design concept or promote it's use
      - documented discussions and feedback to developers of tools in 
progress, such as
         A-Prompt, Bobby, WAVE, etc.

----------
This is largely a rewording and tweaking of philosopy.

The one new thing is that feedback to developers would be documented.  This 
means providing feedback as an actual document to a tool developer, to tie 
together what would otherwise be scattered throughout email and meeting notes.

Maybe we should even break this out as a separate deliverable.
