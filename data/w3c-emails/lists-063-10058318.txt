This could be encapsulated as a page "grammar" which would be parsed to 
recognize the structure.  The parse might be ambiguous... in which case 
there would need to be a heuristic, e.g. a weighting function, to select 
the best fit.  Time to dust off the old AI textbooks (or buy new 
ones...).  This is a _very_ interesting research problem.
