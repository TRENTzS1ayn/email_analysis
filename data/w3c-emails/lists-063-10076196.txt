New title sounds fine. Would the short name then be "TERT" or stay "ERT"?

Subject: URGENT: title and short name for ER WG working draft

Hello,

In trying to get the ERT published as a public working draft as issue has
come up with the title and the short name.

I had proposed that the short name (the unique URI identifier) for this
document be "ERT" as that is what we have been calling it within the
group.  However, other W3C folks felt that the short name needs to reflect
the title of the document.

Currently, the title is, "Techniques For Evaluation And Implementation Of
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines"  which is a real mouthful...

The proposal is that we change the title to something along the lines of:
main title: "Techniques for Evaluation and Repair Tools"
subtitle: "for conformance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines"

thoughts? if we get this settled today it can still be published as a
public working draft this evening otherwise we wait until next week.

thanks,
--wendy
