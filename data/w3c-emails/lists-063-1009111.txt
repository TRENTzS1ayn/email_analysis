Welcome to the Web Accessibility Initiative Evaluation and Repair
(WAI-ER-IG) Interest Group (not to be confused with the overall WAI
Interest Group (WAI-IG).  

As you know from the charter,

http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/

we'll be advising the ER Working group on tools for evaluating, repairing,
and filtering web sites (some people will be members of both groups). In
addition to our own knowledge and experience, we'll rely on input from from
novice and expert users with disabilities, web authors and administrators,
ISP's, content owners, and vendors--some of whom will be ourselves.  

To start out, would you each say a few words about yourself and your
involvement in this area?   I attached my own description below.

Here's my own intro:

Hello.  I'm Len Kasday.  I had some opportunity to work on universal design
while I was at AT&T Bell Labs, e.g. designing the workstations at our Relay
centers to accommodate communications assistants who are sighted, who use
Braille, and who use a large screen and magnification.  I'm now at the
Institute on Disabilities at Temple University in Philadelphia.  Also, I'm
chair of this group.

(When you write about yourself please feel free to be a lot longer or
shorter than I was.  Also, if your official job, i.e. your "day" job, isn't
disability related, please mention it if you'd like to.   It can be very
helpful to get a different perspective).
