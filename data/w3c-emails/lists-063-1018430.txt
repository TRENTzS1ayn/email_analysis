I work for Smith-Kettlewell Institute's Rehabilitation Engineering
Research Center mostly on WAI stuff.  I'm on WGs for authoring tools,
education and outreach and now this one.  I have been feeding at the
blindness trough for about thirty years and have developed several
assistive devices in this area.

I believe that one of the major uses of the ER tools will be to form a
basis to objectivize (I also make up words!) accessibility standards in
a general effort to enable the ATBCB (now called the Access Board) to
set up enforcement mandates for Section 508 of the newly enacted HR 1385
which attempts to put teeth into the prohibition on the government
purchasing inaccessible software.
