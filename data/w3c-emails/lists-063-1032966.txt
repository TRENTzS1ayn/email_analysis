Hi,

I'm Tony Plant and I work for Nortel in the UK. My particular interest
is accessible design for corporate intranets. Nortel's own intranet
comprises around 13 000 websites in 24 countries. Evaluation and repair
on this scale is certainly a challenge! <grin>.

My background is in human-computer interaction, particularly graphical
user interface design. I pioneered the uptake of Virtual Reality
applications within Nortel and now lead a team developing advanced 2D
and 3D visualisation capabilities for telecoms network management
systems. The push to visualisation of complex data, whilst highly
beneficial in many aspects, has obvious implications for universal
accessibility.

Accessibility is too easily seen as an overhead on website management.
Pragmatic evaluation and repair guidelines, supported by appropriate
automated tools are essential to address this mis-conception and to
ensure that what starts accessible is kept that way through easy
maintenance.

Bye
Tony
