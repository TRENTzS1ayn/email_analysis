I like it. It gave informative critique on the test site I regularly start 
with:

     http://www.msnbc.com

I supplied my own email address. I haven't found anything returned to me
by email about that URL, as I had expected, had that email address been
to, say, the webmaster at msnbc.

Please add to the collection of tools.
