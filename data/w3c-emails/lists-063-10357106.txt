Subject: Joint WCG/UA teleconference to discuss navigation and 
orientation  concerns

A joint meeting of the Web Content and User Agent guidelines working
groups, to discuss document structures, orientation and navigation, has
now been scheduled for Thursday, 4 May, during the WCG teleconference
(2000 UTC).

This proposal was informally discussed, though not officially announced,
at last week's meeting, at which stage it was expected to be held this
week. However, a change of schedule has proved necessary. Hence, the joint
teleconference will be conducted next week, as part of the WCG working
group meeting.
