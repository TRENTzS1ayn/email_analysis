Dear All,

This message to inform you about the workshop on "Web Device
Independent Authoring" to be held in Los Angeles, California, USA,
June 22-23 2000.

This workshop is jointly organized by the W3C (WAI specifically) and
the WAP Forum.

The primary areas of interest for this workshop are the issues related
to developing a common set of Web content guidelines which would
facilitate transformation/navigation of generic Web content on non-PC
devices and at the same time ensure accessibility of this content for
people with disabilities.

For more information, see the Call for Participation which has just
been posted at http://www.w3.org/WAI/2000/06/wapwaicfp.htm
