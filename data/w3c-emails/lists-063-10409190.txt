Hi all,

What do people know about fuzzy logic?

It seems that we might want to investigate the topic for the 
guidelines.  It is my understanding (this is from a conversation with Bert 
Bos yesterday) that you take decisions from several sources and factor them 
together.  The basic idea is that truth is not black or white but that 
there are shades of grey.  You poll a number of sources for their opinion 
and determine a shade of grey (0 through 1) that gets rounded to final 
answer that is either 0 or 1.

For example:
Checkpoint 14.1 Use the clearest and simplest language appropriate for a 
site's content.

There are many methods to determine the reading level or legibility of a 
body of text (i don't know that any have been automated).  We could take 
the results of several, and combine them in some way to determine the 
"clarity" of content.

thoughts?
