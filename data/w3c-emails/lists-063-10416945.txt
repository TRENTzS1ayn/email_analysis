I think what you are describing is analog processing - it is what some
machines are designed to do and what nervous systems do. As I understand
fuzzy logic it actually adds a bit of randomness to the factorisation in
general opening things a bit wider, and then testing the resulting
conclusions, rather than deriving the validity of the conclusions from the
presumed validity of the premises.

There are several automated test for readability - have a look at a tool like
MS Word.

  Hi all,
  
  What do people know about fuzzy logic?
  
  It seems that we might want to investigate the topic for the 
  guidelines.  It is my understanding (this is from a conversation with Bert 
  Bos yesterday) that you take decisions from several sources and factor them 
  together.  The basic idea is that truth is not black or white but that 
  there are shades of grey.  You poll a number of sources for their opinion 
  and determine a shade of grey (0 through 1) that gets rounded to final 
  answer that is either 0 or 1.
  
  For example:
  Checkpoint 14.1 Use the clearest and simplest language appropriate for a 
  site's content.
  
  There are many methods to determine the reading level or legibility of a 
  body of text (i don't know that any have been automated).  We could take 
  the results of several, and combine them in some way to determine the 
  "clarity" of content.
  
  thoughts?
