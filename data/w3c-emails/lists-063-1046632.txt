My name is Daniel Dardailler and I work for W3C, acting as overall WAI
Project Manager and also chair of the Evaluation&Repair working group
(Len is chairing the Interest Group).

My involvement in Accessibility goes back to 1993 or so, when I
started working on X Window Access.

I started at W3C in 1996 and helped starting and launching the WAI in
1997.

I think the work we're about to do in these two complementary ER
groups is paramount to the success of the WAI.

Furthermore, I expect the ER IG to be instrumental in defining and
refining the exact deliverables of the WG group.
