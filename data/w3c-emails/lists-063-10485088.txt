ABSTRACT
Conformance testing for the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) 
provides a means for determining if an implementation satisfies the 
requirements and specifications of the standard. The National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) is developing a VRML test suite (VTS) to 
systematically address some of the problems posed by the nature of testing 
three-dimensional graphics. In addition, we will address using the WWW as a 
vehicle for delivering the VTS system. This paper discusses the test 
development strategy and design issues in developing the VTS.
