Regarding the excellent rate given by LIFT to pacareerlink.state.pa.us

Although the page rendered by the browser actually shows a number of
usability problems, LIFT is unable to identify them because the main
page simply starts a javascript script, and LIFT currently skips any sort
of scripts. This is the page that LIFT downloads and actually
evaluates:

   <html>
   <head><title></title>
   <script language="javascript">
   function jumpOn()
   {
   form = document.frmJump;

   //alert("Micah Mood is working on the browser detect (9/17/99 3:50 pm)\nbrowser name = " + cBrowserName + "\nversion = " + iBrowserVersion);
   form.submit();
   }
   </script>
   </head>
   <body onLoad="jumpOn()">
   <form name="frmJump" action="default.asp" method="post">
   <input type="hidden" name="no_point_at_all" value="">   </form>

   </body>
   </html>

for which there is not much to say.
