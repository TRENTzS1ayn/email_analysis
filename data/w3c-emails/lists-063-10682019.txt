Dear All,

This message to inform you about the workshop on "Web Device
Independent Authoring" to be held in Bristol, UK, October 3-4 2000,
hosted by HPLabs.

The Call for Participation and Registration forms are available at
   http://www.w3.org/2000/07/diw.htm

The primary areas of interest for this workshop are the issues related
to creating content for multiple platforms and for all users. Our goal
is to explore how the diverse needs of content providers and consumers
for delivery of content across many platforms can be met through the
use of appropriate standards, notations, tools and guidelines.
