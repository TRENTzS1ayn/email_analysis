Well, one important point for tools is that if there is no content there is
probably a problem...

  Regarding the excellent rate given by LIFT to pacareerlink.state.pa.us
  
  Although the page rendered by the browser actually shows a number of
  usability problems, LIFT is unable to identify them because the main
  page simply starts a javascript script, and LIFT currently skips any sort
  of scripts. This is the page that LIFT downloads and actually
  evaluates:
  
     <html>
     <head><title></title>
     <script language="javascript">
     function jumpOn()
     {
     form = document.frmJump;
  
     //alert("Micah Mood is working on the browser detect (9/17/99 3:50 pm)\nbrowser name = " + cBrowserName + "\nversion = " + iBrowserVersion);
     form.submit();
     }
     </script>
     </head>
     <body onLoad="jumpOn()">
     <form name="frmJump" action="default.asp" method="post">
     <input type="hidden" name="no_point_at_all" value="">   </form>
  
     </body>
     </html>
  
  for which there is not much to say.
