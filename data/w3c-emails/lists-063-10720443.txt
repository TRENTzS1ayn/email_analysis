Our weekly teleconference will take place Monday 8/7,, same time, same station:

10:00-11:30 Eastern USA Time (GMT -05:00) on the MIT bridge (+1 617-258-7910).


Agenda Item 1: Use of RDF to specify accessibility status of pages. This 
continues what we were discussing last tuesday's joint meeting with AU.

Our action item there was to review the capabilities of RDF... at least at 
a high level... and then think of some concrete examples of what assertions 
we would want to write and what inferences we would want to extract.

Example assertions:
1. A particular image [specified in some way] has no ALT text.
2. A particular image has ALT text but it's accuracy has not been manually 
checked
3. A particular image has ALT text and it's been check.  [this is so that 
tool doesn't keep asking you to check it]
4. This authority says that the following checkpoints are checked


Example inferences:
1. Based on assertions from a particular authority, this page is accessible.
2. Based on assertions from multiple authorities, this page is accessible.
3. This page would be accessible with the following browsers ...

Agenda Item 2:
Use of classes to define parts of a document (see discussion of "Grouping 
Links" at minutes
