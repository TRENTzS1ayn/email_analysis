Is this conference also going to address the development of guidelines that 
can optimize the benefits of the web for the educationally challenged  and 
persons with learning disability.

Should I ask my contacts at the learning disability organizations for their 
input? I can ask someone from the BDA (British Dyslexia Association) to 
attend.

Yours
Lisa Seeman
