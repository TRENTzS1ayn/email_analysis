Here's links to upcoming conferences... which are potential places to 
attach our next face to face.

What do people think of these?  Any other suggestions?

We also need suggestions for a host.

p.s.
note to people accessing by speech:  The missing ALT text on CUU 2000 is 
just a decorative icon--  hands of different colors circling and pointing 
to the earth. Also, they could have used a few more header tags, but 
overall  good job on accessibility I'd say.

As for the XML 2000 site.. most of the missing ALT tags are spacer images 
and sponsor logos. Almost all  the buttons on the navigation bars have ALT 
text.   I sent them a note.
