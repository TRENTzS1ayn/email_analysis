At today's GL Working Group meeting Andi said that HPR does *not* switch
languages on the <LANG> tag within a document - only on the basis of a
language-change identifying algorithm (and judging from your post, on
encountering <LANG> at the starting HTML area)?

Such an algorithm might be useful to the Evaluation & Repair Tools
Working Group.
