I'm working in the Norwegian Telecom company Telenor, In our R&D dep. My 
background is from Psychology, and I've been doing research on user Interface 
design and general HCI, before I begun working with assistive technology 5 years 
ago. 

 The term "design for all" have very little tradition in our part of the world, but we 
have now managed to get funding for a project that focuses on how a telecom 
company like ours can incorporate such design strategies.

Designing for accessibility is of course "the right thing to do", but we need good 
tools to actually have programmers apply these strategies. These tools should 
also have capabilities of improving the overall qualities on the product their 
making, to motivate for use of the tool itself.
