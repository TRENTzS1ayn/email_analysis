Washington DC

Reactions?

3. Brainstorm on accessibility of pages with Javascript.  What's most 
important to check for?

4. Grouping of elements on web pages.  This started out with a discussion 
of the MAP element.  I turns out that, indeed, the HTML 4 folks had 
intended it to group links.  The editor will be clarifying the language in 
a future update.  However, this still leaves open the question:  what if 
there are other types of grouping?  e.g. blocks of HTML that are "new", or 
"example", or "deprecated", or "sale" etc.  The author may define a 
class... e.g. class="new", class="example" etc. and link visual and 
auditory styles to that class.  Would it also be useful to inform the user 
in a logical way?  E.g. by having a text string that the user could 
access...a text string that would not necessarily match the internal class 
name.  And would it be useful for the user to search the document for that 
class.  (As you might guess, my personal opinion is "yes").
