The SVG access note at http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG-access provides some
explanationm of how to use RDFD for improving the accessibility of SVG (or
any other image for that matter. There is a Note on how to include RDF in
JPEGs at http://www.w3.org/TR/photo-rdf and there is a piece of software that
does it - http://jigsaw.w3.org/rdfpic - available as open source.

There is a javascript dummy toy at
http://www.w3.org/1999/11/11-WWWProposal/atagdemo that uses rdf in a
javascript interpreter to look for tools that conform to ATAG, but the schema
used is designed to work for anyof the WAI guidelines (or anything else that
has a URI for something taht can be conformed to - for example the namespace
URI for an XML application would work fine.
