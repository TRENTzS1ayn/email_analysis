Initial tab proliferation (to tens) across top in their current home page:

     http://www.amazon.com/

is addressed in proposed new design:

     http://www.amazon.com/new-navigation

They recognize that chunking is necessary.

"Our new navigation would place three main tabs at the top of the home 
page. When you first visit our site, you see two tabs: Welcome and 
Directory. But click one of the buttons under Today's Featured Stores at 
the upper right, and a third tab pops up. These buttons zip you where you 
want to go in a jiffy. And you never have more than three tabs to keep 
track of."

"Our new navigation adds tabs on the fly. Say you want to go directly to 
our bookstore. You'll see that button on the right, along with other 
buttons representing today's featured stores. Click the Books button. Now 
you have three tabs to help you get around: Welcome, Directory, and Books."

Their directory is chunked: "All Stores" into a list of 10 categories,
with several choices each. It also allows for Search All Products
