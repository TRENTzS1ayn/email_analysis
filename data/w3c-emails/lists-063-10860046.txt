Bobby 3.2 is in production with a number of improvements.  The most obvious 
is that the need to apply both the automatic and manual checks is now very

Would folks take a look and give more feedback on the list?  We can then 
make this one of our telecon topics, next week or maybe the week after, 
depending on how much discussion we have...
