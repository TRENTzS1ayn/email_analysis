New Bobby 3.2 features from the 'News' page (and bug fixes, of course):

Increased reliability and stability  (server loading has greatly decreased
with servlets, and the number of unfilled page requests due to busy server
has dropped drastically)

Redesign of the report for readibility and comprehensibility (reword to make
clearer user must perform some checks, separate out items which are always
reported regardless of page content)

Error descriptions rewritten for a less technical audience (more examples,
direct link to wai checkpoint, 'rationale' section, still more work to do here)

When testing pages with unusual color combinations, the Bobby report now
displays in black-and white instead of the color of the original page
(report in a table)

Support for secure web sites using Secure Socket Layers (SSL) 

Improved support for web pages in non-English character sets 

A workaround for a bug in Netscape that displays the message "Forbidden"
instead of a report when testing some web pages  (CSS files with relative path)

Compatability with assistive technologies including IBM's Self Voicing Kit
which allows for Bobby's interface to be read aloud by the computer
(downloadable Bobby) and the
Java Access Bridge.
