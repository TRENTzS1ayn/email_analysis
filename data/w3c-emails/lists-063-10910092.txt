There's an online service that converts various formats to html, including

                                                 PDF (Portable Document 
Format)
                                                 RTF (Rich Text Format)
                                                 TXT (Simple Text Format)
                                                 DOC (MSWord(R) Format)
                                                 XLS (MSExcel(R) Format)
                                                 PPT (MSPowerPoint(R) Format)


It will be interesting to see how it compares with adobe's and microsoft's 
converters.  Of course, if the original document didn't have structure, 
it's unlikely to result will either...
