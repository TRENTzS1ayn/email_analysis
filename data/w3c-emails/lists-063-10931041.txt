I have just put up the site http://www.signbrowser.org.uk/linux/dell433mc.html

This is designed to help other Dell 433mc owners get linux running with a graphical ( Xfree86) interface.

There is a small amount of information on how we configured the Desktop for use by people with learning difficulties.
This should be of interest to all those interested in making interfaces accessible to this client group.

I would be grateful for any comments.
