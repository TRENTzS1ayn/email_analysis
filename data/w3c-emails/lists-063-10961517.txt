In response to a question about how to view css files


If you are looking at a page that has a linked stylesheet, you can look at 
the source to get the address of the stylesheet (remembering of course that 
the address is relative to the directory containing the page).

There are then a number of options

One of the best ways is to use the W3C CSS validator, the option that takes 
a uri:
http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator-uri.html

once you run it thorugh the validator, there's a link to see the stylesheet 
itself.  Plus, it got validated.

Other ways to do it...

If you type the stylesheet into the AOLpress browser/editor, you see the 
stylesheet directly

If you type it into MSIE, front page pops up with the stylesheet

If you type it into Opera, it will ask what application you want to use to 
view files of this type.  Tell it your favorite source browser (I use vim 
myself).

If you have lynx on your commpand line type

       lynx -source  type_the_css-URL_here

and it will dump the stylesheet to the standard output.

If you simply open it with lynx, it will give you a chance to download it.

Enjoy your stylesheets!
