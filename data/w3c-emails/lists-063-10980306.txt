I like the advanced options and the ability to filter information.

1. I forgot to enter a URI to check, and it still gave me a report! Pretty 
sparse but "http://" passed.

2.  I've been checking and unchecking the browser and HTML options and it 
doesn't seem to change my result any.  It seems to only give feedback for 
HTML 4.0, even if HTML 4.0 is not checked.  I tried this with both 
www.w3.org and www.cnn.com

3. I would still like to see an interactive checklist as a second step of 
the process where the user is asked questions and must check something off 
before seeing their results.  Their results would then include what they 
have checked off or not.

It's looking good!
