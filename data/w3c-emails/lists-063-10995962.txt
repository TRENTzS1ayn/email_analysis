Wendy,

Thanks for pointing out the bugs.  The interactive function is in our plans for version 4.  Part of it is the need to save state to avoid asking again if a page is re-analyzed unless the item has changed.

Thanks for your feedback.

I like the advanced options and the ability to filter information.

1. I forgot to enter a URI to check, and it still gave me a report! Pretty sparse but "http://" passed.

2.  I've been checking and unchecking the browser and HTML options and it doesn't seem to change my result any.  It seems to only give feedback for HTML 4.0, even if HTML 4.0 is not checked.  I tried this with both www.w3.org and www.cnn.com

3. I would still like to see an interactive checklist as a second step of the process where the user is asked questions and must check something off before seeing their results.  Their results would then include what they have checked off or not.

It's looking good!
