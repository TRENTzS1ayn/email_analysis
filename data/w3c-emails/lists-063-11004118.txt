Hello,

I vaguely remember that we resolved to replace the "Suggested message" 
section in each Technique with a link to an example - either a link to a 
tool that provides such a message or a section within ATAG 
Techniques.  Therefore, may I delete all of those sections and request that 
people start providing links to examples?
