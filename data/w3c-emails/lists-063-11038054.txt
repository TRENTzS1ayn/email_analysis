Amaya lets you open any stylesheet attached to a document, for those who use
it.

  In response to a question about how to view css files
  
  
  If you are looking at a page that has a linked stylesheet, you can look at 
  the source to get the address of the stylesheet (remembering of course that 
  the address is relative to the directory containing the page).
  
  There are then a number of options
  
  One of the best ways is to use the W3C CSS validator, the option that takes 
  a uri:
  http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator-uri.html
  
  once you run it thorugh the validator, there's a link to see the stylesheet 
  itself.  Plus, it got validated.
  
  Other ways to do it...
  
  If you type the stylesheet into the AOLpress browser/editor, you see the 
  stylesheet directly
  
  If you type it into MSIE, front page pops up with the stylesheet
  
  If you type it into Opera, it will ask what application you want to use to 
  view files of this type.  Tell it your favorite source browser (I use vim 
  myself).
  
  If you have lynx on your commpand line type
  
         lynx -source  type_the_css-URL_here
  
  and it will dump the stylesheet to the standard output.
  
  If you simply open it with lynx, it will give you a chance to download it.
  
  Enjoy your stylesheets!
