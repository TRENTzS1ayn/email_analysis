Hello,

The ER group is working on Techniques for Accessibility Evaluation and 
Repair Tools (AERT) document. What do you think of the following 
suggestions for where to place labels in relationship to form controls to 
satisfy Checkpoint 10.2 (Until user agents support explicit associations 
between labels and form controls, for all form controls with implicitly 
associated labels, ensure that the label is properly positioned.)

1. Labels for radio buttons and checkboxes should appear after the radio 
button or checkbox. For example: [checkbox] oranges, [checkbox] apples.
2. Labels for text fields appear before the text field. For example: last 
name [text area].
3. Labels for groups of any form control should appear before the group. 
For example: choose a city [radio button] Boston [radio button] Madison.

If this is agreeable then I will add this to the section on Forms in the 
HTML Techniques for WCAG document.

Thanks
