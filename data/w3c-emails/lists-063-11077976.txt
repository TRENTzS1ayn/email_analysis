To: Kynn Bartlett<kynn@idyllmtn.com>,w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org

Hello,

I responded to part of this message on 23 May 2000 [1]. (how time flies....)

Kynn, thank you so much for the thorough comments!!

I had originally said that "author" and "developer" can often mean 
different things and I wasn't sure which to go with.  Kynn suggested 
"author."  I like "author" better than "user" and went with that.

Kynn had several comments on the "Suggested message" language.  Several of 
the "Suggested message" sections have been deleted as we move towards 
linking to examples rather than writing our own suggested language.

My responses (WC::)  are interspersed with Kynn's comments (KB::).

WC::
I added this as an open issue because I would like to see what others think 
about this.  The link may or may not contain the word "transcript". Are 
there other words that the link may contain?  In WCAG we do not recommend 
what the link should say.  Also, what about proximity to the link to the 
audio?  What if there are several audio and transcript links on a page?

It now reads:
<blockquote>
Requirement: Audio file must be described within the document or document 
must contain a link to a text equivalent file.  @@Search for link text 
containing the word "transcript?"

Agreed. It now reads:

This is pretty much taken from WCAG, but I tried to make it clearer by saying,
<blockquote>
If a FRAMESET has three or more frames and at least one of the frames does 
not have a "longdesc" attribute, ask the user to determine if the 
relationship between frames is obvious (from the titles of each frame) or 
if the relationship(s) need to be described.

Good point. I've edited it to read:
<blockquote>
Inline quotes (marked with Q) have at least one word in front of, or 
behind, the quote text.
The whole page or large sections of a page are not marked with 
BLOCKQUOTE.   If this is the case, it is a possible indication that the 
author is using BLOCKQUOTE for formatting rather than to mark a quotation.

These definitions were reversed. I have left them in for now. Now reads:
<blockquote>
Potential acronym:A collection of 2 or more capitalized characters.
Potential abbreviation:
A collection of 2 or more characters where the first one is capitalized, 
the rest are lower case, and the last character is a period.

WC::
correct. I edited this to read, "Ask the author if the acronym or 
abbreviation was defined elsewhere on the page and if so do nothing, 
otherwise ask the author to enter a definition for the abbreviation of 
acronym and attach it to the first instance."

I've added the requirement, "Do no worry about words followed by a

KB::

WC:: I thought this fit better with 5.3.1 than 5.4.1.  Thus I added the 
following to 5.3.1, "Allow the author to reposition cells or reorder the 
table."

KB::

WC:: I think you are suggesting that this is the text of the technique.  In 
fact, this is a manual evaluation strategy.  I did change the name of the 
technique to be HTML/XHTML specific.  It now reads:
<blockquote>
Technique 6.1.1 [priority 1] Verify that an HTML/XHTML document is readable 
when style sheets are not applied.
Evaluation
Elements:
LINK  rel="stylesheet"
STYLE
At least one "style" attribute used on any element.

Requirements: The author must verify if an HTML/XHTML page is readable 
without style sheets.  Generate and/or display a version of the page 
without styles to help the author decide.

Repair
Display an author notification if any use of style sheets is detected.

WC:: This is the best suggestion so far.  If you look at how windows and 
several windows programs handle file extensions they look for these.  We 
may get some false positives with this we may also miss some, but it is a 
decent general rule of thumb.

WC:: Good suggestion. I have expanded the 2nd bullet to read:
<blockquote>
The contents of the NOFRAMES element must provide the necessary links to 
navigate the site.  One way to check is to compare the number of links and 
their destinations in the NOFRAMES with the number of links and their 
destinations in all of the FRAMES combined.

Good suggestion. I've added a bullet that says, "Suggest that the author 
use HTTP headers -- via web server configuration and/or server-side scripting."

only some of them?  How does the author decide which ones?</Q>

KB::

WC::
I added the following bullet to the evaluation:
<q>If accesskeys have been used, has the author identified which keys are 
defined and how to use them?</q>

And this to the repair:
<q>If accesskeys are used, encourage the author to provide a description 
that identifies which keys are defined and how to use them.</q>

WC:: Yes, because the LABEL "for" attribute may not be supported.  LABEL 
may not even be interpreted by some user agents/assistive technologies, but 
it won't break anything marking it up as a label and will help those UAs 
that do support it.

WC:: It's in the HTML 4.01 spec: 
http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#adef-value-INPUT
<blockquote>
value = cdata [CA]
This attribute specifies the initial value of the control. It is optional 
except when the type attribute has the value "radio" or "checkbox".
</blockquote>

KB::

least one  that is "checked".</q>

WC::
Philsophically this is the direction we need to head.  IMG is currently the 
way to go, but OBJECT is cleaner in many ways.  I agree that with today's 
browser we don't want to suggest OBJECT instead of IMG. Thus, I have edited 
this section to read:
<blockquote>
Allow the author to replace FONT with CSS.
Allow the author to embed IMG and APPLET within OBJECT or to replace them 
with an OBJECT element.
Note. Before making these changes, the author should be made aware of the 
current situation of browser support of CSS and the OBJECT element.

WC::
Six techniques for this checkpoint have been added since you wrote.  The 
last one looks at the amount of text (triggered if >1000 characters) and 
suggests headers be used to break it up.  Not sure how 1000 was reached...

WC:: to be safe I reworded this:
<q>Allow the author to set a unique "id" attribute for each INPUT element 
in the document then set the "for" attribute of each LABEL element so it 
matches an INPUT element.</q>
Also, I link to the HTML spec where it says that id must be unique.

KB::

Because oftentimes these are the only words in a link and appear several 
times on the page but link to different items.

WC:: True, but more than likely it is something that ought to be shortened. 
Suspicious does not mean it is not allowed, just that it has

that's their choice.
