Yes, that would be the best approach.

Also, I stand corrected.  Each of these appendicies is linked to at least 
once.  Appendix A is actually linked to 3 times.  Therefore, I think we 
ought to keep Appendix A, the Appendix on identifying bullets and the 
Appendix on identifying horizontal rules, but incorporate the rest back in 
with the techniques that refer to them.    And, i think we should do that 
by pointing to examples as Chris suggested.
