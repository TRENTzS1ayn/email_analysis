HB: Sorry I'm so tardy. I do appreciate Kynn's feedback and Wendy's comments.
I have a few additions.

HB: Need to mention the character entity for non-breaking space -- &nbsp; --
and rules for when to ignore them. At the start or end of a line? I
consider their injection to be an unpleasant hack injected when converting
a text file to HTML using some software to import text and then save HTML.

HB: I do not believe all abbreviations end with periods.

"or", not "of"

During document editing that adds an abbreviation/acronym before the prior
first use, is it important to move that definition back to
the new first occurring? The above check could be automated in an authoring
tool, showing the author what if any definition has been given for any
identified acronym/abbreviation.

HB: But those are exactly the conventional clues that an acronym/abbreviation
has been just defined. If the span of that textual definition is identified,
an id on it could serve as target for subsequent uses of that acronym or
abbreviation.

HB: That has many untoward implications:

     1. Cells need to fit into a table grid. Moving a cell outward of
        an edge column or row  of the whole table, or of THEAD, TBODY, or
        TFOOT augments the grid, leaving the other added cells
        without content.
     2. Cells with horizontal or vertical spanning may not be able to
        overlay existing cells with content that are not so spanned.
     3. Or do you mean: move the contents of a table cell?
     4. The writing direction of the table impacts the cells that such
        spanning affects.
     5. Former cell types TH or TD may be inappropriate when moved.
     6. ID attribute values must be unique, so it is inappropriate to
        copy them.
     7. Table reordering is confounded by spanning cells. Arbitrary column
        reordering may require adjustment of TH that are spanning several
        columns.

HB: I thought the purpose of radio buttons was to select only one among, not
several.

HB: All IDs being unique within a document has implications for authoring
tools. ID uniqueness applies to most element types, not just IN:PUT and LABEL.
