Actually, as I understand the proposal, it's actually a proposal
to make CSS more accessible, not just CLASS itself.  Is that
correct?

Well, I like to think that it's class that's being made accessible and CSS 
is simply the means used to accomplish that..  Theoretically, class is 
independent of CSS... HTML 4.01 says that user agents can utilize class in 
other  ways (tho it doesn't specify them)  And other means could be used to 
make the class accessible, like the RDF I described (tho I favor using class).
