From, "what is Ocularis"

<blockquote>
Ocularis is a distribution of the Linux (a trademark of Linus Torvalds) 
Operating System (definition) that aims to allow the visually impaired to 
communicate, work, and express themselves through computers as well as to 
install and customize their system, independent of sighted assistance. The 
distribution itself consists of free software from other projects that is 
woven together with new, original software to create a simple, 
straightforward, Audio User Interface (AUI).
