It's at cut&paste distance, it can't be that hard.

I've been thinking about using a cookie on the form to save the
reporter the retype of name/email.

You mean, like adding a bobby check no matter what.
I think that's what Harvey what referring too as well.
Fine with me.

You mean have Lynx add a "write a comment to the author using the WAI
form" ? Why not.

They might have some good heuristics to find the author too.

Sure, that's another way to distributing the form. I'm all for it.

Worthwhile, but I keep wondering what will happen if we get thousands
of report hit...

I like that wording.

You know, I often look at WAI as a trial of what W3C might want to do
later on a larger scale (education, best practices, external funding
programs, tools, etc) :-)

I'm leaning toward the no-checking outgoing-message scenario.

The From header will come from @w3.org, so I don't see any reason for
hidding us in the letter.

You mean reporter testers.

As I mentioned in my previous message, I would prefer to have a solid
explanation/help document for reporter to use, even saying "you need
to read that before using this form" in licencese language ("I Accept" 
etc).

I mostly want to deliver a tool (this report) that roll on its own
without much resource thereafter.

Yes, and I agree with defining fix anchors in GL.

I need to think more about Bobby integration.

OK for changing the default.

What is Thomas's Register ?

William mentioned that we could also add pointer to ADA and other
regulation when sending email about .gov and .edu sites.
