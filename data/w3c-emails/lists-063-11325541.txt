Except that:

1. ER can't change WCAG priorities
2. Summary is often not rendered, and in many older browsers not even
available
3. Captions for Layout tables are like using other data structures for them -
not relevant since it is not the point of the design.

Better to check for whether a table is used for layout or data first, and
then base the checking on that. (For example if it is a layout table it
should NOT have TH elements, whereas if it is a data table it should.

  I think we should remove this technique because we already have a
  requirement (technique 5.5.1) that the user enter a table summary. This

  Table captions are rendered by the current Netscape and IE5 above the table
  and this can be distracting, especially for layout tables. The table summary
  is not rendered by these browsers.
  
  If we do leave this technique in then it should be moved down to priority 3
  from priority 2.
