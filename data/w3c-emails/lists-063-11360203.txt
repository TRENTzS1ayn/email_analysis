Charles's idea of a structured method sounds good.

The SUMMARY can't be evaluated in the absense of the CAPTION, and the page
designer's decisions about CAPTION and SUMMARY are related.  They have to
work together.  You can't address them correctly with evaluation and repair
methods that are entirely separate.

In other words, if a TABLE has neither CAPTION nor SUMMARY, the author
should first be asked to come up with a verbal description, and then they
should decide how much of this, on second thought, they want to show
everyone as a CAPTION and how much of it will be relegated to the
accompanying SUMMARY.
