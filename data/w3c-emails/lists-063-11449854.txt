The topic of the day will be the Accessibility Description Language 
(ADL).  See reading list below.

Agenda:

1. Introductions.  People will take up to 2 minutes to say
     who they are
     where they're from
     what they are looking to get out of this meeting

2. Requirements for ADL
     What do we want it do do?
     What are some concrete use cases?

3. How to implement ADL.  The main contenders are

     - an XML application with associated schema
     - RDF

We'll split into two or more groups, each of which can try out a different 
approach.

4. Groups report back.

5. Discussion of next steps.
