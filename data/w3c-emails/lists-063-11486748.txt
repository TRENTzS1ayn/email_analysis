I would be glad to join the gang and share my limited knowledge of
eateries.  I
can Metro it or can provide a car with seats for three others.  If they're not
all Charles's size.

Further I will try to keep the list, as we need to run this through PF as
well.  I will do that  but separately.

I know where Len is staying.  Charles, can you give me an idea of roughly
where
you will be?  Will you have a car?  Will you be convenient to the Metro?  

Anyone else interested in joining a dinner gang for Sunday night, as Len said,
please answer this thread.

Daniel is a likely 'regrets.'  He gets in rather late Sunday night from
Montreal.
