We will be using IRC during the ER/PF WG f2f meetings next week to 
communicate with those who can not attend physically (William and Sean) as 
well as to take minutes.

Here is what you  need to know:

1. install an IRC client.  For windows I use mirc (http://www.mirc.com) on 
linux I use the default IRC client that ships with RedHat.

2. set up an IRC server in your IRC client.
the W3C public server is irc.w3.org port 6665

3. connect to the server.

4. Join the #erpf-f2f channel.  We will take minutes on this channel. If 
you have a question during the meeting you can "raise your hand" here and 
someone watching the channel will make sure the chair recognizes you.

Let me know if you have any questions,
