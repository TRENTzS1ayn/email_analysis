O.K., I followed the steps, and it was very easy. My only question now is,
"what times will the channel be open, and for what conferences (exact
times)". All I get from http://www.w3.org/2000/10/erpf-f2f-agenda.html is
that the F2F is from 8:30 'till 17:00 (that's from 13:30 until 22:00 my
time). The phone lines are completely free after about 20:00 GMT, so I will
be able to IRC for as long as you need me after that!
Is Mr. Loughborough O.K. with IRC?

Many thanks,
Kindest Regards,
Sean B. Palmer
