Great to meet you all in person on Monday.  I was telling Al Gilman about some
work done on evaluation of voting technology by Roy Saltman (from NIST, then the
National Bureau of Standards) started in the 1970's.  His 1993 paper at
http://www.cpsr.org/conferences/cfp93/saltman.html
summarizes a lot of his findings and that fact that his (now deja vu)
recommendations were never followed.  Al thought you might find the
paper interesting, especially in light of the possibilities that the internet
can now provide.
