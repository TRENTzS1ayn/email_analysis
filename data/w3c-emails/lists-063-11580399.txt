I also happen to work for this company, as if that were not justification
enough in and of itself ;-)

Hello,

I was just at your page, http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/existingtools.html, and
wanted to suggest that you add a link to SSB Technologies under the section
of evaluation and repair tools.  We are a company founded by technologists
with disabilities and have developed two automated software tools for web
site accessibility.  The first, InSight, checks a web page for accessibility
violations (according to the WCAG) and produces reports.  The second,
InFocus, offers developers guided fixes for accessibility violations.  A
number of members of our company have been active in the WAI, including
recent attendance at the meeting earlier this week in DC focused on the
documents.  If a link could be added to www.ssbtechnologies.com, that would
be great.  If anyone has any questions, please feel free to contact me (my
information is below).  Thank you very much,

Chris
