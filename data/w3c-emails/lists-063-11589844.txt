CMN This seems really nice to me....

SBP  Now, try going to SiRPAC [1] and pasting that little bit of code in, and
it
  gives you a nice response with RDF graphs and so on. [I'd like to have
  attached the image to this email, but I'm not sure what the status on
  attachments is]. I have to admit that this is a pretty neat use of RDF.

  [[[
  However, from a practical point of view, it's simpler to say
      .p1 {title: "priority 1 checkpoint" }
  ]]] - ibid.

CMN I figure that the value in this would be in building a different syntax
that read CSS-style syntax - i.e. use a CSS parser as the basis for selecting
the subject, and then the predicate/object become propety and value
respectively.

Personally I hate writing any syntax. But I guess this would be a neat tool
for doing stuff locally if you had a quick generator that translated it to
RDF syntax as per the recommendation (which, after all, is what should be ued
as a transport syntax and understood somehow so that we keep
interroperability)

  I agree that until the use of RDF becomes more widespread (and valid in
  XHTML!) we need an alternative. Looking at this makes me wonder why you
  don't use HTML titles, or at least:-

  .p1:before { content: "<span title=\"Priority 1 Checkpoint\">"; }
  .p1:after { content: "</span>"; }

  But it would be nice to have some kind of description and comments mechanism
  in CSS. Another good thing to have would be an 'alt' property (I think the
  CSS & FP WG are considering that one). Lastly, it says in the document
  "Users shall be able to choose any class and then step through all elements
  of a particular title..."; could someone explain that for me (preferably
  with examples)?

  P.S. Here are the triples from my RDF example:-
  triple('http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label',
         '[@class='p1']',
         'Priority 1 Checkpoint').
  triple('http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#isDefinedBy',
         '[@class='p1']',
         'http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/#priorities').
