Thanks. I was quite pleased with the result myself. Very neat.

So, in other words: CSS => RDF.
.'. If you had

.p1 { title: "priority 1 checkpoint"; }
You could have the ".p1" as the subject (rdf:about="[@class='p1']"), "title"
as the predicate (@rdf:value, @rdf:predicate, or @dc:title. Maybe as it is
specific to being a CSS property, we would need to assign it a new value in
an RDF Schema/namespace), and "priority 1 checkpoint" as the object
(hmmmm.....I used rdfs:label; a good choice in this case, I believe). You
could quite easily generate something like the following:-

  <rdf:RDF
     xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
     xmlns:css="http://www.w3.org/2000/12/RDF-cssproperty#"
     xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#" >
    <rdf:Description rdf:about="[@class='p1']"
        css:property="title">
      <rdfs:label rdf:ID="p1c">Priority 1 Checkpoint</rdfs:label>
    </rdf:Description>
    <rdf:Description rdf:about="#p1c">
      <rdfs:isDefinedBy
         rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/#priorities"/>
    </rdf:Description>
  </rdf:RDF>

Notice that I have used my own peculiar style of "quadding" here: I like
using rdf:ID's and then refering to them elsewhere because it can be parsed
very easily. Note that once again it parses neatly in SiRPAC.

As long as a syntax is kept as neat as it possibly can be, then it will work
(word of caution: apply that principle to EDL!). It would be a very neat
output going from CSS => RDF, as I have demonstrated, and it probably
wouldn't be too difficult to integrate it with ADL [sic].

[1] Here is the original bit of RDF:-
>   <rdf:RDF

>      xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#">
>     <rdf:Description rdf:about="[@class='p1']">
>       <rdfs:label>Priority 1 Checkpoint</rdfs:label>
>       <rdfs:isDefinedBy
>          rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/#priorities" />
>     </rdf:Description>
>   </rdf:RDF>
