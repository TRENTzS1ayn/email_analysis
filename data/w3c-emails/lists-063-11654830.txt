That's a very good idea. I always thought we needed more forms and
definitions of "class". We can use it for style, transformations, and
sectioning, and that's a lot for one attribute to handle. It's potentially
the most semantic attribute in XHTML, and yet it can also be used to infer
presentation...highly irregular!
I like the idea of binding classes to ID's, as per Dan Connolly's HyperRDF:
http://www.w3.org/2000/07/hs78 which extends the class mechanism, but a lot
of browsers don't allow for escaped characters in CSS:-

     .rel\:class { color: #000000; }

Which is very frustrating.

True content would be RDF/XML. I created an example for a fake meeting where
all of the meeting details are stored in RDF [1] and transformed [2] on the
fly to produce an XHTML [3] output. The short decription is at
http://infomesh.net/swdemo/#demo I urge you to take a look!
     [1] http://infomesh.net/swdemo/demo/rdfmeeting.xml
     [2] http://infomesh.net/swdemo/demo/meetingtoxhtml.xsl
     [3] http://infomesh.net/swdemo/demo/meeting.asp
The XSLT files are a bit scrappy for now, but they work!

Any form of semantic equals a benefit to disabled users, because they don't
miss out on anything :-) That's the whole point of Semantics, everything is
raw information, and then from that you can convert it into the medium of
your preference. I could write a stylesheet to transform that meeting
example of mine into content for Aural Browsers, flashy IE5 types, WAP, or
whatever!

Why would we be writing an XML Schema? Unless you mean we could write an XML
Schema for XHTML ("don't even go there!"), Schemas are the third layer: 1)
Data, 2) Metadata, 3) Schemes for metadata (i.e. metadata about metadata).
Like A.S. says, we are struggling with how best to attack data, and only a
handful are working on metadata. Schemas are way ahead of us! I challenge
you to find some RDF that has a non 1 dimensional structure as dictated by a
Schema. It isn't even possible yet...
Schemas are great, but only in the right places!

Your choice. As the original document was an ERT production, I thought it
best to direct my comments here. It might move to PF...
