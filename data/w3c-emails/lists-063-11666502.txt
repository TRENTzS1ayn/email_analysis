AG::

Somehow we need to a) address the general W3C language architecture through PF
while still b) working the specfic case of capturing evaluations in ER.

Note: There are some architectural ideas expressed above, such as the idea
that
semantics does not include presentation, that metadata can be semantically
distinguished from data in the absense of a schema, etc. that bear further
investigation.  Ideally the way to conduct such examination is in the light of
more concrete access-related scenarios (situations and the functions you need
in those situation).

Related point:

With regard to a metadata module, Sean, have you reviewed the SMIL 2 metadata
module?  Is that module something we could use in EDL?  It would seem to be
the
"RDF in XHTML modularization" precedent that is furthest down the
Recommendation track.
