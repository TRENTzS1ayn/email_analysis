In accordance with the action item I took on from the f2f, I have
published an overview/summary of EDL:-

     EDL - Evaluation Description Language
     http://infomesh.net/edl/

The best part of the document is the formal description of EDL: "Evaluation
Description Language is an RDF based framework for recording, (and possibly
transferring and processing) data about automatic and manual evaluations of
resources. The purpose is to provide a framework for generic evaluation
description formats that can we used by "wizards/tools/humans"."

The most useful point that is raises is the process aim. While I don't want
to rush anyone on that, it is something that really does need deciding.
Another good part of the document is the architecture overview (with
diagram!). Section 5.2 I think.

The document is obviously not finished yet (!), and comments etc. are highly
welcome.

Kindest Regards,
