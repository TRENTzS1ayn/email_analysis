In preparation for my next email (about finding out who'd be an interested 
customer for EARL) I've started a list of user scenarios at 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/earl.html  .  I like to work backwards from 
what the user winds up doing.

It includes Evaluation and Repair Reports,  Web Page and Site Repair, Third 
Party Accessibility Services .  Please post any further fleshing out of 
these cases.

In my next email I"m going to ask people on the list the extent of their 
interest or their organization or company's interest in implementing EARL...
