Chairman Kasday, Mr. Dardailler, and distinguished members of WAI Evaluation
and Repair Interest Group list:

Allow me to introduce my self, Phill Jenkins, IBM Special Needs Systems,
Austin, TX

I'm currently working on accessibility in general for IBM, including hardware,
software, and especially Web and Java.  I've been accused of and called things,
including::
2.Web site content owner - www.ibm.com/sns
3.Web site author, administrator, [and Web slave] - www.ibm.com/sns and other
IBM sites
4.Tool vendors - IBM has many tools and applications including Screen Reader,
Home Page Reader, I-checker, VisualAge, Fusion, Notes, Domino, etc.
5.trying to become an Expert on disabilities
6.was once  an Expert on usability - I actually did some original usability
test for the PC back in the early 80's.  I witnessed test subjects removing
[tearing off] the "protective cover" off the 5.25 inch floppy disks because of
poor documentation and directions.
7.and I can reach out to obtain input from novice users, non-technical web site
content owners, and any other people who might not normally participate
directly.

Besides committing to a "minimum 3 hours per week", remaining "current on
w3c-wai-er-ig list and respond[ing] in timely manner to postings" and
"participat[ing] in bi-weekly to monthly phone meetings or send[ing] regrets to
chair", I will continue to work on evaluating BOBBY, for both accessibility
with our Java Screen Reader technology and use in evaluating our own IBM web
sites.  I am also just now beginning to understand and learn Lotus Notes Domino
- the twistie concern - and how it might be used to repair and/or filter site
content to improve accessibility. Yes, I read the
charter...http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/

Phill Jenkins
