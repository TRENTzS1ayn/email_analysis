We're too much like the guys who set up the gimmicks that the magician uses 
to perform his act - wrong as an audience, insufficiently naive in the 
matter at hand to be "objective".

I'm not avoiding the survey because it's too much trouble but because I'm 
convinced that my replies would skew the conclusions to be drawn from any 
response.
