I decided that this was such a good idea that I made a working example :-)
     Here it is: http://infomesh.net/sbp/sbptest/
What it does is extract, by "transformation-on-the-fly", all of the class
titles from the database style XHTML/RDF document at
http://infomesh.net/sbp/sbptest/fredtest.html
It is highly re-usable, and offers many ways of presenting a single source
of information. Not only that, but it does exactly what Len asked for,
allowing people to extract any information of a certain class. I hope you
like it...BTW, I called it FRED: Formatted RDF Electronic Database, for the
purposes of whimsy.
