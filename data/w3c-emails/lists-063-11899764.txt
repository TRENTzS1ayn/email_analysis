For those of you without access:
We are not yet sure if everyone will have to sign a confidentiality 
agreement to participate in the meetings and then request member access to 
view the schedule.

Regardless, the significant bits for this group are:

Hotel Reservation Details
A block of rooms have been reserved at the Royal Sonesta Hotel at a 
discount rate of $130 (plus tax) per night, single/double occupancy. The 
discount rate will be offered from Sunday, 25 February through Thursday, 2 
March 2001. High speed Internet connections are available in guest rooms 
for a flat rate of $10.00 per night. (Laptop computers must be 10baseT 
equipped.).
The W3C will host a reception Wednesday evening, 28 February from 
18:00-20:00 at the hotel. Beverages and light hors d'ourvre' will be 
served. We encourage folks to take this opportunity to meet working group 
members from other W3C working groups.

Transportation Details
Logan International Airport is the closest international airport to the 
meeting site. The Royal Sonesta Hotel is located three miles from Logan. 
The travel time between the airport and the hotel (meeting site) will vary 
between 30 minutes to one hour depending on traffic conditions. Taxi fares 
will range between $18.00-$28.00.

Please Note: All events will take place at the hotel. There is a large 
shopping mall across the street so you will not need a car during the week. 
There is a major road construction project going on in Boston called the 
"Big Dig." For this reason, we recommend taking a taxi or public 
transportation rather than renting a car. If you prefer to rent a car, all 
major car rental companies have locations at Logan Airport (Avis, Budget, 
Hertz, etc.).
