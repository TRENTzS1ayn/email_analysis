My name Nir Dagan, and I am an economist 
working in Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona.

My interests in WAI is some kind of hobby/intelctual challenge.

Concerning the evaluation-repair activity, I will be 
representing the a small group of web authors (myself) 
in regard to what they think are good evaluation tools.

Due to the fact that I actually have to work to 
make a living, I couldn't commit to the 3 hour a 
week requirement of the charter. But I'll do my best 
to bother you with my opinions with the little time that 
I have.

Regards,

Nir Dagan                            
Assistant Professor of Economics      
Universitat Pompeu Fabra
Barcelona (Spain)
