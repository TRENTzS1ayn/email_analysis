It may have helped if my translation was actually meaningful, but on
parsing it thrugh SiRPAC didn't give great triples. Hence, I've replaced it
with a better version of RDF: much simpler and yet much more effective.
I've attached it the end of this note [1], and it's also at
http://infomesh.net/edl/#rdfmodel

Oops! Really the arrows just imply a general relationship: "EDL is an RDF
language that will use RDF Schemas (and XML Schemas) and that will give
rise to ADL and other subset langauges." I'll write up a full description
tonight and post it tomorrow!

Soem of your questions may have been due to my tacky RDF :-) I hope the
following is a bit clearer and simpler. Just because Al's OOP was pretty
long, it didn't mean that the RDF has to be: it has most of the
functionality that Al had to describe built in!
