1. CSS2 is expressed in EBNF: http://www.w3.org/TR/PR-CSS2/grammar.html

2. So is XML (thanks to Jelks):
http://cpcug.org/user/jelks/XML/xmlebnf.html

3. Lots of programming languages can be expressed in BNF:
http://cui.unige.ch/db-research/Enseignement/analyseinfo/BNFweb.html

4. Not sure about HTML: "EBNF is also used in many other standards, such as
definitions of protocol formats, data formats and markup languages such as
XML and SGML. (HTML is not defined with a grammar, instead it is defined
with an SGML DTD, which is sort of a higher-level grammar.)" -
http://www.stud.ifi.uio.no/~lmariusg/download/artikler/bnf.html#id3 But
HTML can be converted into XML (XHTML) anyway, so who cares?

5. I think EBNF/BNF describe the langauges themselves rather than outputs
of those langauges, but I could be wrong (I only ever looked at EBNF once
before.....).

6. I don't think this HTML parse tree is in (E)BNF, but it looks
interesting all the same:
http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F&sp=#parse

That's the lot. Hoping as ever that this is useful rather than
distractive...
