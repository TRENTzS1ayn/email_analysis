"Dealing with testing Web projects is a matter of balancing
information and emotion, technology and passion. If you want
to effectively manage your site's usability, and learn to
incorporate feedback in a constructive way, read what Kelley
Schmidt has to say."

I like your many good ideas on the process, though accessibility isn't
a particular focus. Some alt texts have "click here". Most are "".
I believe that the small extra effort to make a site accessible is
an important part of usability. It certainly increases the potential
audience.

Some of my concern may better and more generally be addressed by webreview.com.
