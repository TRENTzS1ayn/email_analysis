Our beloved "everyone, everything connected" implies making the Web 
accessible to *people* but in order to achieve this optimally we must also 
not forget that machines need to be connected as well - although 
essentially for people's benefit.

The main excuse for doing our RDF exercises is to enable access to Webstuff 
by machines and while "proselevel" is necessary for human readable stuff, 
we must always ensure that we are providing access for our 
robot/spider/searcher thingies. In a way the same considerations that WAI 
employs apply to machines which in fact have severe disabilities that must 
be considered when we write/structure/index our content, etc. - and 
particularly our EDL.
