heads up: our next joint meeting with AU will be Jan 9.  That means no 
meeting Jan 8

AU's turn for agenda.  Might want to consider EDL.

Also, lets not have a meeting Jan 1 since
1. We planned to cancel due to what we thought would be a meeting Jan 2 and
2. I'd expect a low turnout anyway new years day.
