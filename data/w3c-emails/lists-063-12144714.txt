Aaargh!!!

[ sorry ]

The ER mailing list seems to me a little obscure.  I found the address
at <URL:http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/WG/>, where the joining instructions
are to mail the chairman, and the list archives appear to be empty.
This did not appear particularly welcoming to me, as an outsider who
has been ignored in the past by W3C people.  I only found the one under
/ER/IR/ to be different just now after reading Kynn Bartlett's post.

Ah.  Yes, that appears to be a cousin to the project.  Thanks for the
pointer.

Yes, I've looked at some of them.  How would I go about getting my
tools listed there?

That's a long answer: I think I'll put mine on the Web and open it for 
discussion there, rather than post it in full.

Indeed.  But there are well-developed and well-known heuristic-based tools
such as Bobby and Tidy.  I'm not about to work on yet-another-one (unless
perhaps someone pays me to do so), as reinventing an old wheel holds
little interest to me.

Yes, I do envisage generating machine-readable output, though at what
level remains to be determined.  If I'm invited to join the ER group,
- and perhaps if you suggest a URL for reading - I'll take a proper
look at your project.
