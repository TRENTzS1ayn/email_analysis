Hello everyone,

My name is Kitch Barnicle and I work part time at the American Foundation
for the Blind in the technology access program. When I am not at AFB I live
the life of a graduate student. At the moment I am in the process of
collecting data for my doctoral dissertation, which is basically a
usability study of how users of speech interact with GUI elements. In
general, I am interested in adapting usability testing techniques so that
individuals with disabilities can be included in assessments of mainstream
technology, including the web. 

Prior to joining AFB in the fall of 1993, I was a manager of evaluations at
the federally funded rehabilitation engineering center on the evaluation of
assistive technology. Though our evaluations primarily focused on mobility
related devices such as wheelchairs, scooters and bathroom equipment, I
think the experience will prove useful to me in this endeavor. 

I'm looking forward to working with the group. 

Kitch
