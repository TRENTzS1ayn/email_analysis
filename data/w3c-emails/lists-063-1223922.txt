Thanks for the feedback received.

I have a new version at
  
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/report

It's still not operational, with no active CGI sending messages, but
I've made a series of improvement on the UI and also got clearer ideas
(summary attached) on the questions I'd asked.

We still need to debate on ER IG the issue of liability/publicness of
the reports (will post follow-up message on that topic)

- general idea of W3C/WAI providing such a report, good or bad,
  useful or useless ?

General feedback: useful.
Tight integration of report in Browser would be better (lynx,
visualbasic, cookie) - Keep for future improvement.

Link to bobby is now present, but would like a more concise Bobby
report, the current one is pretty long to attach via email.

 - what to do with the data: public or not, at what stage ? (current
   model suggest that the data is not public right away but can if
   nothing is done - with no definition of "nothing")

Still unclear what to do, strong suggestions on either side.  I will
raise that on a WAI Coordination Call soon but need more input in this
forum.

 - how to manage the liability risk for W3C (spammer, angry/insulting
   reporters, few mistakes, plain wrong report, etc) 

Related issue to the previous one. Controling the set of reporters was 
suggested, always give a chance for the assumed offender to support
his/her case seems like a good idea in any case.

 - how to subset the Page Author guidelines for reference from this form?

General trend is to always point at GL sections, but for that we need
to use either stable anchors or some cgi indirection. This sub-task is
shared with GL and will help hammer out the exact list of possible
offenses on the report form.
