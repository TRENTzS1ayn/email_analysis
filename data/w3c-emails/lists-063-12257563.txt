Nick and all...

Sorry, I sent this to the wrong list.  Please pursue on the guideline list, 
w3c-wai-gl@w3.org where I'm posting a (slightly edited) version...

I just want to make a brief reply to what Nick said though. I definitely do 
want to take consideration X seriously.  That's what I was trying to 
say.  The question has to do with the process we're following in the 
guideline group.  Some people have objected to accessibility guidelines 
because some authors will object some of the time. I'm trying to say that 
we don't throw out the guideline just because there are objections in some 
circumstances.  The question is what process we follow in the guidelines 
group to address considerations X.  Right now it's kind of ad hoc.  Anyway, 
I'm continuing this in the guidelines list.
