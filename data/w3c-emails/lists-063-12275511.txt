[general comment: the techniques in the document are a mix of automatic,
automated/interactive, and purely manual techniques.  Your comments sometimes
err by assuming that only fully automatic checks are under discussion.]


This is where the static text of the document doesn't always cope with the
dynamic status of the document.

[correct me if I'm wrong, Len]  The AERT has been "sold off" to the Authoring
Tools Working Group and they are merging the contents into their Techniques
document.  So currently it would appear that issues with the techniques
discussed in AERT should be raised in that group, because they are maintaining
the version that is currently open for edits.  The ER group is not making
further changes within the scope of what the AU group is working on.

AG:: Clarifying "where necessary" is a question for clarification of the WCAG
1.0 and should be directed to the Web Content Accessiblity Working Group
<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>.

AG::

Recommended next steps:

Conditions under which SYSTEM DTDs are fit to use should be considered for web
content techniques for WCAG 1.0.

Follow up to see how to reflect same reasoning in WCAG 2.0.

Corresponding mods to evaluation and repair methods inserted in authoring
techniques after consensus reached in content guidelines group.

[second pass]

This is a deeper issue than I thought.  The WCAG 1.0 simply assumed that the
DTDs in the W3C Recommendation were the way to go.  The idea of floating a WAI
DTD that is stricter than the W3C Recommendation is an interesting technique I
am not sure we understand the pros and cons of yet.  On first look, it sounds
like a GL issue (Web content guidelines, <http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/>). 
Although it may ricochet around a bit if it goes anywhere.

AG:: Have to read the language of the prior applicability clause more
strictly.  All this says is that if you are nesting blockquotes, that there
should be quotation marks in the text.

But the acceptability of nested blockquotes, and how they should be checked
for, is now a matter for GL:AU coordination and out of here.

SUMMARY expands on CAPTION or TITLE _as required_

AG:: earlier, I advocated dictionary matching as a technique to discover what
words needed pronunciation assistance.  The group did not include this.  This
is probably a slight misinterpretation of scope, colored by the fact that the
editor didn't want to have to promise a dictionary as part of an
implementation.

Scrubbing texts to be truly TTS-ready, and making sure that the SSML format
has
all the capabilities required to encode high grade TTS-ready texts, is an open
area [unfinished business IMHO] shared between ER and PF.

AG:: yes, actual source content, as stated in the language of the AERT
document.  Not the string value of the SRC attribute, the 'source' code i.e.
recovered contents of the referenced resource.

AG:: it would be good to expand on how the proxy is used and how it repairs
the
dynamic characteristics of the dialog.  The correct allocation of requirements
among author and user tools may not have been reached in WCAG 1.0 because it
came out first an had no peer guidelines to rely on.

The User Agent guidelines do address this; but this does not mean there is
nothing that the author should take responsibility for.

Answer: TBD; Process: dialog between content and user agent guidelines groups.

AG:: No.  The phototropic epileptic sensitivity of the user is not that device
specific.  And what the content is being checked for is that the dynamic
behavior of the content does not force flicker when used with a "perfectly
flicker-free" device.

AG:: This is more complicated than you think.  The user should be in control. 
If all user agents gave the user the level of control that the UAAG draft
calls
for, the author would not have to worry.  Until user agents provide this level
of control, it is a valid content issue.  For all time this is a content
issue,
not a "how to evaluate the content" issue.

AG:: To read clearly, hyphenate logical-event handlers.

These are handlers assigned to logical events.  Not logically constructed
handlers for events.

Talk to Charles for an orientation to device-independent events.  onMouseOver
and onMouseDown are device-specific, not device-independent events.

See DOM2 for a model of device-independent UI events.

AG:: Within document text does not suffice in speech environment.  See
discussion of warnings and configuration of control over window proliferation
in UA group.

"Is an existing frame" requires that the whole state trace graph of the
frameset be expanded at once for the purposes of checking.  That is to say,
the
frame may be created by another file into which the current file is inserted
within a frame.  Doing the whole thing is a more powerful check but you may
not
get the author tool vendors to agree to it.  Is an author tool issue, now.

AG:: same comment as above.  User Agent guideline is more effective than
content guideline on this point.  Good reason may still not be good enough,
keep user in control of the bottom line.  [see UAAG on this.]
