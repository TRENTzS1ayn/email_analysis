This is interesting.

When I introduced a (primitive) spellcheck option in the Site Valet,
it was suggested to me that I should allow users to link their document
to a dictionary, which would then be used in the spellcheck.  I have
hitherto rejected the suggestion, on the grounds that dictionaries are
rather big, and I don't like the bandwidth implications of fetching them.
One mechanism I might introduce is to allow users to add words to
(private per-user) extensions to a system dictionary.

Now, regarding your suggestion, I don't see how a standard dictionary
somewhere on the web is any better than a standard dictionary on my
server.  However, a more interesting idea is a Dictionary Protocol,
designed to allow dictionary servers to exchange information on-demand.
However, I suspect this isn't really the right forum to discuss a
dictionary protocol.

Now that you build into the protocol: it should include well-defined
meta-information that identifies a dictionary response as a definition,
an abbr-expansion, a translation, etc.  The request would also indicate
"I'm only interested in responses of class ????" (c.f. HTTP Accept).

E alcuni anni fa quando sono stato in Italia, ma credo che Lei e sbagliato!

Indeed, everyone could benefit from a dictionary protocol supported by
user agents, servers and authoring tools.

I procrastinate.  Efficient people never get around to it.
Therefore I am more efficient than an efficient person.
