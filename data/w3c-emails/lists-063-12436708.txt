I'm not yet facile enough with RDF to produce a valid example, I was just
tossing the thought out there. I was thinking along the lines of using RDF
to express Dublin Core (http://purl.org/DC/) metadata which has some minimal
collection defining elements and has been expressed in RDF a lot. It is also
used in the Open E-Book standard (http://www.openebook.org) but that seems
to use a custom XML DTD rather than RDF. In this specification, a list of
documents in a collection is provided along with their relationship to each
other. This idea should be transferrable to using RDF on web sites.

I could see us holding back on putting this in the ER document for a while
but I hope we keep it in mind as this may become an important navigation aid
in the future.
