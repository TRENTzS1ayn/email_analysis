ok. thanks Michael.
I have modified technique 1.2.1 as follows:
<blockquote>
Technique 1.2.1 [priority 1] Verify that a server-side image map has 
associated text links.
Discussion Status:
awaiting discussion
Evaluation:
If an IMG element has a valid "ismap" attribute and does not have a valid 
"usemap" attribute, prompt the user for associated text links.
Valid "ismap" attribute:
Must be a valid URL
Example Language:
Server-side image maps should have associated text links in the document.
Repair Technique:
Prompt the user for associated text links OR
help the user convert the server-side image map to a client-side image map 
and provide text-equivalents for each link in the client-side image 
map.  Refer to Check AREA for valid "alt." @@link.
If possible, check the text links against the links contained on the 
server-side image map. (@@how would someone do this?)
Test Files and Discussion Files:
Link to test files for this technique.
