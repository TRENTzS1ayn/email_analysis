13.1 is a priority 2, but the checkpoint to identify the language of a 
document (4.3) is a priority 3.  Identifying changes in language within 
text (4.1) is a Priority 1.

I think this is most like Checkpoint 4.3 but fits best as a technique under 
13.1 but with priority 3 rather than 2.

However, we have already agreed that the Technique priority is inherited 
from the checkpoint priority.  Perhaps we should revisit that 
resolution?  or is this actually a priority 2 Technique?

Plus, I think this is a user agent issue.

hmm, again I think this is a user agent issue.  The resource that is being 
retrieved should identify itself.  For example, today I can tell Netscape, 
MSIE, and Opera not to load Java or scripts.

Your example, where I don't load an image because it will put me in "dead 
space" is interesting to consider.  If I have said not to load images, but 
I follow a link that bring up an image, then what will the browser do?
I created a test file to find out:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/tests/image.html

I turned off images in both Opera 3.6 and MSIE 5.  When I followed the 
link, both browsers did the same thing - showed the image.  I guess what 
else can they do?  There is no alt-text associated with it...

In the user agent guidelines, this is a priority 3:
<blockquote>
8.4 Make available to the user information that will help the user decide 
whether to follow a link. [Priority 3]
Note. Useful information includes: whether the link designates an internal 
or external anchor, the type of the target resource, the length and size of 
an audio or video clip that will be started, and the expected natural 
language of target resource.
</blockquote>
http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-UAAG10-20000128/

This takes me back to the discussion above....

Looking at 13.1 in WCAG again, using "title" is suggested, kind of like a 
P3.  There actually seem to be 2 checkpoints here:
WCAG 13.1 - Clearly identify the target of each link [Priority 2]
WCAG 13.1a - Provide supplemental information to help users determine if 
they want to follow the link. [Priority 3]  This includes: language of the 
resource, type of resource, size of resource, etc.

Therefore, I propose that we take this issue to WCAG WG.
