based on the discussion, how about this:
<blockquote>
Technique 13.6.1 [Priority 3] Verify if links should be grouped.
Discussion Status:
awaiting discussion
Evaluation:
Check for lists of links: Several A elements separated only by spaces, 
bullets, or a few characters such as "] [" or " | ".
Check for groups of links: grouped with DIV, P, MAP.
Example Language:
none.
Repair Technique:
Ask the user if an identified list of links should be grouped.
If the user wants to group the links, use a MAP element (@@still 
outstanding issues in WCAG w/this technique?)
Suggest that the user provide a link to bypass the group or that they move 
the group to the bottom of the page or that they use a high "tabindex" 
attribute value.
