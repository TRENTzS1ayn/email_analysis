oops, Len is right. the text equivalent doesn't have to be in a separate 
file, it could be on the current page.  here's the fixed proposal:
<blockquote>
Technique 1.1.7 [priority 1] Verify that  text equivalents are provided for 
audio files where necessary
Discussion Status:
awaiting discussion
Evaluation:
If the "href" attribute of an A element is a sound file then ask the user 
if there is an existing text transcript file or if a text equivalent has 
been provided on the current page.
Check that OBJECT elements of type="<audio or video MIME types>" have an 
associated text equivalent either within their content or an internal or 
adjacent link.
Example of a message to be displayed:
Audio files require a text equivalent. Is there an associated text 
equivalent for this audio file: [audio file name]?
Repair Technique:
Prompt user for text transcript of audio file.
Test Files and Discussion Files:
Link to test files for this technique.
