WC:: we discussed this at the 31 january meeting. I propose rewording it as 
follows:
<blockquote>
Evaluation:FRAME elements should have a valid "longdesc" attribute if the 
value of the  FRAME "title" attribute does not completely describe the 
frame content.
Refer to techniques for checkpoint 12.1
If a FRAMESET has three or more frames and does not have a "longdesc" 
attribute, ask the user if the relationships between frames are not 
apparent in the titles for each frame.
Valid "longdesc" file name:
Must not be NULL
Must be a valid URI
Example of a message to be displayed:
Missing "longdesc": Missing 'long description' file for this frame.
Invalid "longdesc" file name: Invalid 'long description' file name for this 
frame: [current "longdesc" file name] - [can not be empty].
Repair Technique:
If the relationships betweeen frames are not obvious then ask that they 
provide a description of the relationships. Allow the user to create a 
"longdesc" file or associate an existing "longdesc" file. It is suggested 
that each FRAME in the FRAMESET reference the same "londesc" as the 
description of the relationships should be available from each FRAME.
</blockquote>

>|  Checkpoint 10.2 - Until user agents support explicit associations between
>|  labels and form controls, for all form controls with implicitly associated
>|  labels, ensure that the label is properly positioned
>
>LRK:: what are positions?
>Suggestion:  labels for radio buttons and checkboxes appear after
>              labels for text fields appear in front.

>    Putting labels for radio buttons and checkboxes first may seem

>=====================
>|  Checkpoint 11.1 - Use W3C technologies when they are available and
>|  appropriate for a task and use the latest versions when supported
>
>LRK:: This is a wcag issue.  Must we insist on W3C technologies if there 
>are other standards with good accessibility?
>AFter all in the authoring guidelines we ask for accessibility in the 
>non-w3c technologies implementing the editor.

>
>======================
>|  Checkpoint 11.4 - If, after best efforts, you cannot create an accessible
>|  page, provide a link to an alternative page that uses W3C technologies, is
>|  accessible, has equivalent information (or functionality), and is updated
>|  as often as the inaccessible (original) page
>|
>|  (Should we notify user of this? For every page?)
>
>LRK:: again, why insist on W3C?
>
>====================
>|
>|  Checkpoint 13.1 - Clearly identify the target of each link
>|
>|  (Search for text string 'click here'? Perhaps display all the anchor text
>|  and ask user if they are all clear?)
>
>LRK:: I like that
>
>=======================
>|
>|  Checkpoint 14.3 - Create a style of presentation that is consistent across
>|  pages

>|  Document Rating
>|
>|  After evaluating a document, an evaluation and/or repair tool should
>|  provide the user with a document rating. The rating is based on conformance
>|  to the WAI Page Authoring Guidelines and will be:
>|
>|     * Level "A": all Priority 1 checkpoints are satisfied;
>|     * Level "Double-A": all Priority 1 and 2 checkpoints are satisfied;
>|     * Level "Triple-A": all Priority 1, 2, and 3 checkpoints are satisfied;
>|
>|  Some checkpoints can not be checked by a software program and will require
>|  user evaluation. The user must be informed of the items that they must
>|  check.
