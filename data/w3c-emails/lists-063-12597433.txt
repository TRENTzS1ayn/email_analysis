Hi all,

There is a new working draft of the ERT available:
the latest is always available at http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/

I've been using the list to keep track of the changes to the 
document.  Thus, for each change I send an e-mail to the list.  Note that I 
have not incorporated all of the responses to my proposals.  I have some 
catching up to do!

Also note that this has not been spell-checked yet.  I valiantly tried, but 
gave  up because of the tool I was using. I'll be converting the document 
to scripts next week and the spell checker that the scripts uses is much 
better.
