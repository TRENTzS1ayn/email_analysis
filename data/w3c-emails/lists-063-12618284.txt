Subject: please put a precis in the header and/or at the top of the email

I do like the way this discussion is going.
However I still complain about excessive use of "1.13" etc in my email/on
the wai site. I simply am not aware of what you speak.

Could we all please put a precis in the header and/or at the top of the
email
eg:

Re: "cry wolf".
We hope that the techniques in this document, implemented in software
programs, will gently guide authors (of all abilities) along the path to
more accessible documents.

I realise this may not be quite all wendy had to say, but it really is good
practice for us all. You  will see I have had a go.
