That catalog needs updating: nothing on XHTML yet.

There are other valid sources for registering XML applications. Both BizTalk
and OASIS are developing such catalogs for valid applications (of HTML,
XML, and possibly SGML). Should we have a reference to those sources as well?

That is a presumption, the <html>...</html> wrapper could be placed around
most anything. The current browsers attempt to make sense of anything.
What is inside needs to be validated to the purported html
version. This checkpoint addresses the presence of a public text
identifier that is valid. It is stronger than that sentence suggests.
