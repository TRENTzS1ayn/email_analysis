   hi all,

I spent most of the week working on the new WCAG techniques document
[1], thus I have not worked on the latest ERT draft.  I expect to have
this out tomorrow or Monday - more likely on Monday.  I still need to
finish going through the responses to the proposals that I have sent the
last 2 weeks.

Let's continue to discuss open issues [2] during the call on Monday.
(Reminder: 10:00-11:30 Eastern Time
14 February +1-617-258-7910 - MIT bridge)

Agenda:

Audio equivalents

      Text equivalents for audio files do not have to be a text
transcript file. The text can be on the page in
      which the A element resides.
      From: Leonard R. Kasday (kasday@acm.org) Date: Sun, Jan 23 2000
      Scope: Technique 1.1.G - 21 December release

Elements that might have audio

      We should also check EMBED and OBJECT for audio types (from sound
extension as source or a
      TYPE attribute); should also ask about APPLET, EMBED, OBJECT,
SCRIPT which may contain sounds
      we don't know about. Michael Cooper - Mon, Jan 24 2000
      Scope: Technique 1.1.I - 21 December release

Checks for NOSCRIPT

      Don't limit to text description. Prompt for HTML that
isfunctionally equivalent. This may be, for example, a
      list of links, form input to CGI, etc. From: Leonard R. Kasday
(kasday@acm.org) Date: Sun, Jan 23 2000
      Check for just one. Placement on page may be arbitrary. Michael
Cooper - Mon, Jan 24 2000
      Scope: Technique 1.1.J - 21 December release

Checks for ISMAP

     Prompt for text links if ISMAP used only if USEMAP (with valid,
e.g., found,
      MAP element as target) also not found.
