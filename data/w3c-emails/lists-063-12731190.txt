The page

http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/existingtools.html

now has the title

"Existing Evaluation and Repair Tools"

Here's comments from EO on that title, as recorded in Gregory's summary
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-eo/2000JanMar/0053.html

quote:

>JB: another problem is the name of the document -- why
>"Existing"; what would be a better title to make someone
>realize what the resource is -- that it is a list of "Tools
>for Evaluation and Repair of Web Pages"?
>
>SS: I also have a naming issue -- what a lot of these tools
>do is simply testing for accessibility -- a much more simple
>process than evaluation and repair!
>
>JB: could it be confused with usability testing? validation
>would be more specific
>
>SS: then perhaps a definition is needed
>
>HB: current title is not only misleading, it is vague --
>Existing Evaluation and Repair Tools -- tools for what?

end of quote
Do folks have a suggestion for a new name?  Judy's suggestion was

"Tools for Evaluation and Repair of Web Pages"?

Here's another suggestion

"Tools for testing and improving the accessibility of web pages"
