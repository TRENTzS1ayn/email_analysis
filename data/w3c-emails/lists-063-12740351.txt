Our present title for the ERT document is

Techniques For Evaluation And Implementation Of Web Content Accessibility 
Guidelines

This note is to start a thread on possibly revising the title.

Some thoughts-
Current title seems to say we're evaluating the guidelines.
Also, I don't see that we're "implementing" the guidelines.  The authors 
are following the guidelines.


Here's a suggestion to get started:

"Techniques for evaluating and improving accessibility of web pages"
