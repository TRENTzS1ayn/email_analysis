Hello

   if anybody cares or wants to link: I just wanted to let you my first
project, the text-equiv thing that I used to call TextOnly has it's own web
page at http://www.vorburger.ch/projects/textonly -- There is not more
information then the sample and paper I sent to the list earlier, though.

    Note that is basically unrelated to the current project, ALTifier at
http://www.vorburger.ch/projects/alt, that my previous mail explained.

Regards,
Michael
