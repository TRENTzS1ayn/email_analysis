this was a thread a couple weeks ago.  I kept track of the suggested titles 
in the open issues list [available at 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/ert-open-issues.html].  Here are the 
suggestions:

1. Techniques for evaluation and repair of Web content
2. Evaluation and Repair tool accessibility guidelines
3. Techniques for automatic implementation of the Web Content Accessibility 
Guidelines
4. Techniques for evaluation and repair of *accessible* web content
5. Techniques for Accessibility Evaluation and Repair Tools

we can add to that Phil's suggestion:
6. Accessibility Evaluation, Repair, and Transformation of Web Content"
[AERT])

Therefore, I don't think we're lacking suggestions, but rather consensus on 
one of the suggestions, unless someone else wants to add something to the mix.
