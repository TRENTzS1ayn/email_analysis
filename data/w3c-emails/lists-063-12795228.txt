Dear list members,

An important goal of Guidelines is, that these guidelines are used by web
designers and the industry. 
I spoke with a lot of webmasters and web designers here in the Netherlands
who find it difficult "where to start" and asked me if there was not any
translation of these guidelines. 
Are there any plans for translations?
