LRK:: since this checkpoint only refers to images, why notify for all BODY 
Elements? Why not just Images?
Also, I don't understand what "All body elements" mean. There is just one 
"Body Element" since that term means the start tag, end tag, and everything 
in between. Do you mean all elements that are part of the Body Element's 
content?

This is an interesting question.  Yes, primarily when IMG elements or 
OBJECT used to embed images are identified, the author ought to be asked if 
the image could be converted to an appropriate markup language (MathML, 
HTML with style sheets, etc.).  However, are there cases where another 
element within the body of the document could be converted to a markup 
language?  For example, PRE elements to layout numbers converted to a 
TABLE, or PDF converted to HTML or in the future ascii art could be 
converted to SVG.

Is there a case where something in a P element should be marked up?  ascii 
art is the only thing I can think of.

Headers, forms, lists...all seem to be marked up well.  Tables being 
converted to style sheets are covered in other checkpoints.

Therefore, I think I disagree that all elements in the BODY element should 
generate this warning.  I think it should be limited to:
IMG
OBJECT/EMBED
PRE

what about the future?  what about XML?  RDF?
