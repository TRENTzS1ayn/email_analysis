Please keep in mind that there are 65 WCAG checkpoints which means *at 
least* 65 techniques in our document.  We often have more than one 
technique for each checkpoint.

I would prefer if people keep the checkpoint number in the subject. I don't 
care if its at the end or the front, but it is **very** useful to me.  As I 
edit a checkpoint I can easily gather the other e-mail associated with that 
checkpoint.  This reduces the number of times I may need to edit a 
particular technique.  I am not often able to read and reacte to the e-mail 
as it comes in.  Thus, I may be working on a whole week's worth of e-mail 
at one time.  I can find all of the e-mail related to a particular 
technique and synthesize a single proposal from my understanding of the thread.

I will try to make the e-mail that I send more readable for others by 
referencing which version of the document we are discussing.
