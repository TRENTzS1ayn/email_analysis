In Len's comments from the 23rd of January [1]  about the 21 December draft 
[2] he asked that the WCAG definition for a linearized table be included in 
checkpoint 5.3.  There was some other clean-up to do as well.

I propose:
<blockquote>
Checkpoint 5.3 - Do not use tables for layout unless the table makes sense 
when linearized
Technique 5.3.1 [priority 2] Verify that  layout tables make sense when 
linearized

Discussion Status:
under discussion

Evaluation:
A TABLE element will trigger this evaluation.
This technique applies only to tables used for layout purposes, not to data 
tables.

Example of a message to be displayed:
Tables used for layout should make sense when linearized.
When a table is 'linearized,' the cells are read in the order in which they 
appear in the HTML source.

Repair Technique:
Linearize the table and ask the author to verify that the result is 
understandable.

Test Files and Discussion Files:
Link to test file for this technique.
