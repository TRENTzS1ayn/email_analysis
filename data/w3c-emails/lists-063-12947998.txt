Related to the previous message (technique 5.5.1 Check for a valid summary 
attribute, in response to Len's comments from [1] about 21 december version 
[2]), the WCAG group concluded that 5.5 applied also to the CAPTION 
element. Their conclusion was incorporated into the 11 February HTML 
Techniques for WCAG document 
[http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#tables].

I propose:
<blockquote>
Technique 5.5.2 [priority 3] Check TABLE elements for valid CAPTION element
Discussion Status:
under discussion
Evaluation:
Verify that the TABLE element should have a valid CAPTION element.
Example of a message to be displayed:
  This TABLE does not have a CAPTION: A table caption describes the nature 
of the table in one to three sentences. For example, "Cups of coffee 
consumed by each senator."
Repair Technique:
Allow the author to enter a CAPTION.
