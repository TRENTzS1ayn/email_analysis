Len commented that the content of NOFRAMES should be checked [1].  I also 
realized that there was a minor technical error in the way the technique 
was worded in the 21 december draft [2].

here is my proposal:
<blockquote>
Technique 6.5.1 [priority 2] Check that a NOFRAMES element exists within 
each FRAMESET.
Discussion Status:
awaiting discussion
Evaluation:
A valid NOFRAMES element should exist within each FRAMESET.
The contents of the NOFRAMEs element must allow the user access to the site.
Not allowed: Telling the user that they should upgrade to a browser that 
supports frames is not allowed.  Suspicious words within the text a 
NOFRAMES element: "upgrade," "full advantage," supports frames," "missing" etc.
Example of a message to be displayed:
Does your page work if frames are not loaded?
Repair Technique:
Allow user to construct a valid NOFRAMES.
Test Files and Discussion Files:
Link to test file for this technique.
