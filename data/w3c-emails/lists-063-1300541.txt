Mike, 

The Adobe converter Daniel mentioned produces a page 1 with garbage
characters.  I did a quick edit by hand to correct that error and added
some ALT text to the image of the dialog box.  I attached it to this email
if you want to put it on your web site.

(I don't know if the attachment will make it through the ER-IG email list
forwarding, but Mike should get it since he's addressed directly).

Len
