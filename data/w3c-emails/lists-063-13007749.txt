I like the idea to trigger the suggestion to use stylesheets on just a
couple of elements, such as FONT, where a stylesheet can be used. I would
add that it's very important to trigger this if we find a layout table as
well. I think one of the big intents of stylesheets was to be able to
position items that way and move away from layout tables altogether. Once
CSS is widely supported, we would want to see layout tables disappear
entirely.
