I'm afraid this wouldn't be clear, to hear "apples oranges pears checkbox 
checkbox checkbox"

you could make it look like the checkboxes on one line and the labels 
beneath and have it read

checkbox apples checkbox oranges checkbox pears

just like they were each on a separate line, if each label and checkbox 
pair are in a cell of a one row table, with a <BR> between each checkbox 
and label, i.e.

<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD>  oranges <BR> [checkbox]
<TD> apples <BR> [checkbox]
<TD> pears <BR> [checkbox]
</TABLE>

For simplicity, I've omitted the actual checkbox markup as well as the 
</TD> and </TR>
