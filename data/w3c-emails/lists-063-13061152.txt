This actually raises a WCAG issue that's bothered me for a while.  I think 
that, instead of discarding tables for purposes of layout, we simply 
provide a standard way to define something as a "layout table".  For 
example, by adding a class or attribute to the TABLE 
declaration.  Especially since CSS handles tables poorly.

This actually goes beyond WCAG and gets into HTML4 land.

In the meantime, we can put "layout" into the summary, as was already 
suggested earlier.
