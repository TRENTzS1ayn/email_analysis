I think we must evaluate the pages to which we send those using our
"existing tools list" for accessibility. So far Dr. Watson doesn't work
(access denied), a cursory examination of Net Mechanic (incidentally
this is a "for fee" service but I've submitted one of our pages for free
evaluation) finds at least a "click here".

I may recommend that we get a "bad" site to submit to any of the tools
so that we have a uniform checker and perhaps that each site test itself
and our Web presence. Whatcha think?
