they keep us up to date.

WC make link to exisiting tools list more prominent on the ER list.
WL will look at the list of tools and see if i can take any.
LK will ask everyone on the list to write something for at least one of the 
tools.
resolved: the people on this call agree that "Techniques for Web 
accessibility evaluation and repair tools" and if someone wants to suggest 
something new and gather consensus.
Resolved: plan for publishing a public document: WC finish going through 
comments on my comments, then we all need to reread to ensure that WC 
didn't break anything. then send to IG let them review for 1 or 2 weeks, 
incorporate their comments, then become public. Therefore, we'll publish 
tomorrow review over the week and discuss at next week's meeting.
Resolved: include a technique to require an assertive action by the user 
for manual checks.
