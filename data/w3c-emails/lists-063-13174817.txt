The techniques document published on 11 February does include this 
qualification.
<blockquote>
Provide a summary via the "summary" attribute. Summaries are especially 
useful for non-visual readers. A summary of the relationships among cells 
is especially important for tables with nested headings, cells that span 
multiple columns or rows, or other relationships that may not be obvious 
from analyzing the structure of the table but that may be apparent in a

fits into the context of the current document. If no caption is provided, 
it is even more critical to provide a summary. Two examples
