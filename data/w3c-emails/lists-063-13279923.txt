aloha, wendy!

you wrote, quote:
We had assumed that we could identify which OBJECT elements included 
programmatic objects by looking at the "type" or "codetype" 
attribute.  However, there is not a type defined for Java or Flash in the 
current list of MIME types [2]. I had expected to find a subcategory of 
application for Java and flash.

don't mime types need to be registered via IANA
http://www.iana.org/

there is an online MIME type registration form located at:
http://www.isi.edu/cgi-bin/iana/mediatypes.pl

but i seriously doubt if we could register Flash and ECMAScript 
unilaterally...  obviously, macromedia needs to be prodded to register 
flash and shockwave, and something needs to be done about 
JavaScript/ECMASript, too...  if so, would the HTML WG/CG be the 
appropriate persons to liaison?
