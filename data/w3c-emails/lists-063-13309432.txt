lots of things that aren't registered are sent using fairly common "private
extensions". The example here is (from the SouthPark Movie
site) application/x-shockwave-flash for which, sadly, I don't have any
handler registered in Lynx...

  don't mime types need to be registered via IANA
  http://www.iana.org/
  
  there is an online MIME type registration form located at:
  http://www.isi.edu/cgi-bin/iana/mediatypes.pl
  
  but i seriously doubt if we could register Flash and ECMAScript 
  unilaterally...  obviously, macromedia needs to be prodded to register 
  flash and shockwave, and something needs to be done about 
  JavaScript/ECMASript, too...  if so, would the HTML WG/CG be the 
  appropriate persons to liaison?
