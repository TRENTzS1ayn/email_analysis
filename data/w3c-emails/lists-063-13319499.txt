I propose that the evaluation for checkpoint 7.4.1 reads:
<blockquote>
This technique will be triggered by:
A META element with an "http-equiv=refresh" attribute value and a "content" 
attribute integer value greater than 0.
If the "content" attribute is a URI this is an auto-redirect page.  Refer 
to technique 7.5.1
</blockquote>

the evaluation for 7.5.1 would then read:
<blockquote>
This technique will be triggered by:A META element with the an 
"http-equiv=refresh" attribute value and a "content" attribute value of a URI.
</blockquote>
