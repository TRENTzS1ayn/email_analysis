But both a legacy browser that doesn't recognise the applet element, and
one that does but has applets turned off, will render the text between the
applet and the /applet tags (unless it is a really broken one).

Cheers

  As I remember the issue, there are two scenarios:
  
  1. modern browsers who know the APPLET tag and therefore can render the ALT
  appropriately
  2. legacy browsers who do not recognize the APPLET tag at all

  I don't think so. The situation I am thinking of is
  
  <applet class="something" ...>
    Some useful text tht can be rendered when the applet doesn't appear
  </applet>
  
  not the situtation where the stuff is somewhere else (on that account I
  agree
  with you)
  
  cheers

    Charles,
  
    The way I understand it is somewhat analogous to d-tag/longdesc. The
  content
    may, in fact, be elsewhere in the doc, but the only way to verify 1-to-1
    correspondence is by having it an alt.

    Reading through the current draft of the ERT (since that's all that is
    available) iI noticed that it requires "alt" for applet even when there is
    alternative content provided as content for the element. I'm not sure this
    is
    a good requirement.
  
    What do people think?
