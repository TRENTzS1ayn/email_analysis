  On the 14 February telecon we discussed how to decide when an image needs a 
  longdesc.  previously we said when an image was "complex."  in the call I 
  read some excerpts from the National Braille Association's Tape Recording 
  Manual.  We decided to incorporate those ideas to replace the phrase 
  "complex image."
  
  This is my proposal:
  <blockquote>
  IMG element should have a valid LONGDESC attribute and a descriptive link 
  if describing the image will add information not given in the text of the 
  page. The amount of information in the image will determine how detailed 
  the description should be.
