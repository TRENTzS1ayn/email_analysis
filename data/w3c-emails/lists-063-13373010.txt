Java applets in object elements are expected (by convention I think) to use
the code="..." for their source.

There is no general way of knowing - application/x-ms-word may not be a
programmatic object...

  Hello,
  
  The ER working group is creating techniques that evaluation and repair 
  tools can use to determine or help the author determine if elements on a 
  Web page conform to WCAG 1.0.  [1]
  
  One technique is, "Verify that the page is usable when programmatic objects 
  are disabled."  This means that it must first identify programmatic 
  objects.  We had assumed that we could identify which OBJECT elements 
  included programmatic objects by looking at the "type" or "codetype" 
  attribute.  However, there is not a type defined for Java or Flash in the 
  current list of MIME types [2]. I had expected to find a subcategory of 
  application for Java and flash.
  
  Should this be taken to the HTML working group?  Have we overlooked something?
  
  Perhaps we should say that OBJECTs with type="application/*" are potential 
  programmatic objects?  We don't want to limit it only to Java and flash, 
  but I expect a lot of what we'll be seeing is Java or flash and if we know 
  that is what we have we could suggest specific techniques for those 
  technologies.
  
  Thanks,
