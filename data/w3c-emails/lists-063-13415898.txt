I took an action item at the 14 February meeting to find out if a tool 
could determine how many tracks were included in a Flash file by looking at 
the file.  It does not appear to be so.  I created a movie with 2 layers 
then looked at the file in wordpad.  All I can see is a bunch of "junk."

i named the objects I created, and that text is readable, but that's about 
it.  I think we'll have to ask authors when we run into flash.

anyone else know otherwise?
