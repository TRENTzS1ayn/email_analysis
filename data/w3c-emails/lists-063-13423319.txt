it is deprecated but not invalid. if someone has provided a d-link they 
have satisfied the WCAG checkpoint 1.1.  Until "longdesc" is widely 
supported we will have to look for D-links.  We will have to deal with 
legacy as well - many sites use the D-link and will continue to do so 
regardless of how many browsers support "longdesc" because they want to be 
completely backwards compatible.  Therefore, if we find a d-link we could 
suggest that the tool alert the author that they could use "longdesc" 
instead.  d-link is still the most accepted technique for satisfying the 
"long description" checkpoint - today.

see http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#image-text-equivalent for 
more info.

I'm not sure I understand this comment.  The description of an image is 
very much related to the image on its own.  Here is an example from the 
WCAG HTML Techniques document:
A chart showing how sales in 1997 progressed. The chart
is a bar-chart showing percentage increases in sales
by month. Sales in January were up 10% from December 1996,
sales in February dropped 3%, ..

I used the information from the National Braille Association because they 
have been describing images in documents for decades (at least since 
1971).  Therefore, the description that they would provide for an image is 
very similar to what we want in a longdesc.  If the function of the image 
is to display a summary of information of sales from the last year, then 
that's what the long description should provide.
