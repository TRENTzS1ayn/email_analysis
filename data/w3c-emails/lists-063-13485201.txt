The current list or registrered media types covers a small fraction of what
is actually used.

The "type" is advisory and some people within IETF want to have it removed
altogether.

That is a reasonable expectation, and totally unlikely to ever be realised.

Many modern media types are sent out as text/plain or as
application/octet-stream. This reflects the Herculean efforts that were
required to register a new type in the past, plus the fact that most people
don't control the servers they use anymore and can't get any new types
added.

Surely javascript should be added tothe list of programatic stuff?

Also, is this going to be a problem? *Is* it possible to use things with
programatic content disabled, in the general case? Or are people thinking
in narrow terms of current HTML pages in current browsers?

I don't want to see another well-meaning but impractical and detrimental
techniqe joining the infamous "usable without stylesheets"
