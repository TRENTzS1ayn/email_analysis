The quote you gives says that nested headings and headings spanning mutiple 
columns or rows  "may not be obvious".

While it's true that they aren't obvious to a blind user with today's 
technology, they can be readily deduced by suitable software using the 
algorithm published in the HTML Rec at

http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/tables.html#h-11.4.3


  IMHO, we should ultimately require the software in the 
browser/screenreader system to implement this algorithm,  rather than 
asking page authors to put in this redundant information.

Now this raises the question of whether we should require the special 
markup"until" the happy day arrives that the software implements the 
algorithm.  I don't think so.  At the present time, no browser/screenreader 
that I know of makes use of it anyway (at not least in the mainstream... 
there may be something in emacs/w3).  I think the w3c message should be to 
put the algorithm in the browser/screenreader.

There will still be cases where the special markup is needed, e.g. when 
there's some random heading in the middle of a table.  But not for mere use 
of spanning and nested headings.
