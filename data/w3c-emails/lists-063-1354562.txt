Yes, it's on, but you phoned in early.  It's 3PM EST which is 15:00 in 24
hour time, which something like 21:00 (+-1 hour) in western Europe ( I
don't know the exact conversion with daylight savings time, etc.)  I hope
you will still be able to be with us then, since the Altifier is a major
topic.

I apologize for our primitive and confusing American time system :-).
