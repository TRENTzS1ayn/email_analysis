Ian,

Thanks for pointing that out.  That's an even stronger reason to go with 
style, stronger than what I discovered about netscape navigator.. that even 
the 4.7 version doesn't allow complete override--even to the extent implied 
by their edit preferences.  So I withdraw my suggestion that font be 
allowed inside structural elements.
