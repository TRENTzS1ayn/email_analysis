I think the situation may be better than that.  

I looked in the User Agent Working Group implementation notes but I did not
find there a survey of the implementation of the Swing Set.  This would be
good to know.  

Thanks to the lawsuit, with my Win98 laptop I got, on a separate CD ROM, a
[Sun-] Compliant Java VM.  But I cannot find in the OS any way to find an
"About" page for it that tells me what the Java VM I have installed is
compliant _with_.  

Anybody know more about this?
