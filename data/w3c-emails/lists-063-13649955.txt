It may be a small thing but, an image has different meanings in different
contexts. In your example chart what is the important information? The 1996
sales increases were different from the 1997? Sales were up in January.
Sales normally drop in February? The page that holds the image should
provide context for the image and guide the writing of the LONGDESC.
