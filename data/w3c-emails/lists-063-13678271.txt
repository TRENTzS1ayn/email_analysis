Our next teleconference is


      Monday 28 February (+1-617-258-7910 - MIT bridge)
10-11:30 Eastern Time

Agenda:

1. the new ERT document
http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/

for discussion--
- How much detail in the table of contents.  If we include every techique 
for every checkpoint it will get pretty large.  For comparison, you can 
look at the table of contents in the w3c process document 
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/Process-19991111/, and also the table 
of contents of WCAG http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505/

- Discussion of open issues.  Note that the issues are marked as "@@" so 
you can find them quickly.


2. If time, feedback on the Wave accessibility evaluation tool
