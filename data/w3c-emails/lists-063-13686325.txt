I just added descriptions of the Delorie Lynx viewer, Geralds Lynx Viewer, 
and The Wave to the tools list http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/existingtools.html

I also sent off requests for comment from the authors of the first two 
tools, and stared in the mirror to get feedback from the author of the third.
