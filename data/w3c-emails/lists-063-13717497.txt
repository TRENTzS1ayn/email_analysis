The wave doesn't work on http://www.w3.org.  The ALT text notations are 
missing, among other things.  I think it's because that page uses 
XHTML.  It uses it in a way that's supposed to be compatible with HTML 
browsers... but I think it's breaking the parser I'm using...

Anyway, www.w3.org is not a good demo for the wave.
