People may want to talk about this today, or defer it, but I have
a potential application scenario that I have been thinking about
and would like others to think about.

You could call it "distance user testing."  Toronto has a setup
like this now.  I think we want to think about how our modules
could flow into such an environment for industrial-strength
evaluation of techniques.

This is a situation where people with various ability profiles
participate in systematic, structured-sample user testing and
_they are the only person at their location involved_.

What does one want in such a workstation?  Session logging?
Remote administration?  Shrink-wrapped Aps and rapid-prototype
modifications?

Anyhow, that's one of my answers for "where do we see this
stuff going _next_ if someone codes something and someone
else likes it?"
