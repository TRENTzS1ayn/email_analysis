The description of "linearization" now reads

When a table is 'linearized' the cells are usually read a row at a time, 
starting at the left and             moving to the right.

That's true, but I'd suggest adding something like:

'More specifically, "linearized" means reading the cells in the order in 
which they appear in the HTML source of the table'.

This is equivalent to the Web Contents Accessibility Guidelines which 
defines a linearized table as

"A table rendering process where the contents of the cells become a series 
of paragraphs (e.g., down the page) one after another. The paragraphs will 
occur in the same order as the cells are defined in the document source.

(see
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505/wai-pageauth.html#lineariz 
ed-table
)

(I changed it to fit in with your wording in terms of cells, which I like).
