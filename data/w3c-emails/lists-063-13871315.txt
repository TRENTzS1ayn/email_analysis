For technique 1.1.K (http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/#Technique1.1.K) we
need to determine if a page contains ASCII art. Our intern had a look at a
how ASCII art is used on the web and prepared the following document:

http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/AsciiArt.htm

Note: this does not deal with emoticons " :) " etc.

From this report I think we can create an algorithm that will reliably test
a page for ASCII art. I'll code something this week and test it on several
sites.
