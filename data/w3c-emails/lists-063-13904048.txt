hi all,

i've posted my revision of technique 1.1.A at 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/tech1-1.html

I started editing the rest of the techniques for checkpoint 1.1 but then 
decided to wait for reactions on this draft.

note that i got rid of the "under discussion" section, and modified the 
structure a bit.  I like that the same structure is used for each technique 
throughout the document, however it seems to be applied 
inconsistently.  applying a consistent structure would be one of the first 
things i think we ought to do in terms of general "clean up."
