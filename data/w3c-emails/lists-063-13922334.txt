Len,

Yes, I think that looking at the statistical properties of the characters
relative to the language, as you suggest, would be a better method of
detection. Unfortunately, our intern has left the university for a real job
and we haven't got anyone to follow up on this. I'm hoping that the simple
rules already documented should detect at least 90% of ASCII art. Once I get
it coded, I'll start checking sites to see how it works.

Chris
