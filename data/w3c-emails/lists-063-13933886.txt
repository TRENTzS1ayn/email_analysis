Wendy,

Thanks for the editing help on the ERT.

I noticed that you dumped the 'Example Language' section of the technique
and feel that it should be left in. This section can help to ensure that all
validation and repair tools inform the user in a consistent manner. It
doesn't force anybody to use the language but should be influential.

Chris
