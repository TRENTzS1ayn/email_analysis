BP:: "I would love to see some consensus on these points."

WL: I concur savagely with the points about new users vs. experienced
users having different wishes and about how people like to have stuff
read to them. Lots of expressed wants (particularly by newbies) should
be ignored IMHO, particularly when they have to do with "wanting the
same information as sighted colleagues get" in relation to what colors
are in the rainbow stripe used for <HR>, etc. "Bullet" should be easy to
do with "earcons".
