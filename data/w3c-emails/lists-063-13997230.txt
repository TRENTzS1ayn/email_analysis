Bruce,

You guessed right that the folks in the survey were experienced, as I later 
came to realize (I was new to the email lists when I asked these 
things).  In the survey there were 11 respondents, although not everyone 
answered all questions.  Eight described themselves explicitly or 
implicitly as blind.   Another 3 respondents were sighted folks with 
experience in the field.

I absolutely agree that it would be useful to have a survey that took into 
account user experience and LONGDESC.  I did that survey in ancient times 
before LONGDESC.

I think we still disagree on bullet. Are you saying that bullets should 
just be ignored?   I don't want to argue too much on philisophical 
grounds.  The bottom line is what do actual users prefer.  However, I do 
want to point out that the answer we get will depend on the examples we 
give.  For example, you have an example

quote
And there is a bulleted list.  January, no activity.  February, we had a
rally.  March, our annual dinner..."
end quote

In that example, the names of the months, january, february, march, etc. 
serve as the list markers so "bullet" is not necessary.  Similarly, if each 
bullet item is just one word like

. Prepare.
. Act.
. Evaluate.
adding any word is extra baggage.

However, if we consider an example where each bullet item is two or more 
sentences, the bullets become more useful  and I bet there would be more 
positive responses.

There's also your rule of thumb, which I like, about reading the page as 
you would read it aloud to a person who was blind... or part of your radio 
audience... or preparing dinner as you read the paper to her...  Do you 
think even you would start saying "bullet" if you were reading something 
where all items are several sentences long?

So as for what we say for bullets, horizontal rules, etc, the full answer 
is "it depends".

Same goes for horizontal rules.  They can be eye candy, e.g. if they simply 
start or end the page.  But in my experience they are as functional as a 
paragraph tag.   If we disagree on this it's probably because we are 
thinking of a different corpus of examples... you're thinking of eye candy, 
I'm thinking of places where they are useful.  Perhaps div renders them 
obsolete... I haven't thought about that... for for the present at least do 
any speech browsers or screenreader/visual browser combos speak them at all?

I guess my feeling is that right now most web sites out there are 
disasters... no ALT text at all, and we're better keeping the rules simple 
even if it means that users will hear "bullet" or "new section" more than 
would be optimal.  So we give them a list of default words, and that's the 
default rule.   Then we say for people who really want to think more deeply 
about optimizing their page, they can use null or blank alt text for 
bullets or rules that really really truly serve no explicit or subtle 
implicit function whatsoever.

It's like if a person has an image labeled "button for contact 
information".  I'd rather they omit the words "button for".  But I'm going 
to downplay that comment and only suggest they follow it for new buttons, 
and polish up their ALT text as last priority.
