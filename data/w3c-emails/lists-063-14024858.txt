Well, alt-text isn't just used in text-only browsers, but also graphical
browsers (e.g. Opera) with images turned off. There, _bullet_ or
_horizontal rule_ would look really strange.

Anyway, with bullets or horizontal rules, UL and HR *should* be used
(stylesheets can be used to style these).

I would also recommend reading Alan Flavell's very good page about
alt-texts <URL: http://ppewww.ph.gla.ac.uk/%7Eflavell/alt/alt-text.html
