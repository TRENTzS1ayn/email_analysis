we're due for a face 2 face meeting.  we need to give 8 weeks notice before 
a face to face so that people can make travel plans.

could we have suggestions by next wednesday (12 January) for:

1. a city.
chicago is central, but i'm not sure who we could work with to host the 
meeting.

Several members of the group are on the East coast, so someplace like 
Boston might be more feasible.  Again, I'm not sure who would host, perhaps 
MIT/W3C?

I would love to see a meeting in Madison, but I imagine that is wishful 
thinking; there are no direct flights (Except from chicago, minneapolis and 
milwaukee)  and those adverse to cold may not appreciate the mounds of 
snow.  Plus, I'm not sure who could host it (my house isn't quite large 
enough).

2. a venue.

3. dates.  the earliest that we could schedule a meeting, assuming that we 
wrap up discussion and announce by next Thursday 13 January, is March 
9.  note that CSUN is the week of March 20th.  We can not schedule a 
meeting immediately after CSUN because other WAI groups have beat us to 
it.  We usually don't schedule WAI meetings before CSUN because then it 
becomes a full week of meetings (csun + WAI meetings afterwards).

The WAI team discussed possibilities last Tuesday and suggested 
April.  Charles will be in Boston in April.

is there another conference that we could piggyback off of?

4. how many days do you suppose we need? one or two?

5. Agenda items. I assume the agenda would be (at the minimum) the 
following issues:
1. ERT document.
2. WART.
3. rechartering and future plans (our charters expired last July).
