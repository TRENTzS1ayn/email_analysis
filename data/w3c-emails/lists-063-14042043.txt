Thanks, Wendy.

For venue, we can consider Phildelphia.   I believe can get the Institute 
on Disabilities/UAP to host and Temple has some spiffy meeting areas in our 
new learning center.

Philadelphia has a major Airport in town, and there's another, even bigger 
airport in Newark NJ (A much longer drive, but gives more options for other 
fares).  It isn't in the center of the US, but it's more centered with 
respect to Europe <smile>.

For length...

I'd suggest a total of two days, but arranged so that the second is optional.

The first day would an "interest group" focus with a wide range of discussins.
The second day we'd have a "working group" focus: We'd nail down specifics 
on our work items.  All would be invited but it woudn't be a requirement.

p.s.
(by "host" I mean supplying meeting facilities.)
