We should share information and ideas but I don't think the two projects
should be joined.

I'm in constant contact with Jutta (chair of the Authoring Tools Guidelines
Working Group) and have been letting her know about Michael's project.

I agree with Michael that we should wait until he's farther along then have
another look.
