Wendy,

This seems to be a very contentious issue so perhaps a user survey could
help to bring consensus. Can we get the survey going soon?

I have a few comments on your technique 1.1.A:

- The IMG and INPUT elements should not be grouped together in one
technique. The evaluation is different (all IMG elements require ALT but
only INPUT elements with a TYPE attribute of IMAGE require ALT) and the
repair is different (IMG elements can be bullets or HRs but INPUTs are
unlikely to be).

- The current ERT has an 'Other Checks' point for this technique that is
missing in your technique (It states "After user has entered ALT text for
the image, check the site for other instances of the image. If the site
contains other images that are the same and they do not have ALT text,
suggest that all same images without ALT text use the new ALT text.").
Should we put it back in?

On rereading the technique I noticed that we have the suggested maximum
length of ALT text at 150 characters. I don't think we discussed this max
and it seems a bit long to me. I suggest we reduce the suggested maximum
length of ALT text to only 75 characters.

Chris
