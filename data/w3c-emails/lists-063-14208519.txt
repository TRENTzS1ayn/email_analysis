Hi all,

Judy asked that I update the list of existing tools [1] so that more 
information is provided for each entry.  She asked that I use EO's list of 
browsers as a model [2].  It's my understanding that EO had several 
discussions to determine the information that ought to be provided for each 
entry.  I have only edited the first four entries.  So far, I have been 
including:
1. name/URL
2. who it is from
3. brief description of what it does
4. does it run locally or on the server
5. what platform does it run on

is there other information we should provide for each tool?

ratings? (as i did with the The Web Page Accessibility Self-Evaluation Test)
usability vs. accessibility?
year released? this might be harder to track since a. i'm not sure how 
easily this info is available for all of these, plus if they are releasing 
new version regularly we would have to keep this up to date.
others?
