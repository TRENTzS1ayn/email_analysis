I suspect that some of the additional items that you list would be helpful,
especially the date of the most recent version release.

I would add three items to your list:
1. If server-based, is the server software available for installation on
local intranets?
2. Is support available to users of the software?
3. Was the software designed to be accessible to "all" users?

Althought the response to item 3 should always be yes, this sends an
important message to developers who may not consider this is the design of
their own software.
