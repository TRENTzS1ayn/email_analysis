Dear list members,

I don't know if this topic is ever discussed here, but as far I know not.
A growing number of web pages are designed on specific display resolutions
like 800x600. A lot of those web pages include tables what results in web
pages 
with a lot of information outside the screen. If you have luck they didn't
disable the trackbars but there are also pages without trackbars, so that
the only way to see what is on that page is to save it and change the
source code. 
In my statistics coming from visitors to my The Screen Magnifiers Homepage
at http://www.magnifiers.org I see that 21% of visitors to my web site use
a display resolution 640x480. For people having problems reading text on a
screen decreasing the display resolution is a solution to make text larger.
There are also screen magnifiers performing better in this resolution. 
As an example of a web site designed for a 800x600 resolution see the USA
access board at http://www.access-board.org.

Do some of you have any suggestions or comments about this topic?
