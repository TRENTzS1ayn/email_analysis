How are the general reviews of ERT coming along?  I have not seen any 
comments sent to the list.

At the 3 January meeting [1] we decided to publish our first public working 
draft in mid-February. To make that deadline we determined that
1. everyone needed to review the ERT in its entirety,
2. we would collect open issues,
3. clean up major issues as best we could before publishing a public 
working draft (rather than internal working drafts that are public.)

Len sent e-mail last week asking for an intermediate draft before the 
Feburary goal.

I propose that:

1. people review the document and send general comments to the list by next 
monday's meeting (24 January).
2. I will publish an open issues list on Tuesday (25 January).
3. Chris and I will incorporate editorial comments and release another 
working draft on Friday (28 January).
4.  Open issues will be on the agenda for the meeting on 31 January.
5. I will update the open issues list on Tuesday 1 February
6. Chris and I will published an updated internal working draft on friday, 
4 February.
7. open issues will be discussed on monday 7 february.
8. at the 14 February meeting determine if we want to make the 18 February 
draft public.

therefore, we could start the following pattern:
Tuesdays: open issues updated.
Fridays: new working draft posted.
Mondays: discuss open issues and evaluate how close we are to going public.

and then every 3 months take the most current working draft public.

thoughts?
