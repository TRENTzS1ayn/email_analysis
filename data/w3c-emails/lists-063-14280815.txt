My current open issues are:

1.1.A - NULL alt text - allowed or not
1.1.A - Space "  " alt text - allowed or not
3.6 - "Mark up lists and list items properly" - I'm not sure how to do this


Wendy responded:

i think that 1.1.A will only be solved by user testing and gathering
data.  we can put our best guess in the public draft with a note that says
"awaiting data to make firm decision."  there are too many opinions
floating around about this one.  i don't want to open it up for discussion
again until we have data.  i proposed a survey, the response seemed to be
that this was a good idea.  no one volunteered to create the survey.  there
were questions as to what it would look like.  in our next meeting i think
we ought to discuss this and assign someone an action item. I'm willing to
do this if no one else volunteers, however i would like to see action items
being taken by a wider variety of participants on the list.

3.6  has this been discussed in the group?  could you point me to the
discussion in the archives or in minutes?  is the issue that one may
identify a list but aren't sure if it is marked up correctly?  a hack that
people used to use is an LI outside of a list to force indentation.  or a
UL with lots of Ps.  I believe an HTML validator would pick these up (this
ought to be verified).

i also think lots of single item lists is suspicious.  e.g.
<UL>
   <LI>
</UL>
<UL>
   <LI>
</UL>

or deeply nested lists:
<UL>
<UL>
<UL>
<UL>
<UL>
<UL>
   <LI>
</UL>
</UL>
</UL>
</UL>
</UL>
</UL>

so - anything that would indicate that a list is being used for formatting.

the repair is to transform to appropriate markup (most likely LI -> P) and
use style sheets (Or a table - yikes!) for layout.
