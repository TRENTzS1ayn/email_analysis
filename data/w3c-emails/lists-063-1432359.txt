I think that the scanner and the search-and-replace results writer
can perhaps be quickly done by subsetting the WWWlib codeset.

See www.w3.org for this W3C product.  It is not up with the latest
HTML doctype, but the scanning Michael was talking about doing 
doesn't need much more than the SGML parser.
