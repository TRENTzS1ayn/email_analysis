Hi,

I propose that the short technique phrase should be able to stand on its 
own (as in a checklist).  I also think that the repair should not be 
implied in the short phrase since some may have several potential repairs.

proposed short phrase examples for Checkpoint 1.1 - Provide a text 
equivalent for every non-text element:
<proposed short phrase examples>
1.1.A -  Check IMG elements for valid "alt" attribute
1.1.B - Verify that valid IMG element descriptions ("longdesc" attribute or 
d-link) are provided where necessary
1.1.C - Check INPUT elements of type="image" for valid "alt" attribute
1.1.D - Check APPLET elements for valid "alt" attribute
1.1.E - Verify that valid APPLET element descriptions are provided where 
necessary
1.1.F - Check OBJECT elements of type="<image MIME types>" for valid 
text  equivalents and descriptions (where necessary)
1.1.G - Verify that valid OBJECT elements of type="<audio or video MIME 
types>" text equivalents are provided where necessary
1.1.H - Check FRAME elements for valid "longdesc" attribute
1.1.I - Check AREA elements for valid "alt" attribute
1.1.J - Check SCRIPT elements for valid equivalents where necessary
1.1.K - Check A elements for valid text content
1.1.L - Verify that valid text equivalents are provided for PRE and XMP 
elements used to create ASCII art.
</proposed short phrase examples>

  [note that in the discussion of the techniques, MIME types are as defined 
in ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/media-types ]

Note that I added a technique for the A element and arranged the order a 
bit so that OBJECT element techniques were together.

These would replace the current text for Checkpoint 1.1 - Provide a text 
equivalent for every non-text element.
<current>
Technique 1.1.A - Check images ALT text
Technique 1.1.B - Check images for LONGDESC and descriptive link
Technique 1.1.C - Check input buttons that use images for ALT text
Technique 1.1.D - Check applets ALT text
Technique 1.1.E - Check applets for alternative content
Technique 1.1.F - Check objects for alternative representation
Technique 1.1.G - Check frames for an associated LONGDESC file
Technique 1.1.H - Check AREA elements for ALT text
Technique 1.1.I - Check if audio files have an associated text transcript
Technique 1.1.J - Check SCRIPT element for an associated NOSCRIPT element
Technique 1.1.K - User notification for ASCII art
</current>

if this proposal is excepted, I will go through the document to rewrite 
each phrase to fit this form.
