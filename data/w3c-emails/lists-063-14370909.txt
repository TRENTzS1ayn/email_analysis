I propose that we link to examples of good authoring practices in the WCAG 
techniques document.  For most every technique in the ERT we should be able 
to point to something in WCAG techniques.  Where we can't, we need make 
sure that WCAG is aware of the omission.

if people accept this proposal I can go through the document and add these 
links.
