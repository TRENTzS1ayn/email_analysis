I agree that the standalone idea is the way to go.

I note Richard Anderson's post some time back that using the letters
for list item distinction poses audio similarity, particularly on the
"e" ending sounds, that make differentiation harder than if only numeric
list items were used: b c d e g p t v z three phi. He convinced me to
no longer use such.
