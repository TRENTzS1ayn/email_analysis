Hello,

we discussed the title of the document at today's teleconference.  The 
following proposals were made:

* "Techniques for evaluation and repair of Web content"
* "Evaluation and Repair tool accessibility guidelines"

The first proposal does not address that we are focusing on accessibility 
while the second implies that we are looking at the whole tool for 
accessibility  like the authoring tool guidelines.

other proposals? thoughts?
