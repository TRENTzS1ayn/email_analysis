We discussed the face-to-face on the call today.

Here is a summary of where we are at in 4 points:

1. After CSUN is out because other WAI working groups have made plans.

2. After WWW9 is out because of the W3C AC meeting.

3. Before WWW9 is possible.  However, it is more likely to happen in 
Sophia, France than in Amsterdam, Netherlands due to administrative 
logistics.  A quick search of one-way tickets from Nice to Amsterdam shows 
the following two options:

Option1
Price: 1 adult @ USD 159.30
Transavia Airlines flight 6584 on a Boeing 737-300
  From: Nice, France (NCE) Friday, May 12 9:55pm
To: Amsterdam Netherland  (AMS) 11:50pm

Option 2
Price:1 adult @ USD 159.30
Transavia Airlines flight 6582 on a Boeing 737-300
  From: Nice, France (NCE) Saturday, May 13 9:45am
To:  Amsterdam Netherland (AMS) 11:40am

I didn't investigate the added cost of a one-way ticket to Nice, then to 
Amsterdam then Amsterdam back to a city in the U.S., Canada, or other 
country.  It might be cheaper to fly into Amsterdam, then down to Nice and 
back...? I also did not find out what a train would cost.

I also need to confirm with W3C folks that before www9 in Amseterdam is 
*definitely* out.

4. Len offered that it would be easy to get a meeting room at Temple 
University in Philadelphia, PA.  What about a time in April?  Personally, I 
am only available April 1 - 19, but think this could work well if people 
are able to travel in April. Although, as William pointed out that means 
that some people may be traveling March to CSUN, April to an ER meeting, 
then May for WWW9.
