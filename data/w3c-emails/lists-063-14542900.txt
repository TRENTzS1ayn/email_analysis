BM:: "Is this and other arguments compelling enough to continue to
discourage auto-generated text-only pages?"

WL: IMHO, yes. The generation of text-only pages is non-trivial although
a case can be made that a Lynx simulator does just that. Separate ain't
equal. Alhough the notion of a cyber-ghetto may seem an overstatement,
it is too much like the wheel-chair user having to use the freight
elevator to get to the ballroom where she is to be given the "citizen of
the year" award.
