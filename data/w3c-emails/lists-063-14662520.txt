ok.

then do we need a priority on each technique or can we just leave them on 
the checkpoint?  I guess if we want the techniques to stand on their own, 
then we should include priorities on techniques.

I think we should ask what effect we want to have rather than how long it 
will take us to reach our goal.  As I see it, the question is, "is this 
document informative or normative?"  in other words are we creating 
something that acts as a guide for people who are creating E&R tools (a W3C 
Note), or is this something that they will want to conform to and become an 
industry "standard" (a W3C Recommendation). (probably not the best 
description of the differences...)

At this point, I think we are working towards a Note.  It seems to be 
supportive material for the other 3 guidelines documents (WCAG, ATAG, UAAG).

thoughts?
