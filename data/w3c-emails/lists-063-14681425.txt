I think Techniques should inherit priority from the Checkpoints too. It
would not be necessary for Techniques to identify their priority then,
though we may choose to do so for convenience.

I agree that, though the Techniques may be treated as normative (tools may
fully conform to them), we probably don't want to actually make it so. Chris
brings up good reasons for that. I'd also say that the Techniques are
properly viewed as an "interpretation" of the WCAG; making them normative
might freeze some of the room for interpretation and thus take us out of our
own bounds.
