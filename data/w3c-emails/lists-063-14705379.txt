Hello,

I have begun work on the open issues list [1].

Note that:
1.  I have not completely incorporated Michael's comments.  From a quick 
skim it looks like most of these are technically sound and therefore 
require minimal discussion (therefore not really "issues").  However, I 
want to go through again to pick out issues that we need to discuss and add 
them to the list.  Where possible, I will merge Len and Michael's comments 
about a particular Technique.

2.  The style of presentation is not consistent since I started out 
ordering information one way then decided to change.  It's not too 
different, but I would like to make it consistent. Although, we'll see how 
long it takes for us to be using ETA, it might not be worth the effort.

3. This is not the ETA tool!  I talked with the systems folks today and 
there are a couple issues they need to resolve.  We needed an issues list, 
so I generated this.  Once ETA is working I'll add all of this to it.  But, 
we can't wait for it if we want to publish this in February.

4.  The issues are divided into 3 categories:
1. Open Issues
2. Issues that need clarification from the WCAG WG
3.Closed Issues

Len identified several that need to be taken to WCAG.  I think we ought to 
track these separately.  I moved a couple issues to closed based on my 
interpretation of results.  The chair hasn't actually confirmed consensus 
on these topics.

5. I experimented with using lists.  Is this appropriate list markup?  It's 
a linear presentation of a table in some way!  (all right, i'll stop being 
a snot)...seriously, i would like comments on the accessibility and 
readibility of my use of lists.

so, we've got a lot of talking to do!! <grin>
