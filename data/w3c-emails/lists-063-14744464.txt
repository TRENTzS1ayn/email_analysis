Wendy,

There's another issue that occurred to me.  What if there's a description 
of the table in the body of the text?  This might be in there for good 
writing style.  For example, someone might write

<P>
The following table shows the vitamin content of the five most popular 
vegetable:

<TABLE>
<TR>
<TH> A </TH>
<TH> B6 </TH>
etcetera.

A person using a screen reader will hear the description in the text and 
them immediately hear the table headings giving the vitamins that are 
listed.   So they get an immediate idea of what's in the table.

So I don't see any need in this example for CAPTION, TITLE, or 
SUMMARY.  For the user it's just extra clutter.  And for the author it's 
extra work to no end.

Of course, there are other instances where you would want CAPTION AND/OR 
SUMMARY, as discussed in your note to gl.
----------------
BTW, procedure wise, shall we continue to feed comments such as these to 
you to have a single point of contact to gl?
