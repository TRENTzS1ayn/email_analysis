Asking if 15 or some other number seems like a reasonable threshold to
trigger asking the user if related links were grouped on a page.  Some
grouping can be automatically checked, such as a DIV around a group of
links.  Otherwise the question can be triggered by large numbers of links on
a page.

no.
