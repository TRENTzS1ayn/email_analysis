Michael,

In response to your suggestion:
"Technique 2.1.A - User Notification for color use
Also need to trigger if we detect any HTML or CSS color settings"
[from ]

I added the following bullet to the list in 2.1.A:
as well as the HTML elements and attributes listed in the next technique 
(2.2.A).

since i didn't think we needed to list them for both checkpoints.

Also, I added the following to the list in 2.2.A
<quote>
STYLE element or attribute CSS properties:
- color
- background-color
- background-image
- background
</quote>
