Michael,

In your review you said,
"Checkpoint 2.2 - Ensure that foreground and background color combinations 
provide sufficient contrast when viewed by someone having color deficits or 
when viewed on a black and white screen
New technique: check style sheet colors and cascade down to determine color 
of current element."

I think this can be dealt with in the current technique.  If you don't 
think it can be, could you draft text for the new technique?

thanks,
--wendy
