reworded based on michael's suggestions:

Technique 3.4.A [priority 2] Check document for relative or absolute units.
Discussion Status:
awaiting discussion
Evaluation:
For any HTML element defined to take a %LENGTH, %PIXELS, %MULTILENGTH, or 
%MULTILENGTHS, a validated value should either end with "%" or begin with 
"+" or "-" or use the "em" unit.
Exception: "width" and "height" attributes of IMG elements.
Example Language:
This element uses absolute units of measure rather than relative units of 
measure.
Repair Technique:
Allow user to change the units of measure.
