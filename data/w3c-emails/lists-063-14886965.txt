Technique 6.1.A - User notification of style sheet use.
In suggested language, we need to acknowledge that Checkpoint 6.1 and 
Checkpoint 3.3 are mutually exclusive: one or the other will always be 
triggered.

I propose that if 3.3 (Check document for use of style sheets) is triggered 
and fixed, then 6.1 should be triggered.  Thus the following would occur:
1.  the document does not use style sheets (3.3 triggered)
2. user adds style sheets
3. 6.1 triggered to verify that the style sheets transform gracefully

However, if style sheets are identified, then 3.3 is not triggered but 6.1 is.

I propose rewording 3.3 as:
<blockquote>
Technique 3.3.A [priority 2] Check document for use of style sheets.
Discussion Status:
awaiting discussion
Evaluation:
Check document for presence of STYLE or LINK rel="stylesheet" elements 
within the HEAD element or use of "style" attributes throughout the document.
Example Language:
Use style sheets to control layout and presentation. For example, use the 
CSS 'font' property instead of the HTML FONT element to control font styles
Repair Technique:
Notify the user if the document does not use style sheets.
Once the user has added style sheets, trigger technique 6.1 to verify that 
the document is readable when style sheets are not applied.
</blockquote>

I don't believe a link to 3.3 is need from 6.1. I propose that 6.1 says,
<blockquote>
Technique 6.1.A [priority 1] Verify that the document is readable when 
style sheets are not applied.
Discussion Status:
awaiting discussion
Evaluation:
Triggers:
-LINK element with a REL attribute set to 'stylesheet,'
-STYLE element,
-At least one "style" attribute used on any element.
Example Language:
Ensure this document can be read without stylesheets.
Repair Technique:
none
