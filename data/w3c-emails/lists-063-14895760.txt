Per Michael's suggestions, plus a few thoughts of my own, I propose we 
reword 6.2.A as follows:

Technique 6.2.A [priority 1] Check the source of FRAME and IFRAME elements 
for valid markup files.
Discussion Status:
awaiting discussion
Evaluation:
FRAME or IFRAME "src" attribute is not a valid markup file.  In other words 
it must be an HTML, XHTML, SMIL, MathML, or other valid markup.
Valid "src" attribute values must have a suffix of ".htm," ".html," 
".shtm," ".shtml," ".cfm," ".cfml," ".asp," ".cgi," ".pl" (what are the 
extensions for SMIL and MathML files?) or have a known public identifier at 
the top of file.
Example Language:
Frame source: [frame source file name] is not a valid markup file.
Repair Technique:
None
