Per michael's suggestion I have added APPLET to the list of elements that 
trigger this technique.

Note that i couldn't remember:
OBJECT elements of type = (@@what are the type attribute values for Java, 
etc.?)

(following the information for the "type" attribute in the HTML spec led me 
to a list of MIME types, but I don't see java in there, nor other 
programming languages that I had expected to see).

also, we do not have any repairs for this one.
