Technique 9.4.1 [priority 3] Check for "tabindex" attributeDiscussion

Status:
awaiting discussion
Evaluation:
Check the following elements for a "tabindex" attribute:
A
AREA
BUTTON
INPUT
OBJECT
SELECT
TEXTAREA
Example Language:
Create a logical tabbing order through this page.  Some people like to skip 
over site navigation bars that appear at the top of each page in a 
site.  To allow someone to tab over it, set the tab order of the page such 
that the navigation bar one of the last objects.
Repair Technique:
Show the author a list of all of the active elements and their current tab 
order.  Allow them to change the order either by changing the number of the 
tabindex or dragging and dropping an object to where it ought to appear in 
the list.
