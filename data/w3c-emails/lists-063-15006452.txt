The HTML spec actually doesn't define the ACCESSKEY attribute for the SELECT
element. I'm not sure why since it does have it for INPUT, but I assume it's
because an INPUT whose TYPE is not "text" will not have an associated LABEL
element to receive the ACCESSKEY, whereas any SELECT element will. But
anyway the spec isn't clear so I don't know if we should keep SELECT in the
list, or add those provisions for INPUT, or what. Michael
