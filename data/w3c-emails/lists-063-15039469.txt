<blockquote>
Technique 10.1.A - Check anchors for 'new window' attributes
Trigger if A|AREA has any TARGET attribute, which will always open a new 
window unless there exists a window in another frame with that name. Plus 
always for "_blank" and "_new" as shown.

I have reworked it to read:

Technique 10.1.1 [priority 1] Check A and AREA elements for valid "target" 
attributes
Discussion Status:
awaiting discussion
@@ how do we handle the "until user agents" clause?
Evaluation:
A and AREA elements should not have "target" attributes of  "_blank" or "_new".
A and AREA elements may have other "target" attribute values if there is 
another existing window with the target name.
Example Language:
This Anchor element [anchor text] will open a new window that can be 
disorienting for some users.
Repair Technique:
Allow the user to remove the "target" attribute or use an existing window 
as the target.
