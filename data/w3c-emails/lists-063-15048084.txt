<blockquote>
Checkpoint 10.1 - Until user agents allow users to turn off spawned 
windows, do not cause pop-ups or other windows to appear and do not change 
the current window without informing the user
New Technique: trigger on SCRIPT elements, unless we bother to check for 
the "window.open()" command (knowing that window might be a variable of 
type window).

i created the following new technique:
<blockquote>
