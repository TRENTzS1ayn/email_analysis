Technique 10.2.1 [priority 2] Verify that label controls are properly 
positioned.
Refer also to checkpoint 12.4
  Discussion Status:
awaiting discussion
Evaluation:
Triggered by the following elements:
INPUT
LABEL
LEGEND??
SELECT
TEXTAREA
Example Language:
A label for a text area, a text input control or group of controls (e.g., a 
group of checkboxes) must immediately precede its control (or group of 
controls) on the same line (if there is only one control or group) or be in 
the line preceding the control (or group of controls).
Repair Technique:
Allow the user to reposition labels associated with form controls.
