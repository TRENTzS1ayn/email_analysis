In the A-Prompt program, the Alt text database is used to aid the author of
the HTML document. I think it has several uses:

1) it can save keystrokes entering the alt text
2) it could make alt text more consistent
3) LONG DESC files are also associated with the object and alt text so they
will be used more consistently
