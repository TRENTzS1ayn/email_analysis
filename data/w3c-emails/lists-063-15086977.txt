Hi all,

The latest draft of the document is at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/ert-20000128.html


Note the list of to-do's in the "status of this document" section. I would 
like to highlight that the table of contents is not in its final form.  I 
will be generating this, and in the meantime stripped out the links to 
techniques since they were changing and I didn't want major discrepancies.

We have a lot to do, but I am very happy with the comments we received this 
last week and feel like we made some good progress!  I think a public draft 
by mid- to late-February is within our reach.

To do

Finish going through Michael Cooper's comments. I made it through 
Checkpoint 10.3.

Make Len Kasday's corrections.

Install publishing scripts. Primary benefit is to generate the table of 
contents so we don't have to manage that by hand.

Clean up all of the @@'s (editor questions and comments).

Use numbers rather than letters to distinguish Techniques (e.g., convert 
1.1.A into 1.1.1).

Check for consistent language usage.

Link to WCAG Techniques where appropriate.

Use WCAG notes or rationale as example language where possible, unless we 
have something clearer.

Inherit all of the reference info between checkpoints from WCAG (e.g., at 
the end of Checkpoint 10.1, "refer also to Checkpoint 12.4").

Determine if we want to use "author" or "user." Then check for consistent 
usage.

Determine if we want to use "document" or "page."  Then check for 
consistent usage.
