Since the checkpoint refers to "bypassing the group" this seems to refer to 
a set of links all together. So the number would apply to the group, not 
the whole page.

The simplest case is just a series of links separated only by white space, 
formatting, a single character (e.g. a pipe symbol), or an image that's the 
same (e.g. a graphical bullet).  I'd suggest checking that case.

A more complicated case is one where each link is followed by some 
description. and it all follows a pattern, like

link
   description
link
   description
...

If the author used a description list this is easy.  Otherwise, it would 
take a bit of pattern recognition to see the repetition.
