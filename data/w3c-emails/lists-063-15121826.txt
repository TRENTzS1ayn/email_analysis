Guideline Checkpoint 6.2 says
Ensure that equivalents for dynamic content are updated when the dynamic 
content changes.
The Guideline technique doc then says
Refer to 4.10.4 Always make the source of a frame an HTML document .

First of all, I've got a wcag question.
Although I agree with 4.10.4, requiring HTML, what does it have to do with 
checkpoint 6.2, updating dynamic content?

Also, looking at 4.10.4, it's not enough to have a cgi, pl, etc suffix 
because cgi scripts can produce anything, including images, which are 
(properly) forbidden by 4.10.4.
