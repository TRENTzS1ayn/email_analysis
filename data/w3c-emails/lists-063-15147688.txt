Good idea, but I don't think it's a accessibility issue, since it affects 
disabled people same as non-disabled people. Could be good for Bobby tho 
because Bobby has philosphy of going beyond accessibility.

I'd suggest though that it be required only if the HREFLANG is different 
than the language of the current doc.

In any case, as far as accessibilty is concerned, it's a WCAG issue.
