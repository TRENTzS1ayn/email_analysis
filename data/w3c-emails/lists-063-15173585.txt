It should say something more general than HTML.  The idea is that the
resource should be something that is capable of bundling all the
equivalents in one URI recovery.

The reason why this is referred to under "change the equivalents when
changing the dynamic content" is that by bundling ALT and IMG in a
hypertext document that loads the frame, it is easy to update the
non-textual content and textual alternatives in one coordinated step.  If
the frame were loaded with a .GIF file, it is hard to back-annotate the
frameset page with corresponding voice-over text unless you do it with a
script.

Yes.  The current discussion is limited to what you an check in the text of
the current hypertext document.  That is all A-Prompt is going to do for
now, I suspect.  For a more rigorous check, e.g. by webmaster before
installation or by portal on receipt of update notification, one should
walk through the referenced material, recover it, and verify that indeed it
too is WCAG compliant including covering all requirements for equivalents.
