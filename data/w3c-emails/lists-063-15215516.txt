here is my proposal based on today's discussion (refer to the minutes from 
the call at http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/minutes/20000131.html):

Technique 1.1.8 [priority 1] Check FRAME elements for valid "longdesc" 
attribute
Discussion Status:
awaiting discussion
Evaluation:
FRAME elements should have a valid "longdesc" attribute if the value of 
the  FRAME "title" attribute does not completely describe the frame 
content.  Refer to techniques for checkpoint 12.1
If a FRAMESET has three or more frames and does not have a "longdesc" 
attribute, ask the user if the relationships between frames are not 
apparent in the titles for each frame.
Valid "longdesc" file name:
Must not be NULL
Must be a valid URI
Example Language:
Missing "longdesc": Missing 'long description' file for this frame.
Invalid "longdesc" file name: Invalid 'long description' file name for this 
frame: [current "longdesc" file name] - [can not be empty].
Repair Technique:
If the relationships betweeen frames are not obvious then ask that they 
provide a description of the relationships. Allow the user to create a 
"longdesc" file or associate an existing "longdesc" file. It is suggested 
that each FRAME in the FRAMESET reference the same "londesc" as the 
description of the relationships should be available from each FRAME.
