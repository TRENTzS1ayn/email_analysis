Checkpoint 10.5 - Until user agents (including assistive technologies) 
render adjacent links distinctly, include non-link, printable characters 
(surrounded by spaces) between adjacent links
New Technique: between every </A> and every <A> there must be at least one 
non-whitespace character surrounded by at least one whitespace character. 
Whitespace is a space, tab, CR, or &nbsp;

I propose:
<blockquote>
Technique 10.5.1 [priority 3] Check for non-whitespace characters between 
consecutive A elements.
Discussion Status:awaiting discussion
Evaluation:
Check for at least one non-whitespace character surrounded by at least one 
whitespace character between every </A> and every <A> element. Whitespace 
is a space, tab, CR, or &nbsp;
Example Language:
none.
Repair Technique:
Suggest that the author select to use vertical bars "|" between A elements, 
but allow them to choose another character if they prefer.  Insert the 
selected character surrounded by white space between each </A> and <A> element.
