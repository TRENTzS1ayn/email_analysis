I propose (note the many @@'s, i.e. questions and unfinished work:
<blockquote>
Technique 11.1.1 [priority 2] Verify that W3C technologies are used.
Discussion Status:
awaiting discussion
Evaluation:
Check for uses of non-W3C technologies such as: PDF, Flash, GIF images, JPG 
images, proprietary HTML elements (@@other major ones??).
@@See 1.1.1 for images used for mathematical equations.
Note. I left out JavaScript because there is not a W3C equivalent 
technology yet.
Example Language:
Non-W3C technology used:  W3C technologies have been reviewed for 
accessibility issues throughout the design phase and have accessibility 
built-in. Many non-W3C formats require specific applications (often called 
plug-ins) that are inaccessible or do not work well with assistive 
technologies.  Using W3C technologies will tend to make pages more 
accessible to more people using a wider variety of hardware and software. 
If inaccessible technologies (proprietary or not) must be used, equivalent 
accessible pages must be provided.
Repair Technique:
Suggest that where appropriate, the author:
convert quicktime movies (others?) into SMIL presentations.
convert GIF and JPG images to PNG or SVG.
convert Flash animations to a combination of valid HTML, SMIL, and PNG or SVG.
@@convert images of math equations to MathML.
@@Note: many of these W3C formats are not widely supported yet.  Therefore, 
how do we deal with this in the meantime?  Present the info and let the 
author decide?
Use a text-only page generator to create an equivalent accessible page.
