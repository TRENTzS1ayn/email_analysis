<blockquote>
Checkpoint 11.2 - Avoid deprecated features of W3C technologies
New Technique: ask, or run through a validator, or something. We might want 
to check for common ones, such as replace IMG and APPLET with OBJECT, etc.

i propose:
<blockquote>
Technique 11.2.1 [priority 2] Check for deprecated features of W3C technologies
Discussion Status:awaiting discussion
Evaluation:
Use W3C validation services to validate documents as per their public text 
identifier.
See checkpoint 3.2 for more information on public text identifiers.
Example Language:
Use of deprecated HTML element: you are validating against [public text 
identifier] and the following elements have been deprecated in favor of 
newer elements.  [insert list of deprecated elements used in the page with 
what they should be replaced with].
Repair Technique:
Help the author replace FONT with use of CSS.
Help the author replace IMG and APPLET with OBJECT.
