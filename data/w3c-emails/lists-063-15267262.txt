Checkpoint 11.4 - If, after best efforts, you cannot create an accessible 
page, provide a link to an alternative page that uses W3C technologies, is 
accessible, has equivalent information (or functionality), and is updated 
as often as the inaccessible (original) page
New Technique: maybe we should only trigger this on pages that do not pass 
priority 1? 2? Automatic checkpoints

I propose:
<blockquote>
Technique 11.4.1 [priority 1] Verify that the page has passed all 
checkpoints of the desired conformance level.
Discussion Status:
awaiting discussion
Evaluation:
For each page, keep track of which checkpoints the author has passed, 
either through automatic evaluation or confirmed through prompting the 
author.  Ask what level of conformance the author is trying to reach.  If 
checkpoints for that level have not yet been met, ask the author if they 
would like to continue working to make the page accessible.  If they do 
not, ask them if they would like to provide an alternative, accessible page.
Example Language:
Before resorting to an alternative page, reconsider the design of the 
original page; making it accessible is likely to improve it for all users.
Repair Technique:
Dynamically generated alternative pages [references@@].
Tools to generate alternative pages [references@@].
