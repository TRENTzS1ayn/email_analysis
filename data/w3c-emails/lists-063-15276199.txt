Checkpoint 12.4 - Associate labels explicitly with their controls
New Technique: check for presence of LABEL element whose FOR attribute

I propose:
<blockquote>
Technique 12.4.1 [priority 2] Check LABEL elements for valid "for" 
attribute values.
Discussion Status:
awaiting discussion
Evaluation:
Check that the "for" attribute value of a LABEL element matches the "id" 
value of a form control on the current page.
Example Language:
Form controls are not explicitly labeled.
Repair Technique:
If a LABEL does not have a valid "for" attribute, list all of the controls 
without explicitly associated labels and let the author pick one.
If a form control does not have a LABEL, verify that the author has 
implicitly associated text with the form control then help the author 
convert associated text into a LABEL element.
