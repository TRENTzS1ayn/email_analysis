No problem, here.

Information content requirements (including unique or not-unique rules)
should come from the application scenarios, i.e. ER-IG consensus.  These
are still under discussion IIRC.  See thread David started on does the user
mode ever involve multiple choices?

Data format details (XML-ish or not) should be decided by the specific
toolsmiths that have signed up to interface their tools to a given data
object [or WG consensus if there are enough of them].  So far this is you
and Michael.
