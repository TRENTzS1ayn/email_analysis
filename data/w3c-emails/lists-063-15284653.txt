I propose:
<blockquote>
Technique 13.1.1 [priority 2] Verify that the target of each link is 
clearly identified.
Discussion Status:
awaiting discussion
Evaluation:
Check for commonly used non-meaningful phrases such as "click here" and 
"more" as link text.
Check that if link text is not unique, duplicates link to the same place.
Example Language:
Link text should be meaningful enough to make sense when read out of 
context -- either on its own or as part of a sequence of links. Link text 
should also be terse.
Repair Technique:
Retrieve the TITLE of the target page and suggest that as link text.
