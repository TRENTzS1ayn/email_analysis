Checkpoint 13.2 - Provide metadata to add semantic information to pages and

New Technique: check for RDF in document
</blockquote>

I propose:
<blockquote>
Checkpoint 13.2.1 [priority 2] Check for use of RDF, META, ADDRESS, TITLE 
and LINK elements.
Discussion Status:
awaiting discussion
Evaluation:
Check for RDF, META, ADDRESS, TITLE and LINK elements in the HEAD element 
of HTML/XHTML files.
Example Language:
none.
Repair Technique:
If no RDF, META, ADDRESS, TITLE or LINK elements are found, request 
information from the author to be stored as meta information. Examples of 
content to prompt for:
title of the page (required for frames, see checkpoint 12.1),
type of content,
descriptions of the content of the page,
conformance claims,
author information,
next page in a series (e.g., LINK rel="next").
If a LINK element is found, check if it is used for style sheets.  If  it 
is, then proceed as if no LINK element were found.
If a META element is found, check if it is used to create a redirect.  If 
it is, then proceed as if no META element were found (refer also to 
checkpoints 7.4 and 7.5).
