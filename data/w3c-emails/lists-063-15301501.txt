I don't see the isindex attribute in HTML 4.

I propose:
<blockquote>
Technique 13.7.1 [priority 3] Verify that search functions enable a variety 
of skill levels and preferences.
Discussion Status:
awaiting discussion
Evaluation:
Check if a FORM is used to submit a search.
Example Language:
When providing search functionality, content developers should offer search 
mechanisms that satisfy varying skill levels and preferences. Most search 
facilities require the user to enter keywords for search terms. Users with 
spelling disabilities and users unfamiliar with the language of your site 
will have a difficult time finding what they need if the search requires 
perfect spelling. Search engines might include a spell checker, offer "best 
guess" alternatives, query-by-example searches, similarity searches, etc.
Repair Technique:
none.
