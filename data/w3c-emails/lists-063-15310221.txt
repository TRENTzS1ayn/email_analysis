Checkpoint 13.9 - Provide information about document collections

Can you give me an example of RDF for document collections?

I think the check has to be a question to the author.
I propose:
<blockquote>
Technique 13.9.1 [priority 3] Verify that information about document 
collections is provided.
Discussion Status:
awaiting discussion
Evaluation:
Ask the user if this page is part of a collection, such as a slide show, or 
a chapter in a book.
Example Language:
Bundled documents can facilitate reading offline.
Repair Technique:
In HTML/XHTML specify document collections with the LINK element and the 
"rel" and "rev" attributes.
Suggest that that the author create a collection by building an archive 
(e.g., with zip, tar and gzip, stuffit, etc.) of the multiple pages.
