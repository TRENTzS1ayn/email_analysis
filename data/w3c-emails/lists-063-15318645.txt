Checkpoint 14.3 - Create a style of presentation that is consistent across

If there is a linked stylesheet, would that be a clue?

I propose:
<blockquote>
Technique 14.3.1 [priority 3] Verify that a consistent style of 
presentation is used across pages.
Discussion Status:
awaiting discussion
@@this requires looking at pages throughout the site.  Need two levels of 
checking: page vs site?
Evaluation:
Compare the properties of STYLE elements between pages.
Compare the names of external style sheets (referenced with LINK elements).
Example Language:
Consistent page layout and recognizable graphics benefit all users. In 
particular, they help people with cognitive disabilities or who have 
difficulty reading.
Repair Technique:
If STYLE properties vary between pages, or various external style sheets 
are used, suggest the author consolidate style properties into external 
style sheets and use consistently.
