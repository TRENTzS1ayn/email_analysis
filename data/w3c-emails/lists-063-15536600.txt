Good treatment of effects, sometimes unintended, of concise writing style:

"Escher effects in on-line text" by Judith Ramey. In "The Society of Text. 
Hypertext, Hypermedia, and the Social Construction of Information",
Edward Barrett, editor. The MIT Press, 1988.

Abstract: Escher effects are ambiguities or other anomalies in on-line text
that force the reader to study the text as text. On-line text consists of
instrumental text (commands, menu items) and commentary (system messages,
Help). Simple Escher effects result from stylistic strategies used to
compress on-line text, tangles of instrumental text and commentary,
weak-formatting, and home-grown terminology. Complex Escher effects
result from deeper rhetorical or structural problems; they interfere
with our ability to build a rhetorical contract with the writer/designer
and our ability to build a useful mental model of the system.
