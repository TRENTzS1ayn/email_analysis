Well,

using the default CSS for HTML (or for that matter taking it from the
stylesheet in operation) it means that what is rendered as a block is
defined, which is probably pretty obvious to average people looking although
blocks that have blocks inside them could also be looked at in terms of what
they have - too many paragraphs (how many is that?) without any headers, etc.
That would be the approach to take to tables as well.

Cheers

Charles

  So the next question is:
  
  Is this formal definition of a block what the average human looking at a 
  page perceives as a block?
  
  It's what's perceived as a block that's revelant to blocks that are "too long".
  
  Also, as long as people use tables for layout,  we still need rules that 
  apply there.
