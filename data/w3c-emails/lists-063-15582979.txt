Dear All,

Two W3C workshops are going to be held this coming Fall related to Web
Device Independent Authoring.

The first one, which is a joint WAP/W3C workshop, already has a Call
for Participation available at
  http://www.w3.org/2000/06/w3cwap-workshop.html
  W3C/WAP Workshop on the Multimodal Web
  September 5-6, 2000, Hong Kong 

It is in fact planned the week before the WAP Forum meeting, same
location, and is going to be focused on WAP specific issues wrt. W3C
technologies: WML2 and XHTML Basic, Common Dialog language with Voice,
State management and XForms, CSS improvements, etc.


The second workshop, not yet finalized, should be held beginning of
October 2000 somewhere in Europe or US, and be more aligned with the
original Device Independent Authoring workshop program (scheduled for
June but not held) and still described at
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/2000/06/wapwaicfp.htm
  (that description will change soon)

We want this second workshop to be broader in scope, with
participation from more constituencies than just WAP : also TV, WAI,
other mobile stakeholders (like Imode), etc. and so we've decided to
decouple it from the WAP Forum meeting in Hong Kong.

Please consider registering for the first workshop in Hong Kong and
stay tuned for more information on the second workshop.
