W3C specs have used d-links. I think the anchor is generally a capital D. So
that's how I do it (as well as adding a longdesfc for that hoped-for day ;-)

  Complex images should have a longdesc. But, IE and Netscape do not support
  the longdesc attribute of the IMG element so an interm method must be used.
  The 2 common methods are the 'D' link and the image-anchor method (the image
  is an anchor that links to the longdesc file). I would like to hear comments
  on which method is preferable.
  
  Should both methods be used? Is one better than the other? Are there other
  methods of using the longdesc?
  
  What is the best anchor text for the 'D' link? I've seen "d", "D" and "[D]".
  
  Thanks for your comments,
  Chris
