HB: I note that HTML and XML only allow one attribute of the same
name in any one tag. Thus if some graphic had distinct multiple
language descriptions built-in, it would be up to the application 
to provide just the pertinent one for the language containing the
reference to that document.

HB: We have not proposed multi-language ATT values on a single
graphic, that would require some delimited recognition and 
selection of the desired single language message before its 
presentation, say as a tool-tip.

HB: Since a lang="natural-language-code" can be used on most HTML
elements, that could be the selector to cause only some to be
rendered.

HB: of content, not necessarily rendering.

HB: That approach will allow multiple <alt-text>[text]</alt-text>
Is each part of a pair with its following <as-used-in>...?
