This is of course a wcag issue, but my personal opinion is to use the D 
link, since images are often links themselves already, so the convention 
wouldn't apply in those cases.

Also,  the user might click on the image thinking it was a link to 
something more substantial when they otherwise would have preferred to skip it.

As for D vs. d vs. [D] I'd want to hear from speech users on that one.

 From a visual perspective, a plain D I think would get the fewest 
complaints about messing up the look of the page.
