Hello all,

I apologize for  not publishing a new draft of the AERT this week.   I 
should be able to publish an AERT this week, but it  most likely will not 
be before the meeting on Monday.  The next draft will include edits that 
Chris made last week as well as a few that I still have to make.

The WCAG WG has been working on an update to the WCAG Techniques 
Note.  Therefore I've had a lot of editing to do on those documents.

In other news, Charles and I met with Ted Guild of the W3C systems team to 
design the database to track tools that was discussed at the AU/ER 
face2face in Amsterdam.  Ted created the tables and some scripts to add new 
entries to the tables as well as list information from them.  It looks 
really promising.  More on that later.
