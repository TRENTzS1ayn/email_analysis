Hello,

My proposal for AERT Technique 13.6.1 is as follows.

<blockquote>
Technique 13.6.1 [Priority 3] Grouping links.

Discussion status
The suggested authoring technique is not widely supported by user agents.

Evaluation

Triggers
Several A elements separated by
spaces, bullets, or other characters such as "] [" or " | "
BR elements,
LI elements,
TD elements (i.e. A is the only element in a series of TDs, or A with inner 
IMGs are the only elements in a series of TDs)

Requirement
Links should be grouped by MAP elements.  Provide information about the 
group in the "title" attribute.

Repair

Triggers
User has identified a list of links that should be grouped.
User has identified that they want to include a link to skip over the group 
of links.

Actions
If the user wants to group links:
If the links are contained in a P element, replace the P
  element with MAP element.
If the links are in a list, enclose the list in a MAP element.
If the links are the only content of a table, include the table in a MAP 
element.
If the links are not the only content of a table, then ??? how do you help 
the user separate the links into something that can be included in a  MAP 
element???

If the user wants to bypass a group of links and wants to include a link on 
the page:
Insert an A element with a "name" attribute and a "tabindex=1" just after 
the group of links.
Insert an A element just before the group of links and link to the A 
element just created before the group of links.

Refer to the suggested techniques from the section in the HTML Techniques 
for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 called  "Bypassing and 
Grouping Links."
</blockquote>

Comparison of proposal and existing text 
[http://www.w3.org/TR/AERT#group-links]

1. I made the Evaluation section a definition list and listed the elements 
that trigger this technique as "Triggers."
2. I modified the list of evaluation triggers since I felt the description 
of table was too limiting.
3. Deleted the "suggested message" since at the 12 June telecon we decided 
to link to examples rather than provide example text. [minutes - 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/minutes/20000612.html]
4. Changed "Suggested repair" to "Repair" and divided into 2 sections: 
Triggers and Actions.
5. Included details about how to perform the repair (Actions).

With this format, these techniques are separated from discussion of the 
interface.  Instead of saying, "ask the user if they want to create a group 
of links" which opens a whole box of worms we can say, "once the user has 
decided to group links..."

Should we link to particular sections of ATAG10-TECHS that discuss the 
interface?  If we don't have examples, should we mock some up?

thoughts?
