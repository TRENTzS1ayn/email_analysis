couple of points...

a p element should be included inside the map (it requires block content, not
inline). For the same reason, there is no problem having non link content
included (except that there is a problem trying to wrap a map around a
section of a table I suspect, although there needn't be. Maybe I am getting
cynical about conformance to specification...)

giving a tabindex 1 after the map isn't enough - in implementations, the
tabindex goes to the things with explicit tabindex then starts from the top
of the page (so it isn't all that helpful in genereal <sigh/>). Better is to
include a "skip navlinks" option.

  Hello,
  
  My proposal for AERT Technique 13.6.1 is as follows.
  
  <blockquote>
  Technique 13.6.1 [Priority 3] Grouping links.
  
  Discussion status
  The suggested authoring technique is not widely supported by user agents.
  
  Evaluation
  
  Triggers
  Several A elements separated by
  spaces, bullets, or other characters such as "] [" or " | "
  BR elements,
  LI elements,
  TD elements (i.e. A is the only element in a series of TDs, or A with inner 
  IMGs are the only elements in a series of TDs)
  
  Requirement
  Links should be grouped by MAP elements.  Provide information about the 
  group in the "title" attribute.
  
  Repair
  
  Triggers
  User has identified a list of links that should be grouped.
  User has identified that they want to include a link to skip over the group 
  of links.
  
  Actions
  If the user wants to group links:
  If the links are contained in a P element, replace the P
    element with MAP element.
  If the links are in a list, enclose the list in a MAP element.
  If the links are the only content of a table, include the table in a MAP 
  element.
  If the links are not the only content of a table, then ??? how do you help 
  the user separate the links into something that can be included in a  MAP 
  element???
  
  If the user wants to bypass a group of links and wants to include a link on 
  the page:
  Insert an A element with a "name" attribute and a "tabindex=1" just after 
  the group of links.
  Insert an A element just before the group of links and link to the A 
  element just created before the group of links.
  
  Refer to the suggested techniques from the section in the HTML Techniques 
  for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 called  "Bypassing and 
  Grouping Links."
  </blockquote>
  
  Comparison of proposal and existing text 
  [http://www.w3.org/TR/AERT#group-links]
  
  1. I made the Evaluation section a definition list and listed the elements 
  that trigger this technique as "Triggers."
  2. I modified the list of evaluation triggers since I felt the description 
  of table was too limiting.
  3. Deleted the "suggested message" since at the 12 June telecon we decided 
  to link to examples rather than provide example text. [minutes - 
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/minutes/20000612.html]
  4. Changed "Suggested repair" to "Repair" and divided into 2 sections: 
  Triggers and Actions.
  5. Included details about how to perform the repair (Actions).
  
  With this format, these techniques are separated from discussion of the 
  interface.  Instead of saying, "ask the user if they want to create a group 
  of links" which opens a whole box of worms we can say, "once the user has 
  decided to group links..."
  
  Should we link to particular sections of ATAG10-TECHS that discuss the 
  interface?  If we don't have examples, should we mock some up?
  
  thoughts?
