As I was working on a proposal for Technique 13.6.1, I looked at the 
sections in WCAG10-TECHS, ATAG10-TECHS, and AERT that are related to this 
technique.   I am trying to figure out a proposal for how ATAG10-TECHS and 
AERT refer to each other.

First compare what ATAG10-TECHS says for this technique vs. what currently 
exists in the AERT:

ATAG10-TECHS checkpoint 3.2
[http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-ATAG10-TECHS-20000504/#gl-prewritten-descs]:
<blockquote>
WCAG Checkpoint 13.6 Group related links, identify the group (for user 
agents), and, until user agents do so, provide a way to bypass the group. 
[Priority 3]
Techniques for WCAG checkpoint 13.6
HTML
Ask authors if lists of links are a group and should be a map.
</blockquote>

Note that it has an HTML specific technique.

Compare this to the current text in AERT for Technique 13.6.1 
[http://www.w3.org/TR/AERT#group-links]
<blockquote>
Suggested message:
         Groups of links should be grouped with a structural element.

Suggested repair:
         Ask the user if an identified list of links should be grouped.
         If the user wants to group the links, use one of the following 
techniques
         a MAP element
         SPAN or DIV with appropriate "title"
         Suggest that the user provide a link to bypass the group or that 
they move the group to the bottom of the page or that they use a high 
"tabindex" attribute value.
</blockquote>

What is in ATAG10-TECHS is a watered down version of what's in AERT, what 
should really be there?   A link to AERT?  This works better with the 
proposal I sent to the list than with what currently exists in the 
AERT.  It also seems that the ATAG10-TECHS ought to link to the 
WCAG10-HTML-TECHS section on grouping links.

Thoughts?
