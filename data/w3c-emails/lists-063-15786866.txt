The AERT has gone overboard.  What is in the ATAG10-TECHS is closer to what
the
AERT repair should match, as I recall the joint meeting with UA-WG.

For example, if the group of links is already the contents of a list container
such as OL, DL, or the like; the list structure is all the container you
need. 
It is unnecessary and therefore inappropriate to introduce a MAP here.

Detail:  I don't know where the "identify the group (for user agents)" clause
came from.  This is not, if I remember correctly, what we agreed with the User
Agent Working Group.  All the user agent needs to see is one parent node in
the
parse tree which covers the scope to be skipped.  This is what the inital
"group the links" phrase covers.  The TITLE is identifying the group for the
human user.  The syntactic container, whatever type of element it is, is
identifying the group for user agents.  The middle phrase "identify the group
(for user agents)" is redundant and/or misleading.

_If you need to add_ a container to separate such a group off from syntactic
elements that are (prior to grouping the links) peers in the parse tree but
not
part of this close-packed-link-group functional unit, use MAP as the container
introduced.  The question as to whether the link group is a functional unit
should be posed to the author, and the author allowed to easily adjust the
start and stop points of the range of  stuff enclosed.  If there is already a
container for the appropriate scope, confirm the TITLE with the author.  Do
not
introduce a redundant container nor force the type of the container to MAP.
