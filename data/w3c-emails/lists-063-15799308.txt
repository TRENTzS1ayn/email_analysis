Actually I may partially disagree I think (but we may just be matching
terminologies here) - the following are first response thoughts...

The map element identifies the semantic of a collection of links. So if
that's what there is, it should be used - it is more than a case of being
able to identify a group element for skipping them, although that may express
the requirement at a more basic level.

There are though many cases in hypertext where there are not a particular
collection of links - whether in a heavily linked paragraph, a list, or
whatever.

  The AERT has gone overboard.  What is in the ATAG10-TECHS is closer to what
  the
  AERT repair should match, as I recall the joint meeting with UA-WG.
  
  For example, if the group of links is already the contents of a list container
  such as OL, DL, or the like; the list structure is all the container you
  need. 
  It is unnecessary and therefore inappropriate to introduce a MAP here.
  
  Detail:  I don't know where the "identify the group (for user agents)" clause
  came from.  This is not, if I remember correctly, what we agreed with the User
  Agent Working Group.  All the user agent needs to see is one parent node in
  the
  parse tree which covers the scope to be skipped.  This is what the inital
  "group the links" phrase covers.  The TITLE is identifying the group for the
  human user.  The syntactic container, whatever type of element it is, is
  identifying the group for user agents.  The middle phrase "identify the group
  (for user agents)" is redundant and/or misleading.
  
  _If you need to add_ a container to separate such a group off from syntactic
  elements that are (prior to grouping the links) peers in the parse tree but
  not
  part of this close-packed-link-group functional unit, use MAP as the container
  introduced.  The question as to whether the link group is a functional unit
  should be posed to the author, and the author allowed to easily adjust the
  start and stop points of the range of  stuff enclosed.  If there is already a
  container for the appropriate scope, confirm the TITLE with the author.  Do
  not
  introduce a redundant container nor force the type of the container to MAP.
