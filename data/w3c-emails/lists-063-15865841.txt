My 2 bits...

I think Al is correct that we can get a long way without well-defined
semantics marking collections of links, but my recollection of what was
actually decided is the same as Wendy's.

And there is value in having more specfic markup, when we try to make
reasonably complex transformations. A list of links in a page that can be
navigated is great, but a list where we additionally know whether some links
are explictily grouped or just happen to occur in some order is even better.

So I do prefer the approach that Wendy has proposed for HTML. Having a title
means it might be human recognisable, but won't be machine-recognisable -
that comes from predefined semantic terms, which is what the markup elements
of HTML are.

  Al,
  
  You suggest that the WCAG group needs to be asked for clarification on this 
  issue.  You also state that this is not in alignment with what was decided 
  in a discussion with UA.
  
  WCAG had a joint meeting with UA on how to markup "navaids" as you call 
  them.  It was my interpretation of that discussion that MAP ought to be 
  used.  I sent a proposal to the WCAG working group a while back and added 
  what was agreed upon to the HTML Techniques for WCAG 1.0.
  
  What I have proposed for the AERT is merely an extension of that 
  proposal.  No where did I hear that the UA/WCAG agreed that a title on a 
  container element was enough.  MAP needed to be used to contain the 
  navigation bar links.
  
  Note that I am not proposing that <em>all</em> links be enclosed in 
  MAP.  Is that where the confusion is stemming from?  I am only referring to 
  links that are used as "navaids."  Thus, it is up to the user interface to 
  help the author decide if the identified group of links is a navigation 
  bar-type thing or not.  If it is, then the proposed AERT technique would be 
  invoked.
  
  If there has been further resolution within the UA group (re: only using 
  "title" on containers of navigation bars) I do not believe that either WCAG 
  or ER has been made aware of these resolutions.
  
  I disagree that what AERT needs to state is what is currently in the 
  ATAG-TECHS.  All that the ATAG-TECHS says is " Ask authors if lists of 
  links are a group and should be a map. "  The whole point of AERT is to 
  provide algorithms sans interface descriptions of actions an evaluation 
  and/or repair tool should perform.  Otherwise, there is no need for AERT 
  and we can keep it all in ATAG-TECHS.
  
  Note that the main point of this message is to determine what should be in 
  AERT and what should be in ATAG-TECHS and how they ought to link to each 
  other and WCAG and WCAG-TECHS.
  
  The actual proposal for technique 13.6.1 is included in another message 
  [http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2000Jul/0026.html]. 
  Please refer to that thread.  The text in this thread is what currently 
  exists.  note that it has changed significantly.
