My thoughts and recollections, vague as they may be

No, I think GL is correct - it is to identify for user agents (ie through
markup such as map). We have asked for both handling of map, and the more
general structural navigation you speak of.

The specific reasoning was that a title or class was not going to be
consistently recognised by a user agent, and there exists a perfectly good
HTML element (first class element no less) that does what we want - the map
element.

This is how I recall it anyway. (The trigger is that Nir pointed out that
trying to reserve a class to meet the function of the map element was
reinventing wheels and making them square)

  However, [Expletive!].  That "identify the group (for user agents)" bug is
  in the WCAG itself.  The "for user agents" is a mistake.  The "identify the
  group" was supposed to be for users: the TITLE on the grouping element.  I
  fell down in not reading the drafts closely and often enough as it went on
  to final.
  
  How to put it...
  
  Did we ask UA for special handling for MAP or did we not?
  
  Does a DIV, TABLE, or UL with a good TITLE meet the checkpoint?
  
  What is the status of MAP on this point?  It is the preferred grouping
  element, it is suggested in the advisory technique in the Techniques document.
  
  [so far these are WCA questions, so far as I can see.]
  
  This leaves it open to interpretation just when replacing a DIV or OL with
  a MAP is to be considered an improvement.  [ER issue]
  
  I misunderstood which Techniques document you were comparing with.  But the
  example AERT technique 13.6.1 goes beyond what I would consider reasonable
  intervention, and I _would_ like this particular technique coordinated with
  _GL_ based on the concerns outlined above.  Sorry the example threw me into
  a tangent vs. the methodological discussion you were trying to start.

  What is machine recognizable is not the contents of the TITLE, but rather
  whether it has a TITLE or does not.  That is machinable, and is one of the
  things that I would have the automatic table of contents extractor (also
  know as structural navigation function) sensitive to.
  
  If you actually thought that we were asking for machine recognition of MAP
  as this function at that time, I think we blew it.  Does the UAAG reflect
  any special processing for MAP?

  Here is a point of difference: I believed the consensus to be, and the
  writeup that Wendy did then to mean, that MAP should be used when a new
  element was required to achieve grouping; not as the grouping element in
  all cases.

  Here is a source of a lot of the confusion.  I misread which techniques
  document you were addressing.  I meant to say that the WCAG Techniques was
  the baseline and WCA should be asked if we are going to recommend something
  at variance with that.
