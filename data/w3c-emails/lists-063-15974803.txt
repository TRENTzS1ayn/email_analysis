Another possiblity s to provide a downloadable version of the tool itself. I
believe that the validator is available from W3C CVS, but that requires some
technical skill to set up.

  A major area of concern for federal webmasters has been the analysis
  tools' inability to evaluate Intranet pages.   The HTML Validator tool
  developed by the W3C (Gerald Oskoboiny) recently added an option to
  allow files to be uploaded from the user's computer.

  Adding this functionality could provide a way to have people save a
  Intranet page to their local PC.   The only potential obstacle to this
  would be if an organization's firewall won't allow this.   How feasible
  is it for other analysis tools to provide this same type of capability?
