Technically that wouldn't be too difficult to set up, though it's not quite
as simple as "just upload the file". However, the danger of overwhelming our
server's traffic and disk space is a major deterrent, and we aren't likely
to do it ourselves with Bobby. For this among many other reasons, we
recommend the downloadable version when possible. Michael

Subject: Analyzing Intranet Pages


A major area of concern for federal webmasters has been the analysis
tools' inability to evaluate Intranet pages.   The HTML Validator tool
developed by the W3C (Gerald Oskoboiny) recently added an option to
allow files to be uploaded from the user's computer.

Adding this functionality could provide a way to have people save a
Intranet page to their local PC.   The only potential obstacle to this
would be if an organization's firewall won't allow this.   How feasible
is it for other analysis tools to provide this same type of capability?
