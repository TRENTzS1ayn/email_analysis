In reponse to these messages, I've made additional changes to the new version of
the Check Your Page tool.   This latest version is providing links to the
Authoring Tool and User Agent guidelines.

While under development, it's only available through the direct link to the
form:
http://w3.gsa.gov/web/m/cita.nsf/YourPage4?OpenForm

There's been a lot of confusion among the federal webmaster community about
whether the HTML Validator should be used to determine accessibility, so I
removed this as a link.   We're attempting to make this tool provide guidance on
a "Level 1 Review" per my May message to the EOWG:
