Unless it's using SSL to upload the page (and return the contents),
any federal sysadmin worth his salt is going to point out to you
the security problems in sending secret/non-public files across the
Internet, unencrypted.

A better solution is to set up your own local version of the validator
(or Bobby, or whatever) -- and as Chaalz pointed out, it's not easy to
do.
