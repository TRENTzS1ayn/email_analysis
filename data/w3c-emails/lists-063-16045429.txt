Kynn -
The security issue's been the major challenge for this aspect of our technical assistance requirement.
Certainly, pages considered secret/non-public are even more problematic, but we also have had many requests
to evaluate pages that are under development before they get posted to the web.   Some agencies have formal
procedures that can require hours to get new pages posted to the web.

For reference, I've raised this issue previously.   I'm glad to be receiving responses from this group, as
this issue is also being addressed by the EOWG.

Thanks,
Karl
