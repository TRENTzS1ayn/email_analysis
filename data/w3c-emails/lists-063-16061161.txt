Are not all these tools that run on servers also available to run on local
machines inside the firewall?

Bobby is, I believe most of the validators from W3C are available,
including even their source code, and most web authoring management tools
allow you to add, or have their own, tools.  For example IBM WebSphere
Studio allows for addition of tools.  The answer is not to put the pages
outside the firewall, but to put the tools inside the firewall and make
them part of you management and publishing process.  You could easily add a
few seconds to your "hours" process to get pages approved for publishing by
running Bobby internally before they go live.  Once they are live, you can
use linkbot, and all the measurement and analysis tools to monitor the web
site.  Tools like Bobby again can be added to the mix, generating reports
on accessibility along with hits, security, etc.
