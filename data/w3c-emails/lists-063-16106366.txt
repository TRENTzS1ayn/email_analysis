AG:: "So this issue involves both (WCA and/or PF) and UA at least.  And
ER for the AERT impact."

WL: Not to mention some Working Groups in the W3C.

I wonder if "navigation" is another category parallel to "content",
"presentation", and "structure" since it is a peculiarly hypertextish
entity with no precedent in the past like the others clearly have? - And
it is a frequent add-on to the "document proper"? A ToC is "structure"
but many "navbar" items relate to the site itself rather than the
contents thereof?
