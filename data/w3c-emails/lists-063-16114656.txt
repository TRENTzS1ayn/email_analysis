You are right, except that 'parallel' suggests too much independence.  It
is indeed yet another view or slice through the territory.  But it is
highly interdependent with the others, specifically a) structure; which is
by the way a property of content that transcends pages; and b) the
hyperlink-jump class of moving around within the web of content.

The point is that we are asking for more of "orienting and navigable
structure" than the hyperlinks alone provide.  To look at navigation you
have to have the hyperlinks on the table, and to look at structure you have
to have sites on the table as well as the content categories returned by
poking the "more like this" button.

[All of which we will have to revisit when we get the intergroup process
defined.]
