JRG: The UA group has not been as a group particularly interested in having 
a separate checkpoint(s) for access to markup that is used to indicate 
navigational links.  But that was before we have been working on the 
minimal requirements for each checkpoint.  It maybe of some interest in UA 
to discuss this again.  But I hesitate do to the current number of open 
issues the group is trying to resolve.

JRG: The use of TITLE in XML was not discussed.  My understanding that for 
XML is that the use of schemas will allow links to be identified as 
navigational links.  I don't know a lot about schemas, so I am trusting the 
people who are advocating this approach to future needs for indicating 
navigational links.

JRG: MAP was the markup identified in HTML to indicate a group of 
navigational links.

JRG: Markup for non-HTML technologies would be of interest to the UA group.
