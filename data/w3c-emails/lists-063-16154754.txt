Ian,
A requirement in the UA guidelines (if any) would be a special case 
checkpoints of checkpoint 7.6.  Two potential checkpoints would deal with 
directly moving to the list of navigation links and/or skipping them.  For 
example:

"Provide one step access to the collection of links that have been 
identified by the author for navigation [Priority 3]"

"Provide a one step to skip a collection of navigational links that have 
been identified by the author [Priority 3]"

The reference to MAP would be in the techniques document as the best way to 
indicate a collection of navigational links in HTML.  The UAAG techniques 
document could just reference the WCAG techniques on this issue.  Other 
markup languages would have other techniques.

Jon
