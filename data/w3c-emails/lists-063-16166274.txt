The UA issues list includes a new issue 303 [1]. This issue will
involve a proposal to list explicitly for checkpoint 7.6 those
elements in HTML 4 we mean. This list would include MAP. Therefore,
I don't think a new checkpoint is necessary since the user can
get to the MAP as part of structured navigation. I don't know why
one-step navigation to a MAP is more important than one-step 
navigation to H1s.

This is also part of checkpoint 7.6 as is since you can simply move
to the next main element away from the MAP.
