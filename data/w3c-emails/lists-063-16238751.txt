The WAI schematron thingy is pretty interesting,
and today I was dealing with a collaborator
whose page is just unacceptably inaccessable,
and I wanted to point them to WAI validator.
I wasn't really happy with the output of Bobby,
and I didn't see much else in the way of
online services, so I took Rick J's WAI/schematron
stuff and made it into a forms-based service:

A Web Content Accessibility Checking Service (ALPHA)

It needs work... the WAI schematron stuff isn't really
complete. But it's at a point where I think other
folks could benefit from it. Share and enjoy.
