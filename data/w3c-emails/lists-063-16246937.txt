(this topic has been distributed among a few recent threads but I'll insert 
my 2 cents into this branch)

As for using MAP to define sets of links... there's a problem...

What happens if you have a link hierarchy, e.g. a series of headings each 
of which  is a link, and each of which has a list of links 
underneath  (e.g. the Yahoo home page).  How does map apply?

If we wrap the whole thing in a single map, we lose the hierarchy and 
flatten it all into one pile of links

Can we wrap the whole thing in a MAP, and then also wrap each indivisual 
list in a MAP? No can do.

For one thing, it doesn't validate... either by my reading of HTML 4.01 or, 
more importantly, by the w3c validator.

And even if it did validate, what would it mean?

It seems the way to address this is to use DIV's and existing structure 
(cf. Al's remarks at

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2000Jul/0032.html

Otherwise we lose the structure.

Now, that leaves the problem that the semantics, viz that this is "a set of 
links", is not machine readable.  But even if we had MAP, there would still 
be plenty of semantics that are not readable.  For example, if we had a 
page with lots of sets of links, where's the main navigation bar?  And 
there are other semantic units that have nothing to do with links.... e.g. 
"main section" "news" etc. that we often see. So MAP would address only a 
part of all the semantics that are needed anyway.  That means we do one of 
the following, seems to me:

1. waiting for XML
2. defining conventions for class names  (hey, we accept D links)
3. defining conventions for titles  (well, I gotta have a third alternative)

As you might guess, my vote is for 2, defining conventions for class 
names.  I realize this was discussed in WCAG and it didn't fly, but perhaps 
it's time to reconsider.

Note that even if we wait for XML, that just postpones deciding on the 
semantic units.  So why not figure them out now, stick them in class for 
the time being, and then re-use them when XML arrives.
