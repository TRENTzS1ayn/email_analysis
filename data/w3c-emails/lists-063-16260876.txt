Dear WCAG

where it says in 10.1

Until user agents allow users to turn off spawned windows, do not cause 
pop-ups or other windows to appear and do
            not change the current window without informing the user. 
[Priority 2]

Does this mean

a. Do not cause popups to appear, period or
b. Do not cause popups to appear without informing the user.

For example, if a popup springs up and the first line says "... Sorry to 
interrupt you but I'm a new popup, ." (We might want to make the line 
invisible by the usual tricks).

is that OK, since you've informed the user?

in other words it depends on how you parse the sentence:

a. do not cause pop-ups or other windows to appear and (do not change the 
current window without informing the user)
vs.
b. (do not cause pop-ups or other windows to appear and do not change the 
current window) without informing the user.

Personally, I hope the answer is (b) cause popups are actually useful at 
times.  If it is (b), we have another tweak in AERT 10.1....
