Put a MAP around nested UL lists.

I don't think that that's an option. XML is already here. We need
to do the right thing for XML. I think the question is what to do
for HTML.

D-links don't require anything from the user agent. But asking user
agents to recognize classes that are not defined in the HTML
specification
is problematic to me. It could be done - the UA Guidelines could require
that conforming user agents handle some predefined classes in a special
way - but I think that the HTML spec is the appropriate place for this
type of information.

Here's a nice HTML trick that works with Lynx:
Define links to key parts of a page with the LINK element

    <link rel="start" href="#headline" title="Go to headline |"/>
    <link rel="contents" href="#contents" title="Go to table of contents
|"/>
    <link rel="index" href="#search" title="Search"/>

   Lynx renders these as links, but they do not show up on most
   graphical browsers. Thus the author can create skip-over links
   even if the UA doesn't support structured navigation to or
   past groups of links.
