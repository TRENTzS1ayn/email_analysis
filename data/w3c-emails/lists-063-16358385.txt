Ian replied:

Yes, the outermost only is what I meant. That may
not be sufficient for deep nested lists. But authors
should probably avoid long lists of links anyway.

Actually, it doesn't even work for one level of nesting... like I 
mentioned, map inside map is an HTML 4.01 syntax error.

I think there are reasonable uses of nested links, e.g. subject headings 
and a few links under each heading, which is a very common idiom in 
portals.  It's also arguably an accommodation for people with motor 
disabilities since it reduces mouse clicks.   So I don't think we can 
ignore this limitation of map.
