I'll be on the WAI Advisory Council conference call at the same time so will
have to miss this one.

Next telecon: Monday, July 24 10:00 Eastern USA Time (GMT -05:00) on the 
MIT bridge (+1 617-258-7910)


Agenda: I'd suggest we discuss

1. grouping, especially of links, which has generated a lot of list traffic 
recently.

Any other suggestions?

If not, we can plan to go to 11:00 instead of 11:30.
