This is where we meet the crossing point between Al's primary point - that
one can navigate structurally any kind of structure, and that allows valuable
treatment of complex sets of links - and mine - that for a collection of
links which are for navigation and are related in their purpose, the
appropriate HTML element to wrap around the block content is map.

The map should go around the lot, to identify that this is just a collection
of links (and it would be handy to ahve a title to help decide whether or not
to skip it). The links should then be given whatever additional structure is
going to be useful and helpful (nesting in lists, etc).

just my 2 bits worth - cheers

  Yes, the outermost only is what I meant. That may
  not be sufficient for deep nested lists. But authors
  should probably avoid long lists of links anyway.
  
  Actually, it doesn't even work for one level of nesting... like I 
  mentioned, map inside map is an HTML 4.01 syntax error.
  
  I think there are reasonable uses of nested links, e.g. subject headings 
  and a few links under each heading, which is a very common idiom in 
  portals.  It's also arguably an accommodation for people with motor 
  disabilities since it reduces mouse clicks.   So I don't think we can 
  ignore this limitation of map.
