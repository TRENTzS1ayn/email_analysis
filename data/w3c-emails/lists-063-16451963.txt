It looks to me that technique 6.3.1 (verify that the page is usable when
programmatic objects are disabled) is covered by technique 1.1 (Provide a
text equivalent for every non-text element). The specific techniques are:

1.1.4 [priority 1] Check APPLET elements...
1.1.5 [priority 1] Check OBJECT elements...
1.1.10 [priority 1] Check SCRIPT elements...

If we have a text equivalent for the programmatic object then the page is
usable when the programmatic object is disabled.

Make sense?

Chris
