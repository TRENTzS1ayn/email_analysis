More or less. The requirement is that the function can be performed (I
haven't checked yet and I don't recall off the top of my head).

  It looks to me that technique 6.3.1 (verify that the page is usable when
  programmatic objects are disabled) is covered by technique 1.1 (Provide a
  text equivalent for every non-text element). The specific techniques are:
  
  1.1.4 [priority 1] Check APPLET elements...
  1.1.5 [priority 1] Check OBJECT elements...
  1.1.10 [priority 1] Check SCRIPT elements...
  
  If we have a text equivalent for the programmatic object then the page is
  usable when the programmatic object is disabled.
  
  Make sense?
