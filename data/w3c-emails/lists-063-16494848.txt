Sometimes you need more than a text equivalent to make a page usable with 
programmatic objects are disabled.

For example, if a form uses a button that triggers javascript, then when 
you turn off javascript you will need to have a SUBMIT button instead.

This often comes up when the javasrcript is used to verify the 
fields.  This means then when you replace it with the submit button, that 
field verification has to be moved to the server, e.g. to a CGI 
script  (this is something a good programmer would want to do anyway).   So 
the user really has to check server functionality here.

(In principle, we'd want the tool to check the server code, probably by 
black box testing.  If we don't get into that now, perhaps we should add a 
section to point out explicity that we're not getting into this.
