Description
CrushPop is a tool that will rid your browsing experience of pop-up 
windows. This program works on and off the Internet and is powerful enough 
to close any program or window on your computer. It will also show you 
everything that is hidden and running on your system. This program features 
drag-and-drop functionality, so it is easy to use.
In this updated version, CrushPop can block Web sites by keywords as well 
as by titles or URLs. An optional log file can be set to keep track of what 
has been crushed so that you can find out if someone attempted to access 
something they shouldn't have.
Note: This update is more useable with Netscape, and bugs have been fixed.
