Hi Michael,

Been looking at at Bobby 3.2 .  The wording of the requirements for bobby 
approval is a lot better. I think it should take care of people overlooking 
the manual checks.  Also, the bobby output is displayed against a white 
background, overriding the background image, which gets rid of that problem 
that bobby output was sometimes invisble against the background .  Plus the 
output is generally simpler and cleaner looking and has a nice shortcut bar 
to the various parts of the report.Those are just the most obvious 
enhancements, I'm sure there are many more.

Found a bad link though...  the icons guideline page 
http://www.cast.org/bobby/icon.html is not found.

Also, I'm still concerned that it doesn't ask the user to check the 
accuracy of ALT text.  It's still possible to get bobby approved with alt 
text that doesn't match the images.    I know this concerns you too, and 
you're balancing this against other factors, but for me checking alt text 
overrides other factors.
