I agree with what I think Len is saying... We should require text
equivalents of programmatic objects, in order to ensure that _content_ is
available. We also need to require that any _functionality_, such as
navigation, be available if the object does not run. Depending on the
object, that second point may or may not apply, and we may or may not be
able to suggest a way to check for it automatically.

For example, a script doing a mouseover image switch, in which the image
just changes color or something so the ALT text doesn't get invalidated,
already has alternative content (the image's alt text) and doesn't need
anything else to happen if it doesn't run - they hyperlink will still work.
By contrast, a Flash splash screen that has an animated company logo can
have some sort of text equivalent associated with it, but if it requires you
to interact with the object on order to get to the next page, and there are
no other links on the page, we have a problem.

In my personal opinion, yes, we still need 6.3.1.  Text equivalents are not
enough.

Do other folks agree?
