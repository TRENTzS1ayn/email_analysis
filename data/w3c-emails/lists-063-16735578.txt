That's not my reading of the spec:

"name: This attribute assigns a name to the image map 
       defined by a MAP element."

One use of this name value is to be the value of the
usemap attribute on another element. But name may serve
other purposes (e.g., it could be used in scripting).

I don't see a contradiction. "Usemap" is one consumer
of MAP/name.

Again, I don't see a contradiction. But it might be little clearer:
If your A elements are associated with an image, then specify
the geometric reasons. Authors aren't required to put in geometries.
Most of this section is about image maps, so the language is
tailored towards that application of MAP, AREA, and A. 
But, the following sentence clearly indicates that an image
is not required:

  "The MAP element may be used without an associated image for
   general navigation mechanisms."
