I think I have not been clear.

When I said only the 'scavenger' was a fit subject for research,
it was not because the editor plugin is not desirable.  It is
just so clearly desirable that our friends at the University of
Toronto already have it under development.  No need for research
to demonstrate the utility.

Please check over the minutes from the last ER WG telephone
conference for a little information on what projects are underway
and expected in this area.
