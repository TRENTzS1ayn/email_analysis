LRK:: personally speaking, I'd certainly agree with that.

What I was asking was whether research was required to design the specific
user interface for a tool to add ALT text.  Marja raised some potential
research issues.

Here's some thoughts on some issues Marja raised:

LRK:: I think that, since this could be offered as a standalone tool for
fixing a web page via human intervention, it could fall within the scope of
er-ig's work.

One variable is the number of people designing the page.  Is there just one
"designer"?  Or a team, with different people responsible for overall
story, art, text copy, like in the print advertising industry.  If it's a
team, how would we facilitate collaborative work?

LRK:: One way to research this is to take a best shot and do usability
testing with actual users.

Al, or Chris, could you tell us if these features are already planned?
That would open usability testing.  Alternatively, there are various levels
of prototyping.
