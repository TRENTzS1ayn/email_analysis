Thanks Al for the A-prompt info in Chris's email. That email says to get
the URL from chris by sending email to 

chris.ridpath@utoronto.ca

That's to keep it private.  Since the archives for this group is public, I
assume that we'll need to follow that procedure instead of posting the URL
on this email list.

Right, Chris?
