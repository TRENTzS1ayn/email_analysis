Can somebody bridge me (Switerland) in as well? Last time Daniel (France)
did so.

My Phone number NEW is: +41 (021) 617 74 53

We have electricians working on the phones tomorrow. In case you don't get
through, or no "Michael" is around, just forget about and don't try too
long.

Thanks!!!!

Michael
