Here's the agenda for our teleconference

Wed., Nov, 4th, 4-6 pm EST  (i.e. Boston Time)

There are at least 7 major ER-WG areas of work now in the discussion,
planning, or implementation stages.  They are listed at the end of this
email, along with some of the issues they raise.  If I've missed any,
please post to the list.

Agenda

1. Spend 5-10 minutes on each area, discussing:

  a. How shall we identify and resolve issues?
     (e.g. expert advice; surveys; simulations)

  b. Who will provide advice
     (e.g. Us, expert users, naive users, individual web authors, authoring
teams)
     and how shall we obtain that advice

2. Find out  who is interested in dealing with which projects

3. Find out who would like to volunteer to be editor on each.

4. Plan 
    next steps
    next meetings

Work Areas

1. The web report form.

Last message to this list was

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/1998Aug/0024.html

Daniels's draft form is at http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/report

- Do we as a group have consensus that this is a useful tool?
- Do we have additional suggestions for improvement?
- Is there a way to test some of the concepts with users?
- In addition to sending reports to webmasters, should reports be made
public?

2. Bottom Line evaluation.
see e.g. David's comments at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/1998Sep/0007.html

 - What are minimum  requirement for "pass"?
    Is starting point a count of requirements passed/failed?
    or is starting point something like  . "usable with Lynx"

3. ALT text inserters for users

This concerns tools that try to supply ALT text and other text equivalents
when they are missing from web page.

  Daniel's  features are at http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/text-equiv.htm
  Michael's plan for author- and user- oriented tools are in his mail at
     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/1998Nov/0007.html

  - How can we contribute to this effort?
    e.g. apply by hand to "typical" pages?

4. ALT text inserters for authors
   Michael's plan listed above
   A-Prompt (URL available from chris.ridpath@utoronto.ca)
   Marja's suggestions at 
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/1998Nov/0000.html

5. Audio browsing simulators
  e.g. Al's note at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/1998Sep/0023.html

  - What would value of this tool be?, e.g. compared with viewing via Lynx?
  - Feature design?

6. Tables.

   According to comments from some folks in Peterborough, tables cause
major difficulty once alternative text is taken care of, since the spatial
organization of tables conveys information.

   Recommendations for browsing tables in the UA guidelines. e.g. in the
working draft

  http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19980814.html#Alt-tables
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19980814.html#Nav-tables

  Some of this functionality can be provided by filters to current day
browsers.
  See thread "simulating output of transform tools"  at
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/1998Oct/subject.html#start

7. Heristics tests for "good" ALT text
   thread "Heuristic tests not in Guidelines" at 

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/1998Oct/subject.html#start
   - syntactic rules, e.g. warn Null ALT text for pure IMG link
   - semantic rules, e.g.  warn concrete ALT text for pure IMG link
   - punctuation rules, e.g. terminate ALT text with (.)
