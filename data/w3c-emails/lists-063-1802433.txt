Daniel's report form at
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/report>http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/report

Sheet 2, the report about a URL cannot be put on that URL itself.

The alternative is to provide a standard place that all the reviews
can be put.

How do we find the webmaster to send the report notifications.

Each report needs to identify the date or version of the URL, in case
it is updated.

The fixer should have the ability to return a message indicating
the attempts made to fix the URL.

Regards/Harvey
