Hi Keith,

Today I did some testing with the TOM tool and want to give you some feedback.
I find that TOM only works on what I called here simple webpages, but not
on more complex pages including IMAGE MAPS. 
At the webpage http://www.ns.nl/reisinfo/start.asp
you can plan you travel by train. There are to IMAGE MAPS on this page. One
at the top left and one at the bottom right. 
After entering the URL in the TOM tool I can fill the ALT tag for some
images and the descriptions for the client side map. I can not fill
descriptions for the image map (buttonbar) at the bottom right of the
document.
After processing the TOM form (I checked add alt tags) an document results
that is not accessible at all.
ALT tags are added to the client side map, but I don't see them at all.
This is because my Netscape 4.5 browser does not support HTML 4 I think. 
After saving the page and changed the relative URLs to absolute URLs I see
no image map at all? But this maybe caused by not loading the document from
the original server.
I think it is better to change such image maps in unnumbered lists?

The buttonbar <INPUT TYPE=IMAGE SCR="image.gif" has an ALT tag, but the
IMAGE is a image map itself.
