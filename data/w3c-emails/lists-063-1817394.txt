Two points:
Point 1:
"ALT tags are added to the client side map, but
I don't see them at all. This is because my Netscape 4.5 
browser does not support HTML 4 I think."

ALT is a required attribute for AREA elements already 
in HTML3.2. So this has little to do with support 
to HTML4.0.

Point 2: 
Concerening INPUT type=image, it can operate like 
a server side image map, then there is no HTML 
mechanism to give alt text to the different regions. 

Making INPUT type=image a client side map 
is possible only with HTML4.0.
