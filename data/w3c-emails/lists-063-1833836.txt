I think I understand the confusion.

[http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/rep2 is an optional step that lists relevant
URLs already entered in the system so that the reporter can decide
whether or not a new one is needed.]

Although they looked like they do, the "existing report" links do not
point to the URL itself but to a report area, still to be defined,
likely to be an mailing list archive, ala:

 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-report/OctNov98/0017.html
 
I made some changes in the wording to make it clearer.

Yes, I could add a pointer to the archive on this step.

I changed step3 so that the tool tries to guess it and presents it to
the user in an edit field.

Doesn't the date of the report (email archived) suffice ?

Just replying the report email should do it:

  From: w3c-wai-report@w3.org
  To: webmaster@offender.com
  cc: reporter@foo.com, w3c-wai-report@w3.org
  Subject: WAI Report - www.offender.com/page
  -------

and replies give

  From: webmaster@offender.com
  To: w3c-wai-report@w3.org
  cc: reporter@foo.com
  Subject: Re: WAI Report - www.offender.com/page
  -------

which goes to the list archive/forum of discussion.
