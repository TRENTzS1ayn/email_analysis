Yes, you are right. Someone on another list gives me the
http://www.teleport.com example and TOM seems to work fine there. 
TOM works not well on the example I gave at
http://www.ns.nl/reisinfo/start.asp. TOM removes the client side map from
the page and also a lot of other images on that page. 
I thin a bug in the tool.

There are a  lot of IMAGE MAPS without <AREA>, most of them .gif files with
more options. Is the information about the URL in the image? 
I thin it is important to make also these kind of maps accessible, because
they seem very popular.
