Hi, Peter,

Thanks for your feedback.  First for the "disappearing image" problem.
Were you running Tom in add mode or replace mode?  Remember that the
intent of replace mode is to totally strip out all images and make a
text-only page.  Add mode will add alt tags, but leave the images in the
page.  You'll want to use add mode.

With your image map, I have actually never seen that type of
construction used before.  That can be added fairly easily, though.  Tom
is trained with client-side imagemaps created with the "usemap"
attribute to the <IMG> tag.

I appreciate your feedback very much!  Remember, Tom is a work in
progress.  My studies and other activities have pulled me away from
development of Tom over the past few months, but I'm still keeping a
running wishlist.  I'll add these to it.  I hope I can get back in to
the project soo, as well as find others who can also help.

Thank you!

Keith
