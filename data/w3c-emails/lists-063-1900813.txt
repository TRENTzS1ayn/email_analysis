One thing that I have been wondering with Web documents, images etc. is if it
would be valuable to be able to have alternate descriptions attached to the
actual objects.

In some cases it would be good if the site would have a database containing
the
descriptions of the common stuff such as company logos etc. So that user's
don't have to write them time after time.

If the alternate descriptions were attached to the object, it could
function as
a default that can be then be changed by authors in different contexts. For
instance,? image with a globe has description "An iconized globe showing
Americas" and when it is used as a icon to global environmental issues the
author changes it with ALT text to "Global environmental issues."
