Yes.

Briefly:

PNG has such a capability (embed metadata in the image file).

RDF is in general viewed as how we would standardize the data
dictionary and/or information model for the information to be
bound in in that way.

There have been proposals for filename conventions to put
metadata in parallel files but I think that is not reliable
enough.

Host capabilities to annotate persistent objects will vary among
hosts.  That is why to create an abstract information model and
let author tools and servers query the persistent metadata via
physical methods that are localized to the host.  Consider the
metadata capabilities of Hierarchical Storage Management
products.  

Yes it would be better.  The author tools do some of this in
a limited way already with tool-peculiar databases of ALT/image
pairs, all uses of a common URI-reference, etc.

But the full systematization is in the future and we need an
approach to defining information coverage requirements that is not
dependent on the developers choice of persistent data technology.
