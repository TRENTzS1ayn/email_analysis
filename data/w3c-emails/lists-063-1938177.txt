I get last-change headers when I do a HEAD request of the server.
If the complaint-processing site is going to run a Bobby report
it has robot functions on the back end.  It might even be good to
do a HEAD request on the server as a sanity check on the URL
before calling Bobby to look at it.  That way you can get a
version stamp for when you ran the analysis.  You probably want
to log more stuff from the dialog.  What browser was the user
using?
