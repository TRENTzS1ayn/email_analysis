I think we should very well explain to the public 
why these guys are wrong:

http://webbuilder.netscape.com/Authoring/HtmlValid/ss06.html

To make a long story short, they claim that real validators are
bad because they find errors that other "validators" let them get 
away with. They say its bad because "both" Netscape and 
explorer "support" these errors (invalid nestings, not escaped 
ampresands in URLs, unquoted attributes etc.). 

The bottom line is that they recommend using 
mediocre checkers and not to use validators.
