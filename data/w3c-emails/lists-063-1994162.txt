Yes, it's true that the validator shouldn't be criticized for being "overly
strict", but there's another point they also make, that the error messages
are cryptic:

When tag attributes aren't surrounded by quotes, W3C reports
"An attribute value must be a literal unless it contains only name
characters." Ampersands in URLs (technically a no-no, though
quite common) are met with cryptic "General entity not defined"
reports.
