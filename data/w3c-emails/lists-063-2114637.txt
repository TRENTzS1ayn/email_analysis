Hello

> PNG has such a capability (embed metadata in the image file).

PNG and to my knowledge GIF as well can store comments/descriptions. Anyone
has/knows of a simple library to extract/store this into PNG/GIF? A link or
doc would be appreciated for my project.

> RDF is in general viewed as how we would standardize the data

Al, what is RDF?

I would like to remind http://www.w3.org/WAI/altserv.htm which presents ONE
idea of how a central storage for image descriptions could look like.

Marja, the tool/project I am working on (specification to be published for
discussion here soon) will have this possibility; a simple side-wide ALT
database, basically just a textfile with mapping IMG-SRC to ALT, and the
ability to put the given ALT automatically into all IMG occurences of your
site, for you as an HTML author.

Regards,
Michael
