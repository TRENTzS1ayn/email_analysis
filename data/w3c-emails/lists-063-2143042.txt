We have wrestled with the difficulty of coming up with a
high-level (e.g. bottom line) certification standard.  I still
think we may not be ready for that.

On the other hand, if we ask "Are there incremental ratings that
could be supported?" I think the answer is yes.

An example is the rollover highlight done by a script.

Aside from avoiding seizure-provoking frequencies, it is quite
likely that this class of behavior is benign.

We can't yet inject a pragma into the scripting environment which
will insure that all scripts written with that pragma on are OK.

But we can certainly look at some scripts and say that they are
OK.

If the "behavior sheet" submission to the W3C is adopted or
replaced with some other behavior-reuse capability, then it would
be useful to have example behaviors available for public use
which have been reviewed and approved for their benign impact on
accessibility.

Are there other examples of classes of site-building preforms
that could be rated with some confidence for some performance
factor that matters?
