The er working group needs our input on a number of issues.  I've attached
a summary of main issues to date. I'd like to arrange a teleconference to
proceed.

Please post to this list your current thoughts on the issues listed below
and any other important issues I omitted.

Also, please send to me kasday@acm.org (*not* to the list)  what times are
good are bad for you for a teleconference on and after Oct. 26.

Here are issues that have been discussed on this list (in chronological order)

1. The web report form.  

Last message to this list was 

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/1998Aug/0024.html

Daniels's draft form is at http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/report

- Do we as a group have consensus that this is a useful tool?
- Do we have additional suggestions for improvement?
- Is there a way to test some of the concepts with users?
- In addition to sending reports to webmasters, should reports be made public?

2. Bottom Line evaluation.
see e.g. David's comments at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/1998Sep/0007.html

 - What are minimum  requirement for "pass"?
    Is starting point a count of requirements passed/failed?
    or is starting point something like  . "usable with Lynx" 

3. Textual Equivalents 

This concerns tools that try to supply ALT text and other text equivalents
when they are missing from web page.

  Daniel's  features are at http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/text-equiv.htm

  - How can we determine value of various approaches?  
     e.g. apply by hand to "typical" pages?

4. Audio browsing simulators
  e.g. Al's note at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/1998Sep/0023.html

  - What would value of this tool be?, e.g. compared with viewing via Lynx?
  - Feature design?

5. Tables.

   According to comments from some folks in Peterborough, tables cause
major difficulty once
   alternative text is taken care of, since the spatial organization of
tables conveys information.

   Recommendations for browing tables in the UA guidelines. e.g. in the
working draft

  http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19980814.html#Alt-tables
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19980814.html#Nav-tables

  Can we provide some of this functionality to people using current day
browsers?

   (I'll be giving some suggestions on this in subsequent email)
