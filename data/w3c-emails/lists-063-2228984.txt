Concerning textual equivalents:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/text-equiv.htm

Two more attributes that may used for creating
textual equivalents are ID and CLASS.
Clearly ID with higher priority since it is 
document-wide unique.

In regard to the NAME attribute, it is not defined 
for IMG in HTML4.0 (or any other W3C/IETF spec.)
It is used though to address the IMG element by client side
scripts in older browsers who do not recognize ID.
Ofcourse it may be used to create a textual equivalent
by a program that recognizes it.
