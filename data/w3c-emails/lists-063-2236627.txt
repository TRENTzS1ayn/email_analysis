You mean something like "onload" performs some  document.write("<BODY>...")

Yes this is really bad, and people are doing it.

To me, a "repair" tool is one that is used by the page author (or
maintainer), so what you describe is a possible repair tool, although
I'm not sure it is feasible (i.e. how does it determine the "onload"
leads to idempotent/unvariable bits)

What's certainly feasible is a "proxy" tool, doing the "onload" (and
all other non-interactive events) dynamically on behalf of the final
user-agent.
