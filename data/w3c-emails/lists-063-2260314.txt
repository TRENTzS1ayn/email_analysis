As you noticed, I'm now leaning toward a "stepped" version of the report.

I also maintain a open-issue page for this report form: 
   http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/rep-issues.html

I think so.

probably more coming in

yes, a trial with this forum for instance.

I think so. I want to use a simple w3c public mailing list where
reports are cced and where webmaster and reporters can discuss their
points.

Whatever tool is going to use these techniques should make its best
effort to offer as many choices to the user as possible without
damaging/loading the setup interface. One should be able to select
what default operational mode is desired and then select
alternative/override techniques as it moves on.

My student Eric has been working on a TABLE linearizer and I hope to
come up soon with a demo online.
You can read some ideas about it in http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/WG/tablin.txt
