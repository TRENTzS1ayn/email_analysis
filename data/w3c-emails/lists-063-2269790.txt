I've also been working and thinking about table linearizer filter that
would provide a batch service (by opposition to something done in the
UA environment), and you went a step further in providing a solution
for the "no interaction" issue (i.e. not being able to navigate the
table cell by cell and changing orientation as it goes).

My ideas (exposed at http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/WG/tablin.txt) are to
offer a default setup and then ways to override that at the level of
each *TABLE* in a document, not at the level of the cell, as you
propose to doing it.

We will need user input as to which one is really useful (e.g. they
might be too many extra step in your solution, maybe not, maybe it can
be worked out in a simpler way)

In any case, I think both can be implemented in the same tool, i.e. in
addition to "orientation" and "repetition", one could add "navigation"
as a parameter of a TABLE linearizer.
