I think we must distinguish batch transforms of a whole document,
which are then processed by UA navigation methods, from
interactive applications which support thing like table
navigation.

It is very hard to evaluate the latter from static mockups.  An
active prototype is pretty much required.  The essense of
navigation is the closed-loop process alternating read and move
steps.
