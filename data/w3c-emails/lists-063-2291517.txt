Absolutely! I'm also concerned about the number of steps.  E.g. if you're
going across a row, you can't simple hit a key to go down the column.  You
have to press return to get to menu, tab to get to column navigation, and
then return again to get back to the table, then tab to continue.

return tab return tab

(we could lose that extra tab by moving you to next cell by default).

On the other hand, it does give the functionality, maybe there isn't that
much need to change direction, and maybe a skilled user might get used to
that so it becomes automatic.  Also, there's the possibilities of using a
keyboard macro package... tho that starts to get klugy.

And maybe there's a simpler paradigm...

We definitely need actual users and actual tables.
