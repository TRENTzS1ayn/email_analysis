Ah, but it's not a static mockup.  Even though it is just a single web
page, it does offer full navigation, left/right and up/down, by making the
cell entries links to menus that switch you to another version of table on
the page.

The cost of this technique, as Daniel implied and as I elaborated on in my
last email, is that it takes more keystrokes than what could be built into
a user agent.
