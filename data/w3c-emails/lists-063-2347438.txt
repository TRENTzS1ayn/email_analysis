Hi,

I only read the WAI document about how to make websites accessible.
I have given some webmasters the URL to that document, but a lot of them
feel it is to much information. So I'm very interested in this group.
It is no problem for me to translate english documents in to Dutch, but if
they are very large it cost me too much time.

Thank you.
Regards Peter Verhoeven
