Hi Peter,

The report form that Al was referring to is at

http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/rep1

We'd very much like to hear what you think of it.

It's part of an effort within WAI, "Evaluation and Repair" (ER) to create 
tools to help evaluate web pages,  
tools to help webmasters make their pages more accessible, 
and tools, such as proxy tools, to transform existing web pages into forms
more friendly to screen readers, by techniques such as adding ALT text,
linearizing tables, etc.

This effort has in turn two groups, a working group (Chair, Daniel
Dardailler) which will create the tools, and an interest group (Chair, Len
Kasday) that will help the working group decide what to implement.  By the
way, this interest group is called wai-er-ig and is different from the
general wai interest group, wai-er that most people are on.

For more information, see

The call for participation at
