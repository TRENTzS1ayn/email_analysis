It's not just "nicer" to have just one version, it's the only method
that scales for the Web.

Our job is to help them reach that point faster. You're giving up too
soon :-)

The issue is not the mechanism to find the alternate page, it's the
duplication process involved, which leads to
  - more work for the author (which mean they are likely to drop this part) 
  - likely divergence/out-of-date pages in the alternate site
  - more complex site management (mess of links from alternate pages going
    to graphical pages and the other way around)
  - each new media potentially needs a different alternate version 

Making a page accessibly also involve more work for the author, of
course, but it doesn't carry the other problems and as a bonus, the
end-user ends up controling the presentation.

Text-only links are bad to the extent where they teach people that the
only way to make their site accessible is by doubling their number of
pages.  But they are a viable solution for some people, so they are
addressed in the PA guidelines.

If it can be done automatically, why bother the author/webmaster, we
just need to integrate the tool in the user agent or in some user
proxy.
