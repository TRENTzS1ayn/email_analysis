Hi Michael,

The index.html seems accessible to me. So why translate it into text-only
version.

To make two versions of a website, graphical and text-only, cost to much
time and money on maintanance.
So I think this is not the way to go.

Maybe you are right, they are willing to make their website accessible if
the only thing they have to do is ONE click, but this doesn't work in
practice. The major problem with accessibility of webpages at this moment
is NOT there are graphics, but there are no ALT tags include with these
graphics. 
I think a tool that let webmasters interactively enter ALT tags has the
highest priority. If all graphics on the Internet has a good ALT tag and
image map were handled well, I think the Internet is more accessible and
there is no need for an alternative text-only version.
