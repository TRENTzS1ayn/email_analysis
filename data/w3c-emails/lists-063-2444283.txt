Good point.

In investigating which short form of Bobby report we attach to the
report, I think we should be careful to just report facts, and not
subjective judgement, ala "Congrat", etc. This way if Bobby doesn't
find anything, the Bobby report will "just" be empty.

It is optional, turned ON by default. Are you asking that it be turned
off by default ? It was off, but some people argued the other way and
that's why I changed it to be ON...
