Hello

  my semester at university (EPFL) started again and I have to chose a large
study project, 12h a week thing. I am interested to devote it to a WAI
related project, and need your advice for chosing between two ideas, as
Peter expressed that the real problem are missing ALT tags, not text-equiv.
Would you give first priority to:

- An ALTifier tool allowing to set ALT attributes? Key ideas: on a side-wide
basis, defining ALT once for an image, having it applied automatically to
each occurence on each page; indep of HTML authoring tool; quick run to set
default automatic ALT, using some heuristics; correct some common MS
FrontPage ALT mistakes, such as in automatically generated page banners and
HRs; platforms: Win with GUI and UNIX as CLI listimg/setalt commands.

or

- A TextOnly text-equiv filter as suggested earlier and on the phone
conference? Port to Java instead current C++ and working closely together
with Daniel's Table linearizer, maybe even Bobby's HTML library, should be
discussed. (Please note that I am NOT offended if you people tell me that a
text-equiv filter is not really needed at all, because we don't want
separate text-only pages. That's an opinion that was expressed in several
private mails.)

 I need to decide and present the project idea to my professor very soon,
ideally this week. Cannot wait until next phone conf Nov 4/5. Tx for
discussion here ASAP. Tx for your help!

Regards,
Michael

PS: Forburger is spelled with V, like in Vorburger; thank you all. ;-)
