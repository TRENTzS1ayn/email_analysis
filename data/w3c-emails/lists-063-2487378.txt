THIS one does, yes, at least kind of. Others less. If you look at index.html
in lynx, you will see [IMAGE] for the bullets etc. Other pages, for example
using frames, are not at all and a TextOnly (text-equiv) Filter could do
something about that and other things. Another idea I had recently, is
including a link to pdf2txt@adobe.com for PDF links. Or a warning before
binary links. -- Plus, TextOnly (text-equiv) page also loads faster, and
displays in EVERY browser, including hand-held small display thingies, not
just most recent 4.x. That's accessibility as well, isn't it?

If the tool is fully automatical, it does not cost any time. If the tool is
completely free, it does not cost any time. So I think this is the way to
go. :-)

Interesting point, please read next msg to the list where I suggest two
study projects.
