Hi Michael,

If it is possible to create a text-only filter I prefer such a filter. But
I think it is NOT possible. You can create such a filter for simple page
constructions. But how you want to create such a filter for webpages with a
lot of clickable images without ALT tags, with a lot of image maps, with
nested frame constructions, with HTML generated by CGI scripts? 
If all pages include ALT tags, image maps were handled well, CGI scripts
generate pages including ALT tags I think a text-only filter can work
unless it will not work for 100%.
If there are ALT tags, if image maps are handled well, if CGI scripts
generate pages including ALT tags the webpages are accessible for most
visually impaired people. After that a text-only filter can make it more
accessible for people with other handicaps or visual impaired people only
using speech to access. 
But I'm afraid most companies do not like such a text-only version, without
commercial banners, loading fast. They want there visitors read the
commercials and click on them. I'm visually impaired myself and have always
turned image loading on, because if I turned them off I get a lot of
accessible problems. If I see a website has a text-only version the first
thing I do is going there and never go back to the graphical version. This
because of the faster loading of text-only pages. What do you think sighted
people will do?
A text-only filter can be helpfull. I also often have problem to read the
text on an image because of a bad contrast. In such situations I move my
mouse over the image and read the ALT tag but because I use a high
magnification 
the width of the description is larger than my monitor screen.

In my opinion both tools can be very helpfull. But I prefer solving the ALT
tag problem first.
