First, for another choice, you can also look at
   http://www.w3.org/WAI/altserv.htm

Your first tool is a repair tool (to be used by the webmaster/author),
the second is a transform tool (to be used by the end-user).

Since we already have Chris (UToronto) and Michael Pieper (GMD)
started or about to start on repair tools, I would give priority to
the text-equiv filter.

In fact, since Michael Pieper and his team haven't started yet, it
would be a good time to start sharing more detailed
design/functionality ideas on the ER WG list about the ALTifier repair
tool you drafted in your message.

I think a text-equiv filter is needed, and I think we don't want
separate text-only pages :-)

That's because I think this filter should be used by the user
(integrated in the browser or a proxy of some kind), not the author.
