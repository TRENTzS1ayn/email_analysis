LRK::
Here's my personal opinion: Right now, there are so many pages on the web
that need ALT text, and so little chance that they will be fixed soon (or
maybe ever, although I hope that education will help that), that I agree on
the priority of the text equiv filter.

We will still need to figure out priority of the various techniques, e.g as
listed  in

http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/text-equiv

unless, of course, Michael plans to do them all <grin>.

Do other folks agree with priority of the text equiv?  And if so, how shall
we prioritize the various text equiv techniques?
