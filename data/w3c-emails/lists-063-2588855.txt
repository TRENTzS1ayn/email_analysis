Hello,
I remember that Adobe Systems has created an accessibility plug-in for
their Acrobat reader. It was a self-executable file that after
extraction was detected by the main program and appropriate changes
were implemented to the menus of the program and other components. If
a similar accesibility plug-in could be writen for each of teh
browsers and be installed on a person's computer, we could eliminate a
need for additional tags.
See what you all have to say,
Best regards,
Victor
