Hi Victor,

After reading all arguments I prefer a text filter that create a text
equivalent of a graphical page. 
Unless it solves not all accessibility problems, it solves a lot. 
It will help the disabled more on the short term than tools for adding alt
tags to images, because you have to ask webmasters to use these tools. I
know how much time it cost to contact all those webmasters.

I think the idea of a plug-in is a good idea. Is it also possible to add
plug-ins to browsers like Lynx and Net-Tamer?

Regards Peter Verhoeven
