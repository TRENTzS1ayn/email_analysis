The function that we most want integrated into browsers is the
one that says "submit the current [document | link] [to Bobby |
to the WAI trouble-reporting site]."  The transition from routine
browsing to diagnostic activity should not require the user to
manually type _two_ URLs.  Presently they must manually get to
Bobby and then manually enter the URL of the page they want
reviewed.

With a [simple | trivial] plugin, both of these URLs can be
remembered by the software and not need to be entered by the
user.
