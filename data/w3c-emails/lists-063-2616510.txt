My understanding of the original question was that the tool that the
webmaster would use would have the webmaster put in the ALT text explicitly
by hand whereas the alternative would use various heuristics many of which
would simply guess at the ALT text.  In other words, only the second one is
the scavenger.

So, question to Michael and others in er-wg who would be working on this...

  - Is is feasible to do every single feature?  Maybe yes, if different
    folks take up different parts.   On the other hand...

  - maybe not, in which case you you need priority input.  For example, if 
    several can be done very quickly, you'd presumably just do them.
    But if you have choice between two high effort features, then
    priority is needed.  

   So what are the large effort items?
