On the other hand, even if it is a relative url,
it will usually append "gif" or jpeg" (the only exception I've seen to this
is w3c <grin>)

It's also often good pracice to put all images in a separate directory.  So
a bullet could be something like

images/bullet.gif

This is an empirical question.  
- What do people on this list who regularly use screen readers think?
- would anyone like to include this in a user survey?

I'd suggest to the extent that users find this rarely useful, that we
stongly consider raising this to guidelines level at least as strong
recommendation in the "implementation" part.
