ASG::
I see.  Well, only the scavenger is a topic fit for research.
And the other function is covered with tasks already on the
books.  We have TOM today to do that, and the A-prompt that
Toronto is developing will be a step beyond that, and Pieper's
student will do something (with or without incorporating
A-prompt) along these lines.  

In the A-prompt camp, we are looking for better sources of
"nominations" or "sugested values" for the interactive author, so
that the process is fast, less error prone, and more people use
it.  That is where the text-equiv function comes into the
author-side implementation; but it still needs to be prototyped
and evaluated, and can be released for user-side application as a
workaround for all the authors that are not paying attention.

So I see application for the text-equiv techniques on both the
author and user side, and I see the author scenario encompassing
both automatic suggestions and manual judgement and rewording.
