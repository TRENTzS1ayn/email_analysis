Well, logically I have to agree with that, but, to reveal a personal bias
here, are there any cases where the automatic text would be as good as text
the author wrote him or herself, aside from 

- copying text link to a ALT text for image or image map area with same URL
- and visa versa of the above
- all-text image read by OCR (tho even there an error
  could produce a real knee slapper)

I'm worried that authors would get into habit of using the automatically
generated text in cases where it's inferior to what they could easily do
themselves.
