LRK::
(This is changed subject from a thread on a tool that helps authors insert
alt text vs. a tool that tries to automatically figure out the alt text.
Al  called the latter the "scavenger".)

Is a user interface and associated prompt that asks authors to insert ALT
text  also a subject for research?   Al's remark seems to suggest that it
isn't.

I'd especially like to hear from human factors folks on this one.
