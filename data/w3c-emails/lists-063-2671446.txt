I think, this is a good argument as well. If we start to rely on
automatic conversion tools, web designers will abandon accessibility
problems at all. At least if designers would give meaningful names to
their images, like help.gif or options.gif, one could try to guess the
content of the image by cutting off the extion of the file. I use this
technique  lot in an ttempt to guess the destination of the image on
the page.
Best regards,
Victor
