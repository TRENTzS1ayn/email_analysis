There are probably a lot of suggestions folks could make for improving
Bobby.  My recommendation is that ALT="" should be illegal inside <A
HREF...

Please check out:
http://www.dors.state.md.us/test.html

A totally inaccessible (but simple) page that flys through the W3C and
Bobby validators with no problems.  Even the verbose "Accessibility
Recommendations" and "Accessibility Questions" and "Accessibility Tips"
don't address what is the real problem with this page.

Please note that I haven't touched this page in a while.  The LONGDESC
is implemented incorrectly (not that the W3C validator complains).

Have other people designed pages to illustrate Bobby's short comings? 
The "Known Bugs" of the Bobby FAQ
(http://www.cast.org/bobby/bobbyfaq.html#sec4) is still blank...
