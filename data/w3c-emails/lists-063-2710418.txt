LRK:: I like that heuristic, but I think it needs to be a warning, not
absolutely illegal.  What if you have both an decorative icon and text that
are part of the same link.  For example

<A href="index.html">
   <IMG SRC="cutsie_doodad.gif" ALT=" ">
   Home.
</A>

Here, you want the sighted person to be able to click on
cutsie_doodad.gif,so it's inside the link, but you don't want to clutter
the screenreader with any ALT text about it at all.  (Tho I would argue for
a longdesc for people who do want a description of cutsie_doodad.gif).

Of course, if ALT=" " is the only thing inside a link then I'd agree that
it would be illegal.
