Hello. I am Gerhard Weber and teach computer science courses at the Harz
University in Germany. 

I have done a Ph.D. in computer science with a large tactile display in
1989 in Stuttgart, Germany. 
For a year I taught introductory courses on computer literacy at the
Overbrook School for the Blind in
Philadelphia using braille and speech in class. 

In project GUIB I have helped to create a screen reader for MS Windows
(now 
named WinDOTS from Papenmeier) and the X Window system. Until 96 I have
managed the EU
MATHS project to create a SGML based maths workstation with braille
andspeech. At the moment I am
involved in another EU project on printing tactile graphics as part of a
fax system 
for the blind.

My main concerns in joining this group are the "repair" of graphics and
of mathematics. 

Gerhard Weber
