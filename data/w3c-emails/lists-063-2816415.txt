This document describes techniques to be used by tools (browser,
proxy, converter) taking HTML as input (incomplete or othersize
inaccessible, IMG with no ALT, FRAME with no TITLE, etc) and trying to
come up with textual alternatives for all sort of visuals lacking
their native description.

I would like the ER IG to review and discuss it before I start sharing 
it with other groups in or outside W3C, like the WAP forum, who is
going to work on similar technique for wireless/mobile access to the
Web.
