> Comments interspersed IN CAPS

I'm not sure I caught all your comments, since I also used CAPS myself
for most element/attrib names... Please tell me.

> * IMAGE LOCATION (ie masthead usually centered at top)

Can you give a little more detail on what you mean here ?

> * REDUNDANCY OF IMAGE (both intrapage and interpage)

Do you mean maintain some sort of technique cache, so that if some
text version was extracted at some point for an element, there's no
need to redo it for the same thing later on ?

Good point, but it's not a technique, but an implementation
optimization. 

> image used as link
> <A HREF=url><IMG SRC=url></A>

> * NAME of A (IS THIS The SAME AS NAME OF LINK?)

yes, A is the link, note that LINK is a different HTML element.
