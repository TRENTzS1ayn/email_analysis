yes

yes

should be were "stars" come into play: simple pass , pass with 1 star, 
pass with 3 start.

we need to use the priotiry

we should have both: individual accessibility of pages and accessible
zone or site.

It should be up to the webmaster to define what is his or her site.

For instance, I could decide that the WAI site is accessible,
althought the W3C site isn't.

We should discourage browser sniffing and encourage the one source
approach, so I'd say no.
