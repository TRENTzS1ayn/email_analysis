Another technique for image map AREA tags that don't have ALT text would be
to search for a text link with the same URL, and use that text link as ALT
text for the AREA tag.

In fact, optionally, the tool would then delete the text link at the bottom
since it is then redundant.

This would help folks who like image maps because it allows them to
conveniently skip the menu items that browsers like Lynx and pwwebspeak
create from the ALT tags.
