This is part of the Transform side of ER :-)
(Evaluation & Repair & Transform)

No kidding, I see Transform as being part of Repair: it's repair on
behalf of the user, not the webmaster.

I'd like to end up with a modular toolkit for Transform tools: one
module for serializing Table (something coming up soon in this area),
one for extracting textual equivalent, maybe one for reorganizing page
for better flow (navigation bar moved at the end, etc), etc.

The goal is both to produce Transform tools that can be used by real
users (by hosting them w3.org or other servers) and to show User Agent 
guidelines people and UA companies what is doable and what is less
doable.
