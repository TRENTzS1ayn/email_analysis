I assume this is mostly for sighted people wanting to check their
page.

So how about a simple cgi (hosted somewhere well known) that just
returns the list of links on the page with text/alt and url.

Example:
  http://cgi.w3.org/WAI/linklist?url=www.w3.org/WAI

would return:

W3C Home                        http://www.w3.org
WAI Home                        http://www.w3.org/WAI
new Working Draft:              http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH
News, Events & History:         #News
Stay Informed, Get Involved:    #Information
Resources on Web Accessibility: #Resources
etc.

This could also be provide as a standalone tool.

Note that this kind of service is already supported as part of the ETH 
Proxy service at http://www.inf.ethz.ch/department/IS/ea/blinds/
(currently down but I remember it listing all the link up front)
and could easily be added to Kynn Bartlett's
http://www.cgu.edu/degrade/.
