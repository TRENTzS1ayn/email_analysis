Daniel,

Another issue for your proxy that comes up all the time is how to handle
pages created with FP. FP is infamous for writing bad code, but the biggest
problem is that it won't allow ALT text for imagemap hotspots. It even
strips them if they are added manually. Microsoft appears to be unwilling to
address this issue.
