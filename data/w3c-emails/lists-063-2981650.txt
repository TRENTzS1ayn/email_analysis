Since Netscape 2.0, there is a technology called Automatic Proxy
Configuration that allows one to easily add a local proxy in one's
environment without disturbing the existing setup (it uses JavaScript
to test/pile up suite of proxies).

Documentation is at
  http://home.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/2.0/relnotes/demo/proxy-live.html

I think this is a nice and easy way to integrate Transform tools (such
as a Table serializer or Textual extrator) into one's environment and
I'd like to get a sense of this forum on the validity of this
approach. Does anybody in this group have direct experience of this
technology ? How does it work with Internet Explorer ? Do they support
a similar local/auto proxy feature ?
