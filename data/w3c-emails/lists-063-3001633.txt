This list is a good simple test for "does the link text make the
results of following the link predictable?"  On the other hand, I
don't think it really measures up to the job of communicating
"sippin' cyber through a straw" such as the blind experience it.
If the CGI would feed the links to you one at a time, that might
do it.

Here is another, slightly more complicated version that I don't
yet know a cheap way to do [but it could be done with styles and
a little hacking...].

Link text of the current link is bold.  The tab order is in
textual order according to the appearance of clickables on the
page.  All other text is obscured with ROT13 transform, except
for the link text that has already been passed over and that is
greyed out.

Then, to evaluate this experimentally, this takes:

A good computer game designer with no background in adaptive
technology as the "how comparable is this" evaluator.

A trained speech-web-naut to demonstrate their experience and
methods.

Demonstrate both.  Ask the game designer to compare/contrast
the two.
