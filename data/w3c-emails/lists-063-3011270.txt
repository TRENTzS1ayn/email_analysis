This is another function in the repair category.

Some page authors have static information inserted in their code
through initialization code which runs independently from any
input from the user.  This may make their pages unusable with
scripts turned off even 'though the needed information is static
and not truly computed.

The repair tool concept is a tool that would interpret scripts
and move static information into the HTML from the script.
