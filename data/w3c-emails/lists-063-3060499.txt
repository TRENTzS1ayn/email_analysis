What I would like to end up is a document like the Web Content Guidelines
Checklist 
  http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990324/full-checklist
with instead of (Yes, No, N/A) a mention of how automatable the
evaluation of the checkpoint is and how this can be achieved.

Look at http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/evalauto for a start.
