A server version of Bobby 3.1 Beta 6 is now available. You can access this
through a development version of the new web site, which will be posted
publicly when we release Bobby 3.1. The URL is
http://www.cast.org/bobby3.1/.

Note that the web site is still under development, and certain technical and
content elements (including functionality for both the feedback and download
forms) have not yet been added. This is available mainly as a means for you
to test the new bobby server and its output. We welcome discussion and
suggestions via this discussion list for the product. Many issues that you
may identify are already scheduled to be addressed prior to the release, but
there are probably others that we have not yet considered.
