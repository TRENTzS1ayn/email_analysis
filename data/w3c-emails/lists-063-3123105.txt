I got some clarification for concerning charges for our Friday ER
conference call, which, as stated in the last email :

is scheduled on AT&T, Friday, April 23, from
11am-12:30pm; the call-in number will be +1-805-240-9483; the participant
code is 771714

Here's the charge info:
>
>MIT/W3C pays the set-up fee, plus the .31/min/connection for the caller
>paid teleconference calls--the participants pay the long distance charges.
>Please let me know if you have any other questions.

So to find out what it will cost you, check the long distance charges to  
+1-805-240-9483 .
