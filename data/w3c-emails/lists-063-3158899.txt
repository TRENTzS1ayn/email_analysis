More comments:

- provide a way to upload a file to bobby (INPUT type=file), or to
cut&past HTML, so that people can bobby internal page (behind firewall)

- way to much hats on the result page

- there seems to be a bug in the double treatments of D-link and
LONGDESC (one is N, the other 2N, they should really be N only)

- provide backlink from the hat explanation to the document (I can't
find where the ASCII art warning comes from, it says "1 instance")

- do not give the browser compatibility info unless asked, same thing
for the download time info and the accessibility tips.
