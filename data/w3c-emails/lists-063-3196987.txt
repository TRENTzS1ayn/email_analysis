Hello,

I just wanted to clarify the point I made during our conference call. 

Moving towards abstracting the UI from the programming logic (and the Guideline "rules" - but I believe that's been discussed previously) would help to facilitate adjustments to be made in the UI, make further developments of the client-based and server-based products easier, and also improve the portability of Bobby in general.

Cheers,

Bill
