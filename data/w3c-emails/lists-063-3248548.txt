I wonder if we can think of some stronger way to emphasize that Bobby is
not a "total accessibility validator" but rather a powerful tool in the
armamentarium of an author who's trying to create accessible Web
content?  The most frequent complaint is that Bobby "passes"
inaccessible and rejects accessible ones.  

Perhaps the notion of "passing" isn't "where it's at" and we should find
some language that clarifies this.  Icons and seals of approval are all
very well but this would have to be a juried analysis and that's almost
surely out of the question.  To the surfer it really doesn't matter what
sort of badge is on the site but whether the site is usable.  Pragmatics
rules, as usual.
