William,

I like your intro. Here's my suggested changes:

The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) produced a foundation document, The
WAI Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines, that describes what must be done to make an HTML
page accessible to all. Two working draft recommendation papers were
produced, based on these WAI guidelines; one for user agents; another for
authoring tools.

The draft recommendation papers try to make clear that the WWW should enable
everyone, especially those with disabilities.

To determine if a web site is accessible to everyone, it is important to
have functional, friendly and free tools for site evaluation and, if
possible, repair of problems that may be uncovered.

> To this end we are developing guidelines for such Evaluation & Repair
> Tools - sort of "Guidelines for the Guidelines." Although these are

This document describes techniques that may be used by such 'evaluation and
repair' tools to uncover accessibility problems and possibly repair them.
These guidelines may be used by those who create web authoring tools or to
anyone interested in creating accessible web documents.

> The most important aspect of any such tools is that they be themselves
> accessible. Since many people trying to use them will be fairly new to
> technological matters they should be pleasant to use, not condescending

It is important that evaluation and repair tools themselves be accessible.
Many people using these tools may be new to this technology and will require
software programs that are easy to use while not condescending in tone. Is
also important that the evaluation tool does not generate excessive warnings
or false positive accessibility errors to avoid the 'cry wolf' syndrome.

> It is clear that only a limited set of the checkpoints may be

It is clear that only a limited set of the WAI Guideline's checkpoints may
be objectively tested by a software tool. There will still be a dependence
on the user's ability to use common sense to determine conformance to the
guidelines. It is imperative that any tool have features that assist in
reminding, without nagging; in helping, without demeaning; in suggesting,
without demanding.

We hope that the techniques in this document, implemented in software
programs, will gently guide authors along the path to more accessible
documents.

Chris
