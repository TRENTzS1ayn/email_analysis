Len,

Thanks for your helpful comments. I've put most of them into the document
and will have the new version posted at the A-Prompt site tomorrow Fri. Aug.
6 (http://aprompt.snow.utoronto.ca/docs/Implementation.html).

I have a few comments on your suggestions:

> > It also describes methods for modifying HTML
> >documents so that they will conform to these guidelines.
>
> LRK:: minor: for the software to modify...
>
CR:: I don't understand this. Are you suggesting "It also describes methods
for the software to modify documents so that they will conform to these
guidelines."?


> LRK:: important: in all cases, even if ALT text passes tests, show picture
> and ALT text so that user can verify that ALT text is suitable.
>
CR:: We are designing a 'review' or 'verify' mode so that the user can
review/verify what is actually in the document. I think this is what you're
suggesting. We really don't want to present the user with items that are OK
when they are in 'evaluate/repair' mode and only questionable items should
be shown. When we get the 'review' mode working it will address some of your
following comments.


> >Suggestions for possible ALT text:
>
> LRK:: minor: reword: "Ways that program can automatically suggest alt
text"
>
CR:: Daniel has made a suggestion that we use the more generic 'repair
technique' text for these sort of suggestions. OK?


> >   * IMG element should have a valid LONGDESC attribute if the image is
> >     complex.
> >   * If IMG element has no LONGDESC attribute and could be a complex
image,
> >     ask user if the image is complex and requires a long description.
>
> LRK:: signficant:  I suggest that this be folded in with display of images
> and ALT text.  Display description pointed to by LONGDESC, or alert user
at
> that time if no LONGDESC.  This eliminates need to evaluate what's a
> "complex" image or the bullet and   rule line below.
>
CR:: For the 'review/verify' mode this makes sense. For 'evaluate/repair'
mode I think we'll have to ask the user for every image (that's not a bullet
or HR) whether it's complex and requires a LONGDESC.


> >Technique 1.1.K [priority 3] User notification for ASCII art
> >
> LRK:: signficant: algorithm for spotting ASCII art, e.g. series of n or
> more punctuation characters or clusters of repeated letters...

CR:: Developing the algorithm will take a lot of work. Anybody got some free
time?

> >server-side image map.
> >
> >Technique 1.2.A [priority 1] Prompt user for text links if ISMAP used.

>
CR:: Good idea. I've heard that some servers can provide a set of links and
associated coordinates for the image map if you ask for it.


> >Checkpoint 1.3 - Until user agents can automatically read aloud the text
> >equivalent of a visual track, provide an auditory description of the
> >important information of the visual track of a multimedia presentation.
> >
> >(Can't be machine checked. User notification if movie file found?)
>
> LRK:: important: allow user to run track and listen to description.  This
> also applies to checkpoint 1.5.
>
CR:: This is a good idea. We would like to add a media player to A-Prompt
for doing just this sort of thing. It likely won't get into this version
though.
