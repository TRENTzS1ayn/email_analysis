I've marked my comments with LRK::: to distinguish from earlier comments

LRK:::Yes.

The way I was thinking of it, this spec is just addressing the tool
capabilities and algorithms.  It doesn't describe user interface
considerations like how the output it organized.  So why not put it all in
one list for purposes of this document, regardless of the user interface.

If you want to also describe your user interface that would be great,
although I'd suggest putting it in a separate paper.  Or, you might go on
ahead since it's often more productive to comment on an actual user
interface than to talk in the abstract in advance.  Your call.

Personally, based on my experience going over web pages, I think I would
like to look at the images all at once since there's so much bad alt text
that would never get picked up.  But maybe when I actually experience your
interface who knows, I might switch over.  Your automatic checks will
certainly be good as initial screening of a site to see what's generally
going on.

Same comment applies to your other reference to these modes in LONGDESC
which I've omitted from this email.

LRK::: I don't know what you mean

To further encourage volunteers, how about giving the progmming interface
<grin, I guess>?

LRK::: Wow! that would be great!

LRK:::  Glad it's in your plans and if not in version 1, no problem.  Like
I say, this isn't a contract of what you're doing next week <grin>. 

Thanks again for putting this all together!
