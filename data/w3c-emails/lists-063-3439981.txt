Good idea to email reminders.  Will do.

Also, there are links to schedule meetings, etc.  but they are at

http://www.w3.org/wai/er/ig

Historically you didn't need that ig on the end. It came in when er was
split into er/wg and er/ig.  But most people probably aren't that aware of
the division because in practice all the discussions are going on in er/ig.

So probably a lot of folks didn't realize that most of the action is on the
er/ig page, the er page.  I'll add a big link on the er page.  Thanks for
bringing that up.
