Judy asked us to estimate what we will be doing for er-ig now through
december.  

What do you think of the following:

---------------------
a. The main activity nowadays centers around the ER Techniques Document
(ERT) that Chris Ridpath is writing:

http://aprompt.snow.utoronto.ca/docs/Implementation.html

It includes evaluation tool features and repair tool features.

Chris has set a goal for ERT:  first version by October 31, 1999.

Here's the other things we need to be looking at.  I'm assuming here that
each will be a separate document or statement, to avoid delaying the ERT.

b. Bottom line rating algorithm.  Goal: decide by September 31.
   (see http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/1999Aug/0015.html)

c. Suggestions for user interface to techniques in ERT.  Goal: October 31,
1999

High level requirements for the user interface as well as wording for error
messages are included in the ERT introduction.  This document will offer
further suggestions (suggestions, not requirements).

d. Recommendation for filtering tools to be used by end user. Goal: First
version Nov. 31.

 Some of this is the same as the repair techniques in ERT, but with a
different wording: for example, instead of "suggesting" an alt text it will
"guess" the alt text.  Other techniques don't fit in with ERT's current
authoring emphasis: e.g. such as transforming tables (cf.
http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/WG/tablin/) or guessing at meaning of Java applets
(cf. thread rooted at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/1999Feb/0007.html )

e. Informal feedback on tools as beta and final versions are offered.  To
be posted as tools are offered for feedback.

f. Summaries of Guideline Issues.  To be posted as issues arise.

What do folks think of these?
