I should apologize for not having posted a follow-up to explain this
document that I posted. This document is still in draft stage, it's part our
implementation of the Techniques document; as the techniques evolve, so does
this, including the document structure. I posted it for discussion in the
Monday teleconference just to contextualize some things we were talking
about; I'll make a point to make that purpose clear next time I post a
version. I haven't put time into making the DTD completely correct - just
sufficient to get the document to display (in IE5). That said, your
suggestions are helpful to me as a relative XML neophyte (we inherited the
file from Josh who knew what he was doing more than the rest of us) and, as
we finalize the document in the next month or two, I'll make sure to take a
closer look at those structural aspects. As far as the specific questions
you raised in the revised DTD, they relate to aspects of our implementation
that are still evolving and it might be more helpful to explain, and get
feedback on, those items a little bit later. Michael
