Hey Gregory!

Neat trick, to make an image the link to it's longdesc.  What do you do
recommend to provide a longdesc of an image which is already a link?

I don't understand though, why you use .hide, defined with foreground an
background both white, on that image, since there isn't any text to hide.
The text is ALT text which is hidden anyway.  Maybe this wasn't the actual
example you were thinking of... maybe the .hide here is a remnant from
earlier in this particular pages's history.

Also, what do you find annoying about d links?  BTW, your .hide would of
course make d links also invisible, tho no less annoying to screenreader
users, whatever that annoyance might be.

And a suggestion. Give .hide teensy weensy font size to take up less room,
thus currying greater acceptance amongst other web page designers who might
otherwise eschew this trick.
