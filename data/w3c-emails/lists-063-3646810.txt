Hi Charles, David

This site is actually listed on our 'Existing ER Tools List' under
Filter/Transform tools as 'ETH Zurich - Proxy helper project' (same URL). It
was done by a student in Zurich - Louis Perrochon, who has since left and as
of our last communication is now at Stanford in California. As you've hinted
in your email, he was quite an early pioneer in this area developing this
application when virtually no-one else was. He has since moved on to other
things although I've alerted people at Stanford working on the accessibility
Archimedes project and hopefully they have had a chance to get together to
perhaps get some sparks flying. If he did that so many years ago, can you
imagine what he could do now???

Bill
