Here are possible choices for our next two meetings.  Please tell me which
pairs of dates are OK for you.

(In theory we could mix and match from among these pairs, but I'm trying to
keep it on the same day of the week and same time to make it easier to
remember and avoid conflicts with other regular meetings.)

Monday Times
September 13 and 27 9AM Boston *
September 13 and 27 10AM Boston

Tuesday Times
September 7 and 21 10AM Boston
September 14 and 28 10AM Boston *

* dates marked by * make our next meeting about 3 weeks from today.
Otherwise the next meeting is about 2 weeks from today.
