Another comment I have is to "add" to the form a check box on whether or not I
want the web site added to the "database" .  The reason is I'm testing the use
of the tool and may be evaluating a bogus site, and/or evaluating a real site,
but really testing the tool and not doing a through eval of the site.  I am also
doing real evals of some sites and would want them added to the database even
though the tool is in beta...
