First, I've changed the tool so that it asks comment to be sent to the 
ER IG list, rather than just to me, so that people can discuss the
issues as they come in, not waiting for me (always trying to remove
intermediaries...) 

So far I count 6 comments:

I think the "Other comments" field can be used to indicate that kind
of things (ala: "I only reported this and that but there seems to be
more problems on this site").

After discussing with Judy and the WAI staff, I changed it to be 

From <reporter-name or reporter-email or "anonymous"> (whatever is available)
using the W3C WAI Accessibility Initiative Report Tool.

I could modify the cgi logic so that one can both select a browser in
the menu and enter a browser in the Other field, and that both of them 
appear in the message.
I'm not sure that's worth the trouble ?

I think like for issue one above, the "Other comments" field can be
use to emphasize particular aspects.
You guess it: I'm reluctant to complicate the UI of this form.

What others think ?
This way we might get some end-user input as to what is the
significance of this problem.

I'm not in favor of that.

If you want to test the tool, you just stop at Step4 and do not hit
"Send Message". You basically see what the message will be.
(If you really want to see what messages looks like, you can check the
archive.)

Also, I don't want to send unarchived messages on behalf of W3C...
