-- give an idea of how many steps there are in the process on
the first page

-- use email callback to verify the email address of the user?
This thing makes it (too?) easy to forge a report on behalf
of somebody else.

-- privacy statement? You're asking for quite a bit of info.
What are you promising *not* to do with it?

-- hmm... I expected it to be semi-automated. I'd like the
machine to make a guess at the report. Here are some
things that look automatable:
-- missing ALTs
-- check HTML validity
-- notice that there are no imagemaps so that checkpoint is n/a
-- determine which browser the user is using
(which shouldn't prevent them from changing it,
in case their doing the report with a different
browser from the one they used to do their review)

Ah... I guess this isn't so much of a general review
tool as a tool to facilitate problem reporting. So I guess
I just got the wrong impression.

-- I suggest a link from the "mobility imparied access"
subjective rating section to some background about it;
I don't know how to judge mobility impared access.
The "not rated" option is good.

-- confirmation step: great!

-- in the mail message, under "The reviewer found the
following accessibility problems" you don't say
what the impact of, e.g. "Missing or inappropriate
alternative text for an Image or Animation".
Yes, they can follow the link, but you could provide
more motivation for them to do so than just the
fact that one reader was inconvenienced.
I appreciate the effort to keep the report short,
but one sentence describing (at least the most significant
part of) the impact of the improper markup seems worthwhile.
