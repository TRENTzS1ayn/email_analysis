Regarding nested tables

I agree that scope doesn't cover case of nested tables.

However, each cell has a "headers" attribute which is a list of 
id's  (separated by spaces).  Since an id can be anywhere on the page, it 
allows a cell in a nested table to refer to a cell in an outer table.

Also, regarding algorithms, there is already an algorithm

http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/tables.html#h-11.4.3

to deduce what would have been done by scope or headers.  This algorithm 
can be extended by recursively including the deduced headers of the 
enclosing cell.

Does that take care of it?
