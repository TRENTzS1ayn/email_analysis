That extension sounds logical to me; as logical as any I have been able to
think up.

I wasn't quite ready to say "That takes care of it."  

Partly because we need to be clear that if one can ask the author, then all
guesses should be checked with the author.  And then reduced to hard code
(i.e. headers, scope, and axis notations) rather than simply leaving it to
the User Agent to repeat the guess algorithm.

The other part is that I would prefer to know what, if any, use has already
been given to nested tables out in the field.  I think that our brains are
logical, but if the consensus of everyone else follows a different logic, I
would like to know this first before putting on my shield and buckler to go
out and convert them to our logic.

PS: Once we embrace that idea, that all headers pertaining to the enclosing
outer cell are pertinent to all cells inside the inner table, then SCOPE
does flow down into the inner table as well.  No need to treat it differently.
