Here's URI's for two topics that came up in todays discussion

HTML 4 algorithm for deducing headers

http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/tables.html#h-11.4.3

Basically, the algorithm is travel up the column, listing the column 
headers you intersect.  The headers are inserted into the table in top to 
bottom order.  Similar for rows.  Tables this simple don'r really need 
extra markup.


Also, here's the URL for the working Draft Note on Accessibility in 
XML  http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/XMLGL.HTM
