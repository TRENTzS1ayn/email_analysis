Hello,

I took an action item at today's teleconference to determine if the HTML 
validator would catch  attribute values that point to non-existing IDs.  I 
created an example page [1] with the following code:

<code>
<td headers="error">Black</td>
<td headers="error">Espresso</td>
</code>

the ID "error" is not defined. The W3C HTML Validator gave me the following 
message:
<message>
Error: reference to non-existent ID "ERROR"
</message>

Therefore, my concern *would* be picked up by a validator.

Also  note that there is a nested table in this example.  One of the cells 
in the inner table points to a header in the outer table.  This passes the 
validator.
