Although I agree that a brief description in alt values is redundant, I would
suggest that a longdesc is often appropriate. However I feel that it would
make more sense to use a more powerful construct than "img" anyway, which
would allow for the selection of multiple content types.

  Why would we encourage "longdesc" for images that are purely decorative and
  have no meaning?
  I would move 3b to the end of the ordered list.  After checking if it's
  part of a link, or used for spacing or formatting, then finally if it's
  just a "purely decorative" image, then shouldn't alt="" be O.K.?  For
  example, I have a image of a LOGO several places on a page purely for
  visual effect, but don't want to "clutter up" the audio by having it
  rendered every time in-line with the HTML, I the author may choose to turn
  off the audio by using the alt="" on the redundant images.  What I do with
  my eyes, skip over and ignore the purely decorative images, can only be
  supported by the screen reader by me the author using alt="".  The user can
  always get the source HTML file and review the image file used if curious,
  but brief description and longer description should not be encouraged for
  redundant decorative images.
