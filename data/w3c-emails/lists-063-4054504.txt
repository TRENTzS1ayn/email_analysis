I think alt="" MIGHT need to be treated differently than alt=" " (or 
alt="&nbsp;" [or alt="&#160"]) because alt="" makes images (and any link) 
disappear from text-only browsers.

2b.  What about when the image is part of link that does NOT have text 
(e.g, <a href="home.html"><img src="button.gif" alt=""></a> OR <a 
href="home.html"><img src="button.gif" alt=""></a>?  Is this kind of thing 
ALWAYS flagged -- which I think it should be.  If I missed consensus on 
this, I apologize.

For this example, subsequent alt="" might be okay, but even better would be 
to repeat the alt or perhaps substitute alt="..." -- just so text browsers 
generate the same annoying effect!
