I've started work on an accessibility evaluator called the Wave (Web 
Accessibility Versatile Evaluator).

Although the Wave incorporates some automatic checking like we've 
discussed, the emphasis is to aid human judgment of accessibility, and to 
do so without showing HTML.

   Features

      Displays Alternative content next to Images, Applets, etc.
      Displays Error icons if Alternative content is missing.
      Displays, via numbering, order screenreader reads page (linearized 
order).
      Warns of special circumstances, e.g. audio links


   Users and Uses
            Sighted users can
                     visually evaluate quality of alternatives
                     and order of presentation
            Blind users can
                     evaluate alternative content,
                     be alerted by Error icons;
                     use numbering to commnicate criticisms
            Deaf Users
                     will be alerted to audio content

I've got a first draft prototype running.  Right now it's just running 
locally on my machine but I'll be getting it out on the web when I get the 
chance.  You can take a look at examples of it's use at
