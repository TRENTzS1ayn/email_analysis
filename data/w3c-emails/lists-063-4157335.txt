Nearly two-thirds of disability World Wide Web sites were found to have
accessibility problems, a recent analysis found.  The study by the Gilbert
Center checked the home pages of more than 100 disability organizations
using the Bobby validation tool for accessibility.

Is the standard for access so difficult or unclear that our own
organizations cannot meet it?
