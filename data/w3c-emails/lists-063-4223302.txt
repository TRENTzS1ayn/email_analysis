There are a couple of small issues related to TABLES that have still not
been resolved. Can we agree on the numbers (4 and 15) for:

There is no need to check a table for multiple levels of row/column headers
unless the table has more than 4 rows or 4 columns.
http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/#Technique5.2.A

TH elements should have an ABBR attribute if the header name is greater than
15 characters.
ABBR attribute values should be less than 15 characters.
