By saying that there are two types of tables we are trying to identify if a 
cell can exist on its own.  Data tables usually rely on some relationship 
between cells, whereas the cells of layout tables can usually exist on 
their own.

for example, if a table is used to layout a navigation bar, there is no 
"relationship" between the cells.  Yes, they are all related and thus 
grouped into a table, but they could each exist "on their own" on the page 
as a single piece of information.

a cell in a data table on the other hand, often needs a header to make 
sense.  for example, "33" does not make sense until associated with its 
header "jersey numbers of heisman winners."

Yes, the only way _to be sure_ which type of table it is, is to ask the 
author.  However, a few things could be tested:
1. if there are no TH elements, it might be used for layout.
or vice-versa, if there are TH elements, it might be used for data.
2. if there is only one column or one row it might be layout.

definitely.

yes.
