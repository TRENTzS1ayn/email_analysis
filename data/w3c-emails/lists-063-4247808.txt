aloha, y'all!

i'm not sure what the ER policy on linking the ERT to an external, on-line
resources, but if that is a kosher mechanism for getting an author to view
his or her output via a text-only, tables-incapable browser (as well as one
that supports NOFRAMES), one possible way of getting authors to view their
tables in a linearized fashion would be to provide them with a link to a
stable service, such as Scott McGee's Lynx-It
