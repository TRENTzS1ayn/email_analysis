one resolution that i forgot to capture in the list I just sent:

Resolved: Once "nagging issues" are closed we will start at the top of the 
document and work our way through.  We will set up an open issues list and 
people can volunteer to shepherd an issue through to consensus.  This way 
we can have more than one person pushing the document and perhaps get some 
more work done quickly.
