I absolutely agree that it's useful to see how the page actually looks in 
something like Lynx.  That's sometimes shown me things that I 
missed.   Perhaps that could be added to the intro of ERT.

Another tool that shows how a page looks in lynx is

http://www.delorie.com/web/lynxview.html

This has the nice feature that you can click on links and it shows how they 
in turn will be displayed.

But be warned: neither this tool nor the one Gregory mentioned  tells you 
how image maps are handled.  In the real Lynx, you can select an image map 
and see the ALT text of the contained areas (assuming the author put them 
in; otherwise it shows the urls).  These lynx viewing tools don't show that.

I once requested delorie to add that feature, but no time so far.  He gives 
the Perl source though.  Maybe someone will want to work with him on that 
upgrade.
