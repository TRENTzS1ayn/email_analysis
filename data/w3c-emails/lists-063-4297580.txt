here is a good explanation of table linearization and the use of structural 
elements (taken from Techniques for WCAG [1]):

<blockquote>
However, when it is necessary to use a table for layout, the table must 
linearize in a readable order. When a table is linearized, the contents of 
the cells become a series of paragraphs (e.g., down the page) one after 
another. Cells should make sense when read in order (row-wise or 
column-wise) and should include structural elements (that create 
paragraphs, headers, lists, etc.) so the page makes sense after linearization.
