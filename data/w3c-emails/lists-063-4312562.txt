I am proposing a radio button type of interface with examples to help the 
author perform some "pattern matching" to best determine what kind of table 
they have created.  what do people think about the following:

<proposal>
This table is used to:
[] present data (such as a bus schedule, a comparison of regional sales 
figures, or a listing of employee contact information).
[] visually lay out images, text, and other information on the page (such 
as a navigation bar, or a newspaper page with stories, links, and images).
</proposal>

Once we agree on something, this would be included in an "example wording" 
section, right?
