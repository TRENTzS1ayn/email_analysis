Hello all,

   long time no speak! ;-) I did not forget about ALTifier, though... Most
of the things we spoke about on the list and the phone confs found it's way:
More than one ALT per IMG, XML registry format suggestion etc.

   I hope it's okay to attach, no time for website update now. Find the
Win32 CLI tools alt_filter.exe and alt_report.exe and sample docs. (Note
that the webpage http://www.vorburger.ch/projects/alt/ and the paper have
NOT yet been updated.)

  Very briefly, here is what these two tools do: alt_report crawls an entire
site, stores ALT in an internal RAM-based registry, works on this registry
to Guess missing tags, and for now then just reports the Registry's content
in three different formats, one being compatible with Chris Ridpath's
APrompt, another similar to the XML Al once suggested here. Use -noguess
option if you want alt_report to crawl and report, but not to guess. Many
ALT will be (NULL) ;-)

  The other one, alt_filter.exe, is intended as a filter for ONE page: Give
it the filename of an HTML doc, it will analyze, and write a hopefully
enhanced version to STDOUT.

  While alt_filter can only "guess" based on the one page it sees,
alt_report
does "guess" site wide and eg. set missing ALT according to what it found on
another page. (Daniel, remember your question about "context" in one phone
conference?)

Attached are two sample pages (index.html and linked.html) and what comes
out (index-alt.html and linked-alt.html) if sent through the filter, only.

I am not really clear how to continue with this. A nice GUI tool allowing to
see and set
ALT site wide, review the Guess suggestions etc, would be cool. Also, the
alt_report
only scans/extracs for now. If we can agree on a standard textual
description, like alt_db.xml, there could be an alt_write.exe as well.

Check it all out and let me know what you think! And sure feel free to
forward/post this whereever appropriate, clearly stating that this is Beta
and I am open for suggestions.

Regards,
Michael
