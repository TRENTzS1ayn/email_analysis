Hi Mike,

Yes you're right, I'm not subscribed to that list.

Your alt thing looks rather good.

I've managed to temporarily hook up alt_filter.exe to my development 
copy of the access gateway, on ssb22.joh.cam.ac.uk.  It gets the web 
page, runs alt_filter through it and processes the results.  So you can 
browse with it.  At the moment the user doesn't get any choice but to go 
through the filter.  I don't think this way of doing it is a good 
permanent idea though because the amount of process spawning that's 
involved does slow it down.  Also, calling a Win32 executable is not 
portable to Unix platforms (most web servers run Unix).

May I ask what programming language it is written in?

There is a slight bug in that consistently replacing VALUE with ALT 
doesn't always work too well in forms, as in

<input type="text" name="hpe" size="2" alt="10">

where the VALUE attribute is lost.
