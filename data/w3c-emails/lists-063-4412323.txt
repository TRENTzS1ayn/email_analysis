Are you not using the AltText.txt format anymore? You realized alt_report
writes this as well, and some demo XML as suggested by Al too. I think the
XML is usefull, the details of the format should be discussed soon to have a
common "standard".

It DOES work on an entire directory, by crawling a site by following links,
but not just scanning any HTML file it finds. Of course, "orphan pages" that
are not linked from anywhere are ignored. The crawling could start with any
filename other than index.html, that's one line to change, I'll make it a
parameter in the next version.

WHAT??? Anybody from the list has details on this? I am VERY interested in
this. I do have FrontPage 2000 Beta Preview here and played with it but
don't remember having seen an ALT text registry included.
