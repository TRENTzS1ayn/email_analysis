Looking good!  I tried

http://ssb22.joh.cam.ac.uk/scripts/access

To get the ALT tags I did needed to NOT check the "disable all sight..."
box.  I had gotten the opposite impression from what you wrote.

When I tried it on http://www.temple.edu, which leads off with a client
side image map that lacks ALT tags, It very nicely inserted the tags,
apparently by grabbing text from text links elsewhere on the page that
pointed to the same URL.

Just a couple of minor things:

It left spaces out of the words, e.g. it said "TEMPLEADMISSIONS" instead of
"TEMPLE ADMISSIONS"

Also, where it generates alt text from the URL it covereted

www.owlsports.com

to 

www.owlsports

It's nice that it dropped the .com.  I'd suggest dropping any leading
"www." as well.
