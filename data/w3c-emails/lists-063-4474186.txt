The things you mention shouldn't be too difficult to implement in the 
access gateway but I have rather a lot of work on my hands at the 
moment.  I'm not sure if your experience of applet parameters is as 
broad as there is (the general case scenario would be to analyse the 
Java itself and thus solve the halting problem) and I'm not sure if the 
benefit gained by making these parameters accessible would justify the 
effort put in.  Every applet I've ever met is not worth the bandwidth it 
takes up and I just zap 'em.  And I tend to give a low priority to this 
kind of thing because it seems so relatively unimportant.
