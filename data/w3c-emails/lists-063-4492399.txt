I can't find the applet at Temple University but please try the AT&T 
site with the gateway now and see if it's any help.  (Please use the 
www.accu.org gateway as the others might not have updated themselves yet 
and the one on my machine has altifier; you probably only want to test 
one thing at a time.)

Here is the code I put in, in case you're interested.  (Of course there 
is other stuff, like the extra option on the form, the extra bit in the 
help text and the initialisation of processParams in the query decoder, 
but you get the idea.)

if(noApplets && processParams && !stricmp(theTag.getName(),"PARAM")) {
const char* v=theTag.getAttribute("VALUE"); if(v) {
if(!strnicmp(v,"http://",7)) {
HTMLTag tag2("A");
tag2.addAttribute("HREF",v);
processTag(tag2,htmlLineInput);
theEnvironment->h_fputs(v);
processTag("/A",htmlLineInput);
theEnvironment->h_puts("<BR>");
} else if(strchr(v,' ')) {
// It's probably text
theEnvironment->h_fputs(v);
theEnvironment->h_puts("<BR>");
}
}
}
