> So I guess at this point it doesn't handle frames?

It does.  The default behaviour is to linearise all the frames, but you 
can also choose to get it to leave them untouched.  The problem was that 
www.temple.edu is actually now a no frames site, and I hadn't thought of 
following the link to the frames version.

Anyway, unfortunately the gateway didn't work because the URLs were not 
as separate parameters but embedded in the value with two backslashes.  
I'm not sure whether to try and parse this kind of thing or not; it 
seems a little special-case.  If it's any help I could attempt to 
write some code that recognises a URL in plain text when it sees one 
(like mailer programs do), but this still wouldn't get rid of the 
backslashes.  (Only I can't do anything now because I'm a bit loaded 
down.)

You're right there's not that much I can do about the duplicates on 
AT&T I'm afraid.  I can look for duplicate URLs no problem, but it's 
possible that in some circumstances they will actually be wanted and it 
seems too risky.
