Actually, www.temple.edu is a frames site.  Here's the result of GETing the
page  using a telnet incantation

$telnet www.temple.edu 80 > temp
GET / HTTP/1.0

(terminate with extra carr return)



Here's temp:

As you can see, the page has frames and, furthermore, the header doesn't
redirect the browser to a new location (which I thought may have been the
problem).  So I don't know why your software is thinking its a no-frames site.

BTW, the page has a snytax error, viz. two </frameset> tags. Could that be
the problem I wonder?
