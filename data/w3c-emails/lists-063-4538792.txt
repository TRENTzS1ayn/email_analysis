Actually it did work.

When I went to 

http://www.accu.org/cgi-bin/access/access

and input
http://www.att.com

and did not check the "disable all ..."

It showed the url's in the java applet as separate links, just as it
should.  This was viewing it in netscape navigator 4.06.  Although that
doesn't seem to be any magic in netscape: when I look at the source there
are indeed <A ... href="http://  etc.

Maybe you made this improvement after you wrote this email.  Anyway, looks
fine to me.

BTW, the <A...>'s contain onMouseOver="window.status='etc...  What are they
for?
