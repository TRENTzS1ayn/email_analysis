> Here's the result of GETing the page  using a telnet incantation

Was this telnet attempt from within Temple University itself?  It seems 
to be responding differently depending on where the request is coming 
from, or something.  I did exactly the same thing and here is what 
happened:

telnet www.temple.edu 80
Trying 155.247.166.60...
Connected to www.ocis.temple.edu.
Escape character is '^]'.
