On www.att.com yes, but not on the Temple site I'm afraid.  www.att.com 
has the URLs in separate parameters, whereas Temple embeds them in the 
same parameters as the text.

Normally when a sighted user moves the mouse over a link, the status 
window displays the URL that the link points to.  If that link has been 
redirected through the gateway, the URL will be awfully long (including 
all the options etc) and would not fit in the status window.  The 
onMouseOver stuff makes it look like it's not redirected, except I put 
the word "Access" in just to make sure there's no confusion.

It turns out that most of the people using the gateway around here are 
fully sighted Japanese (and a few Chinese) who want to look at those 
pages without needing the fonts (the gateway can substitute a load of 
gif files and handle the encoding detection automatically).  And then 
there are one or two sighties who use it just because they like their 
paragraphs indented rather than a line left between them.

Also, I must admit, I've used the status window before.  I do have 
partial sight and I don't always want to work quite like totally blind 
people do; this is the advantage of having something that is 
configurable.
