That's an interesting use for populating the status line using onMouseOver.
 Maybe there are other uses also for this trick.

For example, you could process a table so that the row and column headings
appear on the status line when the mouse is on a cell.  Folks with low
vision could position the mouse there already: folks using screenreaders
could use the send-mouse-to-screenreader-cursor command.  

This would also be handy for sighted folks when the column or row headings
are scrolled off the screen.

(see implementation hints in P.S.)

P.S.

This use of mouseover requires wrapping each cell in an A link.

If anyone tries this there's a glitch you've got to watch which I ran into
on my home page http://astro.temple.edu/~kasday

If the cell isn't a link already, Netscape 4.06 requires the following

<A href=""  onclick="return false" ...

You need the href for Netscape to respond to the onMouseOver (something I
consider a bug) and you need the onclick="return false" to prevent netscape
from trying to go to that href when the user clicks there.  Kluge, Kluge,
Kluge.
