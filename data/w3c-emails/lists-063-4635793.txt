Hi Silas,
(cc'd to list)

I found out more about our cgi server here.  It runs Sun Solaris 2.6,  Perl
(v5.004_04), and the gnu C/C++ compiler (gcc/g++ v2.8.1).

Please tell me how to proceed to mirror your stuff... does it compile under
Solaris 2.6 and gcc/g++ or will I need to play with the includes... or is
it a binary already... etc.

Len

p.s.
I found out why you get a different temple home page when you are outside
of temple.  It was a deliberate design decision here... they wanted to give
outside people a faster loading home page, but with identical content...
they translated the scrolling java applet into a series of separate text
links on the outside page.
