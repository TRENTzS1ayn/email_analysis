I'm not sure what you mean by "make an RFC".

W3C doesn't make RFC in any case, IETF does.

Regarding your proposed extension, I suggest you look at the 
HTTP extension framekwork that the W3C HTTP team has been working on
and proposing to IETF recently.

> ====================================================================
> Standard for Mediator Warnings
> (Proposed by Silas Brown, 28th February 1999)
> 
> A "mediator" is defined as any program that acts as a proxy (whether or 
> not it is actually implemented as a proxy) with the purpose of modifying
> HTML in some way.  This standard enables HTML documents to embed warning 
> messages for users of specific mediators.  Mediators conforming to this 
> standard should add these warning messages at the top of the page; other 
> mediators and normal browsers should ignore them.
> 
> An example of its use is that a mediator can embed a message for itself 
> or for other mediators, warning about redundancy, but there is nothing 
> to stop messages from being embedded in static documents.
> 
> A MIME header can contain an arbitrary number of X-Mediator-Warning 
> lines.  The syntax of each line is:
> 
> X-Mediator-Warning: name=message
> 
> where 'name' is the canonical name of the mediator and 'message' is the 
> message that this mediator should display.  Any mediator that supports 
> this standard should add its canonical name to the MIME header of any 
> page it returns, using the following syntax:
> 
> X-Mediator-Name: name
> 
> Canonical names are not case sensitive.  They are formed from ASCII 
> characters between 33 and 126 inclusive, except 61 (the '=' sign).  
> No spaces may be added before the '=' sign.
> 
> Both of these can also be done in the HEAD of the document itself, using 
> META tags, as follows:
> 
> <META HTTP-EQUIV="X-Mediator-Warning" CONTENT="name=message">
> <META HTTP-EQUIV="X-Mediator-Name" CONTENT="name">
> 
> None of the above is case sensitive.
> 
> Notes:
> 1.  It is left unspecified whether or not messages may contain HTML 
> tags, since this depends on the context of the mediator.  This standard 
> does not guarantee that mediators implementing it will leave HTML tags 
> untouched, or even process them sensibly.
> 
> 2.  Messages are unformatted.  It is assumed that, if several 
> X-Mediator-Warning lines are present, each one is a different warning.  
> You should not begin a new X-Mediator-Warning line to insert a line 
> break.
