I put a draft version of a Table linearizer tool implemented in Java
at:

  /WAI/ER/WG/tablin

Here you can find:
  /WAI/ER/WG/tablin/Tablin.zip
which contains the filter itself, as a set of Java classes, with
sources and README (browsable online)

There is also 
  /WAI/ER/WG/tablin/lynxfilter.sh
which explains how to use it with lynx as a local proxy.
(editing of this shell script is required for your environment)

Coming soon: a more complete version, and a running server acting as a 
proxy using this stuff.

Send comments to me.
