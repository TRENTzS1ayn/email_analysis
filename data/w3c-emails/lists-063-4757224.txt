This is pretty much what I have been trying and failing to get Lynx to do
for quite a while now.  

The pattern would seem to be the user can indicate "access _this_ [the
currently focused] link through <user choice of> _that_ (gateway, proxy,
filter or other middleware).

This technique would seem to get more repair delivered to more (user X
page) problems than without it.
