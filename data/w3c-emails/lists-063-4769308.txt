In the tablin package I sent out to the list this week, there is a
lynxfilter.sh script (adapted from a post on lynx-dev) that's pretty
generic and explain how to integrate seamlessly a filter into a lynx
environment, so that when one types, say, xhttp://www.foo.com, instead
of http://www.foo.com, it actually gives you the output of foo.com
thru lynx, rather than foo.com content.
