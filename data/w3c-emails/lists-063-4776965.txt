Subject: CGI script for accessibility

Hi,

Several people have said I should let you know about my access gateway.  
It is a CGI script that makes changes to HTML in order to make the web 
more accessible.  I originally developed it mainly for my own use (I'm 
a partially sighted student at Cambridge University, UK) but if a wider 
audience is interested then I'm pleased it's useful.  Of course, it is 
*always* "under construction", but it has been stable for some months 
now and I'm confident in the security of the script.

Details are on my web site on 
http://ban.joh.cam.ac.uk/~ssb22/access.html

Please don't link to my site because the URL is highly temporary, but if 
you are interested in hosting any of it yourself then please tell me.

Regards

My software never has bugs.  lt just develops undocumented features.
