Hi,

Thanks for your message.  The gateway is written in C++ (my native 
programming language) and works with GNU C++; it uses Lynx to get the 
web pages (I know it's cheating but...)  There are people who distrust 
CGIs written in anything other than Perl because it's easier to go wrong 
in the string handling, but I do be careful.

I have some installation instructions (it shouldn't take too long) and 
they are on

http://www.accu.org/access/public/accessinstall.htm

which also contains a link for downloading the source; please don't 
publish that URL because I'd like to keep some control over the source 
if possible (I don't mind free distribution, but I would like to know 
what's going on!  Especially with updates etc)

Please let me know how you get on!

> However it omitted the ALT tag of the IMG itself.

Thanks for pointing this out.  I hadn't thought that image maps can have 
ALT tags as well as areas.  Now fixed.

Regards
