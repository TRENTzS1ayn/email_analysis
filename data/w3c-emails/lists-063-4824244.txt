Hi Karl,

This is certainly a useful tool. Thanks for the preview!

However, it took me a while to understand what it did.  I had expected that
after I clicked "submit" that I would see analysis results.  What it
actually does is to set up a page which allows me to submit the page to a
number of tools by simply clicking on links, thereby saving me the trouble
of going to each verifier and pasting the url into it's input form. It also
sets up the queries needed to check who is linking to my site as determined
by various search engines. Like I say, thats quite a handy thing to do.
But since it didn't do what I had expected I thought there was something
wrong or I wasn't using it correctly.  So I'd suggest explaining explicitly
what it does so people can appreciate it faster.

Also, why have it save the page at all?  A person can always generate it on
the fly or save it to their hard drive. Plus, I think it might be
intiminating to see their web page displayed on a public list for all to
see.  Especially when it's a page which they know hadn't been checked for
accessibility problems. Plus, if this tool is used a lot, the list gets to
be quite long. So I'd recommend to omit the saving and the list.

Another suggestion: when you save a page with the usual browser, like
netscape, it doesn't save images. Then when the person brings up the saved
page, s/he gets a "broken image" icon which looks unsettling.  So I'd
suggest omitting the image fix99.JPG.
