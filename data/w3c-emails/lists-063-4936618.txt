[only following up on ER]

Thanks for the review Len.

> - insert http:// if absent... or just prepopulate the form with http://

I don't like text field with http:// added by default, as I (as a user
on the web) have to remove it all the time when I do a copy/paste from
my browser (which already has it)

but yes I could add http:// if not present.

> - lynx 2.8 missing from browser list

yes, the list needs rework, it is still the original from the early
draft, I also want to add more subjective rating entries (for physical 
and cognitive)

I could change "Irrevelant" to "Pick one" for a better UI ?
 
As soon as you enter text in the "Other Browser" text field, it
overrides the menu choice.

oops

one of the original idea behind the form was not to make it a free
form letter going thru w3c to the webmaster (liability issue: people
being rude, etc)

that explains this limit to a short comment (not a solution to this
issue I know)

other idea ?

we could make 2 lines and see if we have problem when it's being used
?

we could label it "Personal comments" in the email sent.

I'm not sure.
what do others think ?

image + alt looks good, or just help

yes, I don't pretend to cover all the checkpoints.

this is just an initial list, as we go, we'll revise the list to
include more of what the "others" come to be
