We have a study underway to determine which colors are good/bad for use in
web pages. Please take a minute to participate in the study and pass along
the URL to anyone you know that may be interested. The results of the study
will be used in A-Prompt and made available for anyone else that is
interested.

The study is available at: http://snow.utoronto.ca/readtest/

Thanks,
Chris Ridpath
