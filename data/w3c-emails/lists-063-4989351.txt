aloha, y'all!

the slated meeting time for the ER-IG Teleconference, 28 July from 4 to 5:30 pm
EDST, conflicts with the regularly scheduled Authoring Tools Guidelines (AU WG)
teleconference, which is held every Wednesday from 3:30 pm to 5pm (and which
often bleeds-over a quarter-to-half-an-hour if there isn't another call slated
for 5!)

would it, therefore, be possible to move the meeting back an hour (i.e. so that
it would start at 5pm) in order to accommodate those of us in the AU WG who are
also interested in ER issues, especially those--such as that identified as the
subject of  the teleconference, "Techniques For Evaluation And Implementation
Of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines"--that overlap the AU WG's purview?

also, has it been decided upon which bridge will the call transpire?

thanks,
        gregory.
