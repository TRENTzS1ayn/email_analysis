Comments continued.  As before, I've labeled comments as "minor:
signficicant", "important"

This has most text of original.  I've preceded my comments with LRK:: so
you can quickly skip to them.

>This notification will be presented to the user if the document contains

LRK:: important: need to check text also.   Give strong warning for all
colors that are not consistently associated with logical tags.  For
example, if all H1 are made red, via style sheets, or use if individual
<span> tags, or by the much-despised <font> tag, that's OK.  But if some H1
are red and others are blue, it raises the suspician that the color means
something.

LRK:: important: even if meaning is conveyed by something other than color
alone such as a CSS box attribute, that's not acceptable, since audio
browsers don't pick up that visual style.  Furthermore, it's not even
acceptable if audio style sheets are used, until all user software supports
it. 

LRK:: significant: instead of global statement, put this as a checkbox next
to each image when it is displayed along with it's ALT and LONGDESC.
That's better I think than a global statement.

>Color difference is determined by the following formula:

>(maximum (Green value 1, Green value 2) - minimum (Green value 1, Green
>value 2)) + (maximum (Blue value 1, Blue value 2) - minimum (Blue value 1,
>Blue value 2))

LRK:: important: Color difference need not be greater than a threshold.
For example, very light grey against very dark grey.

The brightness formula, ignoring color, is a good start.  Be prepared to
check if data fits better if brightness is raised to power first.  The
texbooks say that isn't perfect but may be good enough for our practical
purposes, given all the other uncertainties.

Another simple formula: is just difference in the green components, or
better, green components raised to a power.  This should be checked against
people with protonopia (reduced sensitivity to red, a type of color
blindness) and people who lose blue sensitivity as they age.

LRK:: significant: add checkbox to display of images, e.g. "is this a math
equation"

LRK:: important: do we _really_ want people to use mathML before any
browsers support it?  I recommend using it as an object with the image
version nested within in case mathml not supported.

LRK:: signficicant: DOCTYPE is specified at  

http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40-971218/sgml/dtd.html

LRK:: minor: make this less of a command until most browsers implement CSS,
and do so correctly, especially for layout.

>          and/or underline.

LRK:: significant: if text is simply made larger that raises suspician it's
a heading.
LRK:: minor: I might quibble with how many words in a paragraph consitute a
heading.
LRK:: significant: heading can be first few words of paragraph.  If it's
bold, italic, or big it's suspicious.  Automatical HTML translation of
things like Word docs can to this.
LRK:: important: a big image at the beginning of tha page is probably a
heading.

LRK:: important: check for lists disguised as tables.  E.g. consecutive
items all starting with same little image.

LRK:: signficant:  I don't think block quotes should be enclosed by
quotation marks, stylewise.  Any English majors in the audience?  Hmmm.
What's convention in other language?

LRK:: minor: there are automatic means for guessing at languages which
could be applied to check if language changes.  Don't know if it's worth
the effort compared to other checks.  But then again, I'm pretty
Anglo-centric.

LRK:: minor: mark first time each used and look for words in parens after,
e.g.

The W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)
