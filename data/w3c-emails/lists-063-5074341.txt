Comments continued.  As before, I've labeled comments as "minor:
signficicant", "important"

This has most text of original.  I've preceded my comments with LRK:: so
you can quickly skip to them.

LRK:: important: display linearized version to user to check if it makes
sense.  
LRK:: significant: preferably display table and linearized version side by
side with yoked highlighting that move along to check item by item.

LRK:: important: display document without style sheets to visually check
what happens.

LRK:: important: display page with script applet or other programmatic
objects displayed, but "greyed out", e.g. boxed in by a special css box.
Then indicate alternative contents that shows when the objects are turned
off.  This facilitates ready comparison.

LRK:: significant: This is worry of PF I believe in that HTML doesn't have
logical handlers yet, right?

LRK:: important: continuing the theme of show the author what's happening,
show the noframes content together with the frame content to check them
visually.
