Last of the comments

there are just a few comments here

.  As before, I've labeled comments as "minor: signficicant", "important"

This has most text of original.  I've preceded my comments with LRK:: so
you can quickly skip to them.  Especially needed here since my comments are
pretty sparse.

direct accessibility.

LRK:: important:  probable error if <TD> is followed by <input> of type
text or textblock.
Also probable error if <input> radio buton s followed by </TD>, <TD>, or
<TR> without intervening text.

LRK:: significant: visually group apparent label.  For text labels, it's
the text before it.  For checkboxes and radio buttons it's the text after.

LRK:: important: this brings to mind a generic sugestion:  to display
priority of all checkpoints.  This one is a priority 3 for example.

>(This looks like something that the editor should check for.)

LRK:: significant: it's also something that the validator will check given
the doctype.  So this becomes a requirement on the doctype.

>(Should we notify user of this? For every page?)

LRK:: significant: only if problems identified by automatic or manual means
remain.  This means that user must have way to manually check off checks
done by hand.l
