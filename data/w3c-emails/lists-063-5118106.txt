I think we need to add a section after Abstract/Status explaining the

Structure of this document

This document uses the _WCAG checklist_ as a base for examining the
checkpoints and when necessary, it provides a sub-checkpoint listing
to address particular techniques. 
For each checkpoint or sub-checkpoint, it gives:
 - Title 
 - Definition (important for sub-checkpoint)
 - Evaluation techniques (what is suspicious, invalid, etc)
 - Suggested Language (for end-users of evaluation tool)
 - Repair techniques (for tool programmers)
 - Link to test files
