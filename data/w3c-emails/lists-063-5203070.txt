Thanks bruce for observing that 

>Betsie also could not handle a page that is currently giving Lynx fits at

I took a look with lynx.

This page has two frames, one of which is actually blank, to wit (or witless)
   <HTML>
   <HEAD>
        <TITLE>Untitled</TITLE>
   </HEAD>
   <BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
   </BODY>
</HTML>        

So we could add a repair rule: omit blank frames 

And as special case, if there's just one frame, release it from it's shell.

Actually, I think WAG in effect did this by concatenating frames into a
single page.... I'll have to take a look... gotta run now...

There's also some images with no alt text.

Otherwise reads OK.
