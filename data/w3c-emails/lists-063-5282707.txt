There's a  module that implements JavaScript in the CPAN Perl archives.
Here's the synopsis:

FreeWRL JS/js/README 

Contained in: FreeWRL-0.14.tar.gz

    FreeWRL JS/js/README 

DESCRIPTION 

        This is the README file for the JavaScript Reference (JSRef)
implementation.
        It consists of build conventions and instructions, source code
conventions, a
        design walk-through, and a brief file-by-file description of the
source.
       
        JSRef builds a library or DLL containing the JavaScript runtime
(compiler,
        interpreter, decompiler, garbage collector, atom manager, standard
classes).
        It then compiles a small "shell" program and links that with the
library to
        make an interpreter that can be used interactively and with test
.js files to
        run scripts.
