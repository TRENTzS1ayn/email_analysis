Leonard--
point taken-- the minimal hack would open up things that are
currently closed to the lynx user.
The reason I wausi-dismissed it is that in my Emacs-centric
world I simply "show source" in the W3 browser, look for the
URL inside the javascript tag, and hit enter over it to
follow the link.

The validating form example is a little harder-- but not too
much-- I've got a personal perl proxy that cleans such junk
out for me.

There is room for a good open source project that
incorporates betsy and friends into an open and extensible
"personalized proxy" framework-- might be a good  project
for the WAI to take on-- (though I wont hold my breath
--given the track record so far)
