I started to look at the issue a few weeks ago myself.

I am currently working with a free local (i.e., user side) proxy
for Windows 95 called the Proxomitron:

http://members.tripod.com/Proxomitron/

It can transform incoming and outgoing HTTP headers and incoming 
HTML files.

It is based on search-and-replace with regular expressions.
It comes with some HTTP and HTML transformation rules, and I am
working on writing some more.

Nir Dagan
