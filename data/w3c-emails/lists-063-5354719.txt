My experience (working with other W3C groups, like Ecommerce) is that
there isn't a portable solution for client-side proxy, and you have to
adapt your setting and filter to IE, to Netscape, to Lynx, etc.

For Lynx, for instance, there's a way to compile it (so not supported
in every binaries) so that it recognizes some URI schema (say
xhttp://) as special and runs a filter thru them. See lynx documentation.

For Emacs/W3, you need to write you own piece of elisp.

For Netscape, there's a panel (Automatic Proxy Configuration) that
let's you play with client side script. (see
http://www14.netscape.com/navigator/admin/v3.0/proxy.html)

etc.

It's too bad that there isn't a simple client side CGI interface,
fired thru some .mailcap file, like for helpers, that would let anyone 
install a filter on the client side.
