I just installed a Copy of Silas Brown's Web Access Gateway at

http://shelob.ocis.temple.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/iod01/wag/access.cgi

Sorry for that loooong url.  You better bookmark it!

NOTE: the HELP button is not working at the moment but you can get a good
idea of what wag does by pressing the other options.  

Our (front-ended) copy of Wayne Myers' Betsie remains at

http://shelob.ocis.temple.edu/inst_disabilities/betsie.html

Both of these are tools to improve the accessibility of pages to people who
are blind or have low vision.
