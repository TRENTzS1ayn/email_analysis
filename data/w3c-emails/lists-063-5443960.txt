Only commenting 1.1 for now.

Instead of 
>  Valid ALT text:

I would call that:
  Evaluation of ALT text

and make a H5 out of it.

>  Not allowed - NULL ALT value (ALT="") 

Was that the consensus when it was discussed on this list ?
Why is it not allowed while " " is ?

>  Language for missing ALT text: Missing ALT text for image
>  Language for suspicious ALT text: Suspicious ALT text for image

This is language for what usage exactly ?

>  Suggestions for possible ALT text:
>  Other checks:

I would make that another heading, same level as Analysis, called
  "Repair of ALT text"

This way, for each (sub)checkpoint, we have an Evaluation section and
a Repair section, clearly delimited.

I think it's OK to have a complex image which is described in running
text, rather than at the other end of a longdesc URI.
