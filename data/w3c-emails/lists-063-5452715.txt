This is a great start!  Thanks Len and Chris!

My initial comments on Guideline 1 from URL:
http://aprompt.snow.utoronto.ca/docs/Implementation.html#Technique1.1.A

> Not allowed - NULL ALT value (ALT="")

I could agree with you.  There have, of course, been numerous arguments 
that "content-free" graphics DON'T exist.  I won't get into this, except to 
(again) point out that ALT="" is really most problematic with the graphic 
is part of a link.

> Allowed - ALT value of 1 or more spaces (ALT=" ")

Both of the above rules are in direct conflict with the Techniques for 
WCAG!  Please check out URL:
http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TECHS/#spacer-images

Which says:
> If content developers cannot use style sheets and must use invisible or 
transparent images (e.g., with IMG) to lay out images on the page, they 
should specify alt="" for them.

I disagree (rather vigorously) with the suggested text for bullets and 
horizontal rules.  ALT (alternate) should replace function and not form.

* 2. If the width of the image and the height of the image are both less 
than 20 pixels, suggested text should be "bullet".

Suggested text should be "-" or "." or "*" or "+"!

* 3. If the height of the image is less than 20 pixels and the width of the 
image is greater than 150 pixels, suggested text should be "horizontal 
rule".

Suggested text should be "----"!

We could recommend that authors include the "TITLE" attribute (which 
should, if included, be "bullet" or "horizontal rule").  It is not clear to 
me that any browsers support the use of TITLE for images though...
