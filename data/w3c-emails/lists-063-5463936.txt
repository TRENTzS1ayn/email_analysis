Bruce,

We are trying to stay in sync with the WAI guidelines so to follow
http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TECHS/#spacer-images:

ALT="   " (1 or  more spaces) is NOT allowed.
ALT="" (NULL) IS allowed for spacer images.

The WAI techniques also suggest that the ALT text for spacer images be
"spacer". I like this better than the NULL text. I propose that I modify
technique 1.1.A so that NULL ALT text is suspicious and if found, the user
is prompted with: "ALT text for this image is NULL. If the image is used for
spacing use 'spacer' as the ALT text."

That sounds fine to me. It makes it more language independant.

This may be added complexity for something that is not used. Can we drop
this recomendation?
