Sure, sounds clearer to me.

Please see my previous message. If there's agreement, I'll change this ER
technique to conform to the WAI techniques. (NULL is allowed. Spaces are not
allowed).

When an evaluation and/or repair tool encounters the problem, it will inform
the user using this language. We don't want A-Prompt to say one thing and
Bobby to say another. For example: If Bobby said 'Missing ALT text for
image' while A-Prompt said 'Picture does not have descriptive text' the user
could be confused.

I was hoping the language could clearly describe the accessibility problem
so the user would know what's wrong. I'm not sure that 'ALT text' is a good
way to describe the value of the ALT attribute to the user. What about
'descriptive text' or just 'description'?

Sounds sensible. If there's agreement, I'll modify the document.

I agree. Perhaps we could change the user prompt to: "Complex images require
a long description. If the document text does not adequately describe the
image, please create a complete description of the image."?
