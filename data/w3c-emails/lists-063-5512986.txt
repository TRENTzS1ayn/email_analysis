Do complain!

We've been asked by the guidelines group to document for them issues that
arise as we peruse the requirements.   I'm the point of contact on that.

I'll be documenting and sending them as soon as either

a. we reach a single consensus on a view that differs from the guidelines or
b. reach stabilized differing viewpoints.

So, what do folks think of Bruce's point of view?
