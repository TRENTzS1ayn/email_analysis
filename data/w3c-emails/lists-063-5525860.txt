The rule we should try to enforce is checkpoint 1.1, not something in
the technique document, which is not a stable reference.

  Provide a text equivalent for every non-text element

I disagree, you might have no need for ALT text other than "" even for 
an isolated image link.

For instance, on www.whitehous.gov: (that's not what you actually get
there, there's currently no ALT at all, but you would get something
like that under lynx, with ALT and [] used to show link)

which is a little redundant, not to say annoying

with ALT="", you get just the right information:

   [The President & Vice President]:
   Their accomplishments, their families, and how to send them
   electronic mail 

   [Interactive Citizens' Handbook]: Your guide to information about
   the Federal government

   [White House History and Tours]:

   and Tours -- Tour Information

   documents 

In a sense, the wording: 

 Provide a text equivalent for every non-text element

fits my example, since in that case, the equivalent is "".
since the description/function is already inline, next to the image,
but not in the same A
