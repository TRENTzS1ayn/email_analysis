Daniel brings up the case where an adjacent image and text point to the
same place.

I agree it's redundant to have both links.  However, even if you replace
the ALT text with "", there's still a problem.  The user will hear that
there's a link there.  For example, in Lynx with numbers on there will be a
number.   So they'll know it's a link, but hear that there's no ALT text.  

First of all, this adds a bit of  clutter.  Second of all, it will I think
decrease user's confidence that it's accessible, hearing a link with no ALT
text.

In general, I think the better solution is to include the image and text
within a single <A> </A> pair.

The white house page has a complication, however, since the image and text
are in separate table cells, and this would require the link to start
before a cell and end in the middle of the cell, which is illegal.

A way around this is to put the image and text in the same cell with the
image floated left.  An example using the  align=left attribute is shown at

http://astro.temple.edu/~kasday/web_access/examples/whitehouse2.html

Of course, align=left is deprecated, but since the whole thing uses a table
which is deprecated in favor of style sheets, that doesn't really matter.

The best solution would use style all the way, except that not all browsers
support style... but thats another story.  Please start a new thread if you
want to discuss style sheets).
