I realy do not understand the idea behind:

Not allowed - NULL ALT value (ALT="")
Allowed - ALT value of 1 or more spaces (ALT=" ")

Both from a semantic/logical point of view and HTML specification 
these are quite the same thing.

My major reservation with this guideline is that there may be out there 
many people who took the effort to write accessible pages with alt=""
where appropriate, and now we tell them to revise their pages, without
any reason whatsoever.
