This depends on the UA.

An smart UA could completely drop the ALT="" image link, after
checking that the A href for the img is the same as some other very
close textual A.


Note that this technique of adjacent logo pointing to the same
resource as an adjacent textual equivalent is common on the web, and
often it uses two A, not one, for implementation reason (alignment,
table layout, etc) that we can't easily ignore.
