[good summary; may I offer the following tweaks:]

The hiding of items with ALT="" is under user control; it can be switched off.

Screen reader users require that their systems be able to pronounce
punctuation, but a lot of the time they run with punctuation skipped.
Similarly, the ability to suppress all mention of the most insignificant
images is regarded as a benefit by many users.

I agree that warnings can and should be issued without a strict violation
of a WCAG checkpoint.

On the terms of reference of "the current debate" I wonder if you have
drawn such a fine line that you actually managed to miss the mark.  I
believe that the document Chris is maintaining is supposed to serve as a
common reference; both for tools which check existing HTML and for checking
which is performed seamlessly as one creates new material in an authoring
tool.  Even that can be either by writing HTML text or by triggering
generation of HTML text.  In that sense, the debate is not about what the
generator "starts with," but rather what the checks accept, IIRC.

Chris, Daniel: can you clarify this?
