I like the idea of a smart UA surpressing a picture link that's near and
equal URL-wise to a text link, but couldn't it do that more generally, even
if ALT is not ""  ?  User configurable of course.  ACtually, this is a
potential ER repair tool feature idea which, like all repair tool features,
would have use in the user interface

As for associating a specific behavior with ALT="", we could try to
establish that convention, but I think it would be better to use Aural CSS,
with the Speaking property set to "none".

cf.

http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/aural.html#speaking-props

Yes, it would take longer for this to come to pass, but it would take a
long time to promote specific meaning for "" vs " "

By the way, what about "    "  or
"
"
Would they be semantically the same as " "
