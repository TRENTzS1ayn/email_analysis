The list was started as a mean to specify techniques for auto or
semi-automatic evaluation of checkpoints (as used by Bobby).

Chris came in with the additional requirements that we look at
suggested checkpoint repair techniques during the authoring process
(for A-prompt).

I think it's fine to treat both kind of issues at the same time, as
long as we separate them in different section in the resulting
document.
