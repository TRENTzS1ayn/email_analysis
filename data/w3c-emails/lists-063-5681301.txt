I believe that the word used is "may," not "can."  I believe that what the
editors of the HTML specification were trying to get across was how to work
around a fact of current implementation.  Something like:

"Although a strict SGML interpretation of the CDATA type would indicate that 
' myval ' and 'myval' are distinguished values, users of HTML should be
aware that implementations may treat ' myval ' as if it were 'myval'.

Note that this situation is not symmetrical.  Implementations will likely
strip, but not likely add, leading or trailing whitespace in extracting
attribute values.

AG::

I think you have to distinguish "leading whitespace" from "initial
whitespace" to parse this situation correctly.

In other words, leading whitespace is whitespace preceding the first
non-whitespace character, and trailing whitespace is whitespace occurring
after that last non-whitespace character.  Neither are present in " ",
although it meets the criteria both for initial and final whitespace.
