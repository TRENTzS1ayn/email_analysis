This is a good summary Len. Let's hope the WCAG folks can provide some
clarity on these issues.

There are the related issues regarding images used for bullets and
horizontal rules. You mentioned that in a small survey in 1997 there were
inconclusive results about which ALT text to use in these cases. Should we
try to run the survey again and hope to get more conclusive results? Could
we ask the WCAG people for their input?

Chris
