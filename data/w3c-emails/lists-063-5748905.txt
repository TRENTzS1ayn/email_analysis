I've developed a "Check Your Page" tool on my website, which is based on the
City of Brea analysis that Kynn Bartlett did for the FedWeb '99 conference back
in April.  

My office, which provides governmentwide policy support, has received many
requests for assistance from agency CIOs regarding the DOJ Section 508
self-evaluations (the Rehab Act Amendments of 1998 required the Attorney General
to report on the state of acessibility of government IT by February 7, 2000).

Following the "Check Your Page" link will provide a form for you to enter a
short one or two word title for referencing your page, and the URL for your
page.   Once you submit the form, you may need to hit the refresh/reload button
on your browser in order to have your page appear in the list.  There is an
agent that runs every hour that will delete files that are between one and two
hours old, so that the database won't get too large.

Please comment as soon as possible -- please do not distribute this too widely
while it's still in development.  I'd like to make a more formal announcement by
the end of next week (July 9).

Thanks,
Karl
