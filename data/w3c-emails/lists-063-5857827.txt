Hi,

Having eventually found some of the more informative pages on peepo.com,
such as:

http://www.peepo.com/signbrowser/signbrowser.htm

http://www.peepo.com/signbrowser/batterseasecindex.htm

and especially

http://www.peepo.com/signbrowser/scimuvisit.htm

I very much agree with Silas and

I am feeling very red-faced and embarrassed and apologetic for having been
so rude and catty in my earlier posting today, which may have cast doubt on
the seriousness of the peepo.com project. My profuse apologies to Jonathan
and to all concerned for that. Mind you, I still stand by my comments to the
effect that even this kind of a site ought to make proper use of ALT
attributes.

Well, that'll teach me to send rude emails. Apologies again.

Cheers etc.,

Wayne
