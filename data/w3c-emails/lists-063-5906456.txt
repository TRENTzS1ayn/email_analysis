Here, here Len!

I have been cringing at this discussion equating LD with low intelligence.
In fact, as Len points out, LD is defined as disparities between overall
intelligence and performance in specific areas.

The solution? The key is redundancy. Just as a site should not be all
graphics, it shouldn't be all text either. By presenting information in
multiple formats (text, images, sound, etc) ensures access to the widest
group of people. It is not about "dumbing down" the material.

Subject:Re: How can we better accommodate learning disabilities?

I'm not an expert in learning disabilities by any means. Also, from what
I've seen, "learning disabilities" is a complex and somewhat controversial
subject.  Definitions here in the US may differ from those in the UK.  But
here's my opinion.

First of all, at least by definitions common in the US, people with
learning disabilities can have average or above average intelligence
overall, but with difficulties in rather specific areas.  In fact, by
definition, a learning disability exists only when a specific ability is
below what is expected on the basis of overall intelligence.  So in general
it should be possible to construct web pages that accommodate people with
learning disabilities.  In fact, many well designed pages should be
accessible as is.

Also, there's the case of people who may have difficulties with written
English because their native language is sign language (e.g. ASL).  One
person I knew for example, a college grad, was very bright, and you'd never
suspect just speaking with her (she read lips) that she had any
difficulties--but she was often frustrated that her reading level was well
below college grad level (at least that's how she felt about it).  This is
another case where these folks are just as smart as anyone else and
perfectly able to understand anything that might be on a web page, provided
the right accommodations are made.

If there are folks on the list with more info in this area, please fill us
in.
