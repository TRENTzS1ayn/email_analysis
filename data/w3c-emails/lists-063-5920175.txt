Can we translate this into tools?  For example, there are "screen readers"
for people who are not blind but have difficulty reading because of a
learning disability.  These typically highlight text as they read.  For
example

monologue http://www.firstbyte.davd.com/html/monolog.htm
WYNN http://www.austin.ibm.com/sns/wynnibmnews.html
Zoom Text Xtra http://www.aisquared.com/  (actually designed for low vision
but also useful for dyslexia)

Are there problems using these with web pages?  Problems that a tool would
help?

There were suggestions about other accommodations a few emails back at
