I am grateful for the time taken by group members to contribute their thoughts on LD and our site www.peepo.com. I agree with everything so far contributed.

Our site is a search aid without text, please advise me of others.
It would be helpful if members continued to send me suitable links for inclusion.

The nearer a website reflects a real world activity the more popular. Soaps are very hot. Music sites also. The morphing of well known persons faces was universally thought  funny and helped teach point, drag and click skills.

There is a huge range of ability within LD, exhibiting both dramatic and strange lacunae. Generally I should say that the more able adults with LD are able to operate in the real world, but at a marginalised level. They are in the main excluded from the www.
The personal requirements of the LD individual suggest that the browser should be able to match ability to the sites content, probably at first through defining needs.
Disposable income is not a primary consideration of marginalised populations, and advertisers are unlikely to make fortunes (from banners) in the initial stages of implementation.

Specialist suppliers of icons include Terry Johnson of Mayer-Johnson www.mayer-johnson.com. 
Personally I have found that excluding cultural artifacts any 'simple' icon that is transparent to the untutored eye is accessible.
