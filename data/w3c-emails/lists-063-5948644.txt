Presenting information in multiple formats is surely important. Another
important issue is the overall usability of the site. How to get the "big
picture" of the site, how to navigate within the site, how to find the
information that you are interested in, how to tailor the site to show the
information and site structure in a format that is most helpful to you etc.
Some of this might depend on the group of users the site is intended to but
many issues are quite general.

Today many sites make it difficult for the users to know where they are,
where they can go to and how they got there. With at least some kind of
learning disabilities I would think that the difficulties are even greater.
