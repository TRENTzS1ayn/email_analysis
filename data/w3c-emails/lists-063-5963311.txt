I am a little unsure how it is intended that views on documents be shared.
If I should be looking elsewhere please advise me.
 

Having studied the relevant parts of http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-19990226/  these are my thoughts
 
0.0 
    Where possible sites should be transparent in meaning without the use of text.
    ~1-5% of the adult population are non-readers.
 
1.0  Provide text equivalents for text.
    ensure that the minimum text is used that conveys the meaning, with links to details.
    ~50% have a vocabulary of 2k words.
 
1.01
    Provide data in site titles (meta tabs) as to number of words used and readability (flesch reading ease).
 
1.1   
    Provide a means in the common browsers for:
    turning off text labels (ALT) for non-readers.
    excluding complex or lengthy sites (1.01), conversely trite or youthful ones
 
z.z
    Provide tabs for text in HTML
