Jonathan mentioned some facts about vocabulary and page complexity. E.g.
people whose vocabulary is less than ~2k words.

Are there lists of these words.  Perhaps the evaluation tool could do a
count of words outside the list for its ratings.   Or, getting a bit more
sophisticaed, if there's a list of probabilities that words are outside a
persons vocabulary, then the measure could be the statistically expected
number of words outside the vocabulary.

There are various automated reading level measures around.  Would any of
those help?

And I wonder if it would be possible to automate a measure of layout
complexity?  I remember there were measures like that in the old literature
associated with forms on dumb terminals.

Going further with this, how about measures of site complexity?

Anyone know of any literature here?
