Phill will be there.

Phill can be found at the IBM booth 45 & 46, staying at the Marriot
You will also find me during session 98 in the Atlanta/Boston room Thursday
10:40am
http://www.dinf.org/csun_99/session0098.html

I might also be able to reserve the IBM suite, if the group is small
enough, for the er-ig group to meet.

I would like to suggest that er-ig group meet after the Dardailler and
Clark session 195  Saturday 9:20-10:20am in the Denver room in the Marriott
