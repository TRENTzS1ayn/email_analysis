OK got the picture.  I've now added an option to remove ALT tags.  It's 
under Options and it's disabled by default; if you're using it then make 
sure you also disable the sight-related options as obviously the two 
interests conflict.  Alternatively just go to 
http://epona.ucam.org/~ssb22/altless.html and put a URL in the box.  The 
rsulting page can be bookmarked etc.

Hope this helps.
