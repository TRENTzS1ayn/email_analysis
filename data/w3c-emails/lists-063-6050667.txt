Thanks for the offer Phill, but W3C groups cannot meet on an adhoc
basis like that, without informing the membership several weeks in
advance. Anti-trust regulations are watching us!

Lunch is OK, as long as it's informal.

WAI has already scheduled meetings for Saturday/Sunday (including a
update on ER on Saturday afternoon).
