Well personally I find spelling checkers so annoying that I don't use 
them unless I really, really have to.  Especially if they're American.  
Maybe I'm just picky.

It's quite possible that some time in future computers may be more up to 
this task, but from what I've seen, they're not at the moment and 
probably won't be in the next few months or so at least (as far as I 
know this is not a "far futures" group - in the far future, the web will 
be in a completely different form anyway if indeed it still exists).

I don't really understand that sentence.  Are you suggesting that the 
content of pages be changed, by automatically changing statements like 
"This is a green bus" to "This is a red bus"?  Why?

> Chess has been solved to a human degree.

At least Chess has much fewer rules than general understanding.  The 
latter would take a bit longer to solve.  I would suggest that the day 
it is fully solved is the day Commander Data walks on the scene.

"It is one of the great tragedies of our society that from fear, poor
 teaching, or lack of motivation the vast majority of people have shut
 themselves off from the mathematical poetry and music of nature.  The sweeping
 vista that mathematics reveals is denied to them.  They may delight over the
 scent of a rose or the colour of a sunset, but a whole dimension of aesthetic
 experience is foreclosed to them." - Paul Davies, in "Superforce: The
 Search for a Grand Unified Theory of Nature"
