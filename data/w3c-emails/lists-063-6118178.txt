Summary: My recent experience using Netscape Navigator 4.5 suggests that 
writers of product documentation, including online help, may be
writing oblivious of accessibility issues. We should include
such in any product evaluation.

Curious, I tried it. Sorry for redundancy.

Anecdote: NSNavigator Index obscures how to turn images off. After about 
5 minutes trying to use their index (trying images, graphics, loading, 
download, automatic loading, etc.) I gave up, and searched from the main 
menu to find preferences. I examined each of the choices, finally at the 
bottom was Advanced. Eureka! 
the first checkbox, after finding this path: 
    Edit=>Preferences=>Advanced=>Automatically Load Images
Once I found it, I unchecked it. Didn't seem to have any effect, since the 
images on the refreshed page were still in the cache. Bummer. Weak 
cause and effect test. It did work with different page not in cache. Finally. 
I went back to the index and found "preferences, Navigator" 
In the middle of 15 choices was "Automatic Loading". 
Again under personalizing Navigator, paging down linearly for 35 screens 
(without a subindex) I found Automatic Loading described.
There was no useful content search available in that help system.

Moral: A review of any documentation should include probes for help with 
common accessibility needs.
