If I remember right (don't have all books with me here in Boston). There was
something on this in Helanders book by Tullis

Helander, M. (ed, 1988) Handbook of human-computer interaction. Amsterdam:
Elsevier

Also I think Edward Tufte has written something on this, but I would need to do
more research to find the exact references.

The measurings were based on how much white space the page had and how it was
distributed to form groups. The interfaces were mostly alphanumeric. This
naturally is just the tip of the iceberg. There many important things that
simplify the presentation of data but are hard to measure in a scale.
