Oh right - I thought you were talking about giving a checking device to 
fully-literate web page authors and expecting them to use it.

Four those learning two reed, eye don't think spell checkers and sew

(My checker says that this is perfect, four egg sample.)  Maybe ewe have

Anyway, hope the alt thing's useful.
