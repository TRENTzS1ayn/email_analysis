Although it wasn't Harvey's main point, his finding about how hard it is to
turn off images (needed by some screenreaders) suggests another useful tool
feature: to replace images with their alt text... or to put the ALT text
next to the image on the screen.  The latter would be useful for people
with low vision and dyslexia also.
