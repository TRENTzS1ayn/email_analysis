Addressing the last points in reverse order...

I think that feature that turns off ALT text is really neat.  It never
occurred to me with all the effort we go through to add ALT text that it's
an actual problem for some folks.  Very very interesting!

Now on to spell checking...

I personally find spelling checkers very helpful.

It's true that they miss homonyms like reed vs read, but I don't make many
of those errors.  Most of my errors are typos that the spell checker does
catch, e.g. "comlexity".   

And theoretically a spell checker that knew grammar could catch a lot of
the homonyms.  For example, it would catch

  eye don't 

  and knot yet

I don't know if there are any commercial spell checkers like that, but I'd
be really surprised if it weren't already a senior computer science project
somewhere or part of some companies marketing feature wishlist.

(OK so I do make some homonym type spelling errors, like in the last
sentence, but a grammatically informed spell checker would have caught it.)
