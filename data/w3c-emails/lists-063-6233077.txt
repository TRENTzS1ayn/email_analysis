Hi all,

We've posted our latest work on our Web site at
http://trace.wisc.edu/world/web/document_access/.

The following tools are available from this site and will be
demonstrated/presented at CSUN.  We will also be gathering informal
usability results in the curb cuts room.


Headers Power Toy (zip archive)(for Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.x and 5.x) 
     Our power toy allows a user to select a header from a list of headers
to take them to that header in the current page. Developed by Mark Novak. 

Links Power Toy (zip archive)(for Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.x and 5.x) 
     This power toy differs from the power toy provided by Microsoft in
that the alt-text of images used as links is displayed rather than the
document address (URL). Developed by Mark Novak. 

"HelpDB" program (zip archive)(for Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.x and 5.x) 
     Helpdb uses Microsoft's component object model (COM) and several
publicly available application program interfaces (APIs) to communicate and
inter-operate with Internet Explorer version 4.0+ and above. Helpdb does
not expose or allow the user to interact with all elements on a web page.
Helpdb is being developed as a  "proof-of-concept" model, focusing on
improving the ability of users to navigate web page tables, as well as the
user's ability to infer web page "structure" by listing all link, header,
and table elements contained on a particular web page in their order of
occurrence. 

Table navigation JavaScript (for Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.x and 5.x) 
     This script was the proof of concept was the ground work for HelpDB.
It needs to exist on the same page as the  table you wish to navigate, or
it could be included in a frameset and be somewhat persistent on a Web
site. It  was developed by Mark Novak, Jon Reinberg, and Wendy Chisholm. 

Increasing the Accessibility of the Web through style sheets, scripts, and
"plug-ins" 
     Written by Wendy Chisholm and Mark Novak, this paper gives the
background and overview of the work in this  area at the Trace Center. They
will be presenting their most up-to-date results at the 1999 CSUN
conference in  L.A. in March.
