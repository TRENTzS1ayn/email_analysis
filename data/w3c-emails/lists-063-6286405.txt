Hi, yes I did find the idea interesting but that's what I tried and got 
the JavaScript errors on.  I'm afraid that no way am I installing 
Internet Explorer 4.  The reasons for this are:

1.  I have Internet Explorer 2.0 that came with WinNT, and I know that 
if I install IE4 I'll never see IE2 again, knowing Microsoft's 
installation procedures.  I want to make sure that web pages etc can be 
read through old browsers like IE2.  All this "upgrade your browser and 
you'll never regret it" propaganda is no good for people like me who 
want several versions of browsers to co-operate, because not everyone in 
the world can afford to upgrade to IE4.  Yes, I said afford.  The 
download may be free, but the minimum hardware spec isn't, and the phone 
call isn't if you're anywhere other than America.  And if you're stuck 
in one of those Eastern European countries with a 9600 baud modem that 
loads of people have to share, you're not going to be too popular making 
huge downloads.

2.  Internet Explorer 4 has had more security advisories than any other 
piece of software I've seen.  I don't trust it.

3.  I simply don't have the disk space.

4.  I think it might try to take over Netscape as well.  You know what 
MS are like.

Regards
