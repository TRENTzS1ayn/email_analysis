More explanation on how to install it, but not really on how it
operates (which may be evident if you know the MS PowerToy technology)

I understand there are two different pieces: the attachment/firing
itself, which is done using the Windows registry and some MS
javascript hacking, and the script itself, parsing and generating the
Hx clickable index for instance.

Do you have a pointer on how the first part (menu attach + javascript
defer stuff) works (I guess the MS PowerToy home page should be it) so
that the second part can more easily be adapted (once one knows the
dependencies on the first part and can get rid of them).

I guess a gateway could insert the script piece up front plus a
"create a Hx navigation window" to replace the window/registry stuff
eventually.

Are you planning to achieve any porting at Trace ?

 
Interesting work in any case, thanks for the announce.
