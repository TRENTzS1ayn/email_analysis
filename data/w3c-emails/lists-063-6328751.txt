HTTP agents don't need to know about this at all.  The only people who 
need to know about this are the ones who write gateways.  That's why 
using something like Warning would probably not be a good idea, because 
other agents might think they're too clever and do something, whereas 
actually they're not supposed to know.

How did the Standard for Robots Exclusion come about?
