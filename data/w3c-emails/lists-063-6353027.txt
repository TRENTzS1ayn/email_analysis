Jonathan, Silas,

I've been reviewing mail here and I think there might have been some
messages which passed between the two of you without getting on the email
list.  In particular, why is it useful to turn off ALT text?  I realize it
has to do with the tags popping up.  But is that a problem because it's
visually distracting or because it interferes with programs that read the
screen with synthetic speech?  Or some other cause?

Please copy your reply to the list

Thanks!

Len
