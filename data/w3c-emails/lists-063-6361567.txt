That's what I understood.  At any rate, it didn't take one minute to add
the feature to the access gateway (I already had a method to remove all
instances of an arbitrary attribute) so as far as I'm concerned it doesn't
really matter what the exact processes are, as long as it makes it easier
for them.  I know from my own use of computers that sometimes something
makes it easier for me but I am unable to explain exactly why (although I
usually have to come up with some half-guessed explanation if I need to
justify it to someone).

Accessibility means you can have it your way and everyone else can have it
theirs.
