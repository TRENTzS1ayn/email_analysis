Seems to me that Silas's suggestion of a mediator warning in the heading
could be generalized to "hints" in general for any part of a page.  For
example, a way of marking a table that it being used only for layout or to
kluge a list.  E.g. a CLASS convention.


(I realize of course that we want people to use CSS for layout, lists, etc,
but I don't think that's realistic till nearly all browsers and designer's
favorite tools support CSS.  Please start a new thread if you want to
comment on that).

Browsers could also use the hints.  However, it's probably better to not
push this while browsers are implementing other things.

p.s.
BTW, I left the "Re" out of "[was RFC for mediator warnings ]" because the
w3c mail archive system fails to index it under the new heading when the
"Re" is in there.  A bug.
