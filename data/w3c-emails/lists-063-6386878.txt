In the soon-to-be-closed Content Guidelines are two statements that
should form the basis for considerable by this group and the ERWG:

"...checkpoints describe verifiable actions that may be carried out by
the author..."

"The checkpoints have been written so that it will be possible to verify
when they have been satisfied."

Although it is not stated, for some it will be implied that
"verification" could be automated.  In other words one of our jobs
should be to identify any checkpoints that can be objectively validated
and perhaps even supply a further set of points that explain how to
subjectively verify compliance.  It is not enough to simply state that
it will be possible to verify without giving some clear "how-to"
instructions explicit to *all* the guidelines.

It is quite clear that merely testing for the presence of ALT attribute
is inadequate without author cooperation but there are many items that
can be machine-tested - hence Bobby.
