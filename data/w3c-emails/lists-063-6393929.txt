Here's the priority 1 checkpoints from 

http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH/full-checklist.html

With first cut at to answer:  Can these be automatically validated for
priority 1 checkpoints? 

The "automatic" assumes we do NOT have natural language understanding
capability in the software.

The answer to whether they can be objectively verified is "yes" unless
otherwise noted.

Arguments are welcome!

No.  But you can warn if text changes color without semantic markup.

Partly.  Can verify e.g. nesting of H1 H2 etc.  Cannot verify if blockquote
is for format only.

yes

yes.  Tho you need objective definition of "flicker".  E.g. if just one
character blinks it's not "flicker".  If background turns on and off it is.
 Whats the boundary?

yes, assuming the change is via tag

no.  I doubt if this can be done objectively either.  Although there are
automated "reading level" indices that could be applied.

not completely.  You can check if there's text, but not if it's really
equivalent.  And the tool can help a human judge.

Somewhat.  You can check for strings of common ascii art and blocks made of
non alpha characters.

Not completely.  You can tell if longdesc exists.  But not if important
info was conveyed. But you can help a human judge

Partly you can check for column headers, but you don't know if rows should
have headers.

Yes.  But, is special markup really needed for simple cases?

To some extent, although you can't tell if the content changed appropriately.

Partly.  Can verify if there is a title, but not if title is usable to keep
track.  e.g. title="message" better than title="fqz001"

Partly. You can verify that something is offered as substitute, but not
that it's equivalent.  Still tool can help judge.

Partly. Can verify there's something but not if it's equivalent. Still tool
can help judge.

Partly, as usual can verify there's equivalent but not that it's
semantically equivlent, tho you can perhaps give tool to help.

BTY,  why do we insist on w3c technology only in the guidelines?  Isn't it
enough to be accessible?
