I've heard some sites say don't do it (it's not linking, but inlining).  
Others are only too keen.  Best thing is to write to them or see if they 
have a policy on their web page I suppose.  NB copyright is a tricky 
thing on the Internet because it's international.  For example, there 
are differences between Britain and America.

Do you mean word counts in links?  If you've got the page (and you need 
the page to have the meta tags), you can run a wordcount anyway.  I can 
also just imagine that these things will suffer from "bit rot" - people 
might put the word counts in but fail to keep them up-to-date.

> my vb spider had to stop counting somewhere

You wrote your own web crawler in VB to find text-free sites?  I'm not 
surprised it went wrong - the web is *very* big and it's not within the 
resources of most of us to run a crawler.

InfoSeek, AltaVista and Lycos tell you the document size (without 
images) with the search results; this isn't a good indicator but it 
might help (eg. a page that's 100k long will probably contain too much 
text).  You could write to AltaVista [1] and ask if they could add a 
feature that tells you the word count of fetched documents (or indeed 
search for documents with less than a certain word count [2]) - they 
seem pretty keen to implement all kinds of things (CJK, translation 
etc).

[1] Do it as an organisation not an individual.  Large companies often 
pay attention to organisations with important-looking acronyms, but 
don't pay attention to individuals.  Writing on paper will probably help 
too.

[2] but you'll probably have problems with frames - you might get quite 
a few hits to frames that just say "Back to home page"....
