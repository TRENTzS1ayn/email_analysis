I had been trying to implement a browser, linked to a database, with
lookahead. It is a search aid, but not in the sense of altavista, much more
a browser.
It does not use text, anyway not more than 30 words per page.
However it is very difficult to find pages on the www that fit this
criteria. Pages need to be accessible to every variety of ability.

To browse the www one needs links. Those sites with links to other suitable
resources are also very rare, as you will realise, these will form the basis
of networking and community.

I can strip out the text and create new and different links, but to enable
the author, somehow one needs to provide the right tools.
