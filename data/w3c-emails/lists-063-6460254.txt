The trouble with that approach is existing browsers won't display the 
image for anything other than IMG.  Perhaps it would be better to put 
the extra information either as extra attributes (eg. <IMG SRC="blah" 
COPY="Never!">) or as comments.  Although personally I don't see what's 
wrong with existing methods (ie. say on the page or in its comments 
whether you mind people copying, and assume "don't copy" if nothing is 
said and/or email the webmaster), unless you want some automatic copier. 
(It would take ages for webmasters to start using any new method on a 
widespread basis, by which time HTML will probably be old stuff)
