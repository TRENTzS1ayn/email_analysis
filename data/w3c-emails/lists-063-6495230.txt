I think you are right to be suspicious of that statement.  Even if you link
to the original site, you are visually incorporating their artwork into
your page.

What's specific about ASP's?  I believe an ASP can output any type of page,
including one with images.

Does a site have to be pictures only to be accessible to non-readers?  What
if they have access to a program that reads the text on the screen?

Also, I don't understand what you mean by your workaround.  What do you
mean by stripping the site?
