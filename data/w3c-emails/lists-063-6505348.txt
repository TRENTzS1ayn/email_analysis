Hi Wendy,

I'm having trouble working the demo of table navigation.

Where the instructions say "move the window to the right hand corner"

you mean move the right hand corner of the window to the screen?  

Or do you mean move the scroll bars so the window is in the lower right of
the table?  What would that mean? Do you mean move vertical scroll bar all
way down, horizontal scoll bar all way  right?

Also, what should I see happen?   Do I need a screen reader for it to
happen?  Or will I see something on the screen?

I'm looking forward to getting it working!

Len
