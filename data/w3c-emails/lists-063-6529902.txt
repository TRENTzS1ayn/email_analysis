I certainly think your ideas are helpful. Could you please supply links as I
am not always sure what you mean?

Two points:

1    We need to represent the whole range of ability from LD through ~2k
word vocabulary and to academic.
This indicates that 'guidlines' for groups will help as indicators but are
mobile.

2    The links between sites are critical, otherwise one effectively is
limited to a number of intranets. Isolated sites that will be difficult to
browse to.
