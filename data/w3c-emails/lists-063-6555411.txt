So in the ideal world, clicking on the pictures could bring up ASL videos,
which would accomodate people who are reading disabled and people who are
deaf as well.

Or to icons written with semantic compaction (Minspeak) (described at
http://www.prentrom.com).  I don't know how well people with LD can use
this system.

Aside from those cases, I can't think of any way of communicating more than
a fraction of the informtion by icons alone.
