hi Len

Wendy is on her way to CSUN, and since I'm not traveling to CSUN until
tomorrow, I thought I'd try to assist with your question.

The trouble with the "script" demo of table navigation is that nothing will
happen until you get the table to take focus.  Since tables are not active
elements, this can be a trick to get to work.  What I do, with some success,
is click and drag across the table with the mouse, and then double click in the
table, and then press the "tab" key.   If you are successful with this, you
will
have a 2nd small window pop-up, which contains text about the web page
table, and as you then navigate around in the table (by using the arrow
keys) the text in the 2nd pop-up window will change accordingly to reflect
the cell/header content.

Note, this method seems to work best in IE 5, but it is the same thing
I've used for IE 4 or IE 5.  Also,  you do not "need" a screen reader for
this to work.    Can you try this and tell me if you are more successful?

Also, the executable program, HelpDB, on the same web page, will also allow you
to navigate tables, and doesn't have the limitations the script has for
getting the table to take focus.  The readme and install text files
which hopefully explain its use in more detail download with the ZIP file.
