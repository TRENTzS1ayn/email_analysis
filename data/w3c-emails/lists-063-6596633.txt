I am not particularly concerned for my own copyright, though I prefer
inlining as it maintains connections.
I would like to be able to inline link to say disney pages using a disney
image.

As it is intended that the browser should be able to have access to the
'whole web' it is not practical to ask individual sites for permissions.
