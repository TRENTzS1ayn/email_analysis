Is this so that your browser can automatically grab the logo from the site
and display in in your browser?  So a person could say do a search and get
a bunch of logos automatically extracted and then click on a logo to get to
its site?

If thats the purpose of the site it may affect the legal question.  After
all, search engines routinely quote the first few lines of pages they find
without violating copyright.  So if a search engine quoted an image, it may
be legal. 

BUT I'm not a lawyer.  I just give the above observation to mention to a
real legal expert. My basic point is that the answer can depend on what you
do with the image.

And as an unrelated point: Of course, sometimes the image will be an image
of text so ideally you'd want something that distinguishes  that.

Yes, I was a bit U.S.-centric with my ASL comment.
