Hi Michael, 

Another thing I'd really like to hear on the the list of proposals
concerning learning disabilities at

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/1999Mar/0078.html

Especially since CAST has folks that are particularly knowledgable in this
area.

Some of these have a repair orientaion, but those could also be converted
into an evaluation orientation.  E.g. instead of adding white space around
logical groupings, check for white space around logical groupings.
Assuming that such a measure is useful of course.

I'll no doubt run into you at CSUN also.  You can see what I look like at
