Not too well I'm afraid.  I've been having a rather nasty fever and 
generally haven't got much done, and I've got coursework etc building 
up.  I might not be able to do it until I go home.  It is a fairly hefty 
thing because I have to learn your source.  BTW I'm not trying to port 
it to Unix or Linux in particular, but standard C++ in general.  
Although if possible I'd like to change as little as possible of it

For integration with the gateway, I really think it would be better if 
the gateway called your database directly, rather than your parser.  
This is because the gateway also has its parser, and there is absolutely 
no point in parsing the HTML four times when it could be done twice.
