I'm not sure in your particular case, but in general, the main reason
people shouldn't do 
  <IMG SRC=http://www.remote.com/path/img.gif ALT=something>

is not copyright but the fact that 
 - you don't know (unless it's explicitly stated) if /path/img.gif is a 
   stable URI or just an implementation detail on the site (and the
   fact that references img.gif on remote.com is stable has nothing to 
   do with that)
 - even the URI doesn't change, the content of the image might change
   (size, pixels: there goes your ALT)
 - the www.company.com server might be down or much slower than yours,
   and if everybody generalizes this technique, users of the web will
   be faced with the lowest quality denominator syndrom: the bandwidth 
   of one given page will be the bandwitdh of the slowest resource on
   that page: a scarry thought.
