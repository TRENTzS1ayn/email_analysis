Hi Silas

This email has two purposes

1. To alert everyone to the impressive feature list of the web access
gateway... we've been mostly talking about the new features.
2. To suggest to Silas to make this info easier to find.

Presently, to  get a description of the gateway, one presently needs to go to 

http://epona.ucam.org/~ssb22/access.html

and choose one of the links to a mirror of the gateway, and then press help

This brings the person to e.g. 

http://146.227.103.30/cgi-bin/access/access?Aesu=1&Ah=Help&Au=

That contains among other things your impressive list of features, which
are implicit in the options

 Enable scripts 
 Use document body attributes 
 Use document font settings 
 Leave frames as they are 
 If leaving frames, make them generic 
 Leave tables as they are 
 If leaving tables, make them generic 
 Enable applets 
 If applets not enabled, don't attempt to process their parameters either 
 Don't change blinking text to bold 
 Don't change underlined text that is not a link to bold 
 Don't change italic text to bold 
 Don't put brackets around links 
 Don't change marquee text into plain text 
 Perform smiley substitution 
 Don't attempt to remove surplus spaces between characters 
 Leave images in links as images 
 Leave image maps as they are 
 Enable style 
 Enable delayed refresh/redirection 
 Repeat ALT tags after images 
 Don't strip NOBR tags 
 Promote headings 

I suggest you include this list of links right up front on
http://epona.ucam.org/~ssb22/access.html

or put a link to it.

Hmmm.

You refer users to 
http://members.bigfoot.com/~silasbrown/access.html
which redirects to 
http://epona.ucam.org/~ssb22/access.html
Which url is is best these days?
