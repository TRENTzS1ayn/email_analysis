DOM, da DOM DOM  - Al 

PS: 

long description:  This is an attempt to evoke the Dragnet radio program
theme, ususally pronounced "dum da dum dum."  The cliche connotes "the plot
thickens."  The perturbation suggests "this calls for a DOM."

long explanation:  The point of the Document Object Model is to be a
repository where the parse results are kept and manipulated.

disclaimer:  This need not affect what you two do with this particular
code.  Just if we were using a parser and API that conform to the W3C DOM,
it helps in turning selected functions into things that can be applied in
the browser, it helps in communicating the results to the vendors of mass
market products, etc.
