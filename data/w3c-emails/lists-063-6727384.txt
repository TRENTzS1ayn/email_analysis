Hi,

I think this might be a misunderstanding.  I never meant I'd take the 
gateway down or anything (although the ssb22 one will have to go down 
as I'm shortly going home, and the others will come down eventually as 
their supporting students disappear).  I only meant I can't sit here all 
day reading W3C messages and patching up other people's source code when 
I'm supposed to be taking an exam and have a fever that won't go away.  
Also I'm about to go home and therefore offline.

I want to do a PhD in universal information access when I graduate, but 
if I spend all my time on this list then I won't graduate.  I'd never be 
able to do anything then.  It seems like I've spent more hours on this 
list than I have on writing the gateway.

As I said, I think of the gateway as just a little program that I had to 
write, not my life's work or pet project.  My pet project, if you like, 
is something rather larger, and I don't want it to suffer because of 
some simple gateway program.  Of course I can keep the gateway going, 
but I can't track all the W3C messages and sort out Altifier and 
everything else as well as having to find a research place (an activity 
that so far has taken something like 3 hours a day and achieved nothing) 
and help all my peers that come knocking on my door and sort out all the 
problems I've got myself and fulfill my musical commitments and sort out 
the Computer Society and the ACCU and write a talk someone's asked me to 
do next week and get ready to go home and catch up on the lectures I 
couldn't see well enough to follow and prepare for exams and sort out 
the hundreds of items on my organiser's to-do lists and all while 
feeling like I'm going to die.

Regards Silas
