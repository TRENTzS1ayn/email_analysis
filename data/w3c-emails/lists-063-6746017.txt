The new release of A-Prompt (Beta 1.0) is now available on our web site and we would like to get some feedback. Please check out the site (http://aprompt.snow.utoronto.ca/) and download the program.

Bug reports, comments or questions should be sent to aprompt@snow.utoronto.ca 

A-Prompt currently repairs 25 items and we have a list of about 10 more that we are still working on.

There are still several issues that haven't been resolved and I'll start to post them on the WAI ER IG list for discussion.

Thanks for your comments and suggestions.

Chris
