Len,

Thanks for the suggestions. I had a look at your site and the lighthouse
site and picked up some good ideas.

The problem now is how do we quantify the colors. On your computer, the
colors are represented by 3 values (red, green and blue) and the values
range from 0 to 255. So what represents a poor visibility red? What values
make up a 'dark' background?

I have a small test program that allows you to modify the background and
text colors and view their RGB values. I'll send you the program in a
following message. If anyone else is interested in the program, let me know
and I'll send it to you.

Chris
