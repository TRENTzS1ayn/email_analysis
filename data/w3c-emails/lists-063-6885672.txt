Good point.

I'd like to add something though. If there's a group of links with ALT="",
then the page should be acceptable only if the text links to the same
places are in a corresponding group.

This is because there are some pages that have the main links at the top,
and then happen to have those same links individually duplicated at various
parts of the page.  For example, the main links may include "contact us",
and further down there could be text:

yabber yabber yabber a link yabber yabber a link  another link ...  If you
have questions _contact_us_.  yabber yabber yabber yabber... some other
link... some other link... yabber yabber ....

So "contact us" is in there but it's a bear to find.

For a real example see e.g.  www.temple.edu.  

In pages like this the links exist elsewhere, but it takes a lot of time to
find them
