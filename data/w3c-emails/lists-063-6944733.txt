We do not yet have a new beta of the Bobby server available for testing. Our
programmer has implemented the revision of the Bobby reports, though, so I'm
attaching the results of a Bobby report run on the CAST home page. This will
give you a quick look at what a report will look like in the final release
of version 3.1. There are still some changes to be made. You will note that
we have not implemented very many of the suggestions we have received. It
simply was not possible in the fime frame for us; our plan is to turn our
attention to these issues in detail as soon as we finish this version and
release an update that has much greater usability soon.
