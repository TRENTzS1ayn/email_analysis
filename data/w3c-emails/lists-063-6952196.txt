I'm not getting an answer when I call this bridge number, or the longfellow
bridge number either.  If anyone sees this during the meeting please call
me at 215 204 2247

and also send email... I'm still trying.

BTW I called the MIT operator who said that probably there are 12 people on
the bridge.
