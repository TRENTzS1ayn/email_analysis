One of the things we talked about today was having Bobby analyze a page
that was uploaded.  The question arose: how could Bobby show the original
page with the images if only the HTML, and not the images, were uploaded?

I constructed a test page at
http://astro.temple.edu/~kasday/erig/localimage.html

It has two references to an image: one is on the server, the other is local.

Using windows 98:

MSIE 4.0 displays both images, including the one on my hard drive e.g.
src="c:\liberty.gif"
NN 4.06 only displays the image on the server.

Therefore, if Bobby is told the absolute local address on the local hard
drive of the page, it would be able to display all the images without
uploading them or retaining them... at least for people using MSIE 4.0 on
Win 98.
