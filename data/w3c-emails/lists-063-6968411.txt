Next meeting: not decided.

- we started late because of MIT bridge problem ("just rings")

then we used the list of issues sent to the list as basis for our
discussion.

- background issue: best is to force the body and put the original
page and its background in a table cell (this way if table color are
not supported, at least the bobby report is readable, and the page
background is lost)

- upload feature for 3.2; need to see how to address the issue of
  attached content (e.g. image) when html is uploaded.
- in this case download seems irrelevant too.
  btw, should download info be there by default ? same with browser
  compatibility (opinions vary in the call on what should be presented 
  by default)

- how feasible is an algorithm for checking contrast background ?
  discuss various techniques using intensity, color blindness
  intelligence, etc. probably not for 3.2 but for 4.0

- issue with less/combining hats: Michael agrees it's bad looking
  today, not sure how much can be fixed this week

- issue with back pointers to the page from the report, for 3.2 probably

- Daniel suggested to put the report first and the content-with-hat later
  only when back link are implemented
  (would also solve unterminated element issue)
  right now moving the toc menu up would be enough

- disclaimer/manual
  people things the bobby approved logo should go after the manual
  checking: Michael to look at that for this release
  discussed idea of keeping approved page in a database

- discussion alt="" for A and AREA and no href in the page (or no
  content in the anchor) 
- Len also suggested for special alt to look at
  the idiosynchracies of popular editors (alt="foo.gif 234K" in FP)

- tentative timeline: 3.2 targeted in 2 months, 4.0 Xmas 99
