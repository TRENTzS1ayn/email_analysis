Yup, sounds like that will work, provided that the user tells Bobby a
starting path, or "local root directory". Bobby can add a
"file://[local-root]" if needed to any partial URL that doesn't already have
a protocol and host. We will have to make sure a field for that exists on
the file upload form. It's possible that the file upload process can
determine this automatically, which would work unless the user used copy and
paste.
