Hello all,

As part of the evaluation and repair process, we need to create a set of specifications for implementing the WAI page author guidelines. The specs would be used by A-Prompt and Bobby in the design of our software. The specs should be written with the following goals:

- precise enough for use by software programmers
- simple enough for everyone to understand and comment upon
- complete implementation of the WAI page author guidelines

I've started a document that might fulfil these goals and would like your comments and suggestions. The doc is stored at:
http://aprompt.snow.utoronto.ca/Implementation.html

This document is not complete and is a rough first draft!

I would like to see the document finished reasonably soon (end of June perhaps) so that we can code the software.

Please take a look and let me know if you have any comments.

Chris
