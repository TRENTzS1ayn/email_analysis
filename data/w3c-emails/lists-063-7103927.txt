Hi Chris,

Great idea!

A thought...

I find it easier to make comparisons than make individual subjective judgements. I would rather say that between a choice of A or B, I found B easier to read. A couple of possible approaches:

Create a series of background pages which have 2 colours on them (vertical or horizontal) and then overlay the same coloured text on both of them. Ask the user to click on the link inside the rectangle that is the easier to read. 

Create a page with 2 frames containing 2 documents with the same text (& colour) but with different coloured backgrounds. Clicking the harder to read page would load in another alternative into that frame space but keep the more readable one in its frame. The page left standing at the end is the most readable one.

Bill

Subject: Color Visibility


We've been looking at the problem of trying to determine what colors are good/bad for web page visibility. As part of the process, we wanted to set up a web site where people could go and 'vote' on several different color combinations. In this way we would get some real world results. Our example site is at:

Please take a look and let me know your comments.
 
I also have a small program the tries to determine whether colors are good/bad visibility for use in web pages. Let me know if you'd like to have a look at it.
 
Chris
