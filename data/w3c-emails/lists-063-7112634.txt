I would like to recommend that you contact the developers at www.colordome.com (intended to be the Alexandra of color resources)
eg http://www.colordome.com/art/aesthet/01ase00.htm

and members of the UK's ColourGroup(UK), yes I am one. http://www.city.ac.uk/colourgroup/index.html

www.lighthouse.org/color_contrast.htm might be relevant.

I am not sure that they will help you, however they are amongst the foremost authorities in the UK.
Projects that members have worked on include: responsiblity for implementing the current upgrade of air traffic contollers monitors.
