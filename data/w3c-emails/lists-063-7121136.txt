Hi Chris,

Thank you very much for setting up this test!
I have a vision between 2% and 9% (legaly blind) and using a screen
magnifier to access the computer. For me bad color combinations and some
type of font styles are the biggest problem in accessing web pages. 
I'm also wondering that on a lot of web sites for the sight impaired there
are bad color combinations. Often I see light yellow on white. 
This has also to do with the color depth. In 16 color depth orange looks
like light yellow. From the visitors to my The Screen Magnifiers Homepage
at http://www.magnifiers.demon.nl 20% of the visitors use a color depth of
256 and 50% of 16 bit. Screen magnifiers perform better on less color depth. 
Another accessibility problem is that a lot of web pages seems to be
designed for a screen resolution 1024x768. This means that users with less
resolution needs to drag on trackbars contineously. 
From the visitors at my web site 22% has a resolution 640x480, 48% 800x600
and only 22% 1024x768.

But back to the color visibility test.
Like me a lot of people will have problems answering the first question
about "your color vision". I don't know if I have any color deficit but I
think it is not normal.

My computer can display 24 bit colors, but I have set color depth to 16
bit. I think you can better ask for the actual color depth setting. It is
possible to retrieve OS, color depth and resolution with JavaScript.

Let me know if the color visibility test starts so I shall ask the visitors
of my web site to do the test.
