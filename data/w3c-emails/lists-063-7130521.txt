I started a similar thread in 
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/1999Apr/0001.html

my plan was to use the checklist directly, but after some discussion
at the face to face, it looks like we need to split further some
checkpoint that are too generic (like 1.1).

> The specs should be written with the following goals:
>

What do you mean exactly by implementation ? It's a little vague.

My goal my to have a page describing the "Techniques for automatic or
semi-automatic evaluation of the WAI WCAG".

I'll comment on the content of this page in a separate message.

Let's try to agree on a format to track this work first.

Sounds like a good target date.
