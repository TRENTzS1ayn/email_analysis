Some comments.

> Guideline 1.1 - Provide a text equivalent for every non-text element.

It's Checkpoint 1.1, not Guideline.

> 1.1.A [priority 1] Images must have ALT text

Yes, we need to split this one.

>    * Suspicious - ALT attribute value ending with the string "bytes" (ALT
>      text is file size)
>    * Suspicious - ALT attribute value ending with strings "gif", "jpg","png"
>      (ALT text is file name)
>    * Suspicious - ALT attribute value of "{short description of image}"
>      (placeholder ALT text)

Ideally we'd need to get some data on ALT value from the W3C Web
Charactirization Activity. We should also look at what the major
authoring tools are doing by default (as placeholder in particular).

> 1.1.B [priority 1] Complex images should have an associated LONGDESC file
> 
>    * IMG element should have a LONGDESC attribute and the value of the
>      attribute must be set to a file name.

Actually, no, it's a URI, which itself can be a local address, as in
longdesc="#desc", pointing to an anchor further down in the page.

>    * If no LONGDESC, ask user if the image is complex and requires a long
>      description.

One hint for that is if the image has a caption of some kind already.

> Valid LONGDESC file names:
> 
>    * Suspicious - does not end with ".txt" or ".html"

No, it's a URI, not a filename, and adding the extention is bad
practice in general (best is to let the client and the server do the
content negociation)

> 1.1.E [priority 1] Applets must have alternative content
> 
>    * Between the APPLET start element and APPLET end element must be a valid
>      text element.
> 
> Valid text element:
> 
>    * Must contain at least one word of ASCII text

Not ASCII, which covers only english, but Unicode.

>    * Suspicious - ALT attribute value of "{applet text goes here}"
>      (placeholder ALT text)

same comment as above, we need to look for actual usage by existing tools.

>    * Must contain at least one word of ASCII text

not ascii

> 1.1.G [priority 1] Frames should have an associated LONGDESC file
> 
>    * FRAME elements should have a valid LONGDESC attribute.

only if pointing to an image and no NOFRAME.
