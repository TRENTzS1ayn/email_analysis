At quick glance this looks promising. It is easy to say which colors are
totally or almost unreadable and which ones are the easiest to read.

To better see the structure I would put the pale normal and dark version of
the color horizontally. Then we would have a symmetric matrix so that it is
easy to see when you don't see a color.

There is still quite a lot of work for the users when they evaluate all the
color combinations. I wonder if something could be done more automatically.
E.g. if I have problems with this brightness combination maybe the others
with similar values have difficulties too.

The size and font of the text and selected display contrast have some
effects to readability also.
