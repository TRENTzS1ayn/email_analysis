Hi Daniel,

Actually, it was my understanding as well that your "'can/cannot/maybe can'
be automated" checklist (evalauto) would continue to sit on the w3c server
and that any comments that someone from the group made would be crossed
linked to the relevant section of the archive list (both ways). For example,
I might send an email to the list...

===================
To: w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org
Subject: evalauto: 1.5
Message:

Regarding:


"1.5 Replace ASCII art with an image or explain it. [Priority 1 or Priority
2 depending on the importance of the information.] ",

I believe that it might be possible to develop a library of well-known ascii
art such as ;-) and 8-) which an evaluation tool could use to detect *some*
ascii art, prompting tools such as A-Prompt could use to throw up a prompt,
and a proxy tool could use to convert to something more accessible
on-the-fly.

Does anyone know off-hand where such a library might already exist that
could be linked to this thread for the benefit of developers?

====================

From the document 'valauto'  one could presumeable click on the link in
section 1.5 and have pulled out a listing of all suggestions and
brainstorming in the archived list that related to that based on the subject
header (including responses in the same thread which begin with re: ...).
That way, anyone involved in this automation such as the Bobby team or Chris
could access these suggestions or initiate brainstorming on whichever
section was relevant to their current task. Ideally, based on your choice,
your query (from the relevant 'evalauto' document section) could result in
either a listing of relevant email headers from which you could drill in, or
a webpage that opened and displayed all resulting messages on the same page
to facilitate copying, pasting, and organizing.

I think this might be the most useful approach as it could grow to be a
living repository of ideas easily accessible by anyone working on one or
more aspects of this challenge. It seems to me that this mechanism would
also be extremely portable to other areas within wai and w3c.

Bill
