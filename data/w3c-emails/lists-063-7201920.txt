To your Check Point 1.1A:
Valid ALT text:
Allowed - ALT attribute value of "" 
Only IF (NOT inside of A HREF) OR link is also referenced via text.  This
can be tested by algorithm, so it is either allowed or not allowed.  (Human
intervention/consideration is NOT needed.)

Suggested for discussion:
ALT="" is NOT allowed.  (This rule is much simpler!)  ALT=" " is
permissible as an alternative.
ALT=" " is treated as "suspicious" and generates a warning to the effect
of: "Is this graphic purely decoration and devoid of content?"

Rational:
With the Lynx text browser, ALT="" hides the image (and any embeded link). 
The image is completely invisible unless one issues a "view source"
command.  Any associate link is likewise invisible, unless one issues a
"view links" command.  (Exception: iff ALL links on a page are hidden in
this way, Lynx will generate a warning message.)
ALT=" " will generate [ ] in Lynx.  This might be viewed as unattractive
and pointless, but at least the user knows that something is there.  If the
[ ] is part of a link, it will (with the default settings) be assigned a
link number and is (in any case) be able to be selected and activated as is
the case with any other hypertext link.

Hello all,

As part of the evaluation and repair process, we need to create a set of
specifications for implementing the WAI page author guidelines. The specs
would be used by A-Prompt and Bobby in the design of our software. The
specs should be written with the following goals:

- precise enough for use by software programmers
- simple enough for everyone to understand and comment upon
- complete implementation of the WAI page author guidelines

I've started a document that might fulfil these goals and would like your
comments and suggestions. The doc is stored at:
http://aprompt.snow.utoronto.ca/Implementation.html

This document is not complete and is a rough first draft!

I would like to see the document finished reasonably soon (end of June
perhaps) so that we can code the software.

Please take a look and let me know if you have any comments.

Chris
