It seems that there HAS been research into which colors are good and bad for
visibility, such as what is described at the Lighthouse site. But this
doesn't carry over very well to the task of text displays on computer
monitors. We need to know the RGB values that make up good/bad color matches
so that we can test web pages for visibility.

I doubt that we will come up with exact values that will be absolutely good
or absolutely bad but we should be able to find color combinations that are
likely good/bad for most people.

The purpose of the color voting is so that we can get some real world data.
We could never hope to test in a lab all the different computer/video
card/monitor/contrast/brightness variables.
