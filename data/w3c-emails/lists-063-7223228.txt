Thanks for the skepticism Bruce.  We want to make sure we're doing
something valid and also not re-inventing the wheel.  Here's my take on this.

You bring up the comparison of a "statistical sample" as opposed to
"volunteer voting".  As I see it, a web survey is a statistical sample,
albeit one that, at least at first glance, isn't controlled.  But academic
studies usually aren't random statistical samples either.  I was an
experimental psychologist in my student days, and I had subjects in
darkened rooms making judgements which I analyzed via various statistical
tests, like t-tests, ANOVA, regression, etc.  But who were my subjects?
Volunteers, mostly my buddies in the psych department, or people I hired
from the undergrad population.   Looking back, there wasn't a single
presbypopic person in the bunch as I recall. Also there's a tradition in
this area, psychophysics, for the experimenters themselves to be the
observers, as "expert observers".

You're right, there has been mainstream usability testing, and expert
opinion, plenty of it.  I tried to find good info a few years ago.  But I
never find anything that I was comfortable extrapolating to web design.
Sometimes the colors were insufficiently specified.  Sometimes the measure
was reaction time rather than judgements.  Sometimes the stimuli were small
geometric shapes.  Some results were expressed as theoretical equations
that were implausible on their face, e.g. equations that depended only on
the ratio of luminances.

On the other hand, those few years have passed and there may be better
research around.  Or the folks at Smith Kettlewell that Al will be putting
us in contact with may know of something better than what I was able to dig
up.  

Still, thanks for reminding use to double check we're not reinventing the
wheel.

Yes, we've got to think about this.

Well, for one thing, approx 10% of males have it to some degree. They may
not know it.   Maybe we should build in a color blindness test... tho it
may be tough to get it to run on screens of unknown characteristics...
hmmm... have to think of that...

There is a classic color blindness test at
http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/8833/coloreye.html

But we're really just concerned with reduced sensitivity to red so we can
do a simpler test.  We'll have to think about that. 


As for more info about existing guidelines and tips about finding subjects:

I posted a request to a color vision mailing list CVNET

http://www.visionscience.com/mail/cvnet/cvnet.info.html

There's a sharware program to tell people who are color blind colors on a
screen
http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA011243/wcolor_e.htm
I'm a bit uncomfortable asking them for their mailing list of registered
users... 

Anyone have further thoughts?
