To: Al Gilman<asgilman@iamdigex.net>,<w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org>

Al's observation suggests the following process:

1. We only include in our recommendations checks that are presently in the
guidelines or techniques document.

2. If we have a suggestion for additional rules or guidance, we bring them
to the attention of the author guidelines (AG) group.

3. When AG puts it in the document, we then add it to our techniques doc.

4. Discussions about pros and cons of new guidelines/suggestions would take
place in AG space.

For starters
All in favor email "Aye"
All opposed email "Nay"

If there are any "Nays" lets etalk about it.
