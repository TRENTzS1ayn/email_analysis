Very true.  It is not clear to me that conditional testing for ALT=""
inside A HREF will be very easy.  I certainly have a hard time stating this
rule simply.

On the surface, missing ALT, ALT="", and ALT=" " all seem very similar.  It
is the behavior of Lynx (as I outline with my previous post) that makes the
distinction so important.

Yeah, but take a look at how this has evolved in the CURRENT version of the
"Techniques"!

>> ALT=" " is permissible as an alternative.

It turns out that ALT=" " is NOT allowed!  I am (more than) a little
confused though, because the (depreciated) example then goes on to use
ALT="&nbsp;"!  Is &nbsp; being suggested as a work around when ALT=" " is
what is actually desired?  (This is contrary to the earlier version which
stressed that " " and "&nbsp;" were logically equivalent with regard to
CDATA attribute values!)
