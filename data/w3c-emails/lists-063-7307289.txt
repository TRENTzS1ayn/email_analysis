I vote "Aye" -- but see my in-line comments!

Al, should we be voting on each of Len's four points -- or do you vote
"Nay" to the whole thing.

Okay, but I hope we all agree that unique links that are hidden by ALT=""
is a problem that IS covered by the WCAG 1.0!

I don't see a problem with breaking down a checkpoint (1.1 in particular)
into several sub-categories that can each be better analyzed.

Correct.  My suggestion that we consider not allowing ALT="" is not
something that is up for debate -- the point is "settled law".  Likewise,
the construct of ALT=" " is not up for debate either as it is explicitly
prohibited.  Both points are covered (Al, thanks for pointing this out) by:
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TECHS-19990505/#spacer-images

I think that Al or Len or Daniel will do a fine job of sharing the job of
"parliamentarian" when someone (like me) suggests something that
incompatible with W3C published documents.
