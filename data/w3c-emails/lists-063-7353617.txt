I seem to have missed out on this rather heated interlude.

The provision of a means to form a quorum, author pages, address
authorities, browse and search directories... are a right.
The means to achieve this is the responsibility of WAI.

Voting is almost by definition excluded, because it is not inclusive.
The presence of a nay is an indicator of need. It is the nays we want to
know about, not the recommendations if you see what I mean.

We do need a large degree of overlap of  means, to enable communication
between abilities. This must be lax or fluid to provide a continuum.
