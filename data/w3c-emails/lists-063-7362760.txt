It would be most helpful if toolbars 'had to be' editable.
Personally I find many buttons do not get used.
Others I would group together.
macro buttons, could be great.

More specifically in an educational context it is helpful to be able to
isolate the aspect of  interest, from the background of the terrifying
unknown, and unknowable.

I imagine that amaya or another has this but again I am not addressing that
point, rather that all should perform.
