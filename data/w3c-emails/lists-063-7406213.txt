Hi,

I'm currently working on an improved version of Betsie, with all kinds of
new features and some currently highly dodgy implementations of them. All
criticisms / suggestions / pointings out of shortcomings / whatever will be
gratefully received; I am hoping to have the new version ready to roll
fairly shortly, but it needs to be better than it currently is.

You can test the new version here: http://dev1.bbc.co.uk/education/access/
and I'd be particularly into hearing what people think the best way to
ensure that everyone can customise it as easily as possible would be, as
well as if there are any more really simple and stupid bugs that I've
missed, or other simple one liners along the lines of:

s/click here/select this link/gis;

that might substantially improve things.

Cheers etc.,
