The modified checklist (serving as start page into our eval technique
pages) doesn't have to sit on w3.org while it's being edited (depends
on how easy it is to give write access to our site)

I'm currently discussing with Chris Ridpath to see whether or not he
feels ok being the editor of this resource. If he does, then maybe the 
resource can sit on utoronto for a while.

Eventually, it will have to sit on w3.org, in ER space.
