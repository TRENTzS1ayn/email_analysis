To help us test the Wayne's new(ish) version of Betsie, I've mirrored it at
our web site: 

       http://shelob.ocis.temple.edu/inst_disabilities/betsie.html

with the following changes:

 1. Added form-type user interface
 2. Removed limitation to BBC sites (the "safe list").  So you can enter any
    site.

The (modified)source is at
