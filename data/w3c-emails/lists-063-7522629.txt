Sounds good, but I'd suggest to reverse order to give the general one first.

alternatively, have one form, with the first field for general comments.  I
think everyone would want to have that opportunity, whether or not they
want to get technical.

Then have two buttons, one that gives user an opportunity to go to the

that checklist.

Or, have a submit button under the form, plus a not that the user can skip
that button, go to the checklist, and then submit.
