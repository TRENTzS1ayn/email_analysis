An author can identify changes in language for an entire paragraph or DIV
but how can they identify language changes for a word or phrase within a
paragraph or DIV?

FONT has a LANG attribute but it's not really appropriate.

Does the author need to identify language changes for a word or phrase?

Use <SPAN LANG="whatever">other language</SPAN>. "LANG" can be defined on most HTML tags. See <http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/global.html#h-7.5.4>.
