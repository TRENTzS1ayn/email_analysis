I've updated the ERT with suggestions for this technique.
http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/#Technique4.1.A

One suggestion is:

For blocks of text that are not in the primary language and are already
enclosed by markup elements such as Paragraph, DIV or EM, set the LANG
attribute of the markup element.

Would this suggestion cover your concern?

Chris
