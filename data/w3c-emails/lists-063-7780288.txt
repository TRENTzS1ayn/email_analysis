Pardon me if I put my response at the top.  GL and PF readers, please skip
to the quote to get the context.  I will send separate copies to those two
lists.

This discussion is a useful clarification.

Perhaps we can clarify it just a hair more.

I see action items for GL, ER, and PF coming out of this.

First, a possible clarification:

Note that while the ABBR attribute on TH cells in HTML4 is likely to
generate something unfortunate for speech rendering unless the author is
well coached, it is easy to see how an abbreviation could be beneficial for
Braille rendering.

Let me jump to the PF agenda.  What we need as a reference model for future
[XML applications] format accessibility is 
a) the idea of providing both short and long alternatives
b) a formal indication that the two alternatives are [roughly] equivalent
c) hopefully, a semantic model that makes it clear the relationship in b)
is the same relationship regardless of whether the author has used the long
or short alternative in the primary view of the content which is defined by
the author's encoding of the document.

We need to have a way of recognizing that there is one and the same
semantic relationship which fits to the syntax in reverse order in two
places in HTML4: 
a) in the ABBR element it is the relationship of TITLE attribute to content,
b) in the TH element it is the relationship of content to ABBR attribute.

Hopefully in PF we can use RDF technology to create not just a natural
language observation to this effect, but a machine-interpretable encoding
of this fact.

Now, to turn to the GL impact.  It would be good to have the two scenarios
Gregory laid out both exposed in the WCAT.

And finally, the ER impact:  There may be room for a 'hint' raising the
possibility of adding an ABBR on TH if the TH is long, but it should not be
presented to the author as a 'correction.'
