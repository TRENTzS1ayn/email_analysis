aloha, chris!

i agree that we should encourage the use of both the ABBR element and the ABBR
attribute in TH, but am unsure as to whether it is practical to encourage them
to use both...

as a start, i would push that (at least until the issue is further clarified by
GL and PF), that we prompt according to the parameters set forth in my original
post -- namely:

1) if the TH name is longer than X characters (X being a number to be agreed
upon by the ER-IG), use the ABBR attribute to provide a tersified version

for example, if the ER tool encountered:

<TH>Percentage of Domestic Pigs That Can Fly</TH>

it would prompt for an abbreviated version of the TH text.  Note: A hard-coded
limit should be placed on the number of characters that can be used for the
ABBR attribute; this limit should correspond to the number which is used to
toggle between "Suggest Use of the ABBR attribute" and "Suggest Use of the ABBR
element". 

[side note: while i'm philosophically inclined to limit the number of
characters allowed in the ABBR attribute definition, practically, this may be a
very bad idea -- i'd rather have an abbreviation for a verbose header be a bit
more verbose than 5 or 6 characters (which would, in effect, force the author
to define a pseudo-acronym for the contents of TH)

for example, i'd find 

<TH abbr="Domestic Fliers">Percentage of Domestic Pigs That Can Fly</TH>

far more useful than

<TH abbr="PDPTCF">Percentage of Domestic Pigs That Can Fly</TH>

:end side note]

2) if the TH name is less than X characters, use the ABBR element to provide an
expansion for the terse header text

example:

if the ER tool encounters the following:

<TH>% of D.P.</TH>

it would prompt for an abbreviation:

<TH><ABBR title="Percentage of Domestic Pigs That Can Fly">% of
D.P.</ABBR></TH>

[side note 2: in attempting to devise an example, i have convinced myself of
the inherent limitations of using a numeric toggle as a determinant...  it may
well be that this is a case where a simple algorithm will not suffice, so
perhaps, Chris, your suggestion that the ER tool prompt for both is the best
(currently available) solution to this impasse]
