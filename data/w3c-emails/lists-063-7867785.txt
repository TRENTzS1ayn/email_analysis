hello,

in the Evaluation and Repair Tools working group we have been discussing 
how to evaluate and repair tables.  Particularly, nested tables.

if nested tables are used to present data, is there a way to associate the 
cells in the inner table with header cells in the outer table?  I would 
assume that axis and headers could work  across tables (if a UA was built 
that way).  However, in HTML 4.0 the only values for "scope" are row, col, 
rowgroup, and colgroup.  so, it seems that "scope" could *not* be an inner 
table.

Nested tables seem less of a problem for layout tables. I propose that the 
evaluation and repair is to handle each table separately, like Mark Novak's 
HelpDB tool.
