i took an action item a couple weeks ago to write a proposal for the 
accessibility report tool.

We have discussed setting up a non-technical version as well as a technical 
version.  The technical version needs to cover at least all of the P1 
checkpoints from WCAG.  My proposal actually allows someone to go through 
all three levels.  Note that the technical version is a rough sketch 
because i focused on the non-technical version as well as the general 
flow.  I think the technical version will share text with ERT and will need 
to be fairly detailed.

to decrease the insanity, we ought to script the creation of the report 
from the ERT document (in WCAG we generate the checkpoint list from the 
guidelines document).  This is something that I can work on with Ian.  I 
just want y'all to be aware that this doesn't have to be a huge time hog to 
maintain once (if) it is set up.

I find this site difficult to use (select all that apply):
   [checkbox] with a screen reader.
   [checkbox] with a screen magnifier.
   [checkbox] with a dynamic braille display.
   [checkbox] without a mouse.
   [checkbox] without a standard QWERTY keyboard.
   [checkbox] without sound.
   [checkbox] without sight.

I also find that I
   [checkbox] can not use the controls because they change too quickly.
   [checkbox] can not access all of the links available on the page.
   [checkbox] can not access all of the information available on the page.
   [checkbox] can not comprehend the information on the page.
   [checkbox] can not use the page because of too much movement.
   [checkbox] can not read the page because of poor color contrast.
   [checkbox] can not make sense of information in tables when the table is 
linearized.
   [checkbox] can not get to information in frames.
   [checkbox] do not know what is presented in a script, applet, or plug-in 
because I do not have the right software.
