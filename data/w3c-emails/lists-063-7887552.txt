re: the GL agenda:

I have put this as an open issue for the techniques document.

I propose that something along the following lines be included as an 
example in the techniques doc.

    <TABLE border="1"
           summary="This table charts the number of
                    cups of coffee consumed by each senator,
                    the type of coffee (decaf or regular),
                    and whether taken with sugar.">
      <CAPTION>Cups of coffee consumed by each senator</CAPTION>
      <TR>
          <TH id="header1">Name</TH>
          <TH id="header2">Cups</TH>
          <TH id="header3" abbr="Type">Type of  Coffee</TH>
          <TH id="header4">Sugar?</TH>
           <TH id="header5"><ABBR title="Congressional Coffee 
Association">C.C.A.</ABBR>?</TH>
      <TR>
          <TD headers="header1">T. Sexton</TD>
          <TD headers="header2">10</TD>
          <TD headers="header3">Espresso</TD>
          <TD headers="header4">No</TD>
          <TD headers="header5">Yes</TD>
      <TR>
          <TD headers="header1">J. Dinnen</TD>
          <TD headers="header2">5</TD>
          <TD headers="header3">Decaf</TD>
         <TD headers="header4">Yes</TD>
          <TD headers="header5">No</TD>
   </TABLE>

re: the ER agenda:
I agree with Chris that we ought to talk about this next week in regards to 
Acronyms.  as initial ideas, I suggest that the following patterns ought to 
trigger the ABBR dialog:

1.  4 or less characters followed by period.  for example:
e.g. (1 character followed by a period, followed by another character then 
period)
etc. (3 characters followed by a period)
N.R.A.

2.  2 or more capitalized characters
WI

3. mixture of characters and numerals:
W3C

4. group of characters with no vowels:
wrt (with regards to)
btw (by the way)

Usually this function is handled by spell checkers picking up unknown 
combinations of characters.  Perhaps what we suggest is that rather than 
replacing an unrecognized combination of characters with something else, 
mark them as an abbreviation (ABBR element) and prompt the author for the 
text, unless it is already in the spell checker.

I'm not sure what to suggest for the "abbr" attribute other than if a 
heading has more than 3 words, ask the author if it can be shortened.  3 is 
arbitrary.
