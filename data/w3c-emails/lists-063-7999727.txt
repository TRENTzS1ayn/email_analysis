I think we'll have to coordinate with the Guideline and Authoring groups to
make that point explicit. 

I can't find any explicit mention of CLASS name being readable in the user
agent guidelines or the web content guidelines.

In fact, in technique 4.4.1, just after

http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TECHS-19990505/#lists

it says

"To further ensure that users understand differences between list items
indicated visually, content developers should provide a text label before
or after the list item phrase:"

implying that the CLASS name isn't accessible for that purpose.
