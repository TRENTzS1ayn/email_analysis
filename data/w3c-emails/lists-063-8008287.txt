Prompting the page author to reduce horizontal scrolling is a good idea but
it doesn't seem to be covered specifically in the WAI WCAG. Should we bump
this back to that group for comment? Should the ERT include techniques that
are not specified by the WCAG?

My feeling is that the current ERT should cover the current WCAG only.
