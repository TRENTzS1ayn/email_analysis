Briefly, the area under discussion has to do with class tokens that are
applied to elements in the HTML markup.

The DOM core requirements will expose these values because they are
attributes.  So the API requirement to share the document contents in
accordance with the W3C DOM means AT software has access to these through
this API.  

The part I am vague about is how the guideline that the browser through its
own UI should give the user access to all content is being interpreted as
regards CLASS tokens.  IMHO they should be covered; the CLASS tokens are
metadata and I am arguing that authors should set them in a mnemonic
fashion as well as eventually tie them to schemata for more precise
machine-processable definitions.  

This is just an intro; please glance over the thread on w3c-wai-er-ig in
the archives. Use "css abuse" in the subject to find the thread.
