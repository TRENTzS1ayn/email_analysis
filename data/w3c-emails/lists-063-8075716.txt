Continuing from Al's intro...

This came up to cover the following case.  A web page author want to define
"new" parts of a page in a color like red.  Instead of using a font tag,
the author defines a class "new" and uses a style sheet to present it in
red.  So far so good.

But for this to benefit the blind user:

1. The user agent must announce the class names to the user
2. The web content guidelines must specify that class names be mnemonic and
useful.
3. The authoring tools should make is simple to change the class name, in
case the initial choice is not good.  This would involve changing it
throughout the style sheet and all pages using the style sheet.

In fact, it would be even better if the text announced to the user could be
independent of the name of the class, just like ALT text is independent of
the filename chosen for a file.

Al points out how this can be considered implicit in what we have already
(except for the very last point).  I'd suggest though that it be made
explicit in the user agent, web content, and authoring tools.
