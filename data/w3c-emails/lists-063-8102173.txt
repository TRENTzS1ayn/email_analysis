It depends on what you mean. If you mean that for style alone, then
ok. But "new" suggests semantics and what's needed is some semantic
description:

a) In a spec like for HTML (for "new" in HTML use INS).
b) A new element + a schema. 

I don't think "class" names convey semantics effectively without
a formal mechanism for assigning meaning. How else is the machine
to guess what it means? What about values in languages other than
what the user knows?

What about these instead:

  1a) Authors should provide alternative style sheets.
      (e.g., aural style sheets for speech output). User agents
      must allow users to select from available style sheets.

The "class" attribute is for machines, isn't it? 
I don't see how one can rely on human 
interpretation of class values. What if they're in another language?
