As you might have seen at
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/1999OctDec/0132.html

Wendy Chisholm (previously Trace and editor of WCAG) has joined the
W3C WAI staff to - among other things - coordinate our WAI tool work
(ER that is).

There's an MIT meeting Wendy has to attend that conflicts with the
usual ER meeting time (Tuesday at 10am Boston time).

So we need to find another slot (not for today - Wendy will have to
run between both meetings :-).

I propose Monday at 10am.  We should probably have a meeting next
Monday (Oct 25), rather than (or in addition to) Nov 1st.

Let's discuss that on the call today.

As far as the rest of the agenda goes:
