aloha, daniel!

the hyperlink embedded in the list item that reads:

"You can download _various setup_ to use the tablin filter on lynx, apache,
etc."

with the hyperlink text "various setup" which points to

        http://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources/Tablin/setup

yields a 404 Error...

after re-reading your post to ER-IG, i noted that the online version won't be
available until some time in November -- this should be explicitly noted on the
Tablin start page -- perhaps the non-functioning link should be commented out
until the online version is available...  you should also add a parenthetic
aside to the following effect:
        (Not Yet Available)

there is also no indication that the table linearizer will work on the windows
platform with standard speech output (i.e. a GUI screen reader) without the
Java Access Bridge or the SVK -- nor is there any info about what Java VM is
necessary to run the linearizer...  i assume that this info is available in the
README for the downloadable version, but it would be a good idea to mention it
on the Tablin homepage -- or at least have a direct link off of the tablin
homepage to the README file...  one of the reasons why people may not be
downloading the tool is that they don't (a) know what to expect from it, and
(b) don't know what (if anything) they need to have pre-loaded on their machine
to run it
