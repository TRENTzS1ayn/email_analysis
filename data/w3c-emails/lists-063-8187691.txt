aloha!

today, i attempted to file a report on an actual site, using the Web
Accessibility Report Form located at:
        http://www.w3.org/WAI/report/

i have interspersed my comments into a text-image of the "Step 4 (Final step):
Confirm Your Report" page -- my comments are enclosed in brackets and preceded
by "GJR's comments:" -- there are 3 of them, and the text-image is followed by
a fourth comment...

-- begin text-image of report output (step 4)
Web Accessibility Report Tool
Step 4 (Final step): Confirm Your Report

From: wai-report@w3.org
To: wai-report-db@w3.org, wai-report@w3.org
[GJR's comment: didn't input eddresses which i defined in step 3--is this
because the form is not yet "live"]

Subject: WAI Report on http://music.acu.edu/www/iawm/pages/
-------------- 

Hello,

This message comes to you from the World Wide Web Consortium's Web
Accessibility Initiative (W3C WAI) report tool at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/report. 

URL: http://music.acu.edu/www/iawm/pages/
Date: Tue Oct 19 17:34:34 1999 

Your Web site has been found to have to one or more accessibility problems.
This is not an automatic evaluation. This message is the result of an
individual's review of your page or site (refer to the cc: field). This person
experienced difficulty accessing your page either due to a disability (visual,
auditory, physical, or cognitive) or due to device limitations (poor connection
bandwidth, no support for graphics or support turned off, a voice interface
such as a webphone, etc.). Please consider their comments below. 

with: and Lynx32 (2.8.2rel.1 and Opera 3.6 
[GJR's comment: didn't acknowledge the MSIE 5.0 choice that i made from the 
OPTION list--how can i report that more than one browser was used to analyze 
the page?]

The reviewer found the following accessibility problems with your page or site.
Each item is followed by a link to relevant information in the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines 1.0. 

Missing or inappropriate alternative text for an Image or Animation (Refer to
Checkpoint 1.1) 
Missing structural elements (H1-H6, UL, OL, etc.) (Refer to Checkpoint 3.5) 
Invalid HTML (Refer to Checkpoint 11.1) 
Missing long description for graphics (Refer to Checkpoint 1.1) 
Color contrast insufficient (Refer to Checkpoint 2.2) 
Other: A well designed site that uses alternative text particularly well -- the
only negative comment that i have is that the use of graphics to display text
may not allow low vision users to use the page easily, but that could be
remedied by the low vision user turning image loading off. i'd also recommend
that the use of physical markup (i.e. FONT="2") be replaced with stylesheets.
the graphical hyperlink that leads to the photo credit on the front page needs
ALT text, too. please feel free to contact me if you want/need more information
about stylesheets and or accessibility, or visit the W3C's Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines, located at http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/ and
the WAI homepage at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/ -- you might also consider
validating your HTML using the W3C's HTML Validation Service, which is located
at: http://validator.w3.org/ 
[GJR's comment: i used the "Other" field on the list of checkboxes to add my 
comments, as there  currently is no TEXTAREA field in step 3 in which to 
add "Additional subjective comments from the reviewer"--only (stifling) 
list boxes]

Additional subjective comments from the reporter: 

Mostly Accessible with no visual

-- end of text-image of report output (step 4)

one last comment/suggestion: the "Web Accessibility Report Result" page should
have a link to the hypertext archive of reports...  by the way, the URI of this
report is:
