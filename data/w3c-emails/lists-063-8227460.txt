aloha, again!

i have since extended my mini test suite of blinking text to 3 files:

1) http://www.hicom.net/~oedipus/temp/blink.html
which uses the straight Netscapism to cause a blinking affect (when i used
Netscape Navigator 4.08 to access the page, the content was continuously
repeated by my screen-reader, which is the stereotypical response of a screen
reader to blinking text)

2) http://www.hicom.net/~oedipus/temp/blink2.html
which uses only the text-decoration style declaration to cause a blinking
effect -- as far as i can tell from aural output alone -- when this page is
rendered by Netscape Navigator 4.08, Opera 3.6, or IE5, only 2 lines of text
are spoken -- i assume that this means that the rendered text is static

3) http://www.hicom.net/~oedipus/temp/blink3.html
which uses the straight Netscapism (BLINK) to attempt to cause a blinking
effect on the first line of text, and a text-decoration style declaration to
attempt to cause a blinking effect on the second line...  as far as i can tell
from aural output alone, only the Netscapism is spoken -- and then continuously
repeated -- when this page is rendered by Netscape Navigator 4.08 -- aural
evidence also suggests that Opera 3.6 and IE5 simply rendered 2 static lines of
text...

of the 3 files, only blink2.html validates as HTML 4.0 Transitional [1] --
unless you count validating to "Netscape HTML" [2] valid!

valid, i suppose, in the strictest sense of the word, but definitely not the
type of validity that is oft-touted as the first step towards accessibility --
the first step towards accessibility, then, i suppose, is validation to a W3C
document type that's been given the once over by PF -- or to a DTD of a markup
language for which accessible authoring practices and accessibility mechanisms
have been defined...

>1. It must support one or more of the CSS2 media types. 
>2. For each source document, it must attempt to retrieve all associated style

errors),

>3. It must parse the style sheets according to this specification. In

selectors
>(see the grammar of CSS2). If a user agent encounters a property that applies
>for a supported media type, the user agent must parse the value according to
>the property definition. This means that the user agent must accept all valid
>values and must ignore declarations with invalid values. User agents must
>ignore rules that apply to unsupported media types. 
>4. For each element in a document tree, it must assign a value for every
>applicable property according to the property's definition and the rules of
>cascading and inheritance. 
>5. If the source document comes with alternate style sheets (such as with the
>"alternate" keyword in HTML 4.0 [HTML40]), the UA must allow the user to
select
>one from among these style sheets and apply the selected one.
