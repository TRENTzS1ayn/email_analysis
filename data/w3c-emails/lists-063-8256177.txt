It's live.

The only reason I can see is that the webmaster email you entered was
not valid (meaning not in the syntactic form user@domain.tld).

You can check the perl source at /WAI/report/rep[234].cgi and
utils.pm.

You need to enter all the browser names in the Other textfield.
(no need to select anything then, since Other overrides the selection
from menu)

That's OK.

The script that generates the final "thanks" page has no way of
knowning the exact url of the report - which BTW might not have
arrived yet - so pointing to the archive is not really useful (might
be harmful if the reporter thinks she needs to do it again).
