I have no problem with the handling of the repair techniques in this way.

I have a problem with soft-pedaling the PWD issue in this case.  This is a
phenomenon which may cause more severe harm than denial of access to
information.  The point about BLINK is that it is a hazard which may induce
[phototropic?] seizures in some people.  Safety issues need to get
prominence, even in the context of an overall "appeal to self-interest
first" climate of motivational voice-over.
