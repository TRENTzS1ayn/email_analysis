Hello all,

I have looked for some history on the Report Tool, but can't find what I'm 
looking for.  So, sorry if I'm asking questions that have already been 
hashed out on the list.

are all of the checkpoints represented?  I have not done a checkpoint by 
checkpoint comparison, but it seems that quite a few are missing.  Is that 
because we want to simplify the list?  or perhaps just get the key 
points?  the easiest?

thanks,
--wendy
