I've updated the ERT doc with the latest recommendations on BLINK. The URL
is:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/#Technique7.2.A

Marquee is much the same and is at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/#Technique7.3.A

Please let me know if it misses some of your concerns.

I hope that the document is general enough so it does not limit the
implementation.

Chris
