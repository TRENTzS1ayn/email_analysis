let me restate my position, i mixed a couple things.

1.  i don't think we want to use headers to replace blink (or  marquee)
2.  with the span element, suggest using CSS properties.

we could then add a 3rd bullet point that includes len's comment, "The
tool shall offer the user an explanation of why CSS BLINK is 
undesirable."  The "undesireableness" refers back to the HTML4 spec where 
it says that css blink may or may not be supported, as gregory pointed 
out.  perhaps we ought to be a bit more specific in regards to that.
