 We could then add a 3rd bullet point that includes len's comment, "The
 tool shall offer the user an explanation of why CSS BLINK is  
 undesirable."  The "undesireableness" refers back to the HTML4 spec where 
 it says that css blink may or may not be supported, as gregory pointed 
 out.  perhaps we ought to be a bit more specific in regards to that.

aloha, wendy!

actually i did a bit more investigating, and found that Netscape 4.08 _does_
appear to support 
        text-decoration : blink
at least based on my aural impression using Netscape Navigator 4.08 and JFW 3.3
(running on Windows95) to access:
        http://www.hicom.net/~oedipus/temp/blink3.html

however, NN does seem to be the only browser that actually supports
text-declaration : blink, and i suspect that the blink attribute was proposed
as part of the CSS2 spec by Netscape for backwards-compatibility issues
relating to Netscape's HTML extensions, so i think that a simple caveat,
warning that User Agents that implement support for CSS2 are not bound by the
CSS2 conformance statement to support
        text-decoration : blink 
suffices -- although i wouldn't mind adding that there is no reasonable
expectation that any of them (aside from NN) ever shall...

PS: the pertinent CSS2 references are:

2. CSS2 Text Decoration Definition
