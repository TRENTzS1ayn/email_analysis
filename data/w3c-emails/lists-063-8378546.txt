No, not all the WCAG checkpoint are there, it's a subjective mix (I
came up with the initial list) of the most important and the most
usual I guess.

Len had suggested, and it's still on my stack of things to integrate,
that we use a different scheme for presenting the very common stuff
first and the other point afterwards.

Other ideas are welcome.
