Hi Chris,

Yes, you've avoided limiting implementation.

Do we really want to suggest Hx? In my experience people don't use BLINK
where headers are appropriate and WCAG 3.5 states "Do not use headers for
font effects". So we might lead authors down garden path.

I'd also suggest
- adding note after SPAN that ties it to CSS style sheets.
