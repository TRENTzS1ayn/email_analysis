Since we're looking to avoid limiting implementation,

I'd sugggest a global replacement: wherever we say

Prompt user for ___

we change "Prompt" to "Ask"

Ask user ___

I suggest this because in my mind at least having the document say

prompt for x
...
prompt for y
...
prompt for z

makes it seem like individual popups for each item: "prompt" has a
connotation of time. "Ask" has less of that I think.  Hmmm.  Still not
optimal... maybe someone else can think of a even better word.  I'm looking
for something that just takes a few seconds of search and replace instead
of rewording everything.

Of course, I'm not asking to change A-Prompt to A-Ask!
