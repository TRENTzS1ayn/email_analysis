It would be good for cases like this for the w3c search tool on the home
page to be able to search individual mailing lists, and have more
sophisticated features in general, e.g. booleon, ranking etc. Right now it
just searches the whole site.  If there are any such features they aren't
documented, at least not by any link near the search tool.

You can kluge a search of individual mailing lists by including 
"w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org", but that brings in all summary pages as well as
individual items.

Or is there already such an engine somewhere else, e.g. in the member area?
 Even if there is, we need a public one to esp. in wai where we have lots
of non-members participating.

Anyway, Daniel and Wendy, if there isn't such a tool somewhere, could you
lobby for one?
