I don't think that MARQUEE is typically used for series of objects. Can you
think of any examples?

Here's a link to our test file that uses MARQUEE:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/test73A.htm

The test file demonstrates 3 strings of text using marquee. Most pages I've
seen use only one marquee. It's an annoying feature and when used multiple
times it's dreadful.
