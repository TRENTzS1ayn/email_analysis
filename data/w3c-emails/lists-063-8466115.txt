aloha, len!

you wrote:quote
I'd also suggest omitting the H1 H2 ...  I've never seen MARQUEE used for that
unquote

the reason i suggested replacing MARQUEE with headers is that the vast majority
of instances when i've run across a page or site that employs MARQUEE, it was
used on what could easily have been a level one or level 2 header, i.e.:

"Welcome to the homepage of Charles Manson"
or
"Disability is a Right, Not A Privilege"
(apologies to Bill Loughburough!)

actually, a good illustration of a lot of bad authoring practices can be found
at:
        http://www.slate.com/Features/Foghorn/default.asp
admittedly, the site is a parody, but it does collate in one place the plethora
of poor practices that are oft employed by political web sites...  and, in this
instance, the designers of the site made sure that -- no matter what browser
you were using -- the header would annoy the hell out of you, enclosing it in
both MARQUEE and BLINK!  (actually, the use of both proprietary elements shows
the bias of the designers slash implementers of the site, as their presumption
is that anyone who accesses it will be using either IE or NS -- Opera, of
course, ignores both proprietary elements, leaving the H3 underneath the
MARQUEE and BLINK a plain, simple, H3)

another reason that i suggested replacing MARQUEE with a header is that it is
not uncommon to find the MARQUEE element used in conjunction with the
deprecated FONT element, for example:

<MARQUEE><FONT size="+3">You Got Answers? We've Got Questions!</FONT></MARQUEE>

which, of course, is using physical instead of structural  markup...  maybe the
"prompt for an appropriate header" could be a strategy employed when the
MARQUEE or BLINK elements are found in conjunction with the FONT element...

len also suggested quote adding a note, suggesting CSS styling, after SPAN
unquote

fine -- would you suggest a specific CSS style type, or leave it up to the
author...  is there a MARQUEE-type equivalent in CSS, as there is for BLINK?

one last note -- personally, i've never "seen" the MARQUEE element used for
items that could be logically broken down into ordered lists -- script-driven
scrolling messages, yes -- "check out our summer specials on seaweed salad... 
don't miss our mackerel muffins...  our eel is excellent...  our fish is fine,
never funky!" -- but not those enclosed in MARQUEE...

alliteratively yours,
gregory.
