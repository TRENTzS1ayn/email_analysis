aloha, again, len!

you wrote,
quote 
  Do we really want to suggest Hx? In my experience people don't use BLINK
  where headers are appropriate and WCAG 3.5 states "Do not use headers for
  font effects". So we might lead authors down garden path
unquote

again, i repeat my assertion, based upon over 4 years of deconstructing and
reconstructing poorly encoded and/or designed sites, that i have most often
found the BLINK and MARQUEE elements -- often in conjunction with the
deprecated FONT element -- used where a header would have been more
appropriate...

admittedly, this is more consistently true of MARQUEE -- just think of the
implications of the element's name -- when i think of a marquee, i think of --
hell, who cares what i think, here's how WWWebster's Dictionary [1] defines
"marquee":

quote
a permanent canopy often of metal and glass projecting over an entrance (as of
a hotel or theater) 
unquote

based on that definition, i'd argue that the information placed on a physical
marquee is the equivalent of level 1 and (at least) level 2 headers -- i.e. the
name of the theater, and the name of the show or picture currently being shown
there...

admittedly, BLINK is also quite commonly used to set off a phrase or a word, as
in:

<BLINK>NEW!</BLINK>

but i have repeatedly encountered instances where BLINK (again, often in
conjunction with FONT) was used to emphasize what should have been encoded as a
header, or where it (like MARQUEE) was used to add emphasis to what was already
encoded as a header...

gregory.
