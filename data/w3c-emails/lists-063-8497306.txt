Gregory makes a good point for including the Hx as replacements for
BLINK/MARQUEE. Another reason for suggesting Hx is that it might get the
user thinking about using these in the future instead of BLINK/MARQUEE.

Should we also allow the author to change the BLINK/MARQUEE to something
else?

To repair a BLINK/MARQUEE we could offer the author 3 choices:
1) remove it
2) change it to: [EM, STRONG, SPAN, (perhaps Hx)]
3) change it to: [enter your own tag]

For example, here's how the A-Prompt dialog might look:
