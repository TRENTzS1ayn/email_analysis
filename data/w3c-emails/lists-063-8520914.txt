aloha, daniel!

thank you for opening the can of worms which i've been thinking of exploring
for a bit now when you wrote:

i'll take a whack at this ASAP -- actually, i'd already begun the process by
downloading the doc source for the report form, but i may not get back to
working on it for a while due to a very small aspect of my life called "my

PS: i did take a quick listen to the perl source, and answered my own question
as to delimiters...   are you or your student hacking the perl, or are you
looking for volunteers (i.e. someone other than you or me!)?
