1) appears just before 3) in the descending likelihood that the author will
want this order for these options.

2) needs to be subdivided and reordered.

3) there are heuristics that could be applied to estimate what role the
text that is MARQUEEing or BLINKing plays in the page, such as placement in
the page and severity of text emphasis vs. the other emphasis employed on
the page.  I don't expect A-Prompt to get there right away but in fact if
we developed a "learned" weighting scheme for the effective severity of
combinations of text effects based on demographics in actual pages, I bet
we could get very good at detecting anonymous H1 text items, for example.

One problem is that there is a common need for a lesser emphasis headline
followed by a greater emphasis headline as one starts the head of a module.
 Actually, in the situations I am thinking of one could conceptualize the
first, less emphasized identification as a running header and class that
outside the Hn series and be then OK to have subheads all follow their
superheads and be at a lower level (higher n in Hn) than their superheads.
(we need a way to indicate running heads that refer to superscopes of the
current module).
