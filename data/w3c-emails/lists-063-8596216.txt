Say we have a document, e.g. the AU tools document, that link all instances
of a term to it's definition.  This is no problem for sighted readers I
think, but would it be useful for a repair tool... or ultimately the user
agent... to turn off these repeated links for the benefit of people
scanning the document by tabbing through links?  

I don't think this is needed in ERT, since repeating links like that
doesn't violate any WCAG guidelines.  But it could impact the filter doc
that Gregory and I  will be writing.
