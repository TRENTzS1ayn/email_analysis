Of course, the ERT document can have things that aren't in version 1 of
A-Prompt.  ERT is extremely valuable in itself.

That said, let me suggest a very simple heuristic:

Heading text shall be offered as substitutes for BLINKing text if that text
starts a new line; i.e. if it immediately follows P, /P,  BR, TH, TD, or
/Hx. (In the future, this heuristic may be extended to include CSS
positioning and statistical Heuristics.)
