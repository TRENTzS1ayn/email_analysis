Chris, Gregory

In response to Chris's question about a definition for Prompt, 

As Gregory pointed out, the AU definition of Prompt is

quote
Prompts are requests for user input, either information 
or a decision. Prompts require author response. 
unquote

I would want to add to this definition something which would make explicit
what I believe we have consensus on:

"Prompts can be implemented in various ways, e.g. fields in a form,
commands, or "wizard" style dialog boxes.  Any responses they require need
not be immediate.  The user shall be able to postpone responses"

The last sentence addresses something Marja has stressed.

Also, although I'm happy with the word "require", in that definition, it
seems to contradict something else Gregory said about feelings within AU.

Gregory said a few emails ago, regarding the suggested wording  "Require
the user to provide alternate text for the image"

quote
   the reason such verbiage probably wouldn't fly with the AU WG, however, is
   that "Require" has restrictive connotations 
unquote

Is that a problem?
