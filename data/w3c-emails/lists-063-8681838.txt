Hi all,

Could someone give me an idea of which tools on the existing tools list [1] 
have been reviewed by ER?

Which ones have been developed in conjunction with ER?

Which tools are people's favorites?  i.e., which ones do you think will be 
best for a demonstration to the W3C Advisory Committee on November 3?

thanks,
