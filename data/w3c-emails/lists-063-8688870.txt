aloha, len & chris!

i like len's addition to the AU definition of "prompt", so that, in the ERT
glossary, it would read something like:

quote
Prompts are requests for user input, either information  or a decision. Prompts
require author response. Prompts can be implemented in various ways, e.g.
fields in a form, commands, or "wizard" style dialog boxes.  Any responses they
require need not be immediate.  The user should be able to postpone responses
unquote

as for the use of the word require, we are helping Chris draft a techniques
document for the detection and correction of inaccessible and invalid markup,
so we need to be as detailed and explicit as we can be, whilst leaving the
ultimate decision to the author...  some things, such as ALT text, titles,
class definitions and naming, and the placement of structural markup -- to name
but a few -- _require_ authorial input, so it is well within our scope to
_require_ input from the author where appropriate and necessary...

an authoring tool, on the other hand, should allow you to input markup that it
doesn't recognize, and -- after alerting you that the markup isn't defined in
the DTD defined for the document -- should allow you to either keep it or
discard it, but an ER tool _has_ to be able to force the user to "put up or
shut up" where use of certain markup is known to decrease the accessibility of
the content being evaluated...

and as for whether the ERT needs to hyperlink each instance of the word
"Prompt" to the definition in the glossary, i think that this could
(mercifully) be avoided if a strong and obvious reference (and link) to the
definition is made in the introduction...

gregory.
