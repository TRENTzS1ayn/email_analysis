hello all,

>(is there a reason

>isn't linked-to off of the Existing ER Tools page?)
this is both evaluation and repair.  i put it under "repair" and mentioned 
that it also does evaluation.

yes.  that would be helpful.  I think this would help us identify the 
strengths and weaknesses of each tool so we may focus on what work needs to 
be done.  particularly if we can help make this suite of tools even better 
by keep hammering on them.

>oh, and one last thought -- the title of the page located at:

>quote Existing WAI ER Tools list unquote is misleading --

i changed it to "Existing Evaluation and Repair Tools"
