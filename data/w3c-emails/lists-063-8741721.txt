The Disability Rights Movement is at the core of all that we are
undertaking at WAI.

Gregory is not being paranoid.

I join in his concerns and hope that both AU and UA (and ER for that
matter) put the issue of the accessibility of tools right up front where
it belongs.

In fact I think that doing so is in itself a Priority 1 matter.
