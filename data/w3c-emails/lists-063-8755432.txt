There is some coordination business here.

In the PF group we are trying to understand the best way to apply schemas
and verification-to-schema as a way to make the satisfaction of
accessibility requirements involve more computer work and less author work.
 Not that everything can be automated, but the right schema and
verification method is the next step up from checklist.  There is going to
be a lot of work in the PACI program and Grid Forum <www.gridforum.org>
coming up shortly that I will be participating in.  One key reference is
<http://www.npaci.edu/DICE/> and <ditto/DICE/MIX/>.

But please note also the Schematron which embeds verification in a stylesheet:

When Wendy sends around the draft presentation outline I will try to
explain how these things fit together.
