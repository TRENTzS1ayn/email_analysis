This depends on who your intended audience is; who is supposed to use the
form.  On the one hand, it could be for consumers with one beef about a
particular site.  Then the idea could be to put some authoritative and
technically useful information behind the first round of "this site should
be better!"  If that is the target audience, then the present setup is
already too busy, and the form should approximate the QuickTips in complexity.

Who do you imagine using the report generator form?
