aloha, al!

if the report form is already too complex for the quote average unquote user
who just wants to tell the maintainers of a site quote hey, i can't use your
site, because [fill in generalities here] unquote, then perhaps we need 2
interfaces -- one for general complaints (i use speech and i can't use your
site, or i use lynx and i can't get at your usenet search feature) and an
advanced form for those who have more precise technical knowledge and/or a
familiarity with WCAG...

daniel, i can hear you shuddering at the thought, and so, if the ER-IG can come
to some consensus as to what each interface should include slash exclude, i
would gladly take responsibility for encoding the form-based front ends for
each...
