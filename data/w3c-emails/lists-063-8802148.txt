Hi all,

I'm using a-prompt to test a page that has nested tables.  I'm looking to 
see what the recommended techniques are in ERT.  All I see is a link to 
Michael Cooper's comment [http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/issues52.htm].

I don't have a good solution, but it seems that a non-HTML aware user 
should be able to associate the nested table with the appropriate 
headers/rows from the parent table.

Dream:
When a user of a WYSIWYG decides to insert a table into a page.  They are 
asked, "what will this table be used for?  is it a table of data or is it 
to position images and text on the page?"  Depending on what the user 
selects, they are lead through a series of questions to get the appropriate 
information from them.

The whole nested tables section of this would be interesting.  I haven't 
thought much about how it would work.

thoughts?
