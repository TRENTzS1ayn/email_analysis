actually, i suppose i am thinking of techniques for 5.1

The current techniques listed are:
Allow the user to modify the table to include row headers and/or column 
headers.
Allow the user to convert the top row and/or the left column to headers.

I think we ought to suggest a mechanism that allows authors to associate 
cell x with header y (axis) or row/column x with header y (scope).

This might be a technique for dealing with nested tables...??
