aloha, wendy!

i'd much prefer an introductary interface such as the one you described than
simply having a link to an "advanced" feedback form...

as for wording, rather than quote I want to give general feedback about the
site. unquote, might we say:

I want to let the site's maintainer know that I can't use the site

or words to that effect?  i fear that the term quote general feedback unquote
is too vague...
