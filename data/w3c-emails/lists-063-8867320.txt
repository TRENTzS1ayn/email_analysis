Each technique in the ERT has a 'Discussion Status' field that tells whether
we have discussed the technique on the list or not. Most of the techniques
are 'awaiting discussion' and the ones that have been discussed are labeled
'under discussion'.

We are not going through the document in order of technique. We started
discussing techniques that were thought to be easy to reach agreement on in
the hope that we could quickly get through a large number of techniques.
This strategy hasn't been entirely successful because even the 'easy'
techniques still require a significant discussion.
