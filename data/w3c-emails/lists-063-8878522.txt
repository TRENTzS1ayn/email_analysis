If there are no objections, I'll mark the techniques 7.2.A and 7.3.A as
'discussion complete'.
http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/#Technique7.2.A
http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/#Technique7.3.A

We now have a demo version of A-Prompt ready so that you can test the
implementation of this technique. It's available at:
http://aprompt.snow.utoronto.ca/GetAprompt.html
This version is for evaluation by the list only and should not be
distributed.
Please take a look and let me know if you have any comments.

I haven't heard anything about technique 7.3.B which deals with MARQUEES in
SCRIPTS. Should we leave this one in?

Chris
