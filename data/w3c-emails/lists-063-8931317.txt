I was hoping that we could take a look at this (seemingly) simple technique
next.
http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/#Technique4.1.A

The WAI checkpoint states:
"Clearly identify changes in the natural language of a document's text and
any text equivalents (e.g., captions)"

Is it practically possible to detect when the author has used words that are
not in the document's primary language?

If we can't detect this then should every document (that has a BODY and any
text) trigger a warning about this?

Chris
