No, ?a n'est pas possible.

By analysing the charset used, I guess one could design some
heuristics (like I used a c cedilla in the above line, which is very
much french), but that would be just that: a guess, and it would give
a lot of misses. 

In a sense, if it was possible, it wouldn't be a P1...

Analysing the overall language is simpler because statistical tools
can be used.

I guess so.
