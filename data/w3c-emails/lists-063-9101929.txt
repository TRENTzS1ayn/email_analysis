Thanks for the review Marja

well, I really want people to fill their name and email in, but I
don't want to force them, so I'm just presenting them with the text
field. I'm concerned that if I add "optional" somewhere, they will not
fill it in at all.

just added on the first page

You mean, in step4 ? something different than the back button ?

that part is not really shorter.

Do you want to get rid of the last two paragraphs:

  Please take the time to review this report and take action on the
  problems reported. If you have questions, please notify us at
  wai-report@w3.org, so that we can re-evaluate your page.

  Note. These comments were made by someone who visited your Web site
  who may not be affiliated with W3C or the WAI. For this reason, WAI
  does not take responsibility for the accuracy of this report nor the

  Accessibility Initiative please visit http://www.w3.org/WAI.

there are important I think.

right now, they have the archive, but good idea for improvement.
