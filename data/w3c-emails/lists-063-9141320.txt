In step 1 could avoid some typos by suggesting:

Please enter the URL of the page you are reviewing (Copy and Paste from
browser):

Step 3:
AOL Win/MAC 4.0 and WebTV 2.2 are now released.

Step 4:
When reviewing my own web page, the tool decided to send the evaluation
message to webmaster@ncounty.net.  My isp won't care about my page since
I'm http://www.ncounty.net/users/ws3f/ws3f.htm.  Suggest adding an input
item in Step 2 with webmaster@appropriate.isp as the default text, but
allow the user to change it.
