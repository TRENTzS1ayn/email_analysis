Is that necessary ?
I mean don't people know how to use copy&paste ?

OK, will add.

I don't see a big gain between suggesting a phony name (like
@appropriate.isp, which BTW sounds like a real name to me - I'm sure
some people will thing it's an alias for a real webmaster) and
suggesting a useless name (@domain.tld - what's currently being
suggested).

What's needed is a better implementation of the routine internally
that guess the email from the address (and content) of the page.
