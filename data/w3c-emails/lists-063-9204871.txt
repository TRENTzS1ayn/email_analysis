Perhaps the language is not clear. The intention is to suggest an existing
LONGDESC for a file that does not have a LONGDESC.

If the same image is used in two places on a site and one image has a
LONGDESC while the other does not, suggest that the image without the
LONGDESC use the LONGDESC from the image that has one.

Does that make sense?
