Perhaps the language is not clear. The intention is to suggest an existing
LONGDESC for a file that does not have a LONGDESC.

If the same image is used in two places on a site and one image has a
LONGDESC while the other does not, suggest that the image without the
LONGDESC use the LONGDESC from the image that has one.

Does that make sense?

That's sort of what I got from it, but it's not clear as written. The first problem is the use of the word "file," which implies, to me, some other file external to both the current document and the "other document." The valid value for LONGDESC is "any valid URI," so maybe "URI" should be used instead of "file." I'd reword it something like:

...  If another document on the same site uses the same image and has a
LONGDESC, suggest linking to the same long description URI.
