Getting a bit wordy maybe?  How about:

If another document on the same site references a LONDESC for the image,
then suggest that LONDESC file.

Which, unfortunately, leads to the question:  What if the same image has
multiple long descriptions depending on the context it appears in?  I
guess you offer all existing LONDESC files for that image.
