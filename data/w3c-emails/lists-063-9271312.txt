This document is a very nice thing. I hope that we can get the list to
become an active place where lots of people will learn and teach about
ways to make the Web increasingly usable (accessible).

I don't see this being a formal Recommendation but more as the final
outcome of *all* WAI efforts - the place where the message about
accessibility flowers.
