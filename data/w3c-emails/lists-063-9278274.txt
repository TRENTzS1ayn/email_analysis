   We at KISSfp.ch, the creators of the successful FrontPage FTP
Add-On "KISSfp" featured on Microsoft's Office Update, have just
released the latest version of the new FrontPage Navigation Bar and
Table of Contents Components "MenuPlus".  For more information, see:

   The website www.kissfp.ch has been completely redone and now
serves the FrontPage community even better with additional Tips,
Tools & Themes, and a FrontPage Chat room!  For example, read the
article "How to promote your website" where we share with you some of
the knowledge gained from the successfull marketing KISSfp.

  Please note that if you have downloaded MenuPlus during the past
weeks, you may NOW want to download it again :  The latest version
1.31 comes with a completely new and easier installer, and many
detailed improvements!  --  Also note that the MenuPlus introductory
price is a *limited time offer* and is likely to change soon.  You can
download a MenuPlus TRIAL version for FREE.

upload FrontPage Webs to *any* host *without* MS Server Extensions?
It's next version will be released very soon;  pricing structure is
