That's delicate. The mailing list wai-report@w3.org is the mean by 
which webmasters can request and comment on anything.

As far as removing/changing content as the other end of a public URL, I
think this is a no-no. People should count on a more recent review to
replace an older one.

If the difference is worth discussing why it's there, then there's the 
list for that.

I'm not sure I get the rationales for that. A lower page contains the
URL of the top page in it, so to save on byte in the report, if we only
want to include one, the lower it should be.

Good point. Will do.

Hum, it's unclear what we should do here.  Some people are actually
using the tool today to just enter the archive with a "no problem"
credit.
To me, the tool is mostly to report problem not to report
goodies. We're working on a gallery for that.

I'm afraid if we make the tool better adapted to delivering "no
problem" message, it will be even more abused.
 
What others think ?

OK, will change.

Already in my todo has improvement.

Can you explain what you mean ?
