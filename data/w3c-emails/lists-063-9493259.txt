I guess old and new are class names.

You violate guidelines if you use ONLY color for meaning because it is
difficult to notice when the user is colorblind or the device does not show
color.

I'm not sure what this means. I think an id or class is an attribute
already assigned to an element. Depending on the element type the element
may have different other attributes available, such as title or captions.
The id itself is not usually an element and have attributes.

I wonder if RDF could be used to attach metadata for a class?

CSS just has selectors for elements (e.g. for classes) and can attach
presentation for the elements that are selected by the selectors. The
meaning is in author's head when he dividing elements in his document into
different classes.
