As Marja said, RDF has capability in this direction.

The practice I am trying to get people to consider for this purpose is to
include the definitions of CLASS values in a resource which is pointed to
by the PROFILE reference in a META element in the HEAD of the document.

In particular, suppose you want to use Dublin Core definitions for
publishing attributes and Modern Language Association definitions for the
classes of text that are used in deriving style distinctions.  HTML 4
doesn't know what to do with a second PROFILE reference, so a separate
glossary of markup terms written in RDF would be a good way to make the
usage in the current document clear.
