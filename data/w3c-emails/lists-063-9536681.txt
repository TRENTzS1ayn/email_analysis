For this version of A-Prompt, we won't be looking at what's in the style
sheets. I think we've got enough to do just implementing the WAI guidelines
in the HTML doc itself. For the next version we will check them.

I hope that there's not very much the page author can do in the style sheet
to create inaccessible pages.

Chris
