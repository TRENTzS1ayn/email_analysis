Yes, they are independent and the ERT can contain much more that what is
implemented in A-Prompt or Bobby.

We would like to finish the first version of the ERT document soon. I'm
afraid that if we open up the CSS issue now, we may not get the document
done for a very long time.

The WAI page authoring guidelines do not cover CSSs very well. We may want
to ask that group to look at CSSs to find what is inaccessible with them
before we start working on the repairs.

Chris
