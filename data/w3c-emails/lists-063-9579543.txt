The technique can be found at:

The page author guidelines are quite clear about this one - auto redirect
should not be used.
http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TECHS/#tech-no-auto-forward

There was some discussion at the recent telecon about how many seconds
should be allowed before the page redirects. If we follow the guidelines
then this point is moot. The page should not redirect at all.

The repair for the redirect is to remove it. Agreed?
