PLease note that this question is a pure subset of the question "how to get
the Authoring Tool Guidelines implemented", and the AU working group has
resolved that its techniques for checkpoints 4.1 and 4.2 will essentially be
to implement the ERT.

Perhaps an interesting question is whether a repair tool is in fact an
authoring tool with only limited functionality (i.e. does not allow the
generationof free content, butonly the repair of existing content).

  Topic:
  Implementation of the ERT Techniques.  How shall we proceed?
  
  For example,
  
  Shall we construct a checklist of which techniques are implemented in which 
  tools?
  Prioritize the implementations?
  Ask developers to commit to particular techniques?
  
  Please submit any additional agenda topics.
