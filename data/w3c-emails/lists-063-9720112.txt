BTW,

Have you been using WAVE ( 
http://www.temple.edu/inst_disabilities/piat/wave/ )?  What features are 
most useful? what if any features would you want to see added?

Please don't be shy about telling me about problems or 
shortcomings.  (After all, I already have a big list* <grin>).

Len
p.s.
* list of shortcomings/problems includes

Only shows noframes
If you click on a link in wave output it goes to the raw page, not the wave 
processed page
Doesn't handle pages with CSS postioning
Applies only a handful of the 80 ERT techniques... although it's the few 
that I think cause the most troubles
Output says "for explanation read the tutorial".  People don't read 
tutorials.  I need to include short explanations in page.
Needs more summary data to orient user, e.g. N pictures without ALT text.
