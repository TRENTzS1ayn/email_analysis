Opera does indeed give a much better a pure text look than WAVE, and the 
toggling is very sweet.  Do you think I should add a mode to WAVE that 
toggles the images?

BTW, when you're running WAVE you can also look at the ALT tags for image 
maps areas... I don't think opera shows them, or at least I haven't been 
able to figure it out.
