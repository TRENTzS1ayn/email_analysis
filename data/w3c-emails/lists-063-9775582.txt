Wendy,

Here's a couple of possible wording additions:


For Semi-automatic - "the user is required to do some of the work"

add "with assistance from the tool"

For "Prompt - the user is notified of the work that is needed (could also 
be called, "manual") "

add "but with no additional assistance from the tool".
