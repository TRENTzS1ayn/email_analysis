AG::

The header guessing algorithm from HTML 4 tables is a repair technique that
I believe the UA group has endorsed.

I wonder what the group's position would be on what a User Agent should do
on processing a stylesheet that contains !important clauses and clearly
identifies itself as CSS1.  Should the User Agent 'repair' this to let the
user's !important rule?

As we move forward to more general flavors of XML, I believe that we will
want to move User Agent functionality to being triggered more by structure
patterns and less by individual marks.

So the idea that User Agents may properly be engaging in 'repair' is not to
be summarily dismissed, I hope.  

On the other hand, the User Agent Guidelines are in a very stable phase.
Unless someone is aware of a repair that the guidelines have missed, that
ERT has designed, and that is a serious flaw not to include, the action to
take right now would seem to be to say that repair techniques may be cited
in the User Agent Techniques in future and move on.

As David Poehlman points out, most of the 'repair' agenda was left behind
with the decision to focus on the minimum requirements for the base
platform and defer consideration of AT techniques.
