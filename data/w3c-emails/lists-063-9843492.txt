Hello,

Perhaps we should be more involved in the discussions on the 
w3c-rdf-interest list?  [1]

There is currently a thread started by Dan Brickley called, "'Semantic Web 
Accessibility'? - notes on XSLT and Schematron-RDF."

Has everyone downloaded and played with the Schematron?  I think everyone 
should.  It raises interesting questions like:
1. instead of writing a "prose" document like the ERT, should we create a 
schema (basically a set of rules) like he has already done for WCAG? [2]

2. we have talked briefly about a technique that would use RDF to keep 
track of what tests a site/page has passed.  Could we build on the 
schematron for this?

3. In Dan's original post [3] he says, "XSLT has great expressive power 
that can be easily applied to extracting / summarising and analysing XML 
web content into an RDF-processable form. Progress with this, for semantic 
web and WAI efforts, might be made easier if we had some taxonomy of XSLT 
stylesheets, so that an RDF agent could select appropriate stylesheets 
according to task at hand."  If our tools summarized the analysis into an 
RDF-processable form, then data could be shared between tools.  This has 
also been discussed on the list.

Thoughts??  Ideas for discussion at the Face2face?
