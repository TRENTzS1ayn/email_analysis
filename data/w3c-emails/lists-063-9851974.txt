Hello,

This fell off of my plate for a while, but it's back.  I would like the ER 
group to be working under a new charter before the May face2face 
meetings.  I would particularly like to see this happen sooner than later 
since I am recruiting participants for the meetings and would like to point 
them to up-to-date materials that discuss what we are doing and where we 
are headed.

Please review and comment on the charter: 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/erwg-charter.html ,
the timeline: http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/timeline.html ,
and the How to Join page: http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/howto-join-wg.html

The major changes from the last draft:
1. tightened up the mission statement
2. tightened up the scope and audience section
3. tightened up the deliverables section
4. tightened up the coordination with other groups section (although this 
still might need some work)
5. got rid of a lot of @@'s that were floating around.
6. emphasized that we will be creating a forum for developers and 
contributing to open source code.
7. emphasized our desire impact (increased number of tools that implement 
ERT-type techniques)

thanks!!
