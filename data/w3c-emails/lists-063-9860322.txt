For A-Prompt we wrote our own tokenizer/parser. It gives us complete control
over what comes out of the program. It is also quite robust and can handle
all sorts of bad HTML. However, it's a bit of work to create something like
this.

There is an HTML parser control that can be used by C++ or visual Basic
programs (Windows based) that performs HTML parsing. It's easy to use and
seems to work quite well.
