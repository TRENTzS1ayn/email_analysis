Well, you are safe from me being there - I will have just got back from a
22-hour trip home (all being well) and the call is at 2am.

I would like to see that the question was at least left open of whether the
group would do more than just evaluate pages. It would also be worth
mentioning that W3C has a new person coming on staff to look at quality and
conformance type issues, and that should be a noted relationship for ER.

I suspect in reality that in order to do review of tools there would need to
be coordination between er and UA/AU, and perhaps joint work. I am not sure -
so far we haven't had to do a lot of coordinating to do our review work
(although we have developed some feedback for other groups ;-)

cheers

Charles

  4. Shall we add to our charter work on tools to evaluate whether authoring 
  tools conform to ATAG?
      - if so, what sort of work? Specification? Development?.
