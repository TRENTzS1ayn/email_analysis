WC:  Will tool developers see a difference?   I know we talked about the 
marketing advantages of the database and the incentive it may give 
developers to make their tools conform to WAI guidelines.  I realize we 
won't give anything a formal "WAI seal of approval" or "official evaluation 
tool of the WAI" but if someone searches for Level A compliant tools they 
will basically be finding those tools that we deem WAI conformant. In a 
sense this is a seal of approval.

I still think this information is very useful.  I also still have my 
concern that I expressed during the joint telecon on Tuesday.
