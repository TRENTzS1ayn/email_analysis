I would much rather see a third party undertake such a task than
to see the W3C, just because of these kinds of problems.  I definitely
don't think it's something an interest group can/should do, especially

At one time there was talk of the W3C investigating the possibility
of a "conformance claims" activity of some kind -- what became of
that?
