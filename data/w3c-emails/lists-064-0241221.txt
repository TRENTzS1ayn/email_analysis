There is an interesting article in the July 2000 Web Techniques magazine 
called, "Migrating from HTML to XML."  I have not played much with the 
following tools yet, but they sound interesting.

HTML-Kit www.chami.com/html-kit is freeware that is supposed to "help HTML 
authors edit, format, validate, preview, and publish documents on the Web, 
it has a custmoizable GUI that uses HTML Tidy to convert documents from 
HTML to XHTML....Another window lists any errors and offers advice and 
suggestions for improving the XHTML code.  I've found that this tool offers 
a learn as you grow approach for migrating HTML to XHTML."  by Peter 
Fischer, pg 52 Web Techniques, July 2000. published by CMP Media Inc. 
www.webtechniques.com (the June 2000 issue is what is currently displayed 
on their site)

Another tools that he discusses is called XSpLit 
[http://www.percussion.com/Products/XSplit/xsplitover.htm], which is a tool 
used to, "split out the content trapped inside your existing HTML documents 
so that it's no longer intertwined with presentation markup.  Although a 
human touch is sometimes necessary to sort out meaningful content from 
meaningless markup, there are some good tools that will make your job a lot 
easier....Using XSpLit, developers can easily create the XML and XSL 
equivalents of their existing HTML documents without investing a 
significant amount of up-front time learning XML."  also by Peter Fischer, 
pg 53 Web Techniques, July 2000. published by CMP Media Inc. 
www.webtechniques.com

XSpLit also seems to be free, but I'm not sure for how long, i.e. I'm not 
sure if I've downloaded the actual product or a trial version.  Regardless, 
the algorithms they use would apply to many of the AERT techniques.

tools to add to the list of existing tools?
