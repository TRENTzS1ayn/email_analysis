The benefit of using the RDF schema technique for tracking evaluation is that
it is easy to add a property (I would do it, if I had spent time working on
this stuff recently) for "not-evaluated". Or to build tools such that unless
there is an explicit statement about something it is assumed unevaluated. It
is reasonable to specify this in the documentation for the RDF schema itself.
(It already, because the statements are RDF, provides a framework for saying
who said what when).
