I have been using Dreamweaver to test it for conformance against ATAG10.

One of the requirements for ATAG is that the author can change the
presentation in the editing view without changing it in the published
document. The obvious way to do this in a WYSIWYG editor is to attach a local
style sheet.

Although Dreamweaver does not natively have this concept, it should be easy
enough to write an extension to attach a local style sheet. It should be
detached before saving/publishing, and then re-attached, but this MAY be
harder.

Any takers? Or is there such an extension already, for this or another
tool? Amaya already allows a user style sheet for editing.
