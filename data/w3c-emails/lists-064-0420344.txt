In looking at the menu items from a random selection of programs I see that
most items are grouped together in small bunches of 4 or 5 items. However
there are some menus that have many (> 10) items. Large menus include things
like 'bookmarks' or 'open windows'. If we assume that OPTGROUPS are like
menus then I favor a smaller number, perhaps 7 OPTIONS, as the trigger and
let the user decide if they want to have more.

Most dialogs group controls into small groups. If FIELDSETS are like dialog
controls then I think we should trigger on a smaller number than 10, perhaps
7.

The WCAG also mentions logical groups in 'lists' so I suggest:

Element: OL or UL
Requirement: Should have no more than 7 LIs
Suggested Language: List may have too many list items.
Suggested Repair: Display the list and allow user to divide it into smaller
sublists

The WCAG also mentions logical groups in 'tables' but that is handled by
Technique 5.2.1 - [Priority 1] Check data tables for multiple levels of row
and column headers

The WCAG also mentions using headers to 'break up long stretches of text'.
But what is a 'long stretch' of text? How much text to a paragraph? How many
paragraphs to a header? How much text to a page? Yikes - I think this may
have to be a manual check.

Chris
