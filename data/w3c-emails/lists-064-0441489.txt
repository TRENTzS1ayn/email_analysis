Starting suggestions:

14.1.1 - Check for clear and accurate headings
evaluation: any Hx element
This is a manual check. Display the header and associated content and ask
user if it is clear and accurate. Allow user to change header text.

14.1.2 - Check that the topic of the sentence or paragraph is at the
beginning of the sentence or paragraph .
evaluation: any text within a paragraph
This is a manual check. Display the sentence/paragraph and ask if the topic
is at the start. Allow user to change the sentence/paragraph.

14.1.3 - Limit each paragraph to one main idea
evaluation: any text within a paragraph
This is a manual check. Display the paragraph and ask if the paragraph has
one main idea. Allow user to change the paragraph.

14.1.4 - Avoid slang, jargon, and specialized meanings of familiar words
evaluation: any text within the document
This is a manual check. User will have to check the entire document.

14.1.5 - Favor words that are commonly used
evaluation: any text within the document
This is a manual check. User will have to check the entire document.

14.1.6 - Use active rather than passive verbs.
evaluation: any text within the document
This is a manual check. User will have to check the entire document. (Is
there a way to accurately detect active vs. passive verbs?)

14.1.7 - Use language appropriate to site's content
evaluation: any text within the document
For English documents - create a FOG index and ask user if this is the level
for their intended readers.
For Japanese documents - check for the occurrence of the core set of
Japanese symbols and ask user if this is appropriate for their intended
audience.
