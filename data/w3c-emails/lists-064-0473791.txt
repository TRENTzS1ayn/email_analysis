Yes.  On the order of five seems like the optimum; it is not clear just how
much over five to set the 'warn' threshold.  It can only be a warning
because there are some long list such as the names of the US states that
should not be subdivided but just presented as one long list.

Somehow I don't see this as parallel at all.  If all fields are required,
there may be no requirement for subdividing them up into FIELDSETs.  

In the OPTGROUP situation you usually are only going to find and act on one
OPTION.

In the FIELDSET situation, the number of fields that you are going to
interact with to conduct a successful transaction tends to be many, not
one.  I don't think that the same order-of-magnitude-count reasoning
applies to this latter case.

The logic of when and how to group form controls strikes me as much more
like providing header for paragraphs than like providing OPTGROUPs for
OPTIONS.

FWIW
