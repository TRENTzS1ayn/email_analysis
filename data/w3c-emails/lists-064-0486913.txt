These can mostly be automated by using dictionary lookups. (The exception is
specialised meanings for normal words) And yes, it is possible to get a
reasonably accurate test for whether a verb is used actively or passivley in
many languages. An examle algorithm for english is to look for a past
participle with a part of the verb to be. (That is oversimplified, but works
for the examples in this message...)
