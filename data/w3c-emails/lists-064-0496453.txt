For a sentence in english, more than two verbs (not including compounds) is
long. More than twenty words is long. More than two relative or subordinate
clauses is long. (These are not hard and fast figures, just a workable
base. "Cease your current combative agression towards my person" is too long,
but won't get picked up by the checks outlined...)

(Maybe looking for my .sig is a good test for things that are too long, too
*grin*)

  The WCAG also mentions using headers to 'break up long stretches of text'.
  But what is a 'long stretch' of text? How much text to a paragraph? How many
  paragraphs to a header? How much text to a page? Yikes - I think this may
  have to be a manual check.
