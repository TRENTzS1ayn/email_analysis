I'll modify these to read:

14.1.4 - Avoid slang and jargon.
evaluation: any text within the document
Check all words in the document against a dictionary of slang and jargon
words that are in the document's primary language. If any slang or jargon
words are found then inform the user and allow them to change the words.

14.1.8 - Avoid specialized meanings of familiar words
evaluation: any text within the document
This is a manual check. User will have to check the entire document.

14.1.5 - Favor words that are commonly used
evaluation: any text within the document
Check all words in the document against a dictionary of uncommonly used
words that are in the document's primary language. If any uncommon words are
found then inform the user and allow them to change the words.

14.1.6 - Use active rather than passive verbs.
evaluation: any text within the document
For a document with a primary language of English, check for form of the
verb to be (is, am, be, being, were, was, been). If the sentence contains
any of these words then suggest to the author that they should check the
sentence for passive verbs.
(Another indicator is 'by'.)

Can anyone refine the algorithm in 14.1.6 (passive verbs) to make it more
accurate?
What about other languages for 14.1.6?

Chris
