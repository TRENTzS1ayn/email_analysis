Suggestions for 12.3 (Divide large blocks of information into more
manageable groups where natural and appropriate)

12.3.4 - Break up long sentences
evaluation: any sentences within the document
In English, if the sentence has:
- more than two verbs (not including compounds) or
- is more than twenty words or
- has more than two relative or subordinate clauses then
inform the user that the sentence may be too long and allow them to change
the sentence.

A dictionary of verbs may be used to detect verbs. Can a verb be detected
within a sentence without using a dictionary? Can relative or subordinate
clauses be machine counted? Does anyone have some links to algorithms for
detecting grammatical structure of sentences?

12.3.5 - Break up long paragraphs
evaluation: any paragraphs within the document
How long is too long?

12.3.6 - Break up 'long stretches of text' using headers
evaluation: any text blocks longer than?

Chris
