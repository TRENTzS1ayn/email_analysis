Except that this is not a normative document - it describes
techniques. Specific things you can do, like counting the number of words
or verbs or clauses (depends how smart it is) in a sentence.

It's not so much re-inventing the wheel as going out and finding them.

Cheers

  about "normative" and "reinventing wheels".
