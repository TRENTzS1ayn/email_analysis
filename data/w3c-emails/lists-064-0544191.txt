It is better to check against a dictionary of words that are common (among
other things, it is more likely that such a disctionary will already be in
the system for spellchecking...) and identify those that are not found. If we
rely on having all uncommon words in our dictionary we are bound to fail.

  14.1.4 - Avoid slang and jargon.

  Check all words in the document against a dictionary of slang and jargon
  words that are in the document's primary language. If any slang or jargon
  words are found then inform the user and allow them to change the words.
  
  14.1.8 - Avoid specialized meanings of familiar words
  evaluation: any text within the document
  This is a manual check. User will have to check the entire document.
  
  14.1.5 - Favor words that are commonly used
  evaluation: any text within the document
  Check all words in the document against a dictionary of uncommonly used
  words that are in the document's primary language. If any uncommon words are
  found then inform the user and allow them to change the words.
  
  14.1.6 - Use active rather than passive verbs.
  evaluation: any text within the document
  For a document with a primary language of English, check for form of the
  verb to be (is, am, be, being, were, was, been). If the sentence contains
  any of these words then suggest to the author that they should check the
  sentence for passive verbs.
  (Another indicator is 'by'.)
  
  Can anyone refine the algorithm in 14.1.6 (passive verbs) to make it more
  accurate?
  What about other languages for 14.1.6?
  
  Chris
