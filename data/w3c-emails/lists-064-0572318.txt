I agree with the direction you are going in, but I suspect that "more than
one" is going a little too far.  If you diddle the author whenever there
are two or more controls, they may be too likely to disable the check and
not get warned when they do need to do something.  

These things are imperfect.  Real systems work with finite errors, of both
kinds.  Some baddies that didn't get flagged as well as soom goodies that
did.  Not that these classes should be equally likely, but you can't afford
to drive the unflagged baddies to zero without blowing yourself out of the
market.

Just my two cents worth.

PS:  I like your idea of having structured access to a radio button group.
That is one control from a logical or output perspective.  OTOH multiple
checkboxes with the same NAME in one FORM should raise a question to the
author.  Not likely what is intended.
