Agenda


1. Status and report on Action items:

See June 12 minutes:  http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/minutes/20000612.html

2. We've had some good discussion on 12.3 .  Lets see if we can pin down a 
bottom line consensus.  Issues include:

   In SELECT:  use OPTGROUP when count count of OPTIONS exceeds threshold?

   In FORM: use FIELDSET when count of elements within form (INPUT, 
TEXTAREA, SELECT, BUTTON, OBJECT ) exceeds threshold? When two or more 
radio buttons have same name?.

   sentences.. when to break up... possible counts include verbs, words, 
clauses

   paragraphs... when to break up...
