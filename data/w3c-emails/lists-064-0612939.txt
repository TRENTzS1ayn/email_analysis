These are phrased as WCAG checkpoints (or techniques) rather than AERT 
techniques.  To maintain consistency with AERT, they should read:
14.1.4 - Check for slang and jargon  or Verify that slang and jargon is used
14.1.8 - Check for specialized meanings of familiar words

This info needs to be incorporated back into WCAG Techniques.  I will pass 
it along to that group.
