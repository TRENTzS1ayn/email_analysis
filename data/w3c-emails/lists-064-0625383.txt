(I'm writing this now because I'll be away from email the few days before 
the meeting).

Our next teleconference will be

Monday July 3, 10:00-11:30 Eastern USA Time (GMT -05:00) on the MIT bridge 
(+1 617-258-7910).

Please attend if you're available.  Since it's the fourth of July 
weekend,  turnout may be less than usual.
