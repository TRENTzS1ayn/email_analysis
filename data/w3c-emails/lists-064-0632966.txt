We all took an action item on the 12 June call to review and comment on the 
charter before the next call.  That would have been today.  woops.

I had an action item to add "test suites" as a deliverable.

Here is what I've added, let me know if it is not clear, should include 
more detailed info or any other thoughts you have.

<blockquote>
Test Suites. A series of test pages used to determine if a Technique in the 
AERT has been implmented correctly and to determine where false positives 
and negatives may occur.
</blockquote>

the charter is available at http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/erwg-charter.html
