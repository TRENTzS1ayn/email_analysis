Thanks for sharing these files with us. It must have been a real chore to make them up.

  Hi - I was asked to pass on Bobby's browser compatibility information. It's
  actually available in any local copy of Bobby, but I'm attaching a zip
  collection to this message (hss.zip), and the documentation for
  understanding them (2 years old) in an html file (hss.html).

  I also have a very old action item to propose a technical-ish definition of
  "blocks of content" for the purpose of then deciding if a block is "large".
  Just for the sake of argument, to throw something out there, I would say:

  Most generally, a block is a sequence of similar elements (especially ones
  that are defined as block-level elements, such as <p>), delimited by
  elements of some other type. So one or more <p> elements in a row is a
  contiguous block, ideally delimited on both sides by any heading element, or
  the opening/closing body tag.

  Other elements define blocks more by virtue of being containers of other
  elements. So, and <div> defines a block, as does any list (<ul>, <ol>,
  etc.). All the <li> children of a list are members of a block. It gets
  trickier when there are nested lists - I would say a nested list both
  creates a new sub-block, and is a member of its parent block, but at any
  rate does not begin a new block at the same level as its parent.

  <div> elements are tricky too because they might include anything. In the
  best case, a <div> defines a logical block. In reality, they might encompass
  the whole page, or much smaller chunks, down to a single word or character
  if they're confused for <span> which I often see. So, I would say that
  whether a <div> defines a block depends on the diversity of elements inside
  it. If there are a bunch of the same kind of element within a <div>, or
  anonymous text (text not even in a <p> element), that <div> defines a block.
  But, if there's a bunch of different kinds of elements, especially otherwise
  block delimiters such as headings, it may not be useful to think of that
  <div> as a block but as a formatting agent. Within it, there would be
  several blocks defined by other means. I would say though that a block would
  never span across a <div>'s boundaries, so if I had a bunch of <p> tags,
  then a closing or opening <div> tag, then more <p> tags, those paragraphs
  would be members of different blocks.

  Tables also complicates the issue. First, I would say that overall, a data
  table is its own block, and a layout table is not (but should be treated as
  I do <div> above, as a container element). So, generally, if you had a bunch
  of paragraphs, then a data table, then more paragraphs, the data table would
  be its own block, and would also delimit the paragraphs before and after it
  into distinct blocks. However, I would say this is only true for "large"
  data tables. A "small" table might be considered to be a "for example"
  within the block of text and not rightfully considered its own block. (The
  same would be true of a <blockquote>, by the way). So I have to define
  large. That's another discussion, but maybe for now if the table has more
  than 20 cells, it's "large".
