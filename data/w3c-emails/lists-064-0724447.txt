Our next teleconfernce will be

Mondays, 10:00-11:30 Eastern USA Time (GMT -05:00) on the MIT bridge (+1 
617-258-7910).


Topics:

1.  We've been talking about how long a block should be, but what is a 
block?  Lets discuss some more, starting with Michael's proposal at 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2000Jun/0062.html 
(thanks Michael!)

2. How shall we track issues, including cross group issues? One possibility 
is to use W3C's ETA system.  There was a section set up for WAI ER

http://cgi.w3.org/ETA/issuesList.php3/wai/ER/

Although we haven't used it yet.   Those of you who have tried it... please 
see what you think.  If you want to try it out you can add yourself as a 
contact at http://cgi.w3.org/ETA/contacts.php3/wai/ER/?editing=1&nextAction=add

(This requires member access to w3c).
