1. a To Do
 > Clean up usage of capitalization and <strong> on HTML elements and
 > attributes. Use as WCAG does: elements are capitalized, no emphasis (e.g.,
 > IMG), attributes are lower-case and in quotes (e.g., "alt" or "longdesc").

That quoting of attribute names seems awkward, since in XML the attribute
and its value must be in quotes.  So do we have to use in examples
     <IMG ... "alt='shorttitle'">

Incidentally, XHTML has changed to make element names lower-case, as XML
is case-sensitive for element and attribute names.
But HTML 401 hasn't.

2. Mention Deprecated material, both elements and attributes?

Element types from HTML 3.2 deprecated in HTML 4.0:
     APPLET, BASEFONT, CENTER, DIR, FONT, ISINDEX, MENU, S, STRIKE, U

Obsolete element types, for which substitute PRE are:
     LISTING, PLAINTEXT, XMP.

Many attributes are also deprecated in HTML 4.01 (APPLET is particularly
targeted):

align      on CAPTION, APPLET, IFRAME, IMG, INPUT, OBJECT, LEGEND, TABLE,
               HR, DIV, H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H5, P
alink      on BODY
alt        on APPLET
archive    on APPLET
background on BODY
bgcolor    on TABLE, TR, TD, TH, BODY
border     on IMG, OBJECT
clear      on BR

codebase   on APPLET
compact    on DIR, DL, MENU, OL, UL
face       on BASEFONT, FONT
height     on TD, TH, APPLET

start      on OL
text       on BODY

3. Some checkpoints have no [priority], others do. Be consistent.
