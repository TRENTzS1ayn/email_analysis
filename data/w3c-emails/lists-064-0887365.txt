I have realized that the "additional actions" section for each Technique is 
actually the suggested repair.  I propose that we rename this section, 
"Suggested repair."

Also, we decided each Evaluation section should have an "Element" and 
"Requirement."  Sometimes the "Element" is really more of a 
"Condition."  It might make more sense to use "Condition."  I don't propose 
a change at this point, but it is something to keep in mind as you reread 
the document.
