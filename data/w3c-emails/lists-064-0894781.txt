Hi folks,

the Authoring Tools group is planning to refer to the ERT document as
covering techniques for Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines checkpoints
4.1 and 4.2. On the one hand, this means that you can expect us to provide
good careful review of the ERT document. On the other hand, this means we are
hoping that a working draft be published in a stable place as soon as
possible. We are anticipating releasing a new Public version o the Techniques
Note by 20 March, and if possible would like to have some kind of stable
reference in that. If not, what should we use as a reference to the latest
publicly available draft (of course we will have to provide a disclaimer
while it is only in working draft stage)?

Cheers
