Chris,

Here is my proposed rewrite of 1.1.2. Note that I also said that the 
description or the need to provide one may be affected by the context in 
which the image is used.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Technique 1.1.2 [priority 1] Verify that valid IMG element descriptions 
("longdesc" attribute or d-link) are provided where necessary.
Evaluation:
Element: <IMG>
Requirements:
valid "longdesc" attribute (any valid URI) or a d-link required if 
describing the image will add information not given in the text of the 
page. The amount of information in the image and the context in which it is 
used will determine how detailed the description should be.
Cases where a description is not required:
bullets - refer to Appendix J.
horizontal rules - refer to Appendix K.
Example of a message to be displayed:
If describing the image will add information not given in the text of the 
page,  you need to provide a description of the image.  The amount of 
information in the image and the context in which it is used will determine 
how detailed the description should be.
Additional actions:
Ask user if the image presents information that is not included in the page 
or in the text equivalent for the image. Allow the user to create or 
associate a description.
with the  "longdesc" attribute on an IMG element
via a D-link
If another document on the same site uses the same image and has a 
"longdesc", suggest that "longdesc" file.
