hello,

new draft: http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/ert-20000307.html

as always, the latest is available from http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/

There are lots of @@'s since Len noted some changes he made.  There were 
also several open issues from before.  Please focus on commenting on those 
items.

Also note that I added two levels of table of contents.  I have not yet 
added the "next section" and "previous section" buttons.  the to do list 
has all of the to do's but this one.

I think we ought to give this a very thorough read to make sure that 
nothing has been broken by our edits.

Please keep in mind as you are reviewing the document with the goal of 
sending it to AU, WCAG, and IG next week.

Thanks.
I look forward to your comments,
--wendy
