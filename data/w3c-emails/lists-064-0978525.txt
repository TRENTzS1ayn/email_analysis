Actually it seems from the article that both Explorer 
and Netscape get the caption wrong.

align=left and align=right should put the caption on 
the left and right of the table, not on top.

There is no need for nested tables to imitate the correct behavior.
For example in case of align=left one can create the 
first cell to span a whole column, and put the text of the would be caption there.

In http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/tables.html we find
"align = top|bottom|left|right [CI]
Deprecated. For visual user agents, this attribute specifies the 
position of the caption with respect to the table. Possible values:

* top: The caption is at the top of the table. This is the default value.
* bottom: The caption is at the bottom of the table.
* left: The caption is at the left of the table.
* right: The caption is at the right of the table."
