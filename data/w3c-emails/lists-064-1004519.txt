The 'ex' is IIRC in the accepted lexicon of formatting properties for web
media as used by style languages published by W3C.  For further information
on the status and theory of the 'ex' unit, I suggest the following search
path:

a) CSS2 specification
b) Chris Lilley <chris@w3.org>

Please read a bit in CSS2 before troubling Chris over "how is this defined,
anyway?" but if the spec doesn't do it for you do ask Chris.
