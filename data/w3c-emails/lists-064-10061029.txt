In the January 29, 2001 issue of Interactive week there's an article called
"No Ringy-Dingy" located at:
http://www.zdnet.com/intweek/stories/news/0,4164,2679799,00.html )

"The days of the free phone ride appear to be numbered. Companies have been
dropping - or at least rethinking - the provision of free calls over the
Internet from personal computers to standard telephones."

"The two biggest Internet telephony carriers, Dialpad.com and Net2Phone, are
holding onto the free model - for now, anyway. But Net2Phone mentioned in
its last quarterly earnings call that it was considering moving from the
free model."

try.
