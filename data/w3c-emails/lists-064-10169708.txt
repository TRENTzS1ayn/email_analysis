Bit too late to put on the agenda, although it should help with the
"selling EARL" thing. Since people seem so upset that EARL is in RDF
form, I think it would be a good idea to prepare a linear version of
EARL with a simple content model that can be included into linear
languages, such as XHTML (2.0?).

For example:-

<earl:EARL xmlns:earl="http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/0.95#">
<earl:evaluation>
   <earl:Person earl:name="Sean B. Palmer"/>
   <earl:asserts/>
   <earl:Assertion>
     <earl:WebContent xlink:href="http://example.org/">
       <earl:date>2001-07-02</earl:date>
     </earl:WebContent>
     <earl:fails>
     <earl:TestCase>
        <earl:Id xlink:href="http://w3.org/TR/WCAG10/#cp1_1"/>
     </earl:TestCase>
   </earl:Assertion>
</earl:evaluation>
</earl:EARL>

Or something like that; use your imaginations :-)

It wouldn't be as complete and extensible as EARL-in-RDF, but it would
be directly convertable to EARL-in-RDF through XSLT, and it would have
a validatable content model.
