At today's meeting I volunteered to make WART generate EARL (perhaps WART 
will ooze EARL rather than generate it...who knows...we can have a lot of 
fun with these acronyms...).

First of all, what about the name?  As fond as I am of "WART" it stands for 
"Web Accessibility Report Tool" and EARL is more than that.  How about 
"Conformance Report Tool" (acronym collision with CRT!) or EARL Report Tool 
or ... suggestions?  For now, I'll call it WART since that's more 
fun.  Perhaps it will just stand for, "Whatever. Anything Report Tool."

Regardless, I have created a plan page for it with a lovely photo of a wart 
hog at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/WART/plan.html

Let me know what you think,
