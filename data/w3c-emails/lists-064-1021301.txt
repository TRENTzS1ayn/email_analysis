It would be worth looking at the way that preparation of ISO HTML is

  Should we delete the following two checks? 
           1.The first header element in the document must be H1

  One reason for these checks is that H1, etc. are still sometimes misused
  for formatting and finding that out might be facilitated by performing
  this check.
