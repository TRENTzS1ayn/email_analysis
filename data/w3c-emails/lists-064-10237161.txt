Agenda for Monday:
- Implementation plan for WART. Do we want to change the name?
http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/WART/plan.html
- Linear version of EARL
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2001Jul/0003.html
- AERT open issues. Could we spend some time (20 minutes?) going through 
these? We need to divide up which are closed, which are for WCAG WG (HTML 
techniques), and which for AU WG.
