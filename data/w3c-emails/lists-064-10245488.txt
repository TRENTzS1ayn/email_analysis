  Agenda for Monday:
  - Implementation plan for WART. Do we want to change the name?

No, I don't want to change the name. I do think that it would be worth
investigating further what is required to post the EARL as an annotation, and
after that what is required to adjust an annotation where the same person is
doing so. (This would be useful because we can also give it to people making
authoring tools as a readymade piece)

  - Linear version of EARL

I don't thnk we should spend time doing this. It is easy enough to come up
with a syntax if someone wants one, and we should get them to provide
transformations to EARL as part of the work. If they don't understand how to
create the syntax themselves then they are about in the same boat whatever
syntax they generate - they need an explanation of what sequence of magic
characters needs to be produced. (Imagine you are explaining it to a japanese
developer - the difference between strings of latin letters is not meaningful
anyway).
