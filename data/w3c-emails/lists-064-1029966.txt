Crossposted to AU, WCAG and ERT groups. (Sorry for people who are in all of
them)

The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines group, as part of the development
of our techniques document, is working on the development of accessible
template pages for authoring tools.

We would like the WCAG and ER groups to review these templates for
accessibility (and offer them for reference examples...) to ensure that we
are meeting the standards to the highest possible level.

The goals of the templates are to be as accessible as possible, and to be
viable examples for real authoring tools to use. They should therefore
transform graceful as far as possible.

The first set of templates is now available:

http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WD-ATAG10-TECHS-20000308/templates/cmnMain - A "home
page"

http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WD-ATAG10-TECHS-20000308/templates/cmnNews - A
latset news / events page

http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WD-ATAG10-TECHS-20000308/templates/cmnStyle.css -
the stylesheet for these pages

(Note that many of the links go to imaginary pages (i.e. 404 errors) at this
stage of development)

All comments are appreciated.

cheers

Charles McCN
