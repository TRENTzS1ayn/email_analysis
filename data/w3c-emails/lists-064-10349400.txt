The file at [1] is an attempt at expressing the EARL schema in the
newly proposed RDFS(FA) metamodelling architecture [2], by Pan and
Horrocks.

A few comments:-
* rdf:Statement and the reification properties are not defined,
probably because reification itself is the cause of much debate.
Perhaps there would be MStatements and LStatements? EARL (and other
ontologies) would use LStatements.
* rdfs:Literal is an ltype of LClass in RDFS(FA), but RDF Core have
not decided precisely what a literal is yet, only to say that there
are things which are literals, and things which are literals which are
lexical representations of some resource (e.g. [ rdf:value "abc" ]).
* In defining a new type of property, I could only guess that it is an
lsubClassOf LProperty. It seems to make sense that way because we are
defining an ontology here.

I wonder how RDFS(FA) will fit in with the Abstract Syntax proposed by
Jon Borden et al. [3]?
