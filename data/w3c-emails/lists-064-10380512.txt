Sean,

I got to page 7 of that article.  Way over my head at this point.  What I 
got out of it is that there is a "layer problem" which I'm not exactly sure 
what that means but that it originates with RDFS and is therefore carried 
on in DAML+OIL (since it builds on RDFS).

Good article, I learned a lot from what I read.  Good over view of the 
different layers of the architecture.

Do you  know if RDFS(FA) is being considered by the RDF groups?

Could you please explain the differences between the EARL schema expressed 
in RDFS versus RDFS(FA)?

Where do MStatements, LStatements, LClass, etc come from?  What does that mean?

Also, I just realized that RDFS is a Candidate Recommendation - is that 
true?  It's been there since March 2000...??  (looking through the TR page: 
www.w3.org/TR/)

I obviously don't know how this would fit in with the Abstract Syntax 
proposed by Jon Borden.

help...
