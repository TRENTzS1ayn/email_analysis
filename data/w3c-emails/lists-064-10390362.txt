Our next teleconference will be held Monday, 16 July 2001 at the regularly 
scheduled time: 10:00 AM Eastern Time (14:00 UTC/GMT).  To find out what 
time it is in your time zone use the Time Zone Converter [1].

It will take place on the MIT bridge: +1 617.258.7910

Agenda for Monday:
- Quickly go through the  updates to the AERT open issues list, per the 
note I sent earlier today. [2]  I have not passed any of these on to WCAG 
or AU yet, nor integrated them into the WCAG issues list.  What I propose 
is that we get the issues divided, then send notes.  I'll let WCAG 
determine if they/how they want to incorporate the issues before adding 
them to the list.

- EARL Primer. Discuss proposals from last week.  Perhaps new proposal 
before Monday's meeting? [3]

- Future work: Tool comparison and documentation for users.
At the Coordination Group call last week we talked about the role of the 
ERT WG in relation to other WAI groups.  There was discussion that ERT 
might collaborate with EO on some documentation.  For example, developing 
the list of existing tools.

To determine if there is some need that we could helpful fulfill, could we 
brainstorm about what needs people are aware of?  I know people want tools, 
but I think they want a process as well - a clearer idea of what tools to 
use when.

What kinds of tools should we try to encourage people to develop (and 
obviously they should all be encouraged to produce EARL).

I don't want to shake our focus from finishing EARL and getting existing 
EARL implementations, but I thought a general discussion about where the 
group is headed would be interesting.

Be well,
--wendy
