It goes nuts for me at page 14. Page 9 is the cool part.

Yep. The layer problem is just that properties are being used for
several different functions in RDFS, and are therefore ambiguous.
Because logical systems require strict semantics, this ambiguity makes
it difficult for people to build stuff on top of RDFS. We even had
this problem a little bit in EARL - we use multiple ranges for
restrictions and so forth, and these are still being debated on RDF
Logic.

There are some cool philisophical reasonsing about this sort of thing
at [1]. Just where is the design of EARL? Is it in the schema? In the
tutorials? In the implementations? It doesn't really matter as long as
it works, but it is an interesting debate.

I very much doubt it.

The RDFS(FA) version is a refinement of the RDFS version. Or rather,
it will be when they publish more examples for reification and DAML; I
left that stuff out for now.

They're just classes that have very specific functions in RDFS(FA).
Where we were previously using "ambiguous" classes, these are defined
more carefully. It is a matter of contention just how much more
"carefully" these classes are defined though.

Yep, that's true. It's been like that for some time now.

I'll be proposing another stripped-down syntax for RDF in XML soon.
Should make it easy to represent EARL in XML.
