Sure that CWM is the only decent SW tool (inference-wise), or sure
that it's demonstration code? I'm sure of both. XSB is the only other
thing that will get the job done (apparently), but I can't install it
on Win98, so I can't test out that theory. SWI-Prolog does something a
little similar, but CWM is still the only SW tool that can really be
used.

Heh! Good one, Chaals :-)

Pardon?

No, you can't point into RDF files using XPointers (at least when
using text/xml or application/xml) to point at triples, because
they're part of the model, and not the syntax. When you point to an
element within RDF, you only point at the element (although this area
is fuzzy - what does a FragID really point to?). Jonathan Borden came
up with a proposal for an RDFPath thing, that would enable one to
point to triples, but it's just a draft for now.

Anyhoo, yes, in the second version I simply gave an ID to the reified
statement. Anonymous nodes are another fuzzy area in RDF (there's an
issue about them on the issues list).

Cheers,
