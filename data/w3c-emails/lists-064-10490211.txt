> #23. ABBR values should be shorter than 15 characters.
> Moved to ATAG.  This is describing a possible technique for identifying

and

> #25. Testing embedded technologies
> Moved to ATAG.
>
> #26. Server-side to client-side image map conversion
> Moved to ATAG.
>
> #27. Logical tab order

> #31. Provide general information about a site
> Moved to ATAG

> #47. Checking A elements for valid text content
> closed
>
> #48. Checking for quoted text
> Moved to ATAG.
>
> #50. Suggested repair for updating equivalents of dynamic content
> Moved to [WCAG Scripting Tech]. Although this is a discussion about
> repairing dynamic content, I think the definition of what it takes to be
> equivalent needs to come from WCAG.
>
> #51. Identifying OBJECTs
> Moved to ATAG
>
> #52. Checking for device independent event handlers
> Moved to WCAG [Scripting Tech]
>
> #53-60 - didn't get to yet.
