>7. Harvey was wondering what is happening with the WAVE?  WC said that it sounded like the Temple folks had finally just located who was hosting the service and that it wasn't a Temple machine.  Temple is still working to get it back online.  Harvey asked about Kynn's offer to host. WC said to wait to see what happens with Temple. WC will talk with Judy.

Just for clarity's sake -- it's the HWG's offer to host.  (I say this
because when it comes to web accessibility I often have several hats
to wear -- the HTML Writers Guild, Reef, and Idyll Mountain Internet.)
The HTML Writers Guild would be happy to host WAVE -if- a host is
needed; the HWG is a non-profit organization with a web accessibility
resource center.  (I happen to currently be -- as of last week -- the
HWG prez.)
