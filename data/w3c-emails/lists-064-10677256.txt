Hello,

I finished going through the AERT open issues today.  Here is what I did, 
let me know if you agree or disagree.  We'll have a quick chat about this 
on Monday's telecon.  If there are no issues, I will pass this on to the 
WCAG and ATAG working groups next week.

The only open issue that was left for AERT was the HTTP headers issue that 
I raised a couple of weeks ago.  Since no one has a recollection of what it 
is about.  I marked it as closed.

57. WCAG 1.0 Checkpoints with no info
Moved to: WCAG
I propose that most of these will be covered by the WCAG 2.0 success 
criteria, and that once defined by WCAG becomes an ATAG-TECHS issue for how 
to automate/walk a user through.
