Since an agenda item for Monday's AU/ER joint meeting is "Carlos Velasco - 
introduction" it might behoove us to read his CSUN presentation:
http://www.csun.edu/cod/conf2001/proceedings/0130velasco.html
in which he outlines the potential uses for XSLT in conjunction with 
attaining our goals as XML becomes widespread.

It contains material that should be of interest to those of us working on 
XML-GL.
