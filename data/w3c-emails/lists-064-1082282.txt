Cross-post re-established - you others are the experts ;-)

(I think I forgot to mention. The templates are actually from the Techniques
for Authoring TOol Accessibility, at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WAI-AUTOOLS-TECHS/#check-use-accessible-templates so
this information will be used for the next draft of that)

  Major comments:
  I think the exact purpose of these templates and style sheets should
  be clarified. For example I use very different style sheets for the pages 
  that I author and for my user style sheet. This is because I expect all 
  kinds of markup from arbitrary pages, while my own pages have a very 
  predictable (to me) structure.
  
  With an authoring tool, I would expect to have a notion of 
  a website or project, in which the set of HTML templates is 
  tied to a limited number of style sheets. 

CMN
Good comment. The template there now is a basic business site (the sort of
thing that 10 zillion webmasters can make for a small to medium
business...). I will add more information about each template page or
project. 

ND  
  It is desirable to have different alternative style sheets with 
  respect to a fixed set of HTML templates, emphasizing the benefits 
  of separating content and structure from presentation.
CMN
Hmmm. An example would be to provide Audio CSS.  

ND
  Also style sheets can be made more general (applicable to more template sets)
  by restricting selectors to be only applied to things that have predefined 
  semantics such as HTML elements. If you use classes, it would be desirable to have 
  a description of the meaning of each class in some document.
CMN
Yes. Comments in the style sheet (and perhaps an "about this template
set" page?) would be good I think

ND
  Other comments:
  
  The style sheet uses "font-size: 9pt" which is an authoring 
  guideline no no.
CMN
True. To be fixed.

ND
  The classes "hide" and "right" are based on presentation rather than 
  content or structure, which may be considered bad style as far 
  as separating presentation from the HTML markup.
CMN
Well, it means the presentation is seperated. (You have to have the class
selector in there to make presentational differences other than those that
reflect HTML semantics...)  

ND
  Maybe it would be better to use XHTML as this is 
  the latest W3C recommendation.
CMN
Yes. (And fortunately these template pages were hacked together in Amaya,
which produces XHTML *smile*)
