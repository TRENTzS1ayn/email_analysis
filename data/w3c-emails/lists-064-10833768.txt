Hi Katie,

I am the Training Coordinator at PIAT.  I received copies of email
correspondence between Len Kasday and you re our November conference.
Thanks
for the contact information.  I will follow-up on those contacts since Len
is
now out on extended medical leave.

You are certainly welcome to participate in our conference.  Please email me
your regular mailing address so I can put you on the list to receive a
brochure when they are ready.  Meanwhile, I am attaching our Save the Dates
flier in case Len did not email it to you.  This will enable you to get it
on
your calendar.

Jan Knuth
