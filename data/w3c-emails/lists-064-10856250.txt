EARL

SP I had an actio nitem to chase up CC/PP and EARL. The author could have 
cc/pp settings, not sure what it is for.  Perhaps context of "here are the 
cc/pp settings that are making the evaluation. needs to be more structured 
so we know exactly what the settings are and what expect back. We need a 
property  should fit well together. Will go through again.

SP Link to cc/pp setting that tool or author has.  Send a request and 
result based on cc/pp settings.

WC Way to report findings from tests on server-side generation.

SP How to point at it from EARL.

WC Anyone else doing?

SP Not many implementations.  Perhaps jigsaw.

WL What does "XML representations of arbitrary languages(Javascript, CSS, 
etc.) (BNF to XML)" mean?
http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/#earl

SP So that we can point into anything in EARL.

WL Way to explore javascript for accessibility?

SP Possibly.

WL Concerned about this.

HB Capture output stream and analyze it.

WC Working slowly on a couple tools. Yes there will be a JavaScript 
techniques document.

Action WC: finish work on javascript stuff ASAP!!!

WL What about Flash?

HB Who working with?

WC Don't think anyone working with, attended WAI meeting in December, 
haven't heard anything since then.

WL In contact with Mike Williams about getting version of Flash generator.

Action KHS In contact with people for conference Len was putting 
together.  Will put in contact with WL.

/* discussion about DIWG, EARL, RDF, namespaces, etc. */

WL Could you send a note to DIWG about EARL?

Action WC get caught up on DIWG list (search archives for EARL) give some 
support why use.

WL Working on requirements doc, benefit accessibility a lot.
