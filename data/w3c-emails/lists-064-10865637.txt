It's not a problem, just another facet of the discussion. In EARL [1]
for example, we evaluate Web content, and we evaluate Tools and so
forth. When you make an evaluation about some generic Web content,
you're basically saying that you're evaluating the content returened
from some resource on a certain date. Hence, the property that links
to this defines this, and a new resource is created. In EARL it's not
a problem at all - it's part of the mechanics of how things work.

However, there are added complications, as you say. One such thing is
that fact that people can sent accept HTTP headers, and CC/PP
profiles, to get a different representation of the resource. EARL
currently lacks properties to describe these mechanisms, but is
extensible so can easily include them in the future.

No, this is something which is highly contextual, and the main stream
of my disagreement. The following can model this situation:-

   :x a :Picture;
      :returnedFrom <http://example.org/img>;
      :date "2001-03-17";
      :containsARepOf [ a :Person; :name :y ] .

There is nothing wrong with creating new URIs to identify a resource
which may exist only temporarily or conceptually inside a system, and
then get processors to understand the distinction.

Once again, this is no problem, unless you somehow believe that what
you get back from a namespace upon dereferening it is the "one true
definition" of the terms in that namespace; utter nonsense.

Not really; they're good issues, but it's so easy to run afoul of
pedantry while chasing them.

Agreed.
