Perhaps we should define an XSLT transformation that converts EARL written in
RDF-XML syntax to XHTML, and require/suggest that the link to it be included
in an EARL statement.

(Thinking about how to do this for the conformance language that danbri and I
made is reasonably easy - I will try to do that as a contribution for someone
smarter than me to build one for EARL as we have it now)
