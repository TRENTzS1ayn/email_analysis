As mentioned in last week's meeting I have begun drafting a new charter 
[1].  It is still very rough. As usual, the roughest areas are marked with 
double at signs (@@).

note that the charter is for a working group.  This would officially 
combine the current IG and WG groups into one group.

I look forward to your comments,
--wendy
