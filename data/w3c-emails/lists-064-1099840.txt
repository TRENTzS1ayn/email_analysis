Re

http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WD-ATAG10-TECHS-20000308/templates/cmnMain - A "home
page"

It uses style sheets for layout and background colors, which means that 
browsers that don't support these features see a radically different 
looking page.

Plus in general there are still bugs in CSS layout even on browsers that 
support them.

So we could get some understandable resistance from tool makers to seem to 
demand only CSS layout.
