It's more of a replacement (well... "alternative") to HTML; it will
have a similar scope, but it's a kind of HTML for the new millennium.
HTML still has many odd features, and remnants of its pre-Web history.
xWebL will of course be modularized (that's a design "requirement").

Yes, and yes. I've looked carefully at the design, and gone through a
lot of material trying to work on this, and it's going really well;
but we need some of the key UI players on board, and they're all busy.
Very much a grass-roots personal thing at the moment, although it
could spark off some amount of interest. It has a cool name, so it
can't fail (that has indeed been the most difficult thing to come up
with)!

We currently have an "<alt>" element which has the same definition as
in RDF - i.e. "choose one from any of the following to render". But
the association information should be kept by the parser.

I found it really fun to go through the different ways of associating
alternatives with text and markup, and after a lot of debating, I
arrived at the current method, which sorts out the external links to
multimedia objects into a particular container, and then references
that from the content either as an explicit link, or as an annotation.
I learned a lot in the process, and still have a lot to think about.
See also my rationale for separating the annotation mechanisms out in
[1] (which is well worth a read).

Aaron is using a different method, but his way does not *require*
textual content to be associated with the multimedia.

Is currently in low circulation (just XTM and here, I think).
