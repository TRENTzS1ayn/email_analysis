Hello,

Our new charter went into effect last week.  With this I am moving our home 
page to: http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/  Note that the IG and WG pages are 
redirected to this new page.

Should we change the mailing list address to w3c-wai-er? All other WAI 
groups have an e-mail address of that form (e.g., w3c-wai-ig, w3c-wai-gl), 
but I'm not too concerned with that. It might cause more confusion than it 
is worth.  Just a thought.
