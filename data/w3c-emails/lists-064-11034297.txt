I added the following tools to the list of existing tools [1] today

1. Clear Language and Effectiveness Tool (CLAD)
2. Dreamweaver 508 Accessibility Suite
3. Reading level calculator
4. Vischeck

I would like to classify these by WCAG 1.0 checkpoint, not just evaluation 
or repair.  I have begun a chart with some, but not all.  Anyone want to help?

In other words:
The Reading level calculator and the CLAD help someone determine if they 
conform to checkpoint 4.1, whereas the Dreamweaver Accessibility Suite has 
checks for checkpoints 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 4.1, 5.1, 5.2, 6.1, 
6.2, 7.1, 7.4, 7.5, 9.1, 12.1, 13.6, 14.1 and possibly guidelines 8 and 9 
(checking on this). This is per the list at 
http://508as.usablenet.com/508AS/1.1/rules

I would like to list for each checkpoint, which tools may be used to help 
determine conformance.
