  I added the following tools to the list of existing tools [1] today

  1. Clear Language and Effectiveness Tool (CLAD)
  2. Dreamweaver 508 Accessibility Suite
  3. Reading level calculator
  4. Vischeck

  I would like to classify these by WCAG 1.0 checkpoint, not just evaluation
  or repair.  I have begun a chart with some, but not all.  Anyone want to help?

  In other words:
  The Reading level calculator and the CLAD help someone determine if they
  conform to checkpoint 4.1, whereas the Dreamweaver Accessibility Suite has
  checks for checkpoints 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 4.1, 5.1, 5.2, 6.1,
  6.2, 7.1, 7.4, 7.5, 9.1, 12.1, 13.6, 14.1 and possibly guidelines 8 and 9
  (checking on this). This is per the list at
  http://508as.usablenet.com/508AS/1.1/rules

  I would like to list for each checkpoint, which tools may be used to help
  determine conformance.
