Wendy,

Thanks for getting the new charter together. It looks good but I have a few
comments:

The mission statement refers to the WCAG 1.0 only. Should we not be working
on the upcoming WCAG 2 as well?

I see no mention of EARL. Should this be part of the charter?

The charter refers to the AERT but it does not seem to be in our list of
deliverables. I think we're going to need an AERT for the WCAG 2. This
document is related to the GL and AU groups but I don't think either of
those groups will create it. Should we (ER) take it on again?

FTF meetings quarterly? Can we reduce that to every 6 months or even once
per year?

It's OK with me to change the name of the mailing list.
