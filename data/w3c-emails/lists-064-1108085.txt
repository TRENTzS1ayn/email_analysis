WCAG says

5.3 Do not use tables for layout unless the table makes sense when 
linearized. Otherwise, if the table does not make sense, provide an 
alternative equivalent (which may be a linearized version). [Priority 2]

This means that someone could use tables for layout in way that the page 
makes no sense and is not usable by any of todays user agents... but still 
get an A conformance rating, because this is only priority 2.

For example, if there's a form laid out in a table with field labels on the 
top row and corresponding fields on the bottom row.

I think the checkpoint needs to be Priority 1.
