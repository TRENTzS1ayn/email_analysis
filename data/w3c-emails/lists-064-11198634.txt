I have an action item for the user agent group to describe the SMIL
poitioning tool I claimed could be made to meet the requirement for
positioning layout elements.

Here is how it works:

Take a SMIL document. Run an XSLT script that turns the layout regions into
blocks in an SVG, and adds a button to "go on". It should also add a method
that allows a block to be focussed, and moved up down left or right by some
arbitrary value. This should be done by DOM manipulation (e.g. with
ECMAsript)

The "go on" button passes the modified layout back into SMIL layout, and uses
it to replace the original layout.

one implementation would be as a powertoy or equivalent in IE/Netscape, using
a SMIL-capable plugin and the SVG plugin.

It could also be done as a freestanding application of an online XSLT service
that made the calls and produced the resulting SMIL - adding a button to the
original SMIL document to call the processor again.

Anyone prepared to do some coding of this?
