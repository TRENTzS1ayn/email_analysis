[Part of the "Webize everything (c.f. [1])" series]

One of the topics that came up in the F2F was a minor implementation
detail - how to link to EARL from whatever file. In HTML, someone
commented that we have the "rel" attribute... however, there are no
decent rel attributes defined in HTML 4.01
[http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#type-links]:-

     Alternate, Stylesheet, Start, Next, Prev, Contents, Index,
     Glossary, Copyright, Chapter, Section, Subsection,
     Appendix, Help, Bookmark.


Luckily, we have the DanC HyperRDF mechnism
[http://www.w3.org/2000/07/hs78/#]. Use that as a profile for the
document, and then simply abuse the system a little bit (remembering
that head can't take an ID attribute) by using URIs as the rel
attributes:-

     <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
          xml:lang="en" >
     <head profile=http://www.w3.org/2000/07/hs78/#>
     <link rel="http://infomesh.net/earl/"
          type="text/plain" href="earl.n3" />
     [...]

Simple, easy, effective, etc.

As for these discussions about representing "things" in EARL that have
no URIs, try: http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Identity
