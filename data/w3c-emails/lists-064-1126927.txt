excellent.

>- 5.5.2 Table Captions - removed (not required by WCAG)

i added this per WCAG discussion.  I will add this back in.

in my edits I removed all of the discussion status sections except for 
those that had outstanding issues.  therefore, only a handful are "under 
discussion."  as discussed in a recent telecon, we are keeping the open 
issues inline in the document rather than having a separate open issues 
document.  discussion status may not be the best title.  perhps we ought to 
say, "open issues with this technique."

is this an issue that we need to resolve before sending this to AU, WCAG, 
and IG?


>I've made changes down to "@@CR - got to here"

I am concerned with how many @@'s we have in the document.  I would like to 
get rid of as many of these as possible before we send it to IG, AU, 
WCAG.  I think it is fine to leave those that mark significant open issues, 
but there are a couple places where it seems there is a mini dialog between 
Len and Chris!  <grin>
