I would like to see something in the mission statement to the effect
that we want to encourage that all tools used in accessibility matters
be themselves accessible to PWDs. This is often overlooked, to put it
mildly. It wouldn't hurt to include this "urge" in other sections as
well even to the point of using our forum to exemplify these issues. An
ERT that cannot be used by its supposed beneficiary is an abomination.

If it can be worked out I would like to see a *lot* of emphasis on the
"accessibilizing" of Amaya (esp. in Section 4) as an example of what can
be done. Ultimately that "test bed" should include most/all of the
tools' functions that we uncover/create - possibly to the extent that
Section 5 contain some language indicating that a true "success
criterion" would be a usable tool that encompassed accessible authoring,
browsing, evaluating, and repairing "stuff Web". 

As there is no longer much "big buck" potential in editors/browsers
there will be little to preclude support from many sources in making our
stuff, particularly Amaya, very open and free. As the Web becomes more
application-intensive it will be commonplace to use the Web to surf and
publish to the Web ("recursive"?) with nothing much in the way of
localized computing power. But we must always keep our "eyes on the
prize" and heavily emphasize that at all stages of this undertaking, the
product must itself be accessible.
