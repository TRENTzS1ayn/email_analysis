It does.

It is in fact based on a commercial website. The marketing people were
perfectly happy that people who did not have CSS enabled saw a different
view.

We are not demanding anything. We are suggesting this as a possible template
that can be used in an authoring tool.

The question then is whether this particular style sheet prodces any bugs (I
am aware of one minor problem - MSIE 4 does not seem to support
display:block, so the links in the nav bar are not presented one per line as
they are in Netscape 4.

  It uses style sheets for layout and background colors, which means that 
  browsers that don't support these features see a radically different 
  looking page.
  
  Plus in general there are still bugs in CSS layout even on browsers that 
  support them.
  
  So we could get some understandable resistance from tool makers to seem to 
  demand only CSS layout.
