Thanks for the n3!  a question tho...

Regarding the first line
quote
<mailto:danield@w3.org> earl:when [ dc:date "2001/03/14" ];
unquote

I'm trying to figure out: what will be mailed?  I guess us humans reading
this file infer that the rest of the info in the file is to be mailed.  But
I don't think an n3 parser would understand that.

I believe that applies to the RDF verion also.
