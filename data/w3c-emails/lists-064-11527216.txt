(hand slaps forehead)

I now realize that the first statement 
quote
mailto:danield@w3.org> earl:when [ dc:date "2001/03/14" ];
unquote
is looking to capture the date and time of the statements in the rest of the
file.

But my comment still applies: I don't think n3 understands that the file
defines the scope of that statement.  Nor does the RDF version.
