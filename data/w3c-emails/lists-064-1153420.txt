Version 1.1 of the Wave Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool is now running at

http://www.temple.edu/inst_disabilities/piat/wave/

It's much faster now... processing takes only a few seconds instead of tens 
of seconds, and it correctly handles pages written in "HTML compatible" 
XHTML, (e.g. the w3c home page).  There's also some cosmetic changes... to 
make the "Enhanced Display" checkbox more evident and to put a link to the 
tutorial explanation on the output, for people who ask "what do these 
symbols mean".
