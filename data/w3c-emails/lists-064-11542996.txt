We are not having our usual meeting monday April 2, since we're having a 
joint meeting with AU.

Also, the AU meeting time has changed.  It's not tuesday anymore.  It's 
Monday, 12 noon, eastern time.

So our next meeting will be Monday, April 2, but at 12 noon instead of our 
usual time.  Phone number is

W3C Zakim Bridge. Telephone +1.617.761.6200.  When prompted for a pin 
number enter 2020#.
