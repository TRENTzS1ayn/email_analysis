Oh, I think I see what you mean: you want the date in the earl:asserts
context, yes?

The way I have it at the moment is:-

     <mailto:danield@w3.org> earl:when "date"; earl:asserts {  } .

I suppose the "earl:when" should apply to the entire statement, e.g.:-

     <> earl:when "date" .
     <mailto:danield@w3.org> earl:asserts { :x :y :z .} .

Or if you have more than one date for a file:-

     { <mailto:danield@w3.org> earl:asserts { :x :y :z .} . }
     earl:when "date" .
