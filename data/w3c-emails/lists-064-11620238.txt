I wanted to pass on the news that I am leaving the Microsoft
Accessibility group for a new job as a project editor with Microsoft
Press. That means that after this week I will no longer be a member of
the ERT working group. (Though with my many absences recently, you
probably figured I was already gone.)

I've thoroughly enjoyed my time with the group and the WAI as a whole,
and I will miss you folks and your dedication.

Dick Brown, Microsoft
