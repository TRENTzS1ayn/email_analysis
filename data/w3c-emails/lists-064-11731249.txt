>Product name:
>
>508 Accessibility Suite for Dreamweaver and UltraDev
>
>Features:
>This new Dreamweaver evaluation tool allows web site
>to be "accessibility-checked" much in the same way as
>you "spell-check" a word document. The extension
>covers Section 508 and level 1 W3C/WAI guidelines and
>a report can be run on one page, a complete web site,
>selected section or any folder. The user can select
>sub-groups of the guidelines to customize tests to run
>on different web pages. The extension allows the user
>to collect answers to manual tests and includes
>content that explains how to perform tests, why the
>problems found could be accessibility issues and
>explains with examples how the problem can be fixed.
>The extension links through to an Online service from
>UsableNet that allows tests to be automatically
>scheduled on live public web sites. The service starts
>at $49 per year and allows a web site owner to
>centrally monitor the accessibility of their web
>sites.
