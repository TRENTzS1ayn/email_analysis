The User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 [1] currently has a
section about making valid conformance claims. At the moment, the only
example [2] is in prose (XHTML), but ERT WG is working on a language
that should be able to express conformance claims such as these in a
machine readable format, called "EARL" or the "Evaluation And Report
Langauge" [3].

What follows is an informative hack attempt at representing the
example provided by UAAG in EARL. This is provided purely for comment
only, and does not constitute any kind of normative example; this is
merely on the whim of the author :-)

Please note that this uses an experimental and as yet unpublished
schema. I expect (i.e. hope!) this to be published shortly, pending
approval by ERT. Minor modifications cannot be ruled out.

Thanks for your time,
