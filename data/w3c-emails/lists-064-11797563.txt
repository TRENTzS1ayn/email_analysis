I present to you all:-

     http://infomesh.net/2001/05/earl/bookmarklet/
     - A Javascript Bookmarklet For EARL

Purely as a proof-of-concept. I'm too tired to write this up fully
yet - just try it and tell me if it works/fails. Hey, you could use it
to make an EARL evaluation about itself... but only if it passes!
