Take the WART example, if someone wanted to adapt the rep5.cgi last
step of the report script suite (which gather the data and send an
email to wai-report@w3.org today) to generate a EARL piece, it would
need some kind of perl package to do so, to easily generate the n3/rdf
notation from a higher level API.
