Very unrool... (Australian for cool)

Proposed further work:

1. Make it generate the stuff in RDF/XML syntax as
an annotea annotation. Should we look at setting up some server to hold
these?  or ask the Annotea crowd if we can give the program an ID it can use
to store them?

2. Mix this with the WART tool (I guess that was an obvious one :)

I guess we also bneed to stabilise the EARL stuff a bit more before we need
to go around builiding large-scale applicatiosn, although we should be able
to use existing equivalence vocabulary to make sure that we aren't building
legacy stuff that will bite us.

anyway...

I used it to produce the following bit of N3
