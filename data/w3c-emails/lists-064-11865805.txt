makes clear that this stuff isn't clear for non-geek/nerd folks.

begins to look a bit more like human language but still the various ":, @, 
and #" symbols aren't all that friendly.

The effort to explain the function/process/structure of our central 
language is now going to move forward. Sean will try to answer all our 
naive questions and anybody who has a better grip than I is encouraged to 
leap right in with proposals for a "prose" rendition.

Len wrote a sort of introduction some time back as to what its purpose is 
but the details are only clear to folks like him, Daniel, and Sean with 
Charles able to convince anyone except DanBri that he also can speak this 
dialect. We have to get this through what Wendy can write down, Gregory can 
figure out, and Al can explain to me.

For example, the idea that the above URIs reveal a schema that somehow 
fully describes this language and that it is so simple (only two {count 'em 
2} possible "statements"), yet looks like the recipe for flying to Mars is 
a bit daunting. Its very simplicity enables it to evaluate and report on 
just about anything - from document through language via guidelines! It is 
a fundamental tool for the Semantic Web in that it gives "power to the 
people" who can say anything about anything.
