There is a chunk of my page on the conformance thing that Danbri and I did
which explains it in words and pictures (for those with Amaya - most others
just get the derived text equivalent) without referring to syntax at all. I
think this is a smart way to go in explaining EARL for dummies. How to make
an actual EARL expression can follow later for those who want to write tools,
or want to hand-code stuff.

(Actually the image  I have is not unlike the text that Sean used, and breaks
back to almost exactly the same - http://www.w3.org/1999/11/conforms/ for the
curious)

  We have a couple of problems with "EARL for dummies":-

  1) The syntax. To create a model, you need a syntax, but then people
  get bogged down in it, and forget what it was they were learning
  about. I want to learn about EARL, and now you're telling me to go
  read up on XML Namespaces, RDF Model and Syntax, and Notation3? Why
  can't it just be EARL? We have to explain that EARL is built on top of
  these thing, but also to provide people with just enough information
  so that they can understnad EARL. No more. If they want more
  information, they can always follow the links.
  2) The model. How do we represent this in a media-independant manner?
  Clearly, we need some easy-to-understand text... simple introductions,
  lots of examples. Daniel/Charles hit upon this in the teleconference.

  Anyway, that's a little bit to be thinking about. The attached primer
  isn't all that good... but it's a start.
