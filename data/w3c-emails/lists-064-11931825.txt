In lieu of my doing anything genuinely useful with circles, rectangles and
arrows, I've posted a diagram of the 0.9 schema here :
http://www.isacat.net/2001/05/misc/earl09.gif

The picture was generated with Protege-2000 (my favourite toy at the moment)
using the Ontoviz (Graphviz) plugin. The original layout was short and very
wide but with the help of a little assistant I've rearranged it somewhat.
