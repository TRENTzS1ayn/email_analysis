Neat! I already hacked up a simple view of the data model, linked to
from:-

   http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/0.9model.html

but it hasn't got anywhere near as much detail as your version. Would
you mind if I linked to your version from this model page? Is there an
SVG version of it somewhere as well?

Thanks again for this,
