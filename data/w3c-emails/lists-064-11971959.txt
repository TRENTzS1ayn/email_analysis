I'd prefer to put it in a separate document - the overview should just
be a central hub and light intro to EARL (IMHO), but it's up to you. I
could add the issues to the current document for now, and you could
always split them off later on (then you can chaACL the new page at
the same time!) if you want to.

Anyway, I've added some:-
