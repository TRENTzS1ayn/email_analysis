OK, so this causes a problem for me. In some cases the assertor will not be a
person at all. For example, the CSS validator might run around W3C's web site
every week checking if things are valid, and making EARl assertions about
those that are not.

  Neat! I already hacked up a simple view of the data model, linked to
  from:-

     http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/0.9model.html

  but it hasn't got anywhere near as much detail as your version. Would
  you mind if I linked to your version from this model page? Is there an
  SVG version of it somewhere as well?

  Thanks again for this,
