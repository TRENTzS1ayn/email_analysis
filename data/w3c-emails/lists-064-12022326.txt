Of course: that's why "Person" is a *sub* class of "Assertor", not
daml:sameClassAs. From the 0.9 N3 schema [1]:-

   earl:Person a rdfs:Class; rdfs:subClassOf earl:Assertor .

Has this not come across in the graph somewhere? Hmm... is says
"Person isA Assertor", which I guess means that all instances of
person are also instances of Assertor. While that's correct, it should
be noted that this isn't the only sub class allowed. The whole point
of rdfs:subClassOf is that as well as being a transitive property (as
indicated in the graph), it's also a refining mechanism - it allows
you to specialize super classes.
