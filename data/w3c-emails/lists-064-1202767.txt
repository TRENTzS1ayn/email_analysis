It's not just that the styling gets lost for people that don't have CSS 
enabled.  It's that even with CSS enabled, CSS pages can look wildly 
different in current browsers... at least that's my experience trying to 
use CSS, and getting quite different results among NN 4, MSIE 5 and MSIE 5.

So even if we present templates that have only minor bugs, we wind up 
telling the developers that they have to follow these templates exactly or 
they could run into trouble.  Or if we don't tell them and they run into 
these problems, we risk backlash.

I think CSS is find for font and character size, but beyond that we should 
focus on other issues.
