Much better Danny.

A couple of comments.

- imo, "io" is not the best choice for "instance of", it sounds too much
  like IO as in Input/Output in regular computer science. I'd suggest
  "ins", or "iso" or whatever.

- I'd prefer roundcornered black box or green squared for instance
  rather than red, which holds the warning/important semantics more
  that anything else to me 

- I still like to see some relationship arrows or something linking
  together all the root elements of this forest (assertot, testcase,
  etc).
