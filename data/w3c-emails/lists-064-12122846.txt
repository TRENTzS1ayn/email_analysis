Here are some of Len's last missives. I would like to propose a "memorial 
reinsertion of 'Repair'" into EARL. If I can stop crying long enough.

Hi Group,
After our next telcon (on 4/23) I'll be away till June 15, and Wendy will 
be acting chair till then. (tho I may get a chance to pop up on email 
occasionally).

I just posted email to the User agent list [1] about a tool I whipped 
together for folks with signficant motor disabilities.

I'd suggest we leave it alone.
I see Daniels point that it doesn't fully describe repair at this time.
However, we don't want to paint ourselves into a corner where we can't add 
it. So it has that potential, even it it's not in the intitial release.
And even now, it can be used FOR repair.
Also, "Report" sounds too much like just one of the applications, making a 
human readable output summarizing the results. So it makes it too narrow, 
and we need to omit the name "report". This leaves the "R" in EARL meaning 
nothing.
If someone can think of some meaningless thing for R to stand for that 
would be OK with me.
Having said all that, if the consensus of others is to make it Evaluation 
and Report Language, I'll go along with it.
Len

Why are you saying repair is not core?
Personally speaking at least, I think it's an important part of EARL. For 
example, if I'm evaluating a web page, and I see some poorly worded ALT 
text, I'd certainly want to have a way to suggest better ALT text. And once 
I do that, the output can be used for repair.
Repair has been in the user scenarios for months... e.g. see the part 
starting at http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/earl.html#evaluation .
