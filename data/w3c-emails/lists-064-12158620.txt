Hello all,

Len and I tried to talk on Fridays to plan for the WAI ERT WG.  We only 
missed a few and I think it was because our conversations were so 
enjoyable.  We talked about new tools, dreams of an accessible Web, WCAG 
issues, experiences with developers, but we also talked about life and 
philosophy.  We had scheduled a 1/2 hour talk, but usually talked at least 
an hour sometimes more.

He was a good advisor, someone working in the trenches bringing good 
information to the table.  He made the WCAG WG face difficult issues 
head-on.  He asked the questions that no one else was asking.  He was funny 
and witty.  He was a great listener,  a quick learner, a problem 
solver.  He made the world a better place. I will miss the wonderful ideas 
and perspective that Len brought to our work and lives.

I would like to create something (a short message?) on the WAI ERT home 
page, but am not sure what to do.  Ideas?

RIP. With sympathy,
--w
