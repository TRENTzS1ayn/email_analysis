Wendy et al,

I want to reiterate one of the themes Wendy raises, because I experienced it
first hand. I have known Len his whole time of participating in WAI, and I
always appreciated the we he went out of his way to understand me and the
points I was trying to make. I also know that he did a lot of work with AAC
users in Philadelphia. It is a rare gift that is all too uncommon in this
world.

Len will sorely be missed.

Hello all,

Len and I tried to talk on Fridays to plan for the WAI ERT WG.  We only
missed a few and I think it was because our conversations were so
enjoyable.  We talked about new tools, dreams of an accessible Web, WCAG
issues, experiences with developers, but we also talked about life and
philosophy.  We had scheduled a 1/2 hour talk, but usually talked at least
an hour sometimes more.

He was a good advisor, someone working in the trenches bringing good
information to the table.  He made the WCAG WG face difficult issues
head-on.  He asked the questions that no one else was asking.  He was funny
and witty.  He was a great listener,  a quick learner, a problem
solver.  He made the world a better place. I will miss the wonderful ideas
and perspective that Len brought to our work and lives.

I would like to create something (a short message?) on the WAI ERT home
page, but am not sure what to do.  Ideas?

RIP. With sympathy,
--w
