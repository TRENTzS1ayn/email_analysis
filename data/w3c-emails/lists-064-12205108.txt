Hello all,

With the news that Len has passed, I find it hard to schedule a call to 
discuss technical issues.  Instead, I would like to open up the call for us 
to share thoughts about Len and grieve.  Anyone within the WAI community is 
welcome.

His family and friends are arranging a memorial for him.  We don't have 
firm details yet, but will pass them along as soon as we know.  It sounds 
likely that it will be Friday 25 May at Temple University in Philadelphia, 
PA USA, but this is not yet confirmed.

For the time being, I will continue to act as chair of the group.

Call details:
Monday 21 May, 10:00-11:30 Eastern USA Time (GMT -05:00) on the MIT bridge 
(+1 617-258-7910)

Be well.
