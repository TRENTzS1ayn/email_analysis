>3. Any feedback on The Wave Evaluation Tool

     http://www.temple.edu/inst_disabilities/piat/wave/

This happens when WAVE returns my original all in italic, and italic
already exists on the page before WAVE analysis.

Allowed in HTML, what is the meaning of properly nested
multiple <b> or <i> or <em> or <strong> or <u>? Should there be a test
or warning for such?

How about if they are improperly nested?

What if the same emphasis is repeated in the nest, as is now the
case in what WAVE returned from my

I note inconsistent behavior with nesting of emphases, ignored in
MSIE5, and at least italic and bold independently treated in NSN4.6
(and similarly em and strong).

Is this an issue for WCAG? for AT?
