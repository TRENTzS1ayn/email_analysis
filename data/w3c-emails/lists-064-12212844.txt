Wendy, good high level intro.

one question and one comment:

Comment:
Since this is a very basic intro and you are trying to avoid techno-jargon,
I would recommend avoiding terms like SVG and WCAG.

Instead of

... Or if a user agent displays SVG images properly.
"Properly" is defined by the SVG specification.
"Accessible" is defined in WCAG.

I think "browser, HTML, and specification" would work though:

... Or if a browser displays HTML properly.
"Properly" is defined by the specification.
"Accessible" is defined in a W3C specification:
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)


Question:
How public is EARL?  WAI/ER/IG [1] is a public page, but I think the
Overview [2] is a member only doc, etc.
Since IBM is a W3C member co, I can share EARL with others in IBM right?
