Please note, with regard to a memorial service for Len, that this is being
planned for Thursday, May 24, at 1:00 p.m. in Morris Arboretum in
Philadelphia, and not on Friday as suggested below.

Additional information will be available over the next several days, and we
will forward this once it is confirmed.

If anyone on this list had forwarded the previous message, would you kindly
also forward this clarification to the same location(s). Otherwise please
wait until we have a more complete message -- many thanks.
