>3. Any feedback on The Wave Evaluation Tool

     http://www.temple.edu/inst_disabilities/piat/wave/

What is the reason for the unexpected return of everything in italics,
when not so in original?

Consistent for URLs I checked on my site:

     http://www.tiac.net/users/bingham/index.htm  and others there linked to.

Do you go to any extra effort do so, as what is already italic stays that
way in IE5.

I note inconsistent behavior with nesting of emphases, ignored in
MSIE5, and at least italic and bold independently treated in NSN4.6
(and similarly em and strong).

Note: Allowed in HTML, what is the meaning of properly nested
multiple <b> or <i> or <em> or <strong> or <u>? Should there be a test
or warning for such? How about if they are improperly nested?
