Attached for your consideration is the latest version of the schema.
Here is a list of changes:-

1) The domain and range semantics way too strict for earl:asserts -
now using a DAML restriction instead. This means that people can use
earl:asserts in their own ontologies.

2) p/o in earl:Assertion has been swapped around. Aaron and I had a
chat about this, based upon Charles work on the RDF Conformance
langauge thing. It makes more sense that way around.

3) Now uses a novel way to define evaluations and assertions - as an
intersection of some restrictions on the reification properties. Got a
little feedback on this, and in any case, I think it's a good
development - better than doing it in prose.

4) Added "earl:excludes" For example, when you say that "my page
conforms to all WCAG AA points except for one...". This is now a part
of the new Test Criteria stuff.

5) Added a set of standard ResultProperty(s). e.g. by providing
"earl:passes" and "earl:fails".

6) Changed hasX to just X. Affects:-
hasEmail => email
hasName => name
hasAddress => address
hasPlatform => platform
hasSnapshot => snapshot

7) earl:date now mandatory on earl:TestSubject.

8) hasSnapshot is non-normative. (ths hasn't been added, but should be
to the prose).

9) Added earl:note. Like rdfs:comment, but allows for complex objects,
which rdfs:comment doesn'.

10) Added earl:repairInfo, and changed earl:expectedResult from having
a domain of earl:TestCase to earl:repairInfo.

11) Changed range of expectedResult back from rdfs:Literal to not
specified (i.e. rdfs:Resource). This is the most important property
for repair.

12)  earl:released and earl:lastModified now have earl:Date as a
range.

13) earl:released and earl:lastModified are now rdfs:subPropertyOf
earl:date. Useful!

14) Added earl:sameSubjectAs.

15) Added earl:os and earl:ccppSetting.

16) Added domain to earl:testSubject.

17) earl:version now has less strict domain semantics - can be used
more widely.

18) Added earl:DateRange stuff

19) Added earl:Operator, as a person who operates a certain tool.

20) Removed earl:testResult.

21) Corrected rdf:Literal to rdfs:Literal.

22) Added earl:testSuite - must point out the difference between this
and earl:suite.

23) Added the earl:testCriteria stuff:-
a) earl:testCriteria
b) earl:level
c) earl:excludes

24) Added earl:UserAgent

25) Added "earl:testSubject a daml:UniqueProperty".

I think that's it. If you spot any other, please let me know. Full
discussion on many of the changes above can be found on the list
archives, but if you can't find it, please don't hesitate to ask.
