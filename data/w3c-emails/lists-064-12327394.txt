This is just a terse introduction with a few glitzy daigrams of the
data model, some in SVG as well:-

   - EARL Model Primer

The text is mainly space-filler type stuff, although some of it is
useful (to me, at least!). My suggestion is that you take whatever you
can from it, and repurpose it into your own "EARL for Dummies" type
things.
