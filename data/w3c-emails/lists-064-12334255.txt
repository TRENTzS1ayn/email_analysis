I suggest that EARL should not stand for anything at all, and when
quizzed, we should just refer people to some of the core discussions
on ERT about what it should be called. It's perfectly acceptable to
have an acronym that has no particular expansion. In fact, in the case
of EARL, every time we've tried to expand it, we've ended up not being
able to fully capture what we mean.

The characters "EARL" should be enough to symbolize to anyone who has
worked on the language enough to recognize the whole "feeling" behind
the name, and, to people being introduced to the language, they won't
have some redundant first impression of a language that may need at
least a thousand words to explain. In other words, "EARL" should
become a word (acronym) of its very own.

There are only a few instances of the expansion on the EARL homepage
anyway - these would be quite easy to remove, and perhaps replace with
a link to this note, or some XHTML equivalent.
