This Was Odd -- Many Old Names Tried, Here's Something.

(If your point is "EARL doesn't need to expand to anything," the
point is mistaken -- all caps is how you do <strong> in email
text.  If you mean to say that the correct name is
<strong>EARL</strong>, then you're still left with the question of
"what does EARL mean?"  And people will want an answer, they won't
just blindly accept "we like the name 'Earl' because it sounds like
that tea, but we couldn't define this language enough to come up
with an acronym expansion.")
