I agree with Daniel.  In fact, the R, which stands for Report instead of
Repair seems to imply a scope to EARL.  It's not MathML, It's not Annotae
(spelling?) it's not AERT, it's EARL!

Phill

I disagree, this would be contrary to people 's expectation and
jeopardize the adoption of EARL to start from.
