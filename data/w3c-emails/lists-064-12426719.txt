Could someone throw off a quick sample of what an RDF in XML
using EARL (and Dublin Core or other appropriate Ontology)
for my little sample DOM test suite http://home.houston.rr.com/curta/domtest/sample.xml

It would be good to see how an experienced EARL guru would 
represent some fictional descriptions and history of 
test evaluations.  A previous novice attempt using DCMES
is at http://home.houston.rr.com/curta/domtest/sample.dcxml

How would you represent that a test was accepted (or rejected)
by a specific authority (such as the DOM WG)?

I did not mention that individual assertions
in a test case are also addressable by a fragment URI.

Any comments on whether to embed RDF within the test 
definitions or to keep the metadata in a separate file?

Also, is the XML Schema conformance test group aware, considering
or using EARL?

Any XML Schema for EARL?

I assume that EARL 0.95 is not available to nonmembers at this time.
Any time frame for its availability.

Is the primer document available?
