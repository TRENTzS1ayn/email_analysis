Hi,

all EARL work is public (as in available to anyone at all, member or not), so
whatever we have you should have access to.  http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl

The idea is to have EARL in RDF schema, although there are some pieces for
which it seems that it would be useful to provide XML schema representations
- essentially the context (who made a report, when, about what) might be a
mix of EARL, Dublin Core, XML schema - this is not yet fixed.

I won't try to write the EARL sample, having just got off a plane, but I hope
I will be able to do it y tomorrow.

I don't know if the XML schema testing folk are looking at this - do you have
a suggestion for who to ask (or just the mailing list?)

Cheers

Charles McCN

  is at http://home.houston.rr.com/curta/domtest/sample.dcxml

  How would you represent that a test was accepted (or rejected)
  by a specific authority (such as the DOM WG)?

  I did not mention that individual assertions
  in a test case are also addressable by a fragment URI.

  Any comments on whether to embed RDF within the test
  definitions or to keep the metadata in a separate file?

  Also, is the XML Schema conformance test group aware, considering
  or using EARL?

  Any XML Schema for EARL?

  I assume that EARL 0.95 is not available to nonmembers at this time.
  Any time frame for its availability.

  Is the primer document available?
