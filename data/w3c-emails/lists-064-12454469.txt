To:<w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org>

The latest schema is available in N3 from [1], and XML RDF from [2].
More importantly, there are now three examples of EARL 0.95 available
in N3 [3], [4], [5], and XML RDF [6], [7], [8]. The schema itself has
only undergone a few buggy changes - very nearly ready to be released,
IMO.

One large issue: shall we keep the enumeration using "daml:oneOf" on
earl:validity, earl:confidence, and earl:testMode, or shall we let
people create their own terms? IMO, the latter.

Another issue: are we releasing this without prose? Can we add the
prose later using rdfs:isDefinedBy arcs?
