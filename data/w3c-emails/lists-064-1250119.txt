In line with the "things look different in different browsers" fact:
Even among all browsers that "support" CSS there are not-so-subtle
differences in *appearance*. It is a complete *DUH* that I've noticed
the same phenomenon. They really look different in PWWebSpeak! I don't
have HPR but I will give long odds that they also look different there.
Since so many Web designers are dealing with this all the time we don't
need to worry our pretty little heads about this aspect. Let's try to
make a few generic templates function and demonstrate. In this case the
content can be "blah, blah, blah" and "picture of wideget 32u4" but
still clearly illustrate how a reasonably accessible site actually
*looks* pretty much like its non-conformant cousins - which also look
different when viewed with varying apparati. One thing is to put a
template through Bobby/WAVE/tidy/validators and put up those results
sort of like screen shots and make the *process* of ERT use into a sort
of tutorial?
