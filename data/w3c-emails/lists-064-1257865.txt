Thanks for spotting that everything can get returned in italic.  I didn't 
intend that.  Must be a bug a gotta chase down.  With any luck, the bug 
will be in my code, not in something I'm using (the last bugs were in the 
parser I was using).  With less luck, I'm hitting another bug in rendering 
of CSS.
