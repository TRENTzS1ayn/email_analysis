Hello all,

The primary question from Monday's telecon was "how do we convince 
developers to use EARL."  We've put this on the agenda for our joint 
conference call with the AU WG on Monday.

Can we think of arguments, that are not accessibility related, that we 
could use to convince developers?  For example, how would we convince the 
DOM test harness developers to produce EARL.  Why would they want to do that?

As we discussed Monday, the DOM WG wants to combine results of several test 
harnesses (to show interoperability?).  The guts of the test harnesses can 
be completely different, but as long as they all produce markup 
someone/thing could combine results between them to get the overall 
conformance picture.

Which is why they are currently "looking at developing a language-neutral 
form of representing tests (including expected results for advanced 
reports), documentation and other relevant details. We want this format to 
be language-neutral to support porting to most existing languages."  [1]

To this  end, they have developed methods.dtd [2].

Will the "steep RDF learning curve" that Curt refers to [3] and Dimitris 
agrees with [4] be a problem in adoption?  I think this is part of the 
issue that William was raising from his work with the Device Independence 
Working Group and why he wanted a low-level primer.

Therefore, the issue seems to be adoption of RDF over XML rather than EARL 
in general.

Thoughts?  Am I off base?  I'm still trying to get my head around this.

Be well,
--wendy
