And Curt jumps in 5/6ths of the way through after not realizing what this thread was about until the last moment.

What I think would be a coup for EARL on test reporting would be if EARL support could be integrated into JUnit (or other xUnit derivatives) in a non-disruptive manner.  Basically, with a future
release of JUnit, any existing test suite could have its results reported in EARL via a command-line option.

The first hurdle would be providing a URI for the test.  If a URI for the test was not specified, one could be generated from the class and method name using the java: protocol described at
http://www.w3.org/addressing.  I don't know of a method to generate an URL for a specific assertion, but the current asserts could have a new variant that takes a user-supplied java.net.URL as an
argument.  I guess the target of the test could be specified on a command line or in the user interface.

Has anyone had any interaction with the JUnit community?

Of course, all of the proceeding is downstream of the DOM TS effort.
