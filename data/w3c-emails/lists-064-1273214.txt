As for the accessibility of the template...

http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WD-ATAG10-TECHS-20000308/templates/cmnMain

Unfortunately, it's actually less accessible than the table version, at 
least with Netscape 4.7.

That's because when you increase the font size (e.g. in NN 4.7 
with  control - right square bracket) the text from the left and right 
regions overlap each other, making reading difficult or impossible.

On the other hand, with a table version, the text wraps in each region so 
it stays readable up to larger font magnification.  At larger 
magnification, when there's no more word boundaries to wrap on,  the table 
expands so that you can still read it by scrolling horizontally.

So for people with low vision, it's not as good as a table.

Is it possible to add the table features to the example, at least in 
principle?  Also, what's the state of how they're supported?
