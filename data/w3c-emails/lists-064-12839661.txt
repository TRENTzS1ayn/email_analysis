Nick,

Thanks for posting the notice. The ATRC is developing the accessibility
checks for HTML Tidy.

We have the beta version of the code working and hope to have it integrated
with Tidy in the next couple of months.

There are about 50 accessibility checks that we're performing.

If you're interested in helping us test the program, please let me know.

Cheers,
Chris
