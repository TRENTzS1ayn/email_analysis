1.  Todays IRC: this afternoon I'm suffering from a connectivity
    problem I've never had before (probably ISP-related).  Was OK
    for the first 15 or 20 minutes, then v.intermittent.  Apologies
    if I missed anything I should have replied to.

2.  Future: perhaps we could/should ensure that the agenda is
    properly coordinated with subjects of current discussion on
    the mailinglist.  Is that what you normally do for telecons?

3.  General: I find 'spontaneous' (unscheduled) discussions often
    the most useful.  As we mentioned, there's quite a crossover
    between #validator and #er (I guess we're the ones interested
    in building and running systems).  IRC is functioning (somewhat)
    as a "virtual coffee break" for some of us.  #validator is
    quite often busy around evening -> midnight and after (GMT).
