Attached as <<1.0spec.html>>. In researching for this specification, I
came to the conclusion that our current documentation is really poor
(which admittedly is mainly my fault for not documenting what I was
doing). Relying on people to work out EARL from the RDF Schema was not
a good idea :-)

Hopefully, the attached specification will start to make up for that.
Feedback and comments are most welcome.

Cheers,
