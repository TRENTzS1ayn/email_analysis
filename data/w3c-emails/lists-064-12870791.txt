Great!

Even greater! I found the scripts easy to find, download, and install,
and it appears to have worked like a charm. Most links are underlined
in dashed orange at the moment, except links to valet.webthing.org
(the test site), and w3.org.

Note that http://www.e-media.co.uk/earl/template.xml gives a 404 not
found error, and moomin.dll gives "16389 (0x00004005)" and won't
download in IE (it will in Mozilla).

BTW, the line:-

   <Assertor rdf:parseType="Resource">

in the EARL 1.0 specification was a typo; it should read simply:-

   <Assertor>

as it does in the example above. Sorry 'bout that. Note that the
examples for EARL 1.0 are experimental at the moment, although I don't
expect that the template will change in any way (except for the
namespace: I'm just using "1.00" as a test namespace, reserving "1.0"
for finished versions. I should have used "1.0-test").

Your hash property raises an intersting situation: that people will
and should be able to add properties that serve the same function as
"date" and "version". We use date and/or version just to make sure
that assertions about one page or thing on one day aren't confused
with the same thing on another day, when it may have been fixed (or
broken).

Anyway, the demonstration is a very good one. Is there any possibility
of releasing the ASP code and any other trinkets required?

Cheers,
