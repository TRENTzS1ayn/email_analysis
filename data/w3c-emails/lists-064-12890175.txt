Aaargh ... now I'll have to find time to look at it so I know what you're

OK, OK.  I wasn't going to go public with this yet, but there's a
nascent tool at <URL:http://valet.webthing.com/xslt/waitest.html>
you might like to look at.  With a suitable XSLT it will generate
EARL, but (as with the validator) I need to figure out what the EARL
reports will look like.  Any input to that (sbp? aaronsw? jim?)
will be appreciated.

That looks like an agenda item for next meeting.
