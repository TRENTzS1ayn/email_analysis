Sorry, it's pretty dull at the moment anyway, I could do this in Mozilla
without the xul, in a horrid hackabout kind of way (as a bookmarklet.)
I'm not sure if it would be worth it, as the XUL stuff is the way to go,
it just doesn't work yet.  All the dependance is though, is with your XML
validator (oh yeah, I have an oddity on that, using your extension
ie.html, or my original one, or the normal interface
http://www.showcaster.com validates ok, however making the identical
request (to ie.html) from my createearl.wsf, results in a fountain of
errors - my system dtd?)

I'll have a look, the well formed XML though would be a problem with real
sites...

Er. 'cos I was asleep? within ~10-19:00 GMT just send me an email and
I'll join, outside that not so easy, I'm often only on 9.6k modem so I'm
normally just collecting email, but I may have a proper connection
occasionally.

Jim.
