I'm now rewriting the backend so that it stores things in a more
combinable and searchable format, and is this the right method for
combining multiple pass/fails in a single assertion?

http://www.e-media.co.uk/earldev/query.asp?http://jibbering.com/

It passes the validator, but I'm not to sure about the graph, (mind you
I'm not too sure about the graph when there's only one - I think  my RDF
understanding isn't completely there.)

The idea is that people upload EARL reports, I extract the predicates,
and then just serve up this combination, making the full reports
available from the "moomin:original" url - perhaps adding in other
properties identifying which validator and things.

Jim.
