Ah, this validation complains (well just the odd 1464 errors) about
http://www.showcaster.com/ aswell, whereas
http://valet.webthing.com/page/val.cgi?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.showcaster.co
m&demoronise=on  says it's fine.

Also it points out a WCAG 6.4 error saying if you specify an onclick you
should also specify an onkeypress, this is bogus (of course it's not your
fault, it's the lack of scripting appreciation over in wai-gl.) onclick
should only be duplicated by onkeypress if the behaviour on a click wants
to be duplicated when you press a key... needs to be a warning.

I can process that into failure against checkpoints, I don't need EARL,
and add some into my database then look to provide an interface for
deciding what you want reporting on.

Cheers,

Jim.
