That sort of thing is why I hadn't intended to go public yet :-)

But I just took a look: it's complaining about your SYSTEM DTD,
not about the document itself.  I'm not sure what I'll have to
do to fix that - watch this space.

The messages are defined in the Schematron's WCAG demo wai.xml.
I haven't touched them, beyond changing the output format.
Once the software is in place I'll think about whether the
messages can be improved (in fact I *know* they can: none of
them tell you a priority level yet, nor do they indicate
whether they are a definite error or merely something to check).

Right.  Don't put too much effort in yet - the format isn't exactly
stable.  By all means tinker with it, though ...
