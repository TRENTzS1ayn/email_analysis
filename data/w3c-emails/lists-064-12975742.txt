I've updated this thanks to Sean for sorting me out on the EARL (although
I've thought of a problem about using the HASH as the rdf:resource for
the webcontent - as all the "congrats on installing apache!" pages will
have the same hash - I need to make the hash more complicated, this is a
"TO DO")

I've also removed the dependance on Nick, by creating my own WCAG 2.0
checkpoint 1.1 robot, which is out harvesting sites at the moment (it's
very poor, and I'm actually worried it's not actually checking the right
page, I've got some odd results.) but it does mean that a page like
http://www.w3.org/ has quite a few pages links with the borders.  I've
also included a screenshot of part of the w3's homepage so non IE users
can see what it looks like - if you installed it last time, nothing needs
to be done, you should see the update straight away, there's a new
package though.

Cheers,

Jim.
