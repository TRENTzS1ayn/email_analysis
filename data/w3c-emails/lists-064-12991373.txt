The word you were looking for is "experimental" - and basically means
"what I'm hacking on just now".  Quite apart from anything else, the
present script eats far too much of my poor little server's resources
to put it anywhere it's going to get "general" traffic.  And I know
there are still bugs to work out.

The external script is the best approximation to a generic "manipulate
CSS properties dynamically" script.
