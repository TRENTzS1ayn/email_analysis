This should apply only to graphical input elements such as:

     <input type="image" src="submit.gif">

It doesn't apply to "ordinary" types of input elements.

Techniques documents are non-normative and shouldn't be trusted (for
whatever reason; I didn't create the "non-normative" vs "normative"
distinction and frankly I don't care for it).

Then again, WCAG 1.0 is a bit dubious in the "trust" category and
that's one of the reasons that WCAG 2.0 is under development.

WCAG 1.0 by its very nature requires judgment calls, and that means
authoring tool developers (such as you) who are trying to create
tools to support WCAG 1.0 will also have to make judgment calls.

Luckily, in this case, the judgment call is pretty simple:  the
checkpoint only refers to non-text input forms which can't be
rendered in non-graphical browsers.
