Hey this is quite cool.

I think that there are a few ways you could clean it up...

One is to remove all the syntax stuff to linked examples for people who are
interested, and just have the prose description stuff (which is very cool)
in the main page.

It would also be good for the group to formally agree that the canonical
syntax is XML RDF, or to formally agree that there are two syntaxes and a
defined conversion algorithm, or whatever.

And the other thing is for us to do more work on looking at existing
implementations and how to make something of them, and to collect the
information we have about them.

Cheers

Charles

  a good idea :-)

  Hopefully, the attached specification will start to make up for that.
  Feedback and comments are most welcome.

  Cheers,
