You will recollect I hacked up an online demo running Schematron with
the "wai.xml" WCAG-testing schema at

<URL:http://valet.webthing.com/xslt/waitest.html>

As far as I can tell, this experiment is a dead end.  The basic problem
is that I cannot see how with Schematron to reference the messages
back to the page source, so the report is of very limited value.
If anyone thinks they can help with this on a technical level,
please get in touch!

However, the work I did on waitest did serve to point the way to
the Visual Validator, now running live at

<URL:http://valet.webthing.com/page/>

My plan is now to resurrect the WCAG project by incorporating
accessibility messages (as an option) into the Visual Validator.
I am already experimenting with a couple of mechanisms for this,
and I hope (but can't promise) to have some kind of demo up and
running in the not-too-distant future.

Given that waitest.html is being discontinued, is there anything
in particular from the existing demo that people would like to
see preserved in a replacement system?  In particular, is anyone
using (or thinking about using) waitest in your projects?
(I know Jim is already using the Visual Validator XML - anyone else?)
