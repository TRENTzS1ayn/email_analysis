Agenda for Monday:
- Schematron - Nick asks "is it useful to continue development on this?"
Refer to Nick's recent message: 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2001Nov/0031.html

- EARL 1.0. Refer to Sean's latest and greatest documentation:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2001Nov/0006.html

- Jim's EARL client
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2001Nov/0007.html
and the question that came up about combining results between EARL reports.
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2001Nov/0009.html
Nick also brought it up in a separate thread a few days earlier:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2001Nov/0002.html
Combining reports is one of the major features of EARL and one of the 
primary implementations we've been waiting for.

This thread also brings up the point of date not being sufficient to 
identify a report uniquely, especially for content that is generated 
dynamically.

Are there other topics people would like to nominate for the 
agenda?  Please send suggestions to the list.

Be well,
