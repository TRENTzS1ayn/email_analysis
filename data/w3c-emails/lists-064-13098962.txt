I will be attempting to broadcast this "live" (small delay...), and
offering a recording for download if no-one has any objections.

I'll be using Windows Media format, as I have a server, and encoders that
will run off of a phone line.  I'd like to use the ACELP codec, but that
may not be supported by the linux player, so if not I'll be using windows
media 7.   If you wish to test your system before, you can use these two
files:

mms://cast.showcaster.com/acelp.wma  (or http:// if mms doesn't work.)
(max 8.5k/s)
mms://cast.showcaster.com/wma.wma  (again or http:// ) (max 20k/s)

Please let me know of any problems (ACELP aswell as being less than half
the size is also better quality.)

Windows,  and Mac users can use Windows Media Player (available from MS)
and for other platforms I know of http://www.mplayerhq.hu/homepage/
although there may be other solutions.

The recording which will be available afterwards will be in MP3 aswell as
the above format.

There should be more than enough capacity, but if hundreds want to listen
in, please let me know :-)

Of course this may not work, I have recorded teleconferences before,
_but_ it's never been done on a real one...

Cheers,

Jim.
