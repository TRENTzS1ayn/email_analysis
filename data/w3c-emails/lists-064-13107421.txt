>
>To use Zakim:
>Dial +1.617.761.6200 
>At the "enter your passcode followed by the pound key" message, 
>enter 3781#.

>During the conference you can mute your audio by entering 61#. 
>You will hear a rapid three-tone confirmation when your command 
>has been recognized. To unmute your audio so you can again 
>be heard, enter 60#. You will hear a different (lower) rapid three-tone 
>confirmation. If you enter either command more than once in 
>succession you will only hear one set of confirmation tones.
