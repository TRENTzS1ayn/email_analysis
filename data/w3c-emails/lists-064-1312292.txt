Note that the W3C has a copright policy about work which it produces (an what
a working group makes is covered by the policy) that means software is
licensed under a BSD-type license - we are obliged to publish the source
code. This I suspect is primarily because we are a member-funded
organisation, but in general I think it is a good idea.
