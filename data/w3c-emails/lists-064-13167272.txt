hello,

I thought someone had sent a note for the F2F saying that I had messed up 
on the announcement for the bridge.  We are not on Longfellow, we are on 
mystic (617.252.1859).  We are in the middle of lunch and will be 
reconvening the meeting in about 20 minutes (e.g. 9 a.m. East Cost USA).

sorry for the confusion.
