Well, assuming my syntax came out correctly (I mostly did it by nasty hacking
code :( I ahve the following comments:

It seems from teh Schema that there are other results - notApplicable is one
I would have liked, but didn't know how to use.

I actually find it easier to work in XML syntax. Really. It would be nice to
have either examples in XML syntax, or get a conversion tool to make some for
us.

(Although what I would really prefer is a tool that did this for me. Maybe we
should owrk harder on hacking Art's Annotea bookmarklet toy...)

There are a fairly restricted range of earl: things - spec isn't in them. Do
we want to keep the others in earl? I would still like to use dublin core for
the creator of the statement, be it a person, a tool, or a flash of
inspiration in the form of a small talking bird...

I'm tired, so that's enough for now...

  Well, I assessed (in my head) three specs (XHTML 1.0, SVG 1.0 and SMIL 2.0)

  EARL). Hopefully this gives us something to play with, and the PF group
  something to use when they need to do an implementation report.
