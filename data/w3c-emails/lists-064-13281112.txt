  [[[

  So for example:-

     _:x a earl:ResultProperty; earl:validity earl:NotApplicable .

  No you wouldn't! You think you would, but really you wouldn't. Once you
  start prefix/alias creep, you can't get rid of it...

Well, I'm going to go away and think some more, because I ahve thought hard
about this before and talked about it a lot and keep coming back with wanting
to use DC as is. I'll leave that open for now...
