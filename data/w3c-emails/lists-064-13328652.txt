Jon Gunderson, co-chair of the WAI User Agent (UA) group, organized the
evaluation methods for assessing current user agent concurrence with UAAG
guidelines.

User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0.
Candidate Recommendation, 12 September 2001

     http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG/

Jon and others in UA assessed eight user agents so far. This work provides
backup for justifying UAAG going to Candidate Recommendation. See:

User Agent Evaluation Report for Candidate Recommendation

The following references indicate how to do a user agent evaluation,
and the expected results gained.

I have recommended that the UA working group consider using EARL.
Mapping from the UA results to EARL is on the agenda for the UAWG
face-to-face next Monday and Tuesday in Seattle. Wendy Chisholm will
attend that meeting, and present EARL. There will be a phone bridge
available at MIT:
