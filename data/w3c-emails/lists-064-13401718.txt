Who is going to generate such a beastie?

Or do you have in mind a predefined URL (a la robots.txt),
or a third-party EARL database server?

How is this going to apply to a large multi-author site, that take care
with new content but has a legacy, and perhaps some departments using
dicey publishing software?

If we just take the author's word for it, aren't we defeating the
purpose of EARL?  I was under the impression that we were looking
to collate comments from different sources, from the automated
such as Site Valet to the human "I can't read that".

An author or QA manager can generate an EARL report on a page.
A webmaster can define an overall site policy and (try to) insist
everything conforms.  But this is merely like collecting Bobby stamps.
If Granny Arthritic can't follow the feedback link for reasons the
author has overlooked, the EARL may never be corrected.

I guess what I'm trying to get at is that I came out of the f2f
with thoughts of this leading to something reminiscent of GroupLens,
but that doesn't seem to fit with what you're describing.
This would imply some mechanism for collecting third-party EARL
input for any site in a centralised database - a project that could
be somewhere on the event horizon.

Yes, but...

I am planning to use text/x-earl in the absence of anything better.
