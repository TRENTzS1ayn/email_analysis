The whole site thing is tricky: RDF had "aboutEachPrefix", but it was
decided that it should be romved to a higher level in the language. CWM has
"startsWith" as a built in, but once again, it's at a higher level in the
lange. You could model a whole site in any number of ways, it's just
deciding which one is best: we can probably decide on that when we get to
it.

RSS? We're syndicating EARL? :-)

Metadata linked from HTML sounds like the best solution, but we'll have to
investigate scenarios. It's not too difficult to parse HTML to strip out
link data.

Well, it's a neat scenario, but remember that an EARL file is independent
of the files which point to it. It's not as if you have an association from
a file to a piece of EARL saying "this is the conformance claim for this
file", because the EARL itself contains that information. You can say,
"here is some EARL that is related to this page, but don't take our word
for it: parse it". EARL can't exist without a TestSubject part, because it
simply wouldn't work.

I reckon that we shouldn't decide at the moment, until RDF Core state
clearly the MIME type for RDF and its derivatives. I should chase that up.

For now, all EARL is going to be served as text/plain or text/xml, so just
leave the "type" attribute off. It's only advisory.

People tend to ignore that, sadly.
