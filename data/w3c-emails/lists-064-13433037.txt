How does that work with a web site, a unique earl report for each url on
the site, how does that work with urls with query portions?  How can EARL
exist unless this has already been decided, how EARL is used is much more
important than what the tags look like.  I'm astonished by this thread.

Why is EARL served as text/plain - why do you feel it should not have a
mime-type, what purpose does that serve, you say yourself that EARL
contains the information about the url it refers to, this would mean that
an agent could be guided towards just the EARL reports, and never need to
see the url itself unless it was accessible to the group that it was
interested in, this would be harder though if it was text/plain - how do
I configure my UA to cope with earl reports if it's served as text/plain
? it needs it's own mime-type.

If it's as little thought out as EARL seems to be, I'm not surprised.
