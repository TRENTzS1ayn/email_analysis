The assumption here though is that authors use _an authoring tool_ I
don't believe this is true at all, especially within groups particularly
interested in accessibility, those groups, use a suite of tools,
especially due to the low level of accessibility support in the majority
of authoring tools, especially when combined with cost (so older tools
are in use.)  In that enviroment I think most people would, as an site
manager you could easily have a robot at least test the normative parts
of WCAG 2.0 for all pages even if the author didn't.

I think that would be fine, although it would presumably exclude some
users from a subset of those pages, e.g. if the granular report said it
failed in an area that was only relevant to a couple of the pages, then
the EARL report would still mark them all as inaccessible to its user.  I
see nothing wrong with it refering to all, how does that work though
within the current EARL framework, what wouldearl:testSubject be?

Are they not? there's a reasonably clear set of methods of adding them to
pages, which does make them in effect readable.

Require, with difficulty I think unless the EARL can be generated
automatically, so as not put an undue burden, otherwise I feel the EARL
would just be added, as you say we need to trust the author, if it's a
struggle to create EARL, it won't be done.

I don't see WYSIWYG as necessary a single seperate program (or suite)
would be better, rather than trying to generate new ones for each
authoring tool, or encouraging authoring tools to do it. (which obviously
don't exist, I'm slightly confused as to what you refer to here, I'm
assuming just "authoring tool")  If we concentrate too much on authoring
tools it increases the complexity and difficulty and time it would take
to develop them which would be better served concentrating on the content
itself.

but a long way off.
