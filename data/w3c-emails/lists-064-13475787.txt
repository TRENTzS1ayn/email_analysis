No, you don't have to have a "unique EARL report" for every URL on the
site, as we've just been discussing!

"Than what the tags look like"? Your reply is a little incoherant here, but
mine was also badly phrased. EARL just offers the framework for giving the
context, the subject of the test, validity, and metadata for the test case.
The way in which these are represented is flexible, of course, to allow for
a wide range of evaluations to be carried out. We are only just coming to
specific implementations, and are finding that we need to pin down the
scenarios, detailing ever smaller parts of the EARL framework.

We're by no means finished yet, and the current version of the framework is
only a beta 0.95. If you're astonished by this thread, then I submit that
it is because you have done little competent research, and/or are missing
the point entirely.

EARL can be served as text/plain because EARL is based on RDF, and RDF is
often served as text/plain, or text/xml depending upon the serialization.
This is something that is dictated wholly by RDF, and is not under our
control: we must use whatever MIME type is mandated by the Semantic Web
activity for RDF, and as there is little current agreement about it at the
moment, we simply follow developer practice, which as I say, is to serve as
text/plain or text/xml. If you have a problem with that (and it is a valid
problem), I suggest you take it up on RDF IG, but it is a thread which
comes up every so often, and on which little progress is ever made.

At least EARL seems to be a little better thought out than your
delightfully condescending reply :-) As Wendy pointed out, please let's be
constructive here. We've been working on EARL for many months now, and you
have had plenty of time with which to send feedback.

Cheers,
