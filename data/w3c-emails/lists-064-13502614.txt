As Wendy said, all focus was on the developer, that was a big mistake,
and one I can't understand how it was made.

I know why EARL can be served as text/plain, it's just useless to do it
as I see it.  How do I configure my user agent to cope with it (bearing
in my mind my user agent is a webbrowser, and text/plain is human
readable, it's no use having EARL displayed in my browser which is the
current setting for text/plain.) It needs a MIME type.

If it's mandated by RDF, then RDF gets in the way, it doesn't do the job
of making EARL reports useful.  It needs a MIME-type, and "text/x-earl"
seems appropriate to me for now.  What's your reasoning against that?
Even if there was a consensus on the MIME-type for RDF what would that
bring, how would I (without getting some RDF parser, which I don't need,
I just need EARL.) use EARL?  I couldn't pass all text/rdf (or whatever)
to my EARL parser could I?

The conclusion to that is, that new input is not welcome, I obviously
scanned the archives before joining, but resurecting old threads would've
been little use out of context.
