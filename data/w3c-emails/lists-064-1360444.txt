Here's my comments:

> Technique 1.1.1 [priority 1] Check IMG elements for valid "alt"
attribute

"bullet".

If the image is assumed to be a bullet, one should suggest the author to
use 'ul' and 'li' with style sheets.
If the image is assumed to be a horizontal rule, one should of course
suggest the author to use the 'hr' element (see <URL
http://ppewww.ph.gla.ac.uk/%7Eflavell/www/hrstyle.html >).
Not doing this, would violate Guideline 3 -- "Use markup and style
sheets and do so properly".

Is this really *always* necessary? If someone uses background music
(e.g. some piano music) on their site (which of course is a *Bad Idea*),
IMHO there's no reason to provide a text equivalent, since the
background music would degrade very gracefully.

The technique says "where necessary", but suggested message is "Audio
and video files *require* [my emphasis] a text equivalent."

For detecting ASCII art, you might be interested in reading this

Should also check if a background colour is defined when text colour is
(for cascading to work with user style sheets). And if one or more of
'vlink', 'alink', 'link' exists, 'bgcolor' and 'color' should also be
used.

I've used the CSS rule 'q { color: #color; background: #color; }' on
some of my pages. IE supports CSS on Q elements (but doesn't display the
quote marks).

> Requirement: quote should be marked up with Q or

And other quotation marks, e.g. 66s, 99s and guillemets (french
quotation marks).

Quotation marks in Unicode are U+2018-U+201F, U+2039-U+203A,
U+275B-U+275E, U+301D-U+301F, U+FF02, U+00AB and U+00BB -- possible some
more.

The algorithm must be able to deal with nested quotes, e.g. "outside
quote 'inside quote' outside quote" and ?outside quote <inside quote>
outside quote? (where <> isn't <> but U+2039 and U+203A (these arent
available in iso-8859-1).

It should also be able to deal with french quotation marks where there
is a small space (not a normal space) between the text and the enclosed
quotation marks (??).

properly

An inline quote will often contain more than 10 words. And I'm pretty
sure that

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

has a sementically different meaning from

<p><q>...</q></blockquote>

The latter can be used when marking up a novel. Even when an entire
paragraph contain a person's line, 'blockquote' should not be used.

> Technique 3.7.3 [priority 2] Verify that BLOCKQUOTE is not used for
formatting

If the 'blockquote' has a 'p' child, we can be pretty sure that it's a
real quote, right? Most people just write

<blockquote>Indented text</blockquote>

('blockquote' *must* contain a block element (or 'script') to be valid
HTML.)

> Technique 4.3.1 [priority 3] Verify the primary language of the

And sub-codes, e.g. en-UK and no-NYN should not be flagged as errors.

> Technique 5.6.1 [priority 3] Check table for header abbreviations
> Discussion Status:

NO! If you do that, then 'L?ved?r' would be unprouncable, which it isn't
(in Norwegian). Unicode 3 contains almost 50 000 characters, most are
pronouncable, not just ~96 of them!

A paragraph with more than 200 words should be divided into two or more
paragraphs?

Three or more (following) paragraphs with less than 20 words each should
be converted into lists?
