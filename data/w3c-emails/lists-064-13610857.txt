Note that HTML WG are struggling with what they feel are needs that are not
met by X-Link.

We need to learn what those unmet needs are.  But at least in the present
case, the structure that seems to be friendliest both to HTML tradition and
to X-Link decisions is to use a construction something like:

<div> <!-- or any other container -->
<meta keywords="accessibility, report">
<meta scheme="EARL 1.3.7">
<link role="meta" href="URI-reference_returning_EARL_doc"
type="cturi:text/rdf;version=1.2">
</div>

Clearly by HTML precedent we can use META and LINK in the HEAD of an HTML.

I would want to know if it is legacy-safe to inject META and LINK elements
in the BODY or if current processors will croak.

Of course, HTML WG are saying that XHTML 2.0 doesn't have to be
legacy-safe, but I am still concerned to come up with usages that are.
