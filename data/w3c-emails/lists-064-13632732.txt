Are you on HTML-WG?

Unmet needs?  Yes indeed.

We installed Site Valet for a company whose intranet standards required
certain metadata to be visible within every page - so it had to go in
the <BODY>.  We incorporated a custom DTD to enforce the metadata,
and wrapped the whole thing in a <div class="metadata"> which was CSS'd
to appear as a footer.

Ugh!  If anything is going to break back-compatibility, trying to
reuse HEAD elements in a BODY must be a prime candidate.

No, if a document is going to point to its own EARL report, then a
LINK element (or META as second choice) in the HEAD is the right
mechanism for it.

Erm ..... no comment.

Or on second thoughts: yes, here's one printable comment.  It would
be entirely wrong for them to introduce constructs that break back-
compatibility gratuitously.  If they do break it, they should be
prepared to demonstrate both a genuine need and a genuine lack of
any back-compatible alternative.
