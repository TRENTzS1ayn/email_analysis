I don't believe any of the major browsers would have any problem, and my
own testing seems to confirm this on various win32's,   (why ROLE though?
we already have supporting UA's for REL/REV, introducing ROLE seems
strange, but I've not looked at the rationale behind it.) They're also
exposed in the DOM of IE so tools could be built on top of it.

I think in WAI terms, we do have to be legacy safe unless there's some
incredibly powerful reason, anything that breaks current access technology
is dangerous.
