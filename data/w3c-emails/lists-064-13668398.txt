No, but they listen to us [WAI-PF] more than we talk to them.? And in
principle
WAI-PF listens to all the rest of the WAI.? There is every intention on the
part of HTML-WG to listen to the WAI.? Where the communication breaks down, it
is not usually on account of lack of good will from their side.

There are any number of toothaches languishing un-worked-on so any we can
rough
into a plausible proposal here are all to the good.

See the wai-tech-comments archive at lists.w3.org/Archives/Public for more.?
Any functional gaps in HTML you can back up with a disability-impact scenario
should be filed there in addition to whatever else you do to advertise them.

If you don't need it to parse the contents, I am inclined to wonder if it
couldn't just be at the foot from the outset.? And the 'role' be on an html:a
and not an html:link anyway.? But then bundle in metadata or diversity options
using wrappers for the legacy constructs.

We should be trying to make the order in the wire format the order used in
"just play it to me" speech output, as much as possible.

Or else we really do need to require the script -- by which I include XSLT --
to order it that way.

_Empty_ HEAD elements???? I just want to understand why it breaks something.

Element types are for what they do, not where they go.

The basic problem is that in order to provide a content model for The Web
which
give equal justice independent of the concurrency-horizon of viewports or
interaction modes, we need to view web pages not as atomic 'resources' but as
extended samples of a finer infoset 'web.'? Or at least this view is presented
in the attached "page scope not universal" argument and figure.

It is feasible for backward compatibility to lift all object metadata into the
'head of the current document' as a part of the packaging for delivery of the
extended infoset sample.? But this is extra work.

There is not legacy practice for metadata, or is there?? You seem to have a
customer that does use it.? What is the current usage of metadata with HTML?

The example I offered was meant to span

? a) using DIV in HEAD to bundle META properties with LINK references
? b) permitting this inline in the BODY

One can lose b) without striking the example, only the comment.

The argument against this is that there should be plain HTML information
disclosing the path to more information.? No machine secrets; nothing up the
sleeve.? People use hyperlinks in footers.? They don't use invisible LINKs in
HEADs.? We should prefer solutions that are compatible extensions of things
people do use over reclaimers of things people don't use.
