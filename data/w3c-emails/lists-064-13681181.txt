Thwe contents were maintenance information, including page maintainer
(with a mailto: link) and page review dates.? Site Valet parses that
lot to email maintainers when reviews fall due, among other things.

I'm not saying it does break something.? But why take the risk?

Erm - I'm postponing looking at that (time ...).

This customer is using a custom-DTD based on HTML4.? I wouldn't regard
it as useful input to any HTML-WG deliberations, beyond what I already
said about enabling human-readable metadata.

There are certainly uses of <META> on the Web at large: for example,
robots exclusion, PICS.? Why should a parser looking for things like
this even parse the <BODY>?

<div> would be the wrong element for that.? An expansion of the
syntax of <meta> would make more sense:
<metadata purpose="accessibility report"> ... </metadata>

This is effectively what we did with the customer I mentioned,
though it took some smoke-and-mirrors with <div> and CSS to
achieve satisfactory browser presentations.

But that's exactly what <LINK> and <META> are!

Yes they do.? <LINK> support is gradually hitting the mainstream (recent
Mozilla and MSIE variants have finally got around to doing something
sensible).? You'll lose that by putting it in a <BODY>.

OTOH nothing in your example will be rendered by any existing browser -
except the <LINK> if put in the <HEAD>.

BTW - this is email-only, because yours was.? But feel free to quote
from it in a public forum if you want to.
