This linking is sensitive the the ease of implementation by the repair tool of
the machine-followable path, yes.

AG::

Then you have a verrrry strange model of user behavior.

Users are couch potatoes.  99-44/100% of users won't mess with the metadata
unless picked up in a search algorithm.  People operating through a layer of
Assistive transformation are at an added disadvantage in taking control of the
process, and many who would wish to operate the way you say just won't be able
to manage the complexity it imposes.

Let's get the record straight.  We tromped on all kinds of vendors' corns to
get various format specs and the UAAG to assert that the user has the
inalienable right to get into all the hair and micromanage to their heart's
content.  But part of selling this policy is the observation that so long
as we
make the author's preference easier to just accept, for the most part only
those who genuinely need to exercise detailed control will ever bother.

There has to be a "plain web" report presentation or the _content providers_
will rebel and won't agree to have their content ratted on unless they can
review and get comfortable about how the report is talkin' 'bout their
labor of
love.  This is more for the authors than for the users.  Most users won't
bother.  Please see my post from earlier this morning with regard to the plain
web presentation of EARL results.  It's a piece of the system that has to be
there.  For authors' comfort and for users' rights.  But for users, the plain
web presentation is only touched by a small fraction of those who benefit.

And for some LD users and others for whom a small majority of the Web actually
works, it is simply not a solution to first go to each individual page and
from
each of these navigate to the EARL based report on accessibility.  There
has to
be pre-filtering of the available stuff based on pre-collection of the
metadata, in order for the density of workable pages in what they _try_ to
browse, to come up to a level where it is at all worth the time to try.  So at
least for these hard-case communities struggling to get _onto_ the web (and
there is a not-small group of LD potential Web users for whom this is the
state
of the art) the coupling into search algorithms is essential to getting up
to a
minimum success level from where we are today.

The point of putting it in machine comprehensible structure is for downstream
machine processing.  The point of developing a common schema into which you
register or sientifically place the information is so that information from
multiple sources can more readily be combined.  But the whole thing has to be
carried out in a fishbowl of human-comfortable reporting or the machine
processes will not be trusted and the machine-comprehensible form won't be
used.  The system has to provide "operational processes" methods of ensuring
that what the machine is told is something that the humans involved should
have
to put up with, or the whole thing is a non-starter.

On the matter of recombinant information and documenting what you publish, see
the "avoiding the sidewalk closings on the way to the restaurant" scenario I
just posted to GL and then EO.  Yes the user should select what resources they
wish to use, and in fact have machine assistance in merging information from
different sites.  This _is_ radical.  We _do_ need to demand it.  The ability
to do this in the User Agent is only a matter of making the "son of MSAA"
protocol for AT extension of mainstream E&IT as sought by the U.S.
Accessibility Forum sufficiently schema-aware.  All you have to do is to look
at a few scenarios like the sidwalk closings scenario to realize it is a
disability access issue.  All you have to do is pop up from Web Services to
Grid Distributed Computing to realize it is endemic in everything about where
the Web is headed.  So this is just a matter of doing the
AT-with-mainstream-technology treaty right as an instance of "any function can
be done anywhere" Grid protocol architecture.  Small coordination problem? 
Yes.  But _it's happening as we speak_.  Doing it right is readily achievable
if we can just get the word out before the concrete is hard.  We should be
using the generation and exploitation of accessibility evaluation results as a
demonstration of all the key cogs in this next engine of internet progress.
