All I'm talking about is rendering <LINK> elements in a sensible manner,
such as a toolbar (Mozilla makes this an option, and the installation
default is off) or right-click menu.  Of course some minority browsers

I think the metadata-in-body is a different issue.  No, it wouldn't
(normally) make sense to put an Earl report link in a BODY.

That's essentially my point too, but I'm shutting up now until I've
read properly the references sbp has posted in this thread.
