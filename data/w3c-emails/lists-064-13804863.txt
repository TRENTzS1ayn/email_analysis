I have to disagree, conceptually it goes in the head okay, the problem is
in current HTML parsers, they all (certainly the major, and the ones that
serialise for us which I've tested) consider it the start of the "body",
therefore to place it in the head will confuse these, they'll see multiple
bodies, the adding of body attributes will be lost, or confused, or
reliant on error correction.

My only problem with this "portal page" concept, is that the control is
not with user, they're simply consumers, whereas I feel strongly that
users can and should be more involved than that, so the linking has to be
appropriate, I'm most concerned about identifying version and type outside
of the RDF.
