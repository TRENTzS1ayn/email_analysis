Cool...

Do you have a way for the validator to point to errors as URIs in a spec
instead of just strings? (i.e. do the tests it runs correspond to testts that
are specified as first-class web objects, or are they implicit magic that you
had to develop yourself?)

(BTW, is this URI going to be stable - i.e. can I build another experiment on
top of the first one?)

cheers

  At the f2f on Oct3, I took an action to look into generating markup

  With some help from sbp, I've now knocked together a first
  prototype at <URL:http://valet.webthing.com/xslt/>.
  Although I'm struggling on the EARL learning curve, Sean tells
  me it parses OK, and has promised to review it.

  I hope some others on this list will be interested enough to review it.
  Comments welcome!
