Well, I would like to do a couple of things. The first is to chain it up to
an N3 to XML converter, and the second is to store some data on test cases,
fix them and see how we go about comparing two csequential reports.

The other second thing I would like to do is to hook it up to the Annotea
system for storing the information, and then play with the threading of
reports in Annotea.

The other second thing is to collect other information that has some overlap,
and then to squish the data together and se what we can do.

cheers

  That's somewhere on the long-term TBD list, and any public discussion
  of it will probably be on the www-validator list[1].

  Not necessarily stable.  If you want to build another experiment on
  top of it, let me know what you need to be stable and we'll take it
  from there.
