So the first thing both you and I do, is chain it up to an XML converter -
any chance of you doing this as an option Nick?

I'll be looking at extending Snufkin to look at this data and report on it
(Possibly also putting in some form of Annotea client as I agree Annotea
would be a good place for reports. Although that will require me to learn
all about it.) and also build some sort or "repair tool" that takes an
EARL report and displays the errors to the user in page with their
browser.
