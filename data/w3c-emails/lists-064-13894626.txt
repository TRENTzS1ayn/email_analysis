Ahem - did you read the page?  The validator is generating XML to start
with: the EARL is generated by filtering it through XSLT!

The XML reporting has been up-and-running for some months now, and is
likely to be more stable than the EARL.

I'll be interested to see what that looks like.  It sounds like
precisely the kind of thing to help judge whether the EARL reports
are going to be useful in the real world.

Another one I'll be interested in ...

- and that's a direction I'm looking to go in myself!

OK, if you are pursuing these projects, just let me know when you are
about to reach the point where something will break if my stuff changes,
and we'll see to it that you can have something stable to work with.
In the meantime, I still need your comments on the reports I'm generating,
as the format and contents of these will very likely be subject to
change as I get to understand the things better.

FWIW, we have a precedent for an app built on top of Site Valet's
XML Validation.  The MSIE browser plugin is something Jim dreamed up
and prototyped, and I then integrated with the XMLMessageReporting.
