  Ahem - did you read the page?  The validator is generating XML to start
  with: the EARL is generated by filtering it through XSLT!

Yep, but I meant RDF XML syntax instead of N3 syntax. (there are online
conversion services available to do this - Sean probably has a URI to hand).

  I'll be interested to see what that looks like.  It sounds like
  precisely the kind of thing to help judge whether the EARL reports
  are going to be useful in the real world.

I think it looks like two sets of reports that have some conflicting
statements about the same objects. They would also differ in author and date.

  Another one I'll be interested in ...

This is really a mechanism for doing the previous task, but it is in
development - I believe the next version of Amaya will have a working user
interface to play with it.

  - and that's a direction I'm looking to go in myself!

  OK, if you are pursuing these projects, just let me know when you are
  about to reach the point where something will break if my stuff changes,
  and we'll see to it that you can have something stable to work with.
  In the meantime, I still need your comments on the reports I'm generating,
  as the format and contents of these will very likely be subject to
  change as I get to understand the things better.

Well, since I am looking to chain online services together, changing the URI
will break my bookmarkelts I am assuming that (modulo temporary bugs) the
output will continue to be available as RDF in N3, so I can use a service to
convert from (say) EARL 0.95 to EARL 1.0
