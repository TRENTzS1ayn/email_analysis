I disagree, both on a technical, and philosophical viewpoint.  I want to
assert that my content is accessible (and how), I need some way to do
this, I'm not interested in using a 3rd party for my core business.  Then
there are authoring tools themselves, they need some mechanism, and it
needs to work offline, and needs to be transferable across different
test/reporting/authoring tools, including where there's no server
involved.

I don't think it needs to be the only method, 3rd party reports are very,
very valuable, but I do think some way is needed for author linking
aswell.

Jim.
