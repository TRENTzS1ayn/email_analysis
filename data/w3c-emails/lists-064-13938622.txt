I agree that the author should be able to describe the conformance of their
work directly although I expect most authors to do so via a tool. But I
think we would do better to have a method of reporting that works for both a
third party and for the author. Otherwise we are going to have to build an
extra discovery mechanism into every tool that wants to deal with the
information. This also reduces the risk of havng a setup where people try to
claim that they are the only authorative assessors of their content which
philosophically seems plain wrong to me.

(I should have said "there is little point defining a different way to linka
statement to an HTML document from within, I guess).

  I disagree, both on a technical, and philosophical viewpoint.  I want to
  assert that my content is accessible (and how), I need some way to do
  this, I'm not interested in using a 3rd party for my core business.  Then
  there are authoring tools themselves, they need some mechanism, and it
  needs to work offline, and needs to be transferable across different
  test/reporting/authoring tools, including where there's no server
  involved.

  I don't think it needs to be the only method, 3rd party reports are very,
  very valuable, but I do think some way is needed for author linking
  aswell.

  Jim.
