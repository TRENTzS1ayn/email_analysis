Hmmm - fair enough, but is there any advantage to using EARL as your
starting point over using XML?

- and presumably the acid test is whether you can really gain anything
by combining those reports?

Where does this get discussed?  Is there any reading material?

hmmm, well,

I'll post advnce notice of any change to this list, so you get the
chance to shout if it looks likely to break something.  If you
absolutely want an immutable URL, I'll run it (also) at some
path away from any namespace I might want to re-use.  Maybe
something like valet.webthing.com/Chaals/ ?
