The XML serialisation of EARL is much, much nicer than the N3 (that's
personal opinion of course.), and more importantly there's a parser
installed with lots of the browsers out there - Forcing a Python + Python
libraries to get the Snufkin Earl client running is I think
unreasonable - quite apart from being a 15mb download rather than the
current 300k.

Of course you can, it's not (currently) feasible to integrate my script
checker with Site-Valet - I can't even put a web interface on it at this
time, yet a combined report would be useful to users.
