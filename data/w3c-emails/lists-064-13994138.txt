Our next teleconference will be held Monday, 29 October 2001 at the 
regularly scheduled time: 10:00 AM Eastern Time (14:00 UTC/GMT).  To find 
out what time it is in your time zone use the Time Zone Converter [1].

It will take place on the MIT bridge: +1 617.258.7910

Agenda for Monday:

- Where does the EARL go?
We've had a lot of discussion about how this might work. Primarily, we've 
been thinking about - how does a user make use of EARL?  Some people feel 
this will work more like an annotation (where content and report are 
associated in an 'annotation server') others that it will be metadata 
attached to content (e.g. html:link or html:meta or 
html:something-else).  It seems that both of these should exist, but how 
will user agents, search engines and other tools deal with them?  This 
comes out of a question from the WCAG working group about how will content 
authors make conformance claims in EARL.

Part of this discussion was wondering how HTML should/might evolve and what 
exactly it is we would need.  There was also a lot of discussion about a 
MIME type for EARL (as well as RDF). What to use now vs what might be 
possible in the future.

I would like us to continue this discussion on the telecon on Monday. I 
particularly hope all of you who have been participating on the list can 
make the call.

- EARL 1.0
Sean published a draft schema.

He also published a list of EARL 0.95 questions:

- Update on implementations
The list continues to grow:

This week Nick Kew published the address of his experimental validator that 
creates EARL:

CMN and JL would like to pipe the output (currently in n3) through and 
n3tordf convertor for further processing.

- Primer and support material
I was going to present to UAAG about EARL and their use of it in their test 
suite development. In prep I began working on a set of slides:
http://www.w3.org/2001/Talks/10-earl/Overview.html

This week I've been using this as a place to store some of the issues and 
think through some of this stuff.  Still needs a lot of work, but perhaps a 
place to start for some people.  I will continue to work on it in the 
upcoming weeks.  Suggestions, additions, deletions, etc are welcome.

I would like to have a set of slides together for the QA F2F meeting which 
is the middle of November.

Be well,
