  OK, we have two conflicting requirements here:
    (1) This is experimental: I want to be able to update it as I see
        fit and without regard to back-compatibility.
    (2) Others want a stable interface

  To accommodate both, I've duplicated the existing service at
  <URL:http://valet.webthing.com/xslt/20011027.html>.  This will
  remain stable so long as anyone needs it to.
