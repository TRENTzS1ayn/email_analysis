Sure, we could set up IRC chats.  That might be the best way to pull everyone in, although Jim's idea about broadcasting and saving the audio files is interesting - although then we would have to create exact transcripts wouldn't we?

I'll be on the W3C public server: irc.w3c.org port: 6665 channel: #er

In the future, we can use this channel for meetings as well.
