Just a note,

the AU group is now using IRC as well as telephone for most of its meetings.
It seems to work well, and when I ma minuting I use it to provide minutes
that are then edited (to remove the IRC-specific stuff) and published - it is
a litle harder than using Amaya directly but not a lot. It seems to be useful
for the people who find telephone-only difficult.

  Sure, we could set up IRC chats.  That might be the best way to pull everyone in, although Jim's idea about broadcasting and saving the audio files is interesting - although then we would have to create exact transcripts wouldn't we?

  I'll be on the W3C public server: irc.w3c.org port: 6665 channel: #er

  In the future, we can use this channel for meetings as well.
