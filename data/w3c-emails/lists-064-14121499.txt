Just for the record, I am opposed to this group working on making ERAL a Rec.
I think it is a lot of unnecessary haggling over issues that would need to be
resolved, and that we are better off implementing and testing it, and then
handing it over to some group that wants to make it a rec. (Maybe we could
paste it to Sean, so that they get his labour in the package <grin/>)

cheers
