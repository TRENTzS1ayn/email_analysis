The URI given below is the User Agent Group's implementation report, which
includes links to the DTD that Jon wrote for collecting the information. What
would be cool is an XSLT to convert that to EARL (I think it is fairly
simple, but haven't done it). What would be even more cool is a tool that
could create a basic test suite harness from some information about a
document, and generate the results in earl. Anyone else thought about how
such a tool might work?

Similar stuff was done for SVG implementations recently if we are looking for
more examples. One of the things we can do here is raidly generate a bunch of
EARL for playing with that is real-world information. And may even be useful
;-)

Cheers
