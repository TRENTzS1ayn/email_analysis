In EO we discussed at length the upcoming enormous influx of effort into 
"cyber-conferencing" and the role of W3C therein.

I know the resources are thin, but unless the inevitable surge of virtual 
meetings is inclusive insofar as accessibility is concerned (let's not call 
it "video conferencing" please), we will have missed a huge opportunity. To 
retrofit the current spate of "distance learning" undertakings is going to 
be a nightmare and for that to be needed in the case of the "airline 
substitution system" will be tragic.

An important W3C undertaking is to have some positions on the nature of 
these systems and to provide leadership in *doing* something about them 
instead of merely *saying* how great it will be some day.
