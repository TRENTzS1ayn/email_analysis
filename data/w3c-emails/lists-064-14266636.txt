IIRC William has had less than glowing experiences with remote
participation in
past meetings.

If you would consider youself a candidate for remote participation [not
guaranteed] in this meeting, please respond to this message with some brief
remarks in as many of the following six starred question categories as you can
manage:

* What part of the meeting would you be hoping to participate in?

* What squeaks:? If past attempts were not so hot, summarize defects.

* What works:? What seemed to work the best and how well did it work?

* Blue sky:? In the best of all possible worlds, how would it work [limit, ten
pages]

* Baby steps:? Well, if we at least did this it would be better

* What to do:? Your best guess of the least risk/pain way to enable real
participation from remote.? For you.

Thanks,
