All of it.

Apparently scribing and communicating with remote participants via IRC is 
very near impossible. Wendy does well but it probably restricts her 
participation in the f2f, Charles just ignores the IRC because he knows it 
messes with his participation. If the phone worked like it does in 
telecons, there'd be minimal need for the IRC - good for hand-raising and 
real-time musings, but need someone to inject them if appropriate.

>* What works:  What seemed to work the best and how well did it work?

When the phone was working (rarely could hear enough or be heard at all) it 
was excellent. With just IRC it depended entirely on the competence 
(probably too much to ask for) of the scribe.

It would be a teleconference with in -person (and simulated via IRC) winks, 
nods, interruptions. The peripherals of break-time conversations would be a 
nice addition but not really all that important to the work. Daniel once 
expressed a "fear" that if it were done well nobody would fly. DUH! That's 
the idea. I don't subscribe to the notion that Charles' effectiveness would 
suffer if he could do meetings without setting a record for frequent flyer 
mileage in one year.

Headsets for f2f folks and some previous century interconnections so the 
chair can control who may talk at least as well as is done on a telecon.

I now have flat-rate long-distance so staying connected all day won't bust 
the Institute. There won't be the boredom of a GL meet so the remaining 
"fatal flaw" is the frustration of not properly hearing what's up. Seeing 
is less important, particularly in our stuff. And if it's over nine people, 
count me out.
