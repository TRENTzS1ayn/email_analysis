Well, the Hotel Seafield seems to be quite popular with visitors so far:-

   http://www.seafield.activebooking.com/bookings/GIM

On a grander (grandest) scale, we have the Hilton/Metropole:-

The Brighton Thistle also looks good.

The Chatsworth is another in Hove:-

Other stuff is listed here:-

There are plenty of hotels... it's difficult to know which one to choose!

Hope that helps,
