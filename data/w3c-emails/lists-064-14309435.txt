Our next teleconference will be held Monday, 24 Sept 2001 at the regularly 
scheduled time: 10:00 AM Eastern Time (14:00 UTC/GMT).  To find out what 
time it is in your time zone use the Time Zone Converter [1].

It will take place on the MIT bridge: +1 617.258.7910

Agenda for Monday:

- Update on test files, WART, and etc. from WCAG WG F2F 10/11 
Sept.  Charles Munat and I took an action item to work on a tool to gather 
feedback from testers of test files.  WCAG will be testing the files. 
Expect this will form the basis for discussions about conformance 
structures of WCAG 2.0.

- Still waiting from word from W3C management about publishing test files 
and results of evaluating tools.

- Update on Adobe tagged PDF repair process in Adobe 5. The AU WG had a 
demo by Loretta Guarino Reid at their F2F last week.

- Discussion of the relationship between EARL and NIST's IUSR. Comment 
period ended on 10 Sept, but I'll be involved in a telecon with them to 
discuss.  I'm looking for thoughts and feedback that I can take to 
them.  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2001Aug/0005.html

- Sending the EARL Primer to EO.  Again, no progress from me on moving this 
forward.  Should we just send it?

- Sean's latest EARL-related creation: the EARL to XHTML transformation for 
ATR produced EARL.  Useful to add to the primer as a demonstration 
(although they won't be familar with the ATR...although the ATR has a good 
description w/screen shots at: http://www.aprompt.ca/ATR/ATR.html).

- Agenda for the ERT/PF F2F to be held in Brighton 1-3 October.  If you 
haven't registered yet - do it now!!
