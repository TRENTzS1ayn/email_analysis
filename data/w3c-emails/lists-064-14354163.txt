The two external activities that have been absorbing a lot of my attention are
the Global Grid Forum and the U.S. group known as NCITS V2.? The attached
notes
are a ramble through why we should care about these activities and take pains
to collaborate with them.? I haven't been fully selective with the background
links, but the ACE Grid planning notes and the Trace page on V2 are probably
the cites I would suggest you visit if no others.

Maybe Dave Pawson can talk just a bit about the finalization of the DAISY/NISO
digital talking book standard.? It's actually a rich source of examples at a
very detailed level which are informative for the nit-diddly job of reforming
HTML.?
