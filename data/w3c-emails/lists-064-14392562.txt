The new version of the ATR program is available for download and use. You
can pick it up from:
http://www.aprompt.ca/ATR/GetAtr.html

The ATR, for those that don't know, helps to automate the testing of
accessibility repair tools (like Bobby and A-Prompt).

Changes include:
- Allows you to store comments about each of the test files
- RDF output is now correct (right Sean?)
- Each test file has an associated comment
- Test files are more correct and more complete

Please take a look and let me know if you have any comments.

Chris
