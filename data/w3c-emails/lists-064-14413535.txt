Makes some sense, but this and other groups need to get some publicity, if
there is a genuine desire to get all who are interested participating,
then publicising is essential, I learnt of the existence of the group only
a few days ago, despite having a relevant tool.   I don't see the point in
having it as a seperate group (or existing at all), the tools need to be
discussed in the relevant working groups to make any sense.

Erm, no the first thing to explain, is "Why would I want to use ... on my
website?", there's so many proposals knocking about in the W3, and there's
very little to explain where they could be used, and why they better than
the existing equivalents.  Only once there is a convincing argument
documented (and surely one must exist or work would never have started -
well unless it was purely the attraction of re-inventing the wheel, and
this time having a committee to decide the colour.) should any work be
done on a document on how to use it.

Jim.
