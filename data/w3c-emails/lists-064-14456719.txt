You mean that we should provide an XML schema which EARL processors should be
able to produce? This would seem a god idea. I do not think that everything
can always be handled by XML (this is why we are using RDF) but a lot of
common use cases probably can, and it would be good to have a defined schema
that could be sued for this.

  * It seems to contain too many odd and specific properties at the moment.
  Might it be more useful to leave a lot of random properties (earl:level,
  earl:excludes, earl:EquivalenceRelation, earl:format, etc) out of the
  schema entirely and just concentrate on providing general classes that
  users can extend to satisfy their needs?  In other words, earl:TestSubject,
  earl:Assertor, and earl:TestCase are all rich areas that people are just
  going to end up defining to suit their own needs (as I ended up having to
  do.)  EARL should just be the glue that binds them together.

  Summary: standardize and clean the spec, we're not ready for 1.0 yet.
  Perhaps we should clean it up and declare a .96?

Agree with both these ideas.
