One of the roles of the webmaster is quality control over submissions from
contributors to the site.  I would not necessarily leap to the idea that
utility for administrators of sites is predicated on having statistical
reports.  

Administrators in fact are superusers of critic tools.  They understand
what the tool is talking about better than the scattered contributors do.
Often it takes the originating author a.k.a. contributor to make repairs,
but the administrator is constantly having to make rapid decisions about
when to just post a contribution, when to repair it in the webmaster shop
because the repairs are minor and obvious, and when to sent the whole thing
back for further work because the flaws are endemic and serious.  This tool
which speeds up the process of making the _absolutely critical_ manual
checks in that decision process make the tool a strong candidate for
administrator use.  Furthermore, it doesn't have to attain the same
standard of usability for administrators to use it as it does for
contributors to use it <grin>.

Or at least that is a scenario that Bruce's comments triggered in my head.
