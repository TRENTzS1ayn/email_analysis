Hello all,

Let's go with the suggestion that Sean made a couple weeks ago:
 > As a last resort, we could open over a period of a few
 > hours - say 17:00 to 22:00 GMT on Wednesday - and
 > then people can just chat whenever they are able to.

That makes it:
Nice - 7 p.m. (is that too late for you Nadia?)
London - 6 p.m.
Boston - 12 p.m.
Seattle - 9 a.m.
Melbourne - 3 a.m.  4 April (Charles, still in Melbourne? ugh. no worries 
about making the mtg if you are.)

    Server: irc.w3.org
    Port: 6665
    Channel: #er

Agenda:
We need to agree on the direction to head with 1.0 (or 0.96 - whatever we 
call it).  Nadia posted some interesting thoughts and we discussed on irc a 
while ago.  We have several groups interested in implementing EARL.  It 
would be good to have something stable that incorporates the last few 
months discussions.
