In our Evaluation and Repair work, it's important to be able to point to
the structure of a page, to say for example - that some <img> in the
middle of the page should have an ALT attribute, or some other problem
with the structure.  Fuzzy Pointers seem to work very well for this, and
obviously rather than just inventing our own Pointers we're re-using
XPointer syntax.

From an Annotea point of view a:Context has many flaws only one of which
is the XPointer, and we need to start again on how we identify what is
being annotated, as you suggest looking at more human level content - or
at the very least using structure+check that the structure is valid.  I
do have some reservations about human level alone, on complexity grounds
(sufficient to uniquely identify any content in a document, and how non
humans go about generating annotations.)
