Yesterday, SBP pointed us to an article that TBL wrote called 
"Interpretation properties." [1]

I've been putting the examples through the RDF Validator to better 
understand how the different scenarios play out.  Besides finding lots of 
syntax errors <grin/> I'm having a hard time with "Attempt 3."  I'm not 
sure if it is a problem with the syntax, but the graph looks almost exactly 
the same as Attempt 1, except <name> has become an anonymous node...so I've 
lost the info about Ora's name.

Any ideas why?

Here is the RDF I am attempting to use:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
xmlns:play="http://play.org/#"
xmlns:lang="http://lang.org/#">
<rdf:description>
    <rdf:type>http://www.people.org/types#person</rdf:type>
    <play:name>
        <lang:fi>Ora Yrjo Uolevi Lassila</lang:fi>
     </play:name>
    <play:mailbox>ora.lassila@research.nokia.com</play:mailbox>
    <play:homePage>http://www.w3.org/People/Lassila/</play:homePage>
</rdf:description>
</rdf:RDF>

Regardless, I'm still pretty fuzzy about interpretation properties, 
although based on yesterday's discussion [2] I think I see how they fit in 
with a discussion that I had with Cynthia Shelly about other test 
environment properties that she would like to capture.

These seem to be "interpretation properties" of the earl:TestPlatform:
operating system, assistive technology/browser combinations, configuration 
settings (for OS, AT, browser), hardware (speech synth, processor speed, 
sound card, video card)

Based on SBP's examples from yesterday [2], I think this works, although I 
don't see the difference between interpretation properties and properties.

note: "configuration settings" seem to be part of  "operator instructions."

@prefix earl:  <http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/0.95#> .
@prefix : <http://myns.org/1/#> .
:MyTestPlatform
earl:os "Win98";
:at "Jaws" [earl:version "4"];
:ua "IE" [earl:version "6"]; earl:operatorInstructions <someURI> .

I know this n3 is wrong, since I can't get it through the n3 to rdf 
convertor [3], but what I'm trying to say is that the AT has name "Jaws" 
and the version is 4.  In some of SBP's previous examples [4], he used:
earl:platform [ :browser "netscape 4.75" ] .

But, people tend to test with multiple versions of platforms (browsers, 
assistive tech, etc.) and it would be cool to compare results between same 
versions of platforms.

Thoughts?
