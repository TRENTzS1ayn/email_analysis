I've changed my tool[1] to use earl:assertedBy.  Don't pay attention to the
weak generated URIs. The EARL looks neat when passed through the RDF
Validator.

EricP has the idea of making an entire attribution schema - the argument is
that some kind of attribution info for an RDF triple is useful for all
sorts of applications, the most immediate being annotations and EARL.
There would be a stronger and more general assertedBy, with probably other
sorts of possible qualifications on the attribution.  It sounds like a good
idea and useful for EARL if it gets implemented.
