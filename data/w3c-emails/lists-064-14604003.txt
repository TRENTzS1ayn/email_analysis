Hi,

I found the attached CSS on the Internet. After installing it text in 
tables on a lot of pages becomes unreadable. For example at my own web site 
at http://www.magnifiers.org and at http://www.google.com on the search 
results page.
Does somebody knows what the reason is and if it can be fixed?

On a lot of pages on the Internet I read the advice for low vision users to 
use a user defined Style Sheet. If I increase the font size in this CSS and 
visit for example http://www.webwereld.nl a lot of information becomes  hidden.
On other pages you get horizontal scrollbars, which is one of the major 
problems for low vision people and older people on the Internet.
