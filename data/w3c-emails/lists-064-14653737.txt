Making something dependant on tidy is not an option AFAICT, and isn't
necessary in any case. What we actually need is to stop thinking of the
context as a URI-fragment. We can use a standalone property that we can
define the semantics of without all these fragment references getting in
the way.  XPointer isn't even sufficient for application/xhtml+xml stuff
as they're not robust over changes in the document - so we still need all
the contextual stuff to identify a document.
