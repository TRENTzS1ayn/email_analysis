Cool. I take Jim's point that this is not exactly a quick way to resolve the
problem - but the basic problem is that people are using old systems when
there are new ones available which work for almost all the applications, and
work better. Getting people to upgrade is really a slow solution, so pointing
out why some things run extra slow when people are waiting might help a bit.

"Please be patient while we are checking the server to deal with your HTML
code. Did you know that you could do the same things with XHTML and avoid
making your clients wait for this service? Have a look at
http://example.org/how-to-make-good-code"

  Yes, that's essentially what Jim and I are doing.

  Yes.  A server doing exactly that is in the very-near-future plans,
  as a demo application of mod_xml.  It'll be somewhat akin to tidy,
  but (unlike tidy) it is DTD-aware.
