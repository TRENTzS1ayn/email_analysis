There are systems which actually understand XHTML? I assume you're
talking about the broken support in Mozilla, a beta browser which is not
accessible to me, and my needs aren't particularly demanding (and doesn't
support the SVG plugin...)

That would be a simple lie, There are very few people on the web using
clients that understand XHTML, and there are none which even claim to
that are available for 2 of my platforms.
