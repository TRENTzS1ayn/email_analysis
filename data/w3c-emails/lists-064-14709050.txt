but not IE on all platforms, and not the myriad of other browsers,
including ones in embedded systems which aren't (easily) upgradeable.
Suggesting XHTML 1.0 with some compatibility guidlines will make your
content render appropriately in more browsers is clear bunkum HTML 4.01
has all the accessibility features of XHTML 1.0 and has the bonus of
being supported in a lot more browsers.  If XHTML is appropriate for
future browsers, then the simple matter of content-negotiation on the
XHTML mime-type is appropriate.

I fear you've not been keeping up with Bugzilla...
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133567
which says it applies to ALL OS's.  I also understand there is no chance
of native SVG making it into Mozilla 1.0, which has already been pretty
much fixed (a Release Candidate is due on the 15th).

The SGML normalisation is every bit as appropriate as an xhtml one, it's
also simpler to implement as it's what the browsers and validators are
already doing...
