Hello all,

The irc channel (#er on irc.w3.org:6665) is being logged and those logs are 
public (thanks Aaron!).  Therefore, please prefix any non-ert wg topics 
with "[off]" and they will not be incorporated into the log.

For example, in IRC I see:
<wendy> do you know how to write something so that aaron's irc logger 
doesn't publish it in the log?
<wendy> i.e. i thought #... usually worked.
<wendy> [off] will this appear?
<wendy> perhaps it does
<wendy> sweet. [off] seems to work.
<wendy> [off] testing again
<wendy> blargh
<wendy> sweet.

But the log shows:
20:37:33 <wendy> do you know how to write something so that aaron's irc 
logger doesn't publish it in the log?
20:37:43 <wendy> i.e. i thought #... usually worked.
20:38:42 <wendy> perhaps it does
20:38:51 <wendy> sweet. [off] seems to work.
20:38:57 <wendy> blargh
20:39:04 <wendy> sweet.

Thanks,
--wendy
