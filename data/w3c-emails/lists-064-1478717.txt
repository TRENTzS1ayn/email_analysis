AG::

I stand corrected on what you meant by your 'administrator' person.  I had
a DBA type in mind.  The person who holds the keys that say "Yes, this goes
up in public under our name."

I agree with everything you said about the realities of bosses, contracts,
contractors, and the like <moan>.

I think that, somehow, we need to train the administrators out of the idea
that once it is in the contract it is a done deal.  There is this saying in
the industry I came from "Do not expect what you do not inspect."  

Many public administrators, particularly those acquiring public information
services such as web design, are not trained to think that way.
Acquisition-savvy outfits like DoD are the exception, not the rule.

Getting contractors to deliver sites that do comply with the guidelines is
going to take some checking.  Lots of checking at first.  And the checking
has to be done by people who do have a grasp of what the guidelines are
talking about.

EEOC and U.S. Mint have shown it can be done.  But that is just a tiny
point of light.  Lots of "diffusion of innovation" still ahead of us.  And
the state agencies will probably be harder to bring around than the Federal
sites, I fear.

I am not against a statistical summary.  But this report should be dripping
with the same sort of caveats about what is _not_ covered in these
statistics as the "new" Bobby report.

I am reluctant to give adminstrators something that looks like a purely
automatic pass/fail grader, because I know what they will do with it.  I
would sooner try to convince them they need to set aside 10% of their web
design acquisition budget for independent checking of the product, and add
one more contract or add a work item for their in-house staff.  I know that
will be a hard sell, but the alternative is hardly effective.  This is not
a 10% cost growth to support accessibility; it is effective use of their
budget to get effective communication from their websites.  The cross-check
staff will turn up more SNAFUs than just access failures.
