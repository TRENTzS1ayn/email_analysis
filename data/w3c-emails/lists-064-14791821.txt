Hi Charles,

I should say if those guys of Opera, WebEyes and Webformator merged their 
products and add MSAA to it the world had a perfect browser for people with 
vision loss, including the growing group of elderly people.

Problems are scrollbars, information that hide, bad color contrast, text 
images.
Opera is a "better" browser for low vision people than Internet Explorer, 
but because it does not include support for MSAA it is impossible to read 
aloud pages in Opera.

by disabling tables in Opera it is possible to use a large font without 
scrollbars and also images magnify in Opera.
But on some pages this also results in nasty formatted pages with a lot of 
blanks and loss of information.

Web Eyes never shows scrollbars, but has no color setting support and no 
image magnification.

A filtering tool should be able to:

1. Change fixed in relative measures,
2. Option to disable table columns, or better to load a table column into a 
new page.
3. Option to load framed page in new window (a lot of pages have 
JavaScripts that make this impossible).
4. Quick switch between images on and off. If there are text images the 
alternative description can help.
5. Increase and decrease font size with one keypress (like in Opera + and _ 
keys).

With a Large font size in Internet explorer relative measures solves 
problems for a large group of people. For those who need a much larger font 
reformatting of text is needed.
With a screen magnifier without speech it is realy difficult to read table 
columns.

Regards Peter Verhoeven
