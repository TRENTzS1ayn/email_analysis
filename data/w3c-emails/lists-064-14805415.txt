If they are using a screen magnifier, they should not be changing the
fonts, the magnifier does a much better job than the browser.  The Opera
browser does a better job than IE in using larger fonts.  It's not a
problem with the content, its a problem with the browser and/or magnifier.
Relative fonts only helps browsers than currently do a poor job, hence the
priority 2 for content authors.  It should be a lot more productive to fix
a handful of browsers than billions of pages.  What's the problem with
using the free Opera?

Send the problem to the UA group, not WCAG.
