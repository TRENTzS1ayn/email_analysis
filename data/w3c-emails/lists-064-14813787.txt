Hi Phill,

The problem with Opera is, that it does not support MSAA and all screen 
reader and screen magnifier software highly is based on that.
I use a screen magnifier, but by magnifying the font becomes not bolder. 
the quality of the font is much better for me if I make it larger and if it 
is always the same size.
The majority of the people with vision loss do not use a screen magnifier 
and can be helped with options in  the browser.
Most problems on web pages can also not be solved by simply using Opera!

Regards Peter Verhoeven
