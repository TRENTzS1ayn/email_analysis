Hi Kelly and all:
I agree completely.
In the document Al referenced,
http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/index.html 

I beleive the relevant portion is:
"
Checkpoint 13.1 - Clearly identify the target of each link
Technique 13.1.1 [priority 2] Verify that the target of each link is clearly identified.
Evaluation:
Element: A 
Requirements: 
Names must be unique for each target. 
Must be meaningful 
Should be terse 
Suspicious anchor names:
click here 
more 
follow this 
greater than 60 characters 
Suggested message:
If non-meaningful text found: This link text may not be meaningful when read on its own: [link text]. 
If lengthy text found: This link text is quite long and should be shortened: [link text]. 
Suggested repair:
Allow user to change the link text and surrounding text. 
Retrieve the TITLE of the target page and suggest that as link text. 
If the author is trying to make a Level Triple A site, Ask the author to provide supplemental information about the link in the "title" attribute. "

I have argued elsewhere that the phrase
"Must be meaningful" is critical.  specifically, in my view, numbers alone, although distinguishable, are not sufficient for "meaningful" (even when the numbers are distinguishable, i.e. "one", "two", "three", etc.).
I would like to see this moved to priority 1.
-Steve

Hi,

I wonder if you might consider adding support for a problem that shows up
on pages like <http://www.homegrocer.com>.  This page has two buttons that,
according to the instructions, have the word Go on them.  But in the code
for the page screen readers are getting the label for these buttons from
the value="1" code for the image.  As a result all I hear for these buttons
is "one" and as near as I can tell the WAVE makes no reference to this
being a problem in the results for the page.

Kelly
