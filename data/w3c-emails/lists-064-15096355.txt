A Windows desktop edition of Accessibility Valet is now available
for public testing at <URL:http://valet.webthing.com/access/>.
Anyone interested in trying it is invited to download the test
package, and (especially) to email me with bug reports or
suggestions for improvements.

Please note that it is not yet packaged with an installation "wizard",
so you have to read the instructions.  If that's a problem, you should
either use a Linux or Unix edition or wait for the product release.

For those not familiar with the existing online or Unix/Linux desktop
versions, Accessibility Valet is a tool to analyse markup for compliance
with the WCAG or Section 508 standards, with additional functions
to clean up bad markup, and convert between HTML and XHTML.
The online version has already attracted highly favourable Peer Review,
as can be seen in (for example) the newsgroup archives at google.com.
