As part of the development of the Windows edition (see announcement)
I have incorporated a browser-based viewing capability into the
Accessibility Valet EARL reports.  This can be seen in the
online version at <URL:http://valet.webthing.com/access/>
and is known to work with Internet Explorer 6 and Mozilla-family
browsers (Mozilla, Galeon, Netscape 6, etc).
