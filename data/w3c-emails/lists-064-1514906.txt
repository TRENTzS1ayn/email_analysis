Hi Amy
(As you can see I'm peeking at my email on my day off... gotta stop doing 
that...)

- Please encourage the critic to send his or her feedback to the addresses 
on the tool, that's either me
kasday@acm.org
or
w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org

- Said critic said "I hate the fact that it's a frame site"

The WAVE isn't a frames site.   What URL are they looking at?  Hmmm.  Maybe 
you gave the URL of the talk which happened to show the WAVE in a 
frame.  The direct URL is

http://www.temple.edu/inst_disabilities/piat/wave/

And yes, I'd be interested in presenting it in Austin.  It's at the tail 
end of my web tutorial on ACOLUG but that shouldn't be a problem, 
especially if we have a laptop for me to keep up on the email.

Meanwhile, I'm glad said critic found one thing to like ("It does do a good 
job on showing potential problems with tables used for
layouts by demonstrating what gets read first.)"

The key phrase is

  "However, Bobby does highlight any code it finds suspect"

This person is someone who apparently codes the HTML by hand.  The WAVE 
isn't that useful for such purposes.  The WAVE is targeted at  people who 
use graphical editors or who just monitor sites and don't care about the 
code at all.  So I'll have to think about adding that sort of feature... 
but it will likely get very low priority.
