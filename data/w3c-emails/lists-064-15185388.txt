I can't make 6pm (but could on the phone maybe, if you don't mind london
traffic background noice as I cycle...)

4pm is no problem, or indeed any other earlier time, later is a maybe...

> 3. Other day and time: (Please suggest)

Any day before 6pm London is easy, normally tuesdays and thursdays at 6pm,
but not this week as I have engagements.  after the pubs close UK is also
feasible, but it depends how "in-training" I stay and avoid too much beer.

Jim.
