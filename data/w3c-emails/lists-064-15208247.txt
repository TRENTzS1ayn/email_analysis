Evaluation and Report Language (EARL) 1.0
W3C Working Draft 06 December 2002

[
  Evaluation and Report Language (EARL) is a general-purpose
  language for expressing test results. This specification
  describes how to use EARL to describe test results and
  defines a basic vocabulary for this purpose.

   -- http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-EARL10-20021206/

and looked into the vocabulary, tested it a bit in
the form of the attached n3 triples and think that
it is quite valuable to serve WebOnt testpurposes
