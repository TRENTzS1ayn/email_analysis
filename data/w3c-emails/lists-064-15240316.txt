The PF call is 12 noon to 1.30pm Boston Time, 1600Z - 1730Z, each 
Wednesday. [1]
I've scheduled this week's ERT WG chat to begin immediately afterwards at 
1:30 Boston and have suggested future meetings occur on Thursdays at 6:00 
PM UTC
(Thu 10:00 AM Seattle, Thu 1:00 PM Boston, Thu 6:00 PM London).
