It seems most of the editors notes deal with "should we explain something
that EARL depends on or reference an external resource?"  IMO where
there's an existing stable resource we should not in general be
reproducing it.

Hmmm, I'm not using it myself (yet), but I thought there was a good case
for including it.

No, but a generic "note" property could serve for such things.

But should be a property of Assertor, not Assertion!

Add a "representation" property to TestSubject, that can be used to
describe processing/derivation - e.g. a pointer or checksum.  What goes
into the "representation" will be an extension (unless we want to
predefine simple things like Line/Column or XPath/XPointer).

Final comment: A quick-reference list of EARL vocabulary would be
more useful than anything.  Could perhaps be one of those Appendices
that appear to be missing between A and D:-)
