Our next teleconference is

Monday  March 27

10:00-11:30 Eastern Time on the MIT bridge (+1 617-258-7910)

Agenda:

1. Feedback on the new draft of the ERT 
document.  http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/ (As I write this, there hasn't 
yet been much feedback, probably because of CSUN).

2. Statistics and other measures of site accessibility.
So far the ERT document has focussed on evaluating individual pages.  How 
do we evaluate large sites? E.g. what sorts of statistics are relevant?

Please post other agenda suggestions to the list.
