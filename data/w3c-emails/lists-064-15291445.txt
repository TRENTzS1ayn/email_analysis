I'm inclined towards having it on the assertion, but the cost here is a
lack of brevity so it would be nice if it could be inherited, I don't see
much of a problem in having it in both places.  The downside is that the
naive tool won't know what type of test was done, that's hardly
disastrous though.

I understood you never used range  rdf:resource="rdfs:resource" anyway,
since everything is a resource so it's an entirely redundant statement.
I could be wrong though, my experience is limited.
