Sorry, what do you mean by a 'resolution'? at this point?  Maybe there is a
resolution or there is no resolution.  If it's a way out of a predicament,
there is a resolution.  If it's an unambiguous mapping to UTC time, there is
no resolution, but no need of a resolution.  Thus the fact that the
resolution is a reference to possibly future utterances of the civil
authority is true, but not a problem.

No.  This is what we went around on before.  There _is_ at least a
resolution in practice and, depending on the sense of the term 'resolution,'
in principle.

It has to do with understanding the point or use of the time reference in a
plan.  The purpose is to provide or participate in a set of constraints
sufficient to assure the achievement of a rendezvous.

John, this is what you and I discussed before.

The resolution is that the place and local time is sufficent as a policy for
how to rendezvous, and it is a rendezvous policy that is what goes in a
plan, *not* necessarily an _unambiguous_ *time* reference.  The offset
policy of the civil authority will be definitized in time to accomplish the
rendezvous transaction of both being at the agreed meeting point at the same
time.

The time reference will be unambiguous by the time that the rendezvous is
consummated.

UTC Date plus offset is also logically sufficient for a rendezous agreement,
but not customary, so the terms of an agreement on these terms will have
to be emphasized for people to follow them.

Thank you for this helpful reference.
