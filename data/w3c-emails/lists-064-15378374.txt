Yes.  The collection of ADO time zones fills a hole in my description
of "what works" by way of where+whenInLocalTime.  This is a rule that
tells you what sort of a 'where' reference will work.  In the form
where+whenInLocalTime, the 'where' part should be something that has
a unique associated ADO time zone.  'Boston' works, 'Tennessee' doesn't.
