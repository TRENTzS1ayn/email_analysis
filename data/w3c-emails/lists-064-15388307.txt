I think that going with the ISO standard as a first pass is going to be
problemmatic - since it includes so many kinds of time expression you are
likely to get low interoperability.

W3C published a note about a particular subset of the ISO standard that may
be a useful starting point. Looking at what the informal RDF calendar group
[1] does might also be a good idea for working out easy interoperability in
RDF formats...
