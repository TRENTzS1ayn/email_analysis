The following questions regarding compliance came up in today's ER meeting:

A. Compliance with alternative pages:

The guideline states

11.4 If, after best efforts, you cannot create an accessible page, provide 
a link to an alternative page that uses W3C technologies, is accessible, 
has equivalent information (or functionality), and is updated as often as 
the inaccessible (original) page. [Priority 1]

If this is done, can the inaccessible page be given a compliance logo 
corresponding to the conformance of the alternative page?

B. Links between alternative pages and standard pages.

Question: once you are on an alternative page, should links on that page 
refer back to the "standard" page or should there be a complete and self 
contained parallel site.  There are arguments on either side.  Some users 
prefer to stay on the standard site as much as possible.  On the other 
hand, it can be tedious to have to keep switching to the alternate page.


C: Regarding Compliance Scope.

The guidelines state:

Form 2: Include, on each page claiming conformance, one of three icons 
provided by W3C and link the icon to the appropriate W3C explanation of the 
claim. Information about the icons and how to insert them in pages is 
available at [WCAG-ICONS].

Questions:

1. Is this icon allowed even if the pages itself is accessible but links to 
inaccessible pages?
2. It would be useful to define claims that go beyond the scope of the 
current page.  We discussed the possibility WCAG defining one or more types 
of scope, e.g. "everything with a URL given by a given domain 
name".   [note added by LRK after the meeting: this wouldn't cover sites 
which have pages that refer to IP addresses.  Perhaps we should leave it up 
to page or site authors to define the scope... we'd just require that some 
means of defining the scope be defined.]
