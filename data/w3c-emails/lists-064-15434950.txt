Following last nights IRCcon and another brainstorming session with
Jim, Sean and Wendy, I'm still thinking through how to do EARL with
Page Valet, and still have problems.

However, I've hacked up one experimental prototype at
<URL:http://valet.webthing.com/page/wai.html>
(it is simply Page Valet with an additional option for XHTML+EARL output)

Don't forget to select something in the "Accessibility Checks" box
to get a non-null EARL report!


The approach here is to embed the RDF in the <head> of an XHTML doc.
The RDF is sort-of based on some of Sean's examples, but I'm not
currently in a fit state to work out if it makes sense (it
probably doesn't).

As discussed in our brainstorming, I'm having some trouble with
testSubject.  I've hacked around it by adding a bogus
"earl:localref" attribute to <earl:testSubject>.  This attribute
is an IDREF from the accessibility message to the representation
in the Page Valet report of the element generating the warning.

So my questions:
  (1) Is this basic XHTML+EARL type of approach any use to anyone?
  (2) How can I better deal with testSubject (already discussed
once - Wendy, do you have that log?)
  (3) Where next?
