Well, the benefit of XHTML+EARL is that it could provide a simple solution
for the authoring phase. But I think it is not a really smart solution, and
what we want is to provide a pointer to metadata (unfortunately XHTML so far
isn't too smart about being able to do this).

But that is really a question of how you deal with the output of the earl
process - it must be relatively simple to instead pipe it somewhere else.

  So my questions:
    (1) Is this basic XHTML+EARL type of approach any use to anyone?
    (3) Where next?
