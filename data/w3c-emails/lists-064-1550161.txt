Yes. The conformance claim should indicate the scope of the claim,
in this case a combination of two pages.

My opinion is that, since alternative pages should be used as little
as possible, you should avoid where possible creating an 
alternative site. However, it would make sense that if you have a 
particular type of page that appears frequently and is always 
inaccessible alone, you could/should promote easy navigation within that 
set of pages.

Please note that the conformance statements in ATAG and UAAG are more
general and we're slowly improving conformance provisions since WCAG 1.0
was published. Check out, for instance, the UAAG Proposed Rec
conformance
section:

     http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/PR-UAAG10-20000310/#Conformance

There's still work to be done to show how to use metadata to
describe scope, etc.

Yes, but the link should be clearly identified. I would argue that
the icon should not be used if the inaccessible page does not link
directly to the accessible page.

Yes. And that's where we need to spend more time working on the
metadata (schema?) to use in conformance claims.
