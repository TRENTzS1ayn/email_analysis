I've put up a second Page Valet+EARL prototype.  This one has dropped the
XHTML, and is somewhat more considered.  It's still at
<URL:http://valet.webthing.com/page/wai.html>

Some Issues:

(1) testSubjects are now references into the document being checked,
    and take three formats:
    * Validation - the overall result is the URL - that's fine
http://foo.bar/docname.html
    * Validation messages - use a fragment to identify line and column
http://foo.bar/docname.html#(16,37)
    * Accessibility checks - reference an element in the normalised
      parse tree.  I'm aiming for a "fuzzy Xpointer" (as discussed
      in IRC), but there's some significant hacking to visval
      required first
http://foo.bar/docname.html#e12(now)
http://foo.bar/docname.html#1/4/1(goal)

(2) testObjects for validation messages are a placeholder.  I don't
    know what really makes sense

(3) I've used predicates (passes|fails) for validation messages, and
    suspectAgainst for accessibility warnings.  Next step is to
    generate confidence levels from visval, so we can distinguish
    between definite problems, and issues flagged for manual inspection.

Comments, criticisms, and especially help, invited.
