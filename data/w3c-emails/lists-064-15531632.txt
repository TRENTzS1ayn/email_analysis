Good stuff, Nick.

I'd advise something like:-

<rdf:subject rdf:parseType="Resource">
   <earl:reprOf rdf:resource="http://www.google.com/"/>
   <earl:date>2002-02-03</earl:date>
   <valet:line>1</valet:line>
   <valet:column>0</valet:column>
</rdf:subject>

Hmm... although, in fact, what you're pointing at a character position
in an element or attribute in the target document that is being
evaluated.

now:-

<rdf:subject rdf:parseType="Resource">
   <earl:reprOf rdf:resource="http://foo.bar/docname.html"/>
   <earl:date>2002-02-03</earl:date>
   <valet:id>e12</valet:id>
</rdf:subject>

goal:-

<rdf:subject rdf:parseType="Resource">
   <earl:reprOf rdf:resource="http://foo.bar/docname.html"/>
   <earl:date>2002-02-03</earl:date>
   <valet:htmlPointer>1/4/1</valet:htmlPointer>
</rdf:subject>

I suspect that the test case will be the (X)HTML specification for the
version of the HTML being validated. However, it will only be rated
against some small subset of the specification, so it's a tricky one.
