Update: I've implemented (but not yet installed) this, with three
confidence levels:

Certain:definitely fails test
Likely:probably fails test
Maybe:probably passes but should check

Using these I will also generate an assertion {pass|fail} the
overall checkpoint (eg WCAG-AA):

pass with high confidence if there are NO warnings
pass with low confidence if there are only MAYBE warnings
fail with medium(?) confidence if there are LIKELY warnings
fail with certainty if there are CERTAIN warnings

I'll think about putting this in the form too; perhaps permit suppression
of MAYBE messages in the HTML versions.
