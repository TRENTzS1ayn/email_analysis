It's an issue of error handling.  Because google has no FPI, SP (valet)
is parsing it without a DTD, and using default SGML rules.  So it has
no way of knowing that <br> should be empty.

This has been bothering me for some time, but it's not clear how
best to fix it.  Once upon a time we'd have inserted a default FPI,
but all the validators have now stopped doing that.  Maybe we should
revert to that as a fixup?

Hmm - I'll crosspost this to www-validator.  Any other thoughts?
