I'm in two minds on this one.  At the moment, an accessibility warning
with a "Low" confidence level is effectively just a warning.  But the
purpose it serves is to say "this tool can't tell whether XYZ violates
accessibility".  A warning is the right thing to present to a human
reader, but an automatic system needs to know there are/aren't
any such issues.

I think for my purposes I'd prefer to stick to the confidence levels
scheme, noting that a Low Confidence assertion from Page Valet can be
nullified by a contradictory High Confidence assertion from
elsewhere, but should not be silently nullified by default.

Note that the currently assigned confidence levels for different
tests/messages are rather arbitrary, and subject to review.

Erm - that sounds like an altogether different project.  If it ever
happens, I'll be looking to support it as well as, not instead of,
WCAG 1.0.
