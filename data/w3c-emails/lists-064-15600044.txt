One possibility we discussed with EARL was to declare a "normatively valid"
transformation, for example by running something through a given version of
Tidy.

Would this be a useful idea, or a bad one?

cheers

  It's an issue of error handling.  Because google has no FPI, SP (valet)
  is parsing it without a DTD, and using default SGML rules.  So it has
  no way of knowing that <br> should be empty.

  This has been bothering me for some time, but it's not clear how
  best to fix it.  Once upon a time we'd have inserted a default FPI,
  but all the validators have now stopped doing that.  Maybe we should
  revert to that as a fixup?

  Hmm - I'll crosspost this to www-validator.  Any other thoughts?
