Do you also check the CSS to see if the markup is redundant?  I don't
think that redundant presentational HTML should be considered an
accessibility error for cases like @border or the color attributes
on <body>.  As you say, it's a valid browser workaround. Which
presentational markup is considered harmful even if CSS is used?
