Is that wai-wcag-editor?  It doesn't exactly look lively.

There was a very specific reason: pseudo-legalistic completeness in
implementing Section508.  The two messages that carry this weighting are:
  (1) A message in every document, saying "provide a text-only alternative
      if this fails to meet the criteria".
  (2) A message re clientside imagemaps, noting that valid HTML is
      sufficient to meet the guideline.  Since Page Valet is a validator,
      no additional message is required for this section.

Indeed it would.  Do we have any volunteers?  I fear if I undertook that
work it might not be seen as an objective assessment.

It means the page doesn't trigger any WCAG single-A warnings.  If you
think it should, your comments will be welcome.

I am running a spider, and have plenty of data.  But again, if the
tool reflects my prejudices (and includes PLACEHOLDER comments denoting
something I already plan to improve on),  then I'm not the right person
to assess it.

Ah, now that's interesting.  Is there any existing corpus that has been
manually assessed?  There's clearly nothing specific to any one assessment
tool in building such a corpus.

I don't entirely agree with that, and will get round to responding at
some point (if noone helps out with a followup I find easier to work with).
