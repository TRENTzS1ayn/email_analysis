I managed to write a small query and inference engine for the Eep API,
and duplicate the "I Do Not Agree" [1] test. The files are available
in www-archive:-

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2002Feb/0009

It is significant that this engine was built on the Eep API, since my
recent RDF API [2] was also built upon the Eep API, allowing them all
to interoperate.

To run the EARL test inference:-

   python -c "import infertest; infertest.earlTest()"

A .tar.gz of the files will be available upon request. I also plan to
do a query => HTML function, so that people can convert EARL to XHTML
(or whatever).

Cheers,
