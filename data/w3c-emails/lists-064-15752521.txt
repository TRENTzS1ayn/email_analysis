  There was a very specific reason: pseudo-legalistic completeness in
  implementing Section508.  The two messages that carry this weighting are:
    (1) A message in every document, saying "provide a text-only alternative
        if this fails to meet the criteria".
    (2) A message re clientside imagemaps, noting that valid HTML is
        sufficient to meet the guideline.  Since Page Valet is a validator,
        no additional message is required for this section.

Isn't there a notApplicable property in EARL?
