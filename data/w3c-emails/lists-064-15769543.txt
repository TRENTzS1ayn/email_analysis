This looks highly topical.  For those who are hacking EARL client
software (Jim?  Sean?) it looks like an interesting live test case
to combine Nadia's human-assessment EARL with Page Valet's automated
stuff, for instance.  But to do so, I think it might be useful for
your script to offer the option of the xmlrdf output served raw
as text/xml.

We all have that problem!

I think it might be very useful for you to join in the #er live
