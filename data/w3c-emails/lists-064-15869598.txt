  Oops. :) I basically copied my output from ATR, as you guessed.  You should
  make "Learning EARL by Example" public, it's quite helpful.

Yep...

  That's kind of cool.  I'm going for easy to produce and easy to parse here.

You don't need to - there are already conversion tools available, and for now
RDF/XML is the "canonical" format.
