Who do we have in Sydney? (I think there is someone in Japan, where it
would be 3am (2am in summer time - Japan doesn't have summer time).

I am mostly in Europe - and when I am in Australia I am already working
through a couple of nights.

  Is 6pm GMT (7pm France) a reasonable compromise?  That has me in the
  office aswell (which I prefer.) and isn't too early for Wendy.  ~5am for
  Sydney isn't so good though.

  Jim.
