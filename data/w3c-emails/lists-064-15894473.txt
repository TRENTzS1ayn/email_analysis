The main thing we're after is consistent information that can be
queried useful in future. The more consistent your information, the
more useful it is. Imagine the following report:-

<http://www.w3.org/blargh> rdf:type earl:WebContent;
   earl:date "2001-10-15" .
<http://www.w3.org/blargh> earl:fails :MyTest.

and then a couple of days later, another report:-

<http://www.w3.org/blargh> rdf:type earl:WebContent;
   earl:date "2001-10-17" .
<http://www.w3.org/blargh> earl:passes :MyTest.

Now, how do you expect to query it to check whether the page has been
fixed, given that the URIs representing the resources are the same?
It's broken. The rule is: one URI, one resource. [People get votes,
URIs get resources!]

So you're putting the "thing" in your own namespace for a few reasons:
to separate it from other "things"; so that you can add data in the
future; so that your data will be consistent; so that people can query
it in the future; so that if you abandon or break it, you lessen the
impact.

Thanks - I'm glad that it's useful. BTW, the document is already
public:-

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2002Feb/att-0031/01-
0.95byExample

as are all emails and attachments sent to this list:-

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/

and indeed every other W3C mailing list.

Neither am I. It's an issue :-)

The W3C Quality Assurance group is chartered to investigate a test
point definition language. As long as such a framework is scaled up to
the Web, it should be possible to integrate it neatly with EARL.

As for the fragments, what you have there is a document that is in
your own temporary language. EARL 0.95 does not provide information
for identifying the type of a test case document. It does define a set
of classes whose semantics are left for future interpretation by the
group. One of these classes is the "TestCase" class, which has a
predicate testId relating it to a test case file. This allows one to
bundle a group of test case documents, test point specification,
levels, and exclusions together - for example: all of the WCAG 1.0
priority 1 checkpoints except for 2.1.

Ah, that's alright then. Perhaps you could change the forms to GET, if
you think it's suitable to do so?
