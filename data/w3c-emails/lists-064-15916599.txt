The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative has created an Interest Group to
work on issues of accessibility and metadata. Awareness of the need
to make web content accessible and to make it easier to discover
accessible resources is growing in many sectors. It is hoped that
this activity will contribute to make one, harmonised and useful way
of contributing to the accessibility endeavour. This is an open forum.

Participants are invited from all countries, sectors and especially
those with experience in the development and use of metadata relating
to accessibility.

The website is at http://dublincore.org/groups/access/
