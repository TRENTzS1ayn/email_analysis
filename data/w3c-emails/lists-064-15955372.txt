  Using the world meeting planner [1] for London, Tokyo, and New York   it seems the best time to meet next week would be:
  UTC: Wednesday February 20, 2002 at 12:00 PM
  New York: Wed 7:00 AM
  Tokyo: Wed 9:00 PM

  How does that work for everyone?
  Nick, this doesn't meet your requirement for after 6 p.m. UTC.  Could we try it this once?
  Masaya, this is out of the standard working day for you.  If this does not work for you, please let me know.

  FYI, I'll be in Boston next week, so I don't mind 7 a.m., but once I get back to Seattle this would be 4 a.m. my time. Therefore, I am only proposing this time slot for this upcoming week.  I'd like to see us work out something that:
  1. is not in the middle of the night for anyone who doesn't want it to be (Nick, Jim, and SBP are happy with midnight GMT)
  2. is during a reasonable hour for Nadia to get to the office
  3. is after 6 p.m. GMT so that Nick can save some money.

  2 and 3 seem to be in direct conflict with each other. :\

  Any ideas for future meetings?
