But it isn't the same thing. If a page fails on Monday that passed on
Sunday, then it's a different page - a different representation of the
same resource. We still have a link to the resource in the form of the
"testSubject" (0.95) or "reprOf" (P1.0) arcs.

Moreover, if we merge the two example reports from my email, we get:-

   <http://www.w3.org/blargh> rdf:type earl:WebContent;
     earl:date "2001-10-15", "2001-10-17";
     earl:fails :MyTest; earl:passes :MyTest .

which isn't all that queryable. If you instead recognize the fact that
you're evaluating a representation of the resource, and datestamp the
thing/give it an ID, then you can still query by the original
resource, because you have that arc:-

   _:x rdf:type earl:WebContent;
     earl:reprOf <http://www.w3.org/blargh>;
     earl:date "2001-10-15"; earl:fails :MyTest .

   _:y rdf:type earl:WebContent;
     earl:reprOf <http://www.w3.org/blargh>;
     earl:date "2001-10-17"; earl:fails :MyTest .

You can ask "has http://www.w3.org/blargh been fixed?" using the
following query/rule:-

   { [ earl:reprOf ?p; earl:date ?q; earl:fails ?r ] .
      [ earl:reprOf ?p; earl:date ?s; earl:passes ?r ] .
      ?q string:lessThan ?s } log:implies
     { ?p a :EvaluatedThing; :fixedBetween (?q ?s) } .

for the above, that should give:-

   <http://www.w3.org/blargh> a :EvaluatedThing;
        :fixedBetween ("2001-10-15" "2001-10-17") .

OTOH, if you *don't* use a unique ID for each particular dated
representation, there is no way that you can perform that query -
unless there is a different way of modelling the whole evaluation.
