OK, I had a different understanding of the graph being created - I assumed
that the association of a context (date, author, etc) with a given result
(pass/fail/...) would hold when the graphs were merged.

/me goes to think about it for a while (and re-read the schema we have)..

  But it isn't the same thing. If a page fails on Monday that passed on
  Sunday, then it's a different page - a different representation of the
  same resource. We still have a link to the resource in the form of the
  "testSubject" (0.95) or "reprOf" (P1.0) arcs.

  Moreover, if we merge the two example reports from my email, we get:-

     <http://www.w3.org/blargh> rdf:type earl:WebContent;
       earl:date "2001-10-15", "2001-10-17";
       earl:fails :MyTest; earl:passes :MyTest .

  which isn't all that queryable. If you instead recognize the fact that
  you're evaluating a representation of the resource, and datestamp the
  thing/give it an ID, then you can still query by the original
  resource, because you have that arc:-

     _:x rdf:type earl:WebContent;
       earl:reprOf <http://www.w3.org/blargh>;
       earl:date "2001-10-15"; earl:fails :MyTest .

     _:y rdf:type earl:WebContent;
       earl:reprOf <http://www.w3.org/blargh>;
       earl:date "2001-10-17"; earl:fails :MyTest .

  You can ask "has http://www.w3.org/blargh been fixed?" using the
  following query/rule:-

     { [ earl:reprOf ?p; earl:date ?q; earl:fails ?r ] .
        [ earl:reprOf ?p; earl:date ?s; earl:passes ?r ] .
        ?q string:lessThan ?s } log:implies
       { ?p a :EvaluatedThing; :fixedBetween (?q ?s) } .

  for the above, that should give:-

     <http://www.w3.org/blargh> a :EvaluatedThing;
          :fixedBetween ("2001-10-15" "2001-10-17") .

  OTOH, if you *don't* use a unique ID for each particular dated
  representation, there is no way that you can perform that query -
  unless there is a different way of modelling the whole evaluation.
