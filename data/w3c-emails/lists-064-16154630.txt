Oops... I didn't mean to imply that anyone had misled anyone else or
anything like that :-) You said that you hadn't had a chance to go
through it in your previous message, so I thought I'd go through it
and give my own interpretation and spew the results to the list... In
fact, my own interpretation could be wrong, so I'd certainly like to
hear your own thoughts on the model if/when you get around to it
tomorrow.

Apologies once again if the previous letter sounded harsh; it
certainly wasn't intended that way!
