  Hello,

  Checked out RetroAccess today.  Anyone else played with this?

  Here are some thoughts based on a quick check. I used the demo version to evaluate cnn.com.

  Negatives:
  3. The cnn page uses lots of tables for layout.  The tips associated with all of the tables the tool identified says,
  <quote>Possible data table without headers
  Header rows and columns allow interpretive programs to read the data in the table appropriately. Use the "th" tag to identify the meanings of each row and column
  </quote>
  Since they are layout tables, th is not needed. This summary makes it sound like th is required on all tables.

In fact th cells are forbidden in layout tables, according to WCAG.

5.4 If a table is used for layout, do not use any structural markup for the
purpose of visual formatting. [Priority 2]
