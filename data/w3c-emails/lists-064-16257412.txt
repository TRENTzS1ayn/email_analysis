I wouldn't add it.  I don't consider it an accessibility tool.  It's not
transforming or filtering anything .  It's more like turning off JavaScript
or other settings in the browser. The question to ask is: "Can a user with
a disability now use the site with this tool without breaking necessary
functionality?"  Perhaps it could be part of user agents - or add-ons to
compliment user agents so they can meet UAAG.  Tools are used by developers
and content providers, browsers and plug-ins are used by consumers.
