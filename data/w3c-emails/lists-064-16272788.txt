Yes, the clarification helps. The most helpful place for it to be is in the
tool, making it clear that if this is a layout table it should not use th
elements, but otherwise they should be present.

(I have to admit I haven't played with the tool much, so I am not well-placed
to commetn in detail really)

cheers

  Actually the evaluation and repair tool, AccessEnable, is merely
  flagging tables as warnings, or possible problems that require human
  judgement. The key word in the warning is "possible". Since, it is
  difficult to determine from the code whether or not a table is being
  used for layout or data purposes, it is necessary to flag these items
  and allow for human judgement. If the tables are for layout, the user
  can simply choose to ignore the warning and provide a justification
  note. I hope this clarifies things.
