Our next teleconference will be held Monday, 21 January 2001 at the 
regularly scheduled time: 10:00 AM Eastern Time (15:00 UTC/GMT).  To find 
out what time it is in your time zone use the Time Zone Converter [1].

It will take place on the Zakim bridge (+1 617.761.6200), conference code 
3781 ("ERT-1") as well as on IRC
irc server: irc.w3.org
port: 6665
channel: #er

Note: this is a new bridge. The previous bridge did not require that you 
type in a code, it automatically connected you to the call.  Note the code 
(3781) that must be typed in to be connected to the call.

Agenda for Monday:

- Updates on what we've all been doing this last month.

- Sort out where it was we left off before the holidays and figure out 
what's next.

- Suggestions for discussion topics?  Nick says he might have a demo of a 
new tool??  Please send suggestions to the list.

Be well,
--wendy
