Will full results of this study be available on the Wewb (e.g. EARL
statements for each tool with regards to each checkpoint?)

  The ATRC, University of Toronto is undertaking a review and comparison of
  accessibility evaluation and repair tools currently on the market. In
  preparation for this study, we are conducting a literature review of
  existing work related to evaluation and repair tools specifically designed
  to address web accessibility issues.

  While the ER web site and list serve archives provide valuable resources, we
  would like to ensure that we have made a thorough inquiry. The only
  published review we have noted is the GCN article published in August 2001:
  http://www.gcn.com/20_23/s508/16783-1.html  If anyone has information on
  additional studies or literature, could you please suggest URLs or journal
  references?

  The review we are undertaking will utilize the Access Tool Reviewer.  Using
  the comprehensive set of test files provided by the Access Tool Reviewer
  (ATR) we will track the ability of various products to handle the specific
  accessibility issue within each file.  The intention is to compare current
  standalone products on the market, such as:

  ? A-Prompt Tool Kit (http://www.aprompt.ca)
  ? InSight and InFocus (http://www.ssbtechnologies.com/index.php)
  ? AccVerify and AccRepair  (http://www.hisoftware.com/access/Index.html )
  ? Page Screamer (http://crunchy.com/tools/index.html)
  ? RetroAccess (http://www.retroaccess.com)
  Bobby downloadable
  Other tools as well

  Results of this comparison will be presented at the CSUN 2002 conference.

  Anyone interested in helping with the survey is invited to contact me or
  Laurie Harrison (laurie.harrison@utoronto.ca).

  Cheers,
  Chris
