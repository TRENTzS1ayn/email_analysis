Yes, the EARL results will be made available.

Laurie Harrison will be heading up the review and she has added:

"We will be testing a representative sample (scope not yet finalized)
for both WAI and 508 compliance.

The main point is to come up with a product comparison with a focus on
evaluation accuracy and support for repair process. Usability issues
will also be considered."

Chris
