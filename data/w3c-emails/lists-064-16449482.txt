An n3 version is here:

.n3

I rather failed to convert it to xml using the online tools.  There's
probably a syntax error somewhere.  I had cwm somewhere, I'll try with that
in a bit.

The biggest and most important changes are near the top: the addition of
earl:regarding, earl:result, and earl:tested as predicates to replace the
rdf:subject, predicate, and object names.

The subclassOf rdfs:Property has also been removed for ResultProperty.

A new ResultProperty property, earl:severity has been added, and both it
and earl:confidence have numerical values.  I'm sure there's a correct way
to express this in the schema that I don't know about.  earl:NotTested and
earl:CantTell have been removed, since it was pointed out that they were
redundant.

All the terms relating to TestCase have been removed except for earl:id.

I've taken out a lot of the daml+oil stuff.

This is to provoke discussion.  I have doubts about several of the declared
domains and ranges, but I would like them to be described as fully as
possible.

PS. Who ever said version numbers had to make sense?
