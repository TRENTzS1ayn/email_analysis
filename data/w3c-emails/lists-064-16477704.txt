All I really need to declare my CSS tests is:

TESTCASES
     URI - the location of the test case
     Name - the name of the test
     Description - a description of the test
     Author - who wrote the test (so I can contact them about bugs in the test)
     A list of predefined results:
        Name - a name for this result
        Type - Pass/Fail/Not Applicable
        Severity - how serious this result is
        Confidence - how confident one can be about this result
        Comment - what comment to add to the results if this result is picked

TEST SUITES
     Name - the name of the test suite
     Description - a description of the test suite
     A list of tests that make up this test suite:
        Test URI - the URI of a test in the test suite
        Test priority - a key to decide in what order to perform the tests

CHECKPOINTS
     Name - the name of the checkpoint
     Description - a description of the checkpoint
     A list of requirements:
        Requirement - either another checkpoint, or a test
        Importance - how important this requirement is to the checkpoint

So "CSS1 Compliance" would be a checkpoint, while the W3C CSS1 Test Suite would
be a test suite. Most of the tests in the W3C CSS1 Test Suite would be
requirements of the checkpoint, as would many other tests.

The predefined results are a non-exclusive list of results to offer to the user
when showing that test. They represent the most likely results for that test.
Users should be able to enter their own results, though.


Is this what you wanted to know?
