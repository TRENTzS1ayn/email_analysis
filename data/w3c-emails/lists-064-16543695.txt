Hello UA and ER WGs,

I'm looking for a pointer to techniques for repairing
missing alt text in HTML. I thought we had such techs in
the UAAG 1.0 Techniques document, but I can't find them.
Any recommended algorithms we can point to?

The Techniques Document does already include
a reference to the Altifier [1].

Thanks for any tips,

  _ Ian
