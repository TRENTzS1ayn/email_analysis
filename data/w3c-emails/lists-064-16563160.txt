So how about we create a property occursAt which can useXpointer,
line/character offset, element/attribute name (or should we just do that as
Xpointer or xpath). It seems from the discussion in Bristol that we would
also need to identify a normalisation algorithm if one was used - i.e. unless
this is derived from a tool that doesn't touch the source code...

The next trick would be to work out how to make these interoperate and find
the same place using two or three different tools. Outside Xpointer I guess
this will be tricky... (does anyone know what Amaya  does if you annotate an
HTML document?)

cheers
