Peter Rayner, from the CSIRO in Australia has started working on a project to
provide javascript interpretation through a proxy. It is based on the Rhino
javascript parser (written in Java) and a suggestion by TV Raman that most
Javascript could be made to run server-side by passing through a proxy that
either transforms the javascript into something that doesn't need it (for
example javascript: links, which are a bad thing anyway) or can handle the
interaction required (e.g. form validation which isn't based on Xforms -
another possible approach maybe worth investigating).

The details are available from the archive of the blinux list - as soon as
the archive is updated -
