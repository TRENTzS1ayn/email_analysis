Subject: EARL Test Corpus (issue #681)



Hello,

In regards to issue 681 [0], at the 25/26 June 2002 ERT WG F2F meeting, we all accepted* an action item to work on a test collection of EARL data. (* except for eric, I think he got volunteered as someone who could answer questions :P )

from the f2f summary [1] we broke the issue into two parts:

1. test suite (test cases)
2. large amount of earl data to test and play with

What needs to be done:

- identify tools (to generate EARL)
- find a place to store the data
- determine what to test against

=========================
Identify tools (to generate EARL)
- Page Valet
- ACCVerify
- Mutat

Also, we could convert existing test suite data to EARL, ala Ian Hickson's conversion of CSS Test Suite data. [2]

Many evaluation tools generate XML and we could convert those to EARL, e.g. from LIFT, InFocus, etc.  Hopefully those developers would be willing to help.  (I've begun the process for LIFT data but have more to do...)

========================
Find a place to store the data

We discussed an RDF store on the W3C site.  Danbri and I talked about a possible joint trip to MIT to talk with Eric about this.  As of yet, nothing is decided.  Perhaps Danbri, EricP and I could get on the phone to discuss?  Anyone else interested?

========================
Determine what to test against

- Generate sample EARL for each of the user scenarios [3]
- Implement the queries listed for each user scenario

Thoughts? Interests?

[3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/2002/06/25-earl.html - this is the source for the EARL 1.0 spec. It contains the most up to date snapshot of the user scenarios. We edited quite a bit at the F2F.
