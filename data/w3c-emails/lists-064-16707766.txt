Hello,

Let's chat at the usual time and place:

17:00 to 18:00 GMT on Wednesday (note only an hour not the 4 hours as we have been doing...)

   Server: irc.w3.org
   Port: 6665
   Channel: #er

Still need closure on schema issues from F2F.
We might have some progress to report on the test corpus by tomorrow. I talked with EricP about it today.

I've been playing with an "annotated EARL example" [1] using Sean's "earl by example" [2] examples.  Haven't gotten too far, but this is in response to a review by Matt May who said that we ought to try something that "looks like an O'Reilly book."

Best,
--wendy
