Thinking about the fuzzy xpointer thing...

Nick, you're write-up is good. [1]
We ought to figure out how to approach people about it.  It seems to be the groups to discuss this with are: XLink, XMLSig, and Annotea.  Perhaps we can schedule a joint teleconference?

I took an action to bring this to XMLSig. I haven't done this yet.
I think some of it has already been discussed with Annotea folk.
Perhaps we can do a bit of brainstorming on this tomorrow.
