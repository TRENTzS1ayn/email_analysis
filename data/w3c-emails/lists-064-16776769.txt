The holy grail in testing tools seems to be an automatic test for flicker 
that could be dangerous for someone with photosensitive epilepsy.

Does anyone know of a tool that tests for flicker?
Does anyone have ideas about how this would be done automatically?
Are any of the developers on this list interested in working on something?

This is related to WCAG 1.0 checkpoint 7.1 [1]
Information on photosensitive epilepsy. [2]
