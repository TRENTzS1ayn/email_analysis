Peter,

Thank you for bringing up those extra points.  You're right, we need to pay 
more attention to partial sight (a.k.a. low vision).  By the way, even 
though I don't have low vision, I run into these sorts of problems 
sometimes with popup boxes.

So lets summarize your points for low vision:

1. Optimally, users should be able to have scrollbars even if the web page 
turns them off.
2. Until browsers do (1), pages should never turn off scrollbars.
3. Table dimensions should be expressed as percentages, not absolute units.
4. Avoid using images wider than  N pixels  (what's a good value for N?)

to which I'd add
5. If you use style sheets for layout, avoid specifications which cause 
objects to overlap each other when font size is increased.
6. Whenever feasible, display text in such a way that it wraps sensibly 
when font size is increased.
7. Use real text, not images of text, so  that user preferences in color, 
font, and size may be used.

Len

p.s.
I'm actually more familiar with the term "low vision" than "partial 
sight".  Is the term "partial sight" more used in Europe?
