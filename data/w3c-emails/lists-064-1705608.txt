Hi Len,

Thank you very much for your quick reply and summary.
What I and most low vision do is define their onw font size and style. I
always use font size 12 and font style arial and at my work place I have
always my computer on a 640x480 pixels. If you go to www.postbank.nl
(sorry it is Dutch) you see that all the problems come together and it
is realy impossible to read information. Another problem is, that
sometimes loading a page in frames constuction in a new seperate window
is disable by use of ASP. If I try to load the page in a new window
without frames I get the same frame constuction back.
I think a lot of these problems can be solved by including more option
in the browser. I'm not interesting in nice web design or creative
graphical designs. I'm interesting in information on web pages. So if a
word is too long for the specified table cell. Don't make the cell and
the table width longer, but brake the owrd in two pieces (if I want
that).
A lot of people define a table with a width of 640. Than have a column
of 200 and 400 and place a banner of width 480 pixels in the column of
440? 
I think in such a situation the web designer makes a mistake and he or
she must be punished for such a mistake. So make the image smaller. but
why browser also make the width of table longer?

Text on images indedd is also often an big problem. Also if there ia an
ALT tag. Alt tags doesn't help users with screen magnifiers with high
magnification level and no speech not a lot, because the popup window is
mostly much large than the magnified view so impossible to read.
