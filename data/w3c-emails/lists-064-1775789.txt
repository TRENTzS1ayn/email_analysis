Peter,

By the way, what's your recommendations for font size on web pages?

I'd think we'd want to leave the font at the default size, since people 
with low vision on the web would have already set larger fonts (like you 
do) and if we have large fonts on the page then the result are fonts that 
are too large.

There could be maybe one link in large font on the home page that takes a 
person to a page that explains how to make their default fonts larger.

But some sites aimed at people who have disabilities have large font.

Would you explain this some more?

Len
