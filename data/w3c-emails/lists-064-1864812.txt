Hi Len,

Thank you very much telling me it is JavaScript!
I understand why web designer make these construction. If you find a
individual page via a search engine they want to offer you some
navigation options.

I do it both. I have a vision between 2% and 9%. I can also read braille
very well, but I use screen magnification with ZoomText, because
accessibility at graphical user interfaces is in general beter with a
screen magnifier than it is with a braille display. ZoomText can magnify
up to 16 times and in 640x480 display resolution I use 8x magnification
plus the 12 font.
I have a Pentium 133hz here at my work. If I set resolution to 800x600
my screen magnifier performs very bad and it is nearly possible to
scroll (move the magnified view). At home I have a Pentium III 667hz and
there I can set resolution to 800x600 and ZoomText magnification to 12.
Indeed this solves some problems, but not all. Setting font size to 12
causes a lot of problems in tables.

There are two scrolling options in ZoomText. Automatic reading feature.
This features presents the text of a document on the screen. I can
define my own font size, color combination etc. Very nice feature to
read e-mail and documents like in Microsoft Word and sometimes it also
works fine to read web pages. But if a web page is designed with a table
the entire table is read. If I want to read only a column I first have
to highlight the entire column and after doing that I can ZoomText let
it read. This cost a lot of time.
The second option is manual scrolling. I press the ALT+ARROW key to
scroll and read the text. Everytime if I at hte end of the line I press
a hotkey combination to jump to the left border and start to read the
next line of text. If there is text outside the screen I have to read to
the end of the screen. Move my magnifieid view to the trackbar at the
bottom of the screen and find my line of text, that I was reading back
to read the last words of the line. If there is a frames construction I
load the page in a new window. After doing that in most situations there
are no trackbars so I can read that text much faster.

I also know sight impaired who have a much better vision that I have.
They prefer not to use the screen magnifiers, because of all the
scrolling. They also use large font settings, but have the same problems
with those trackbars and as you already said with image text.
I have also collegues here who set display resolution to 640x480 to get
larger text. For most people if they are 50 or 60 their eyes are not so
good than if they were 20 or 30. They can drive a car so they are not
low vision, but they need some magnification and do this by setting
larger fonts. This is I think a very large group of people.
What is good for those people is also good for people like me.

Hope you understand?
Regards Peter Verhoeven
