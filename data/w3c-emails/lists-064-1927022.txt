I disagree with this suggestion.  I believe the points that are being 
discussed are a WCAG issue not a tool issue.  Now is the prime time to take 
these issues to the WCAG working group as they have begun thinking about 
revising the guidelines - particularly to address cognitive and learning 
disabilities and to generalize the checkpoints so that they are less HTML 
specific.

Also, I don't believe enough credit is being given to what WCAG already 
addresses in regards to low vision.

Here are some excerpts from WCAG 1.0:

Content developers must consider these different situations during page 
design. While there are several situations to consider, each accessible 
design choice generally benefits several disability groups at once and the 
Web community as a whole. For example, by using style sheets to control 
font styles and eliminating the FONT element, HTML authors will have more 
control over their pages, make those pages more accessible to people with 
low vision, and by sharing the style sheets, will often shorten page 
download times for all users.

control over their pages, make those pages more accessible to people with 
low vision, and by sharing the style sheets, will often shorten page 
download times for all users.

(from the rationale of Guideline 1)
This guideline emphasizes the importance of providing text equivalents of 
non-text content (images, pre-recorded audio, video). The power of text 
equivalents lies in their capacity to be rendered in ways that are 
accessible to people from various disability groups using a variety of 
technologies. Text can be readily output to speech synthesizers and braille 
displays, and can be presented visually (in a variety of sizes) on computer 
displays and paper. Synthesized speech is critical for individuals who are 
blind and for many people with the reading difficulties that often 
accompany cognitive disabilities, learning disabilities, and deafness. 
Braille is essential for individuals who are both deaf and blind, as well 
as many individuals whose only sensory disability is blindness. Text 
displayed visually benefits users who are deaf as well as the majority of 
Web users.

Related Checkpoints:
2.1 Ensure that all information conveyed with color is also available 
without color, for example from context or markup. [Priority 1]

2.2 Ensure that foreground and background color combinations provide 
sufficient contrast when viewed by someone having color deficits or when 
viewed on a black and white screen. [Priority 2 for images, Priority 3 for 
text].

3.1 When an appropriate markup language exists, use markup rather than 
images to convey information. [Priority 2]
For example, use MathML to mark up mathematical equations, and style sheets 
to format text and control layout. Also, avoid using images to represent 
text -- use text and style sheets instead. Refer also to guideline 6 and 
guideline 11.

WAC note: if markup is used rather than images, text can be displayed 
however the user chooses.  the user can choose size, color, and font.

3.3 Use style sheets to control layout and presentation. [Priority 2]
For example, use the CSS 'font' property instead of the HTML FONT element 
to control font styles.

WAC note: Again, this is giving control to the users.

3.4 Use relative rather than absolute units in markup language attribute 
values and style sheet property values. [Priority 2]
For example, in CSS, use 'em' or percentage lengths rather than 'pt' or 
'cm', which are absolute units. If absolute units are used, validate that 
the rendered content is usable (refer to the section on validation).

WAC note: this gets at the issue that Len mentioned.  If relative units are 
used, when the font is increased the layout should adjust so that there is 
not overlap.
