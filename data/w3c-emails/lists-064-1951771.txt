After thinking about this more, we could discuss the following techniques 
that would help determine if a page is accessible to someone with low vision:

1. how to determine if an image has text. if it does have text suggest that 
the text become the alt-text, perhaps also suggest that the author use 
style sheets.

2. check the page for high contrast color combinations - see the color 
study done by the ATRC in Toronto for more info. 
http://snow.utoronto.ca/readtest

3. check images for high contrast color combinations - this requires 
determining the colors used in the image.

4. I'm not sure what automated technique to suggest for this one: 2.1 
Ensure that all information conveyed with color is also available without 
color, for example from context or markup. [Priority 1]
