"add to list?"

XML Pro appears to be an XML editor and thus IMHO doesn't qualify else
we'd have to include too many editors that *might* have ERT qualities?

STG's XML validator seems to qualify.

The SGML/XML Web Page is quite a bit like our list of tools although it
isn't limited to checkers, but includes editors. So I don't think it
belongs on ours since we aren't a "list of lists".
