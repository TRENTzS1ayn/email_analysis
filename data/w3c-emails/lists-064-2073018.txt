I added icons to the WAVE output to show where there are tags for headings, 
lists, and emphasis, so the user can check if they are being used where, 
and only where, they are appropriate.

WAVE is at the usual place, http://www.temple.edu/inst_disabilities/piat/wave/

Explanation of the icons is included in wave output, also spelled out more 
in the tutorial, 
http://www.temple.edu/inst_disabilities/piat/wave/doc/index.html#logical

Applying the WAVE, we see that

Yahoo http://www.yahoo.com  has no logical tags.

On the other hand, Gregory's CAMERA OBSCURA,  as one would expect, has 
appropriate heading, list, and emphasis tags... including real lists, not 
these paltry table formateed list poseurs.  BTW, some items are marked with 
both emphasis and strong tags... hey, nobody said you can't...

Also, under miscellaneous warnings, it warns when there are audio files, 
and server side image maps that are not also client side maps, so that user 
can check for approprate text equivalents.  You can see these warnings at 
AT&T's TTS demo site http://www.research.att.com/projects/tts/  That also 
misses one ALT text out of 9, showing that even conscientious people can 
slip up.

As always, comments welcome.
