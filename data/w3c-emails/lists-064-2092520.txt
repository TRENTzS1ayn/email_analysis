Our last teleconference before the face to face will be same time same station:

Monday May 8

10:00-11:30 Eastern USA Time (GMT -05:00) on the MIT bridge (+1 617-258-7910)

Agenda:

1. Report on Action Items

ACTION CR: investigate A-Prompt's status vis a vis open source
ACTION MC/BM: investigate CAST's plans for making Bobby open source
ACTION MC: send example to list of what Bobby can do easily that Schematron 
can't do, as well as ideas for relating RDF and Schemas to those things 
that can't be expressed in terms of HTML structure
ACTION LK: put feature into WAVE that will allow someone to look at source 
to see if what appears to be a list is a list; add logical tags so that if 
there is a numerical list outputs an icon

2.  Question: Do we add more low vision discussion to face to face:

     Con: Let's not get into checkpoints not yet in WCAG.  Already have 
full agenda
     Pro:  Types of issues seem different than much of our previous 
discussion:

3. Any further thoughts on face to face?

4. Info about Amaya
