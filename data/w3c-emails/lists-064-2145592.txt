Some of us are meeting for dinner Wedesday evening, 7PM, before the face to 
face.  We'll gather at Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica (CWI) the same 
place where we are having the face to face thursday and friday.

Directions are at http://www.cwi.nl/cwi/about/directions.html

It concludes by saying

Enter the WCW campus on your left through the gate. The building entrance, 
with signs "CWI" and "SMC" (Stichting
      Mathematisch Centrum), is on your right.

We'll meet by the building entrance.
