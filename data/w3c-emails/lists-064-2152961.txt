you'll be able to use telnet and SSH (see http://www.chiark.green
end.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/ a free Telnet and SSH client for 
Windows 95/98/NT).

to summarise:
access to all hosts (except CWI hosts ;) ) through:
* http & https (standard ports, e.g. 80 and 443)
* pop3 & imap (standard ports, 110 and 143)
* telnet & ssh (standard ports, 23 and 22)

You'll be utilizing a 10/100 Mb auto-sensing HUB and will have a 
total of 7 ports available. DHCP services are setup, and should 
be able to provide DHCP-clients with the necessary information 
to connect seamlessly.

220/110 AC

As far as I know we *don't* have 110-=>220 AC convertors...
(Holland uses 230 V @ 50Hz AC)

The telephone number in the meeting room is 020 5926003. It's a
normal telephone. I think you can't call in with several people at the
same time. I try to reach the responsible man for this today.
