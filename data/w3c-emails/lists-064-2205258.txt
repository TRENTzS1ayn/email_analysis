The current demo of A-Prompt is available for download at:

http://aprompt.snow.utoronto.ca/develop/demo.htm

After downloading the program, unzip the package then execute 'setup.exe'.

Please take a look and let me know if you have any comments.

This version has many bugs and should not be considered a final product.
It runs under Windows only.
