The voices championing usability were just as loud (on the WAI lists anyway)
as those arguing for philosophical completeness.  The sad thing is that such
choices were NOT mutually exclusive.  Cast choose the academic over the
practical, and that's their right to make such a decision.  They are, after
all, providing a great a valuable service for free!  I am very much looking
forward to this new version you refer to.
