Kynn,

thanks for your comments.  My responses are interspersed and prefixed with WC::

WC:: I had an interesting discussion yesterday with someone who said that 
"author" and "designer" imply very different things and both will be users 
of the tools being developed.  therefore, i'm not sure that we want to 
limit it to "author" but I also don't think it makes too much of a 
difference as long as we are consistent and people know what we mean when 
we use a chosen term.

WC:: I'm not sure what you mean by "absolute language."

What if we modify the second paragraph in the Introduction to read:
<blockquote>
This is an informative document that builds on the WCAG 1.0 foundation by 
outlining techniques that evaluation and repair tools may use to uncover 
accessibility problems and possibly repair them. These techniques may be 
used by those who create web authoring tools or by anyone interested in 
creating accessible Web documents.  Tools are not expected to conform to 
the processes in this document.  This is not a definitive list of what an 
evaluation and repair tool must perform.  It is expected that tools may be 
developed that focus on one technique while others will try to implement 
all of the techniques depending on the goals of the tool.
</blockquote>

Also, I propose that we cut the last paragraph of the introduction and 
rework the 2nd to last paragraph to read:
<blockquote>
Many people creating content for the Web will not be familiar with the 
various markup languages that are used. Many others will not know about Web 
accessibility. Tools should be intuitive and easy to use and available at a 
minimal cost. Tools should not generate excessive warnings or false 
positive accessibility errors.  However, this document does not address how 
to interact with the author. Please refer to the Authoring Tool 
Accessibility Guidelines for information on dialog and interface techniques 
for creating authoring tools.
</blockquote>

note that this assumes that we will take the "suggested language" sections 
out of this document and synch them with the ATAG techniques as we 
discussed at the face2face.  we have not completely reached consensus on 
how or what to do. we need to start a thread on that.

WC:: no, this is not a definitive listing.  this is informative.  it's a 
collection of brainstorms for people to pick from.

WC:: agreed. perhaps even more should be added to the paragraph i just 
proposed.

WC:: informative.  we have inherited the priorities from WCAG.  many tools 
need to know what the priorities are as we expect that people will 
implement P1 checks first.

again, there is no conforming to this document. it is informative.  i tried 
to clarify that in my first proposal (at the beginning of this message).

WC::those are ATAG issues (guidelines in fact) .  as just stated, i think 
we will be moving the interface information to the ATAG techniques.

>Technique 1.1.1:
>
>  1.  NULL "alt" values (alt="") should be allowed.

WC:: this is an unending argument that i will not address here.

WC:: we are not suggesting that any of the text in the "Evaluation" 
sections of each technique be used in the interface.  this is part of the 
algorithm that a tool should implement.  if a suspicious pattern is 
identified, then it should trigger an action within the tool.  this action 
might be performed automatically by the tool or it may require the author 
to do something.

I can see changing the text in the "suggested message" section, however I 
think this section will be changing greatly or incorporated into ATAG 
techniques.

WC:: refer to previous comments.

I will respond to this rest of your suggestions later today.  thanks again 
for the comments.
