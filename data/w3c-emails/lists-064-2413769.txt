Section 12.3 just has "Any suggestions".  How about:

Technique 12.3.1 [priority 2] Check for OPTGROUP elements within SELECT
elements.

         Evaluation:

              Element: SELECT
              Requirement: Should have OPTGROUPs if more than 10 OPTIONs.

         Suggested message:

              Group long lists of selections into a hierarchy using OPTGROUPs. 

         Suggested repair:

              Display the list and allow user to select groups. 

-----------------------------------------------------

Technique 12.3.2 [priority 2] Check for FIELDSET elements if form controls
found.

         Evaluation:

              Element: FIELDSET
              Requirement: Should have FIELDSETs if more a total of more
than 10 INPUT, TEXTAREA, SELECT or BUTTONs.

         Suggested message:

              Group related form controls and label each group. 

         Suggested repair:

              Display the controls and allow user to select groups.
