aloha, brian!

thanks for taking the initiative on this...

in regards 12.3.2 you wrote:

Technique 12.3.2 [priority 2] Check for FIELDSET elements if form controls 
found

          Evaluation:
             Element: FIELDSET
             Requirement: Should have FIELDSETs if more a total of more than
         10 INPUT, TEXTAREA, SELECT or BUTTONs.
unquote

why the number 10?  i typically use a FIELDSET for any grouping of related 
form fields, so i would suggest that the user be allowed to configure the 
triggering number to any value equal to or greater than 2

the contextual/orientational information that can be obtained from a 
FIELDSET is invaluable to the serial output device user, and to braille and 
speech users in particular...

gregory.
