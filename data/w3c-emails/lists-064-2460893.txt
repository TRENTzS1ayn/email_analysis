Any number is going to be an arbitrary choice. One reason why 10 makes as
much sense as any other is that most mobile telephone-based devices haev 10
number keys (and a couple of others as well...)

  why the number 10?  i typically use a FIELDSET for any grouping of related 
  form fields, so i would suggest that the user be allowed to configure the 
  triggering number to any value equal to or greater than 2
  
  the contextual/orientational information that can be obtained from a 
  FIELDSET is invaluable to the serial output device user, and to braille and 
  speech users in particular...
