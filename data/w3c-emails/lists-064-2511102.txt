  At the face to face meeting we agreed to look at having joint teleconferences

  Since the first call of the month for each group is in about 2 weeks, we
  should choose a time...
  
  AU is on tuesdays at 2:30 pm BOston time (11:30am US west coast, 8:30pm
  Europe, 4:30 am Melbourne)
  
  ER is Mondays at 10 am Boston time (7am US west coast, 4 pm Europe, midnght
