     Well, leave it to me to be the fly in the ointment. :-) 10 am Boston time 
is 9 am my time, and I'm usually not awake by then. Due to my situation, it's 
not just a matter of me setting an alarm. Mondays mornings are also the usual 
time I update my astronomy club's web site, but that isn't a big issue as it 
can (and has on occasion) be done later in the day, or even the next. But 
regardless, I really couldn't commit to attending those meetings at that time. 
An hour later would be better; two or more would be best.
     But, that's just me.
