I am presuming (based on experience) that the TUesday afternoon time of the
regular AU teleconference is fine for you...

cheers

       Well, leave it to me to be the fly in the ointment. :-) 10 am Boston time 
  is 9 am my time, and I'm usually not awake by then. Due to my situation, it's 
  not just a matter of me setting an alarm. Mondays mornings are also the usual 
  time I update my astronomy club's web site, but that isn't a big issue as it 
  can (and has on occasion) be done later in the day, or even the next. But 
  regardless, I really couldn't commit to attending those meetings at that time. 
  An hour later would be better; two or more would be best.
       But, that's just me.
