For those interested in reading more about our web page colors test, our
paper is available at:
http://aprompt.snow.utoronto.ca/WebPageColors.html

The paper gives more information than what was contained in the poster at
the recent WWW9 conf in Amsterdam.

The algorithm described in the paper is now incorporated into A-Prompt and
the AERT doc. I would like to refine the algorithm and do some subjective
testing over the next year.

If you have any comments, please let me know.

Chris
