Hello,

I have updated the draft ER WG charter based on:
1. ideas from the face2face meeting a couple weeks ago,
2. a renewed understanding of charters based on my experience with the R&D 
IG charter <grin>.

The major changes are in the following sections:
- Mission Statement
- Scope and audience
- Success criteria
- Dependencies and Coordination with other groups - primarily the 
dependency with AU is more explicit, although I am concerned I may have 
made it too stringent.

Note that I had been pushing for us to be operating under this charter 
before the face2face. I forgot to mention that we (the WAI domain) will be 
renewing several charters at once and had decided to wait until after WWW9 
and the AC meeting to finish them up.

The new draft charter is available at: 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/erwg-charter-20000531.html

I look forward to your comments,
--wendy
