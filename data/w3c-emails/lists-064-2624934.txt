Couple of comments:

The relationship with user agents should be more clearly sorted out (at the
moment the draft doesn't describe the relationship, just the UAWG).

There is a question about what changes if maintaining a list of tools is done
in concert with AU. I would guess nothing - the group is just responsible
for making sure it happens, and implementation details are generally outside
the scope of a charter.

(I only had a quick skim)

  Hello,
  
  I have updated the draft ER WG charter based on:
  1. ideas from the face2face meeting a couple weeks ago,
  2. a renewed understanding of charters based on my experience with the R&D 
  IG charter <grin>.
  
  The major changes are in the following sections:
  - Mission Statement
  - Scope and audience
  - Success criteria
  - Dependencies and Coordination with other groups - primarily the 
  dependency with AU is more explicit, although I am concerned I may have 
  made it too stringent.
  
  Note that I had been pushing for us to be operating under this charter 
  before the face2face. I forgot to mention that we (the WAI domain) will be 
  renewing several charters at once and had decided to wait until after WWW9 
  and the AC meeting to finish them up.
  
  The new draft charter is available at: 
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/erwg-charter-20000531.html
  
  I look forward to your comments,
