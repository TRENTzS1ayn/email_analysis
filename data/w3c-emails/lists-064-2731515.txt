Today's NYT "Mrs. Rigden is one of a small group of researchers and 
software developers who are creating relatively simple software tools that 
allow Web designers to view their work the way colorblind people see it." 
... "Colorfield has made a plug-in for Photoshop called Insight, which is 
somewhat easier to use than Mrs. Rigden's substitute palettes. Once loaded, 
it allows designers to check the colorblind compatibility of their work by 
using standard pull-down menus. It can also simulate total blue 
colorblindness."

The full article is at 
http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/02/technology/02BLIN.html but I don't know 
if it will stay or even be available to "non-subscribers". No mention of 
guidelines.
