Jan,
Looking good.  One suggestion: in guideline 3 you have the more generic

"prompt the author..."

e.g.

            Prompt the author to identify the type of image (decorative, a 
navigation icon, etc.).

While in the new section 4 you've inherited the "suggested messages" that 
we had in there, e.g.
    * Suggested Messages:
        * "Missing text equivalent: Missing text equivalent for image."
Personally speaking, I like the generic way rather than the "suggested 
wording".  Even if we tell the author it's only suggested, they might feel 
limited.  I think this was where we were headed while AERT was over here in 
ER...
