Jutta and all chairs: I've tried to fulfill my obligation to review the 
UAAG Final Call document from the point of view of each of the Working 
Groups and must beg forgiveness for my inability to do so.

The audience for the document is essentially a group of browser/AT 
developers of which I am not a part, nor currently conversant with. I'm 
just not qualified and my attempts to read the guidelines have failed. I'm 
in the position that Lisa Seeman expressed at the F2F: I can read the words 
but I just can't connect them meaningfully enough to assay what effect the 
Rec, if adopted, will have on all the other Working Groups' goals. I don't 
think the effects will be adverse, nor do I think it will have the kind of 
impact the other groups' deliverables will have, largely because it just 
isn't particularly *directly* applicable to individuals using the Web.

I believe that I'm the only person who is active on all (except UA) of 
WAI's public Working Groups, so I hope others will take up the slack I'm 
leaving and comment meaningfully on the document.
