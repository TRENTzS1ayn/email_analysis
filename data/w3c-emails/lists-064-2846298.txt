Agreed.

Specifically, I think we should not say "suggested text" but present
something as a sample interface.....

  Jan,
  Looking good.  One suggestion: in guideline 3 you have the more generic
  
  "prompt the author..."
  
  e.g.
  
              Prompt the author to identify the type of image (decorative, a 
  navigation icon, etc.).
  
  While in the new section 4 you've inherited the "suggested messages" that 
  we had in there, e.g.
      * Suggested Messages:
          * "Missing text equivalent: Missing text equivalent for image."
  Personally speaking, I like the generic way rather than the "suggested 
  wording".  Even if we tell the author it's only suggested, they might feel 
  limited.  I think this was where we were headed while AERT was over here in 
  ER...
