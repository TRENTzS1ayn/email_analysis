To:w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org

At the risk of this proposal being "out of scope" I would propose that we 
encourage (or perform) development of a simple tool that inserts into an 
XHTML file an assertion that the author (whose email is xxx@yyy) claims a 
particular level of conformance to WCAG 1.0 and that the document has been 
tidied, validated, and personally checked with available tools to enable 
this assertion  on our beloved "Web of Trust".

Although, in theory, the mere placement of a certain logo on the page might 
enable one to locate files bearing such claims, the use of RDF for this 
purpose makes possible a much finer potential availability of this 
assertion as well as freeing one from the obligation to have the site bear 
a certain "appearance" - as well as the problem with "image text" in the 
currently recommended logo.
