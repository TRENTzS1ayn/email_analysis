It's early on a Saturday morning and I've been doing other stuff but isn't 
that a "principle" that should get into the guidelines in some kind of 
Priority 1 sense?

It's sort of covered when we talk about not making page leaps or 
too-short-timed switchings and magnifying images causing loss of resolution 
and descriptive text for movies that isn't synchronized with what's being 
described.

I guess what I'm positing is that in addition to being "predictable" it 
should ideally be "controllable" in the sense that CSS has a "!important" 
feature allowing the last cascade to be where God intended it.

AG:: "This stuff is part of accessibility, not in addition to 
accessibility. Accessibility is not limited to static constraints that can 
be evaluated in the context of a single page 'document.'"

WL: For us to have any "softness" on whether "usability" is absolutely 
essential to "Accessibility" just won't do. To exactly the extent that 
usability is compromised so is accessibility. The most frustrating obstacle 
to information access is spread across a population that's way more than 
"half the planet" - all the same problems people have with using things are 
just as significant for blind folks as they are for me. While on the steep 
part of the learning curve, it's easy to roll backwards.
