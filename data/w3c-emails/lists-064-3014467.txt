No, because CSS and JS are not XML formats, and therefore you can use XML
processing technologies on them. You would have to use a Perl script, or
other C++ based langauge to parse and transform CSS and JS. It is possible
to annotate XHTML in this way though.

That would reqiure a *lot* of AI technology! I'm afraid there is no
forseeable way in which that can be done. Actually, I thought it could be up
until a few days ago, but then lots of people on RDF IG argued with me to
the contrary. Only Sanskrit is possible to parse (strangely enough!).
The solution - or rather the *only* solution, is to make HTML more semantic
in the first place, or allow the addition of meta-data within the <body>
section, thus marking up semantically the CDATA inside. Then we can process
it! In theory, at least...
