I just couldn't resist this opportunity to emphasize this apparently little 
understood (overlooked?) truth.

The really important thing is to assure the implementation of this feature 
and if I'm not mistaken the choice of either will result in the desired 
effect: expansion of the obsurity into clarity. As I age I am really not 
that hip to RSS, P3P, CC/PP, or even DOM, RDF, and XSLT! I realize that 
most anyone interested in these areas might not need this elucidation but 
when it matters, it's almost a priority 1 kind of thing. It's not always 
even possible to find out all the possible meanings of a 3-cap set, *all* 
of which incidentally are registered trade or service marks at least in CA.

Al's further points relating to internatiolization stuff should move into 
our top level of things to examine because we are so UScentric that it's 
become a cyberuglyAmerican thing. If we can begin to have attention put 
onto places where we're blatantly doing this, it might help us all a lot. I 
will never forget when a floor questioner at a WWWx plenary session asked a 
presenter from Japan who was talking about regional language availabilities 
"why don't they all just learn English?" And I don't think he was being 
self-deprecatingly ironic. Just the "directional assumptions" make us seem 
hopelessly chauvinistic since the percentage of literate people on the 
planet who think reading is "intuitively" from left to right might very 
well be in the minority!
