Dear Colleagues,
I recently came up with the idea that the ERT Group could issue an XHTML
Module [1] to take away some of the elements causing accessibility problems
in XHTML 1.1 [2], and add some of our own to improve accessibility.
For example, it would be possible to write this module to do the following
tasks, amongst others:-
1. Take out some of the presentational elements of HTML (<b> etc.)
2. Add in some more semantic ones (<annotation>, <anchor>)
3. Add in RDF etc. [3]
Plus anything else to do with markup changes that the WAI feel are
necessary, or useful, to make to XHTML 1.1, in order to improve
accessibility. I welcome suggestions on both this proposal, and what kind of
things you would like to see in the module if you feel it's a good idea.

A short FAQ:

1. What is Modularization (m12n)? See
http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-modularization/introduction.html#s_intro_whatismo
d

2. Why Modularize XHTML (In particular, why should the ERT group create an
XHTML Module)?
[[[
The modularization of XHTML refers to the task of specifying well-defined
sets of XHTML elements that can be combined and extended by document
authors, document type architects, other XML standards specifications, and
application and product designers to make it economically feasible for
content developers to deliver content on a greater number and diversity of
platforms.
