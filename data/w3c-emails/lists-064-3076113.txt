I've been asked for a clarification on what m12n is, and what it means to
the WAI.
As you all know, XHTML (the W3Cs main document markup language), is only
valid if it follows the XHTML DTD - or Document Type Definition. The DTD is
the piece of code that tells you exactly what markup is allowed where.
Everything that is allowed in XHTML is defined in the DTD.
With XHTML m12n (modularization), the HTML WG have split up the DTD into
"modules". Each module contains a fragment of the XHTML DTD, i.e. contains
the specification/definition for a set of elements and/or attributes. For
example, the Image module contains the <img> element and its attributes.
What this allows us to do is create our own markup languages using the XHTML
modules, creating an XHTML Family. In essence, this allows the general
public (us included) to re-write XHTML as we would like it. One can
therefore:-
     1. Add modules
     2. Delete modules
     3. Replace modules
     4. Modify modules
     5. Add elements
     6. Add attributes
     7. Add entities
     8. Change the content model
What this means is that XHTML is no longer as inflexible as it used to be -
if you don't like some aspect of it, simply re-write it! It gives the power
back to the people: no longer do you have to lobby the HTML WG for changes
to XHTML, we can simply write them ourselves.
What I am suggesting is that we write a "new" module that can be added to
XHTML. This module could change XHTML to make it more acessible. As stated
before, we could remove presentational elements, add in new semantic ones,
put in RDF, and at a stretch change the content model if need be.
Why do I believe that this is the domain of the ERT group? Becuse of the
name: WAI Evaluation and Repair Tools group. I see this module as being a
repair for the inaccessible features of XHTML; it is an XHTML repair tool.
It is one that we can write fully by ourselves, with little or no help from
the HTML WG - that is why they made m12n in the first place, so people could
change XHTML themselves: a sort of DIY XHTML!

When the module is done, if people want to use our accessibility features,
they can so so by using this bit of code as their DTD (what it does is mix
our module with XHTML 1.1):-

     <!ENTITY % waiert10.mod
          PUBLIC "-//W3C//MODULE XHTML WAI ERT 1.0//EN"
                 "http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/waiert10.mod" >
     %waiert10.mod;
     <!ENTITY % xhtml11.dtd
          PUBLIC "-//W3C//XHTML 1.1//EN"
                 "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd" >
     %xhtml11.dtd;

[Disclaimer: Please note that the FPI and system URI are only examples, and
don't imply W3C support for the modules or the URIs given (i.e. only
intended for discussion).]
The example I have listed above is only one example of what we could do
using m12n. For a fuller list, visit

Hopefully my original message will make a bit more sense now:-

> Dear Colleagues,
> I recently came up with the idea that the ERT Group could issue an XHTML
> Module [1] to take away some of the elements causing accessibility
problems
> in XHTML 1.1 [2], and add some of our own to improve accessibility.
> For example, it would be possible to write this module to do the following
> tasks, amongst others:-
> 1. Take out some of the presentational elements of HTML (<b> etc.)
> 2. Add in some more semantic ones (<annotation>, <anchor>)
> 3. Add in RDF etc. [3]
> Plus anything else to do with markup changes that the WAI feel are
> necessary, or useful, to make to XHTML 1.1, in order to improve
> accessibility. I welcome suggestions on both this proposal, and what kind
of
> things you would like to see in the module if you feel it's a good idea.
