What must be accomplished insofar as W3C actions to make this doable? IOW

even a major factor? If I understand correctly any browser that handles 
HTML X.x and CSSx will qualify?

Does this mean that we can make an XHTML "template" that includes the very 
stuff our guidelines address, i.e. we can make the validation of the file 
depend on certain treatments: (alt presence; accompanying style sheet class 
elucidations; indexing ala RDF assertions about conformance levels; various 
structural conventions, etc.

If this is correct then what're the caveats? If something sounds too good 
to be true...

Hello! is anybody here? How about a tool to convert images to SVG? Or 
perhaps built-in content negotiation to assure "graceful degradations" and 
"backward compatability".
