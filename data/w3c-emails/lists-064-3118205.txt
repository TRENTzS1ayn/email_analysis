LRK:: Hmmm. It's the WCAG group that has the final say on what's required 
for an accessible document, but one could take the philosophy that they'd 
simply say "use these ERT modules" without writing the modules themselves, 
just like they say to use other W3C specs, e.g. SVG, they they didn't write 
themselves (but that the PF group made sure had accessibility features).

Of course, I say "they", but a lot of us are them also.

Lets discuss monday.

And thank, Sean, for that description of modularization.
