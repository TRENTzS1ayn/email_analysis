I see what you mean, but the HTML WG have structured XHTML very differently
to how it used to be. Now the only "core" part of the language are the core
modules: structure, basic text, lists, and hypertext. Any "modules/changes"
that we make *will* be a part of the language itself, because that's what
m12n is.
I'm not saying that the PF group should stop trying to get the HTML WG to
add accessibility into the HTML WG modules, or for that matter 1.1/2.0; on
the contrary that is one of the primary things it needs to do. However, many
people will be creating m12n families that don't use all that many W3C
modules, and if we created a module for accessibility, they could mix it
into any XHTML m12n based language, and not just XHTML 1.1.

Sure, I don't mind, but I don't like dealing with the HTML WG direct, due to
the level of politics over programming. They tend to take anything that I
say with a pinch of salt nowadays, no matter how useful my comments are..

We should do both!
