How fortunate it is that soon, on December 4 and 5 of this year, the ER and PF
groups will be meeting together.? We can consider roles, deliverables and step
by step plans together at that time.

In the past PF have encouraged ER to go ahead and prototype things like RDF
application profiles to annotate the results of accessibility evaluation.? We
never got specific about coordination plans for such a beast.? If it is "a
module [or an application profile] for accessibility" it might be worth a
cross-working-group task force.? Just because work products don't sort nicely
according to our current group charters doesn't mean that they shouldn't be
done.

This falls in the general area of "how does our division of labor adapt to the
new layering of Web applications brought about by XML?"? Here we seem to have
some agreement that this is a real question, but no consensus that we have an
agreed answer.
