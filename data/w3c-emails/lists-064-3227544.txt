From my understanding no-one is proposing taking the accessibility features
out of the complete set of XHTML elements.  Merely extending particular
modules to allow for document validation based on accessibility.

I would agree with the approach that we should create modules that can be
included to extend / override the standard XHTML DTD.  In fact we  could
create three modules, one mapping to each priority / conformance level.
[Modules for priority 1, 2 and 3.]  Content authors could specify modules
for their intended conformance level (A, AA, AAA || 1, 2, 3).  This would
make life much easier for automated diagnostic and repair tools as we would
have specified in the HTML the desired conformance level.

It should be stressed, though, that XML validating parser and the DTD
specification are extremely limited in their ability to define documents.
The majority of accessibility problems lie outside of the realm of issues
that can be specified using a DTD.  The meaningful alt text mentioned in a
previous post comes to mind.

So while the modular extensions to the XHTML DTD are a great idea I would
caution any member of this group from stating that we can produce
"verifiably accessible" XHTML documents.

With that said: Is anyone interested an working to author and alpha module
for P1 && P2?

 That is what the
Protocols and Formats group does - and if you want to help we would
appreciate it.

The net result is more or less the same, except that instead of having to
add
in a modle for accessibility it is there as one of the basic requirements of
the language.

Where this becomes interesting is that there are a number of features of a
language - event models, including binary content types, mechanism for
including alternatives - that are similar across different languages, and it
ould be helpful to have clearer specification of wht PF thinks is the way to
do this.

Some of what I think we are trying to accomplish with the XML guidelines -
http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/xmlgl - is to provide this kind of information.

I have cc'ed Al Gilman, who is the chair of that group - these are just my
personal understandings, and he might be able to shed more official light on
the questions...

  I've been asked for a clarification on what m12n is, and what it means to
  the WAI.
  As you all know, XHTML (the W3Cs main document markup language), is only
  valid if it follows the XHTML DTD - or Document Type Definition. The DTD
is
  the piece of code that tells you exactly what markup is allowed where.
  Everything that is allowed in XHTML is defined in the DTD.
  With XHTML m12n (modularization), the HTML WG have split up the DTD into
  "modules". Each module contains a fragment of the XHTML DTD, i.e. contains
  the specification/definition for a set of elements and/or attributes. For
  example, the Image module contains the <img> element and its attributes.
  What this allows us to do is create our own markup languages using the
XHTML
  modules, creating an XHTML Family. In essence, this allows the general
  public (us included) to re-write XHTML as we would like it. One can
  therefore:-
       1. Add modules
       2. Delete modules
       3. Replace modules
       4. Modify modules
       5. Add elements
       6. Add attributes
       7. Add entities
       8. Change the content model
  What this means is that XHTML is no longer as inflexible as it used to
be -
  if you don't like some aspect of it, simply re-write it! It gives the
power
  back to the people: no longer do you have to lobby the HTML WG for changes
  to XHTML, we can simply write them ourselves.
  What I am suggesting is that we write a "new" module that can be added to
  XHTML. This module could change XHTML to make it more acessible. As stated
  before, we could remove presentational elements, add in new semantic ones,
  put in RDF, and at a stretch change the content model if need be.
  Why do I believe that this is the domain of the ERT group? Becuse of the
  name: WAI Evaluation and Repair Tools group. I see this module as being a
  repair for the inaccessible features of XHTML; it is an XHTML repair tool.
  It is one that we can write fully by ourselves, with little or no help
from
  the HTML WG - that is why they made m12n in the first place, so people
could
  change XHTML themselves: a sort of DIY XHTML!

  When the module is done, if people want to use our accessibility features,
  they can so so by using this bit of code as their DTD (what it does is mix
  our module with XHTML 1.1):-

       <!ENTITY % waiert10.mod
            PUBLIC "-//W3C//MODULE XHTML WAI ERT 1.0//EN"
                   "http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/waiert10.mod" >
       %waiert10.mod;
       <!ENTITY % xhtml11.dtd
            PUBLIC "-//W3C//XHTML 1.1//EN"
                   "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd" >
       %xhtml11.dtd;

  [Disclaimer: Please note that the FPI and system URI are only examples,
and
  don't imply W3C support for the modules or the URIs given (i.e. only
  intended for discussion).]
  The example I have listed above is only one example of what we could do
  using m12n. For a fuller list, visit
