Take them out? We want to add accessibility! I'm not actually sure how the
ERT group wants to proceed on using m12n to add accessibilty features, and
take away prsentation.

Good idea, but what would be even more helpful is actual examples. What
needs to be changed in 1.1/m12n to meet A/AA/AAA? Be as precise as you can,
and then I can try to work out if that's ever going to be doable.

Yeah, I know. We *could* write our own Schema language...
<element name="img">
<attribute mane="alt" content="textual alternative" type="required"/>
<attribute name="src" content="URI" type="required"/>
</element>
But that would be taking it a touch too far probably.

While that is impossible, it doesn't stop us working towards it. In fact the
real aim is: make 1.1/m12n/2.0 more accessible. There are a variety of ways
of going about that, and we need to fully investigate and use every single
one.

P1 && P2? What's that all about then?
