Only if we are talking about modification by addition. If we are talking
about constriction, then that is O.K.

Actually, I thought of breaking it down in to smaller .mod modules, and then
referencing it using entities into one driver .module file. Then people
could use the .mod's if they so wished. That the whole purpose of m12n:
break it all up as much as possible.

That's what I plan to do!

Apparently, it's either a PF thing, or a multi WG task force. I think the
ERT group can do it...the whole point of m12n is that *anyone* should be
able to use it fairly easily.

The CG people remain a mystery to me...I'm trying to stay out of the
politics.
