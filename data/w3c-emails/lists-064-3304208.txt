To:w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org, web Content Accessibility Guidelines<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>

As a possible clarification of the purpose and method by which indexing 
will enable the so-called "Semantic Web" I found this quote from Tim 
Berners-Lee that points towards what we might do:

"The concept of machine-understandable documents does not imply some magical
artificial intelligence which allows machines to comprehend human mumblings.
It only indicates a machine's ability to solve a well-defined problem by
performing well-defined operations on existing well-defined data. Instead of
asking machines to understand people's language, it involves asking people to
make the extra effort"


The "extra effort" that we're calling for is to produce "well-defined 
data". The payback for the extra effort is what all my "mumblings" about 
including metadata in stuff published on the Web have been about. Making 
stuff machine-accessible will make accessibility much more achievable. That 
a Semantic Web's possibility is enhanced by the principles in the 
guidelines and the tools we furnish to assure their implementation is 
clear. As the immortal Charles "Yardbird" Parker wrote "Now Is the Time!"
