I agree with Al -- I think the changing nature of the web means that many
of the assumptions which were made in 1997 need to be re-evaluated and
perhaps reorganized.  I don't see WAI having a good structure for dealing
with the challenges of the 21st century.

I think we've also seen this in the discussion regarding guidelines for
design of XML languages (vs. the use of existing guidelines) in/around
the WCAG group.  We'll need to bring some good minds to bear on how to
solve the questions raised by widespread XML use, an issue that the WAI
has previously devoted little energy towards.  (I do note the WAI note
about XML accessibility, just so nobody feels left out!)
