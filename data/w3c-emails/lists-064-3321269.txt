Dear folks,

we have been offered thursday and friday 1-2 march at the W3C working groups
plenary session for face to face meetings, which will be in Boston, USA.

We had asked for one day together and one day each on our own.

Are these days OK with everyone?

If not, please let me know this week so I can free the space for other
groups.

Cheers
Charles McCN
