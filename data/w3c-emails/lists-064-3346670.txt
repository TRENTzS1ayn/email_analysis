Yes, there is still the caveat: <head xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
profile="[...]"> doesn't mean anything at the moment becase there is no
schema for it, although that doesn't stop us writing one (see quick example
[1]) and importing
it into the namespace (especially as it is a unique attribute).
Really, we need to be able to either:-
1. Embed RDF into the file in the first place
2. Link to it using XLink or some other XML reference technology. Using
<head profile="[...]">, <meta> or <link> isn't good enough for XML
processors which haven't got a clue what they should do when they run across
them.

[1] Took about 5 seconds cutting and pasting stuff into this, so don't
assume correctness(!) In fact, this still doesn't tell processors to grok
the profile target [@@need to tie this into the XLink namespace somehow]:-
