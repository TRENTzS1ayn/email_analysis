I suppose I meant SW processors. It will be aborogated when definitions of
how to process XHTML are written. I haven't even written a Schema yet for
the example of using profile, so it isn't really valid (i.e. makes too much
sense) yet. See [1]

It can, but by a hybrid XHTML/RDF processor only...

I suppose, but the more independant a system is, the nore you need to
describe it. Something that is mainstream takes less describing. [1] If you
want to continue using this "ADL predecessor" you could use a similar set of
elements to what you have right there on your example site at the moment,
but just bag them instead:-
glname e.g. "W3C WAI WCAG"
glversion e.g. "1.0"
gluri e.g. "http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10"
level e.g. "AAA"
proselevel e.g. "Triple A"
comment e.g. "This site conforms to the W3C's WAI WCAG 1.0 Guidlines at the
Triple A (AAA) conformance level"
This would be easier to write an RDF Schema for. Do you want me to proceed
and write an RDF Schema for it?

You know me, I like to proceed with caution!
