Write away! Remember that "right away" is more important than being "way 
right". I notice that rdf-interest (don't know about the *real* rdf group) 
is involved in parsing the difference between "statements" and "statings" 
and deciding whether an instance can have more than one...

I still remember from Brisbane a panel "chiding" Tim Berners-Lee (who was 
on the panel) for not including all the possible magic features of 
hypertext when he started all this. We'd still be waiting. By insisting on 
doing something (even if it's less than perfect), I hope to raise awareness 
of the importance of indexing - right now.

Unless there's a genuine *fatal flaw* in having a separate profile 
resource, I can't see why we need to wait much.
