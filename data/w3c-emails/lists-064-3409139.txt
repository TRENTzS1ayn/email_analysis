Do we really need to define a module to put RDF into XHTML?  I ask 
because  the RDF FAQ http://www.w3.org/RDF/FAQ#How gives an example of 
including the Dublin Core in HTML.  The example in the FAQ inserts the 
following into the head:

quote
><rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
>          xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/">
>   <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://doc"
>       dc:creator="Joe Smith"
>       dc:title="My document"
>       dc:description="Joe's ramblings about his summer vacation."
>       dc:date="1999-09-10" />
></rdf:RDF>
end of quote

So it seems like it's covered, or, if that FAQ has gotten ahead of 
implemention and/or specs, I'd expect RDF or XHTML folks are on to it already.

Also, to give compliance, do we really want to have both level and prose 
level? Seems redundant.  How would we interpret level A and proselevel 
double A?  How about just "level", and rely on style sheets to display 
it?  Also, how about making level a number, i.e. 1,2,3 corresponding to 
single, double, triple A.  Friendlier for screenreaders than A, AA, AAA, 
and also conveneient for arithmetic logic.
