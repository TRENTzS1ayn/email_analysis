Try putting that excerpt in an XHTML 1.0/1.1 file and validating it at
http://validator.w3.org/ It won't validate because other namespaces are not
catered for in the specifications. m12n provides a way out assuming that the
W3C will never define an RDF module for the 1999 XHTML namespace, and even
then it's up to someone to write a module for it. (Of course, I've already
written one for Dublin Core, but it doesn't quite cover all of DC 1.1 yet).

The purpose of RDF is it's machine readibility (it wasn't meant to be
displayed), but it should be able to be readily converted into a display
format using XSLT. The RDF language (SubADL) that I published to the list
last night wasn't intended to be the default language for WCAG compliance
assertions: that is up to this group to develop. Rather, it was an example
for Mr. Loughborough to use on his page, and also constitutes a global
guideline assertion langauge: adding proselevel might not be useful in
asserting WCAG validity, but it might be in some other instances.
In summation, it was just a case of me getting bored and hacking up a short
RDF example. I only CC'd it to the list because I thought it might help in
the development of ADL!

The great thing about both RDF and m12n is that they are developers
langauges and very easy to write: i.e. anyone (to a point!) should be able
to do it, and if not then the languages have failed in their purposes. Of
course that also enables groups like ourselves to come up with useful
materials conforming to W3C standards *very* quickly indeed...
