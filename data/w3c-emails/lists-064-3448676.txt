Thanks Sean.

So if we wind up using RDF we'll want to suggest to the the RDF and/or 
XHTML groups that include RDF in XHTML., so we can make as much as possible 
what we need general use "business as usual".   And since like I say the 
RDF folks already claim it can be used in HTML I expect they'll want to do 
that.  What do you think?

By the way,  are there any current links to the definition of m12n?  It 
seems to be used as a synonym for XHTML modularization.  But when I search 
for it on w3c I just get

- email from the mailing lists, where they assume everybody knows what it 
means, or

- pages such as the XHTML modularization spec [1]... but when I actually 
look at the specs returned by the search, m12n isn't mentioned.  Is this a 
piece of jargon that used to be in specs but isn't there anymore?   Or is 
there actually an official, current w3c reference that defines it?  I sure 
couldn't find any.
