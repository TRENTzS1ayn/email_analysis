It would indeed be reasonable for rdf:about to default to "self", at least 
when in the <head> of an HTML or XHTML document, but I don't see that in 
the spec http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/#basic

All I can see there is that omitting "about" creates an in-line resource 
(to which an ID can be attached).

end quote

(A useful construct if you want to talk about something that doesn't have a 
URI by the way).

Do we need to suggest this to the RDF folks?  Maybe make this part of the 
semantics of the RDF module for XHTML you were suggesting, viz:

"An RDF descritpion, in the <head> of an HTML or XHTML document,  that has 
no rdf:about, refers to the document in which it's contained"
