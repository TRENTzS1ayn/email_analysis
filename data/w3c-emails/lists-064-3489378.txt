Note that in my XSLT script for going from XHTML to RDF, I can automatically
update the rdf:about attribute as an xsl parameter:

It might be a very good idea to bring that up on RDF IG,but the best
strategy is for us all to try to rid RDF of these "hacks" for inclusions
into XHTML (yes, we all have to use them for now, even me; but in future
we'll want to add RDF straight into XHTML, I'm pretty certain of that).
