Sean,

What do you think would be a good hack-free way for an RDF statement in an 
XHTML file to refer to the file itself?

For example what do you think of   rdf:about="#"

Hmmm.  If it refers to the whole file, it's referring to itself as 
well.  Is that a problem?

Does anyone else on this list know of work addressing this situation?

Len
