I still think that if there wasn't an rdf:about attribute in most cases that
would be adequate...:
     <p dc:title="My Paragraph">text</p>
You know that that dc:description is for the paragraph and not for some
other file...In XSLT you can simply use things like parameters if converting
stuff into RDF, but when embedding it is a bit more tricky.

> For example what do you think of   rdf:about="#"

That would look for a FragID with no content:
<p id=""/>
But I see what you mean. Maybe just rdf:about=""
However, if you have an RDF statement embedded in that page, I still believe
that it would be assumed that the statement was for that page *unless* the
rdf:about attribute was set saying otherwise.
[[[
A Description element without an about attribute represents a new resource.
Such a resource might be a surrogate, or proxy, for some other physical
resource that does not have a recognizable URI. The value of the ID
attribute of the Description element, if present, is the anchor id of this
"in-line" resource.
]]] - http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/
That means it's a new resource within whatever resource location it's in
doesn't it? So use rdf:ID's to anchor the statement within a document if you
must have an anchor for it... I remember somebody else saying they had
problems with rdf:about so they just ignored them...
If need be, why not just use server side scripting to make sure that the
rdf:about vlaue is always for that particular page or just take care when
creating files and making new URI's.

No, metadata doesn't have to describe itself as well (well, you have schemas
for that).
