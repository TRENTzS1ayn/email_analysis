To:<w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org>

That list of URIs I said I'd send:-
http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/ - Tim Berners-Lee's WWW Design Issues [very
important]
http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Semantic.html - TimBL, Semantic Web Roadmap
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax - RDF Model and Syntax Rec.
The W3C Homepage has this tag:-
<head profile="http://www.w3.org/2000/08/w3c-synd/#">
I suggest that http://www.w3.org/2000/08/w3c-synd/# is a good resource for
learning about that topic.
http://www.mysterylights.com/xhtmltordf/ - My XHTML to RDF processor
http://rdf.pair.com/rdfprofile.xml - Mr. Loughborough's RDF Site Profile:
includes an accessibility assertion (in it's own namespace)

http://www.w3.org/2000/01/sw - The W3C's Semantic Web Development home
http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Logic.html - Logic and the Semantic Web
Somebody asked about inference in RDF; I suggest this page
http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Rules.html and also the Notation3
(http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Notation3) RDF type system.
http://rdfweb.org/ - A Semantic Web Example
http://www.xml.com/pub/2000/11/01/semanticweb/index.html - The Semantic Web:
A Primer
RDF Applications:-
http://purl.org/rss/1.0/ - RSS (RDF Site Summary)
http://purl.org/DC/ - Dublin Core. Not just an element set! (O.K., it is...)
http://www-diglib.stanford.edu/diglib/ginf/sirpac.html - SIRPAC, an RDF
Processor

Common abbreviations:-
RDF - Resource Description Framework
SW - Semantic Web
m12n - Modularization (of XHTML)

My neat little SW Overview:-
The Semantic Web is a vision of the creator of the WWW, Tim Berners-Lee, who
describes the SW as "a web of data that can be processed directly or
indirectly by machines". Further to that, I would say The Semantic Web is a
machine processble self describing web of extensible dynamic languages. It
is logic based, but essentially provides a huge database of Semantically
marked up information, ready for output (which should itself be Semantic).
This fully machine processable Web environment will be self-describing,
easily searchable, and ultimately dynamic. It is, in a way, the next step to
the World Wide Web.
Also, the SW has been described thus: "The Semantic Web is a Web that
includes documents, or portions of documents, describing explicit
relationships between things and containing semantic information intended
for automated processing by our machines." -
http://www.w3.org/1999/04/WebData
I agree that these descriptions don't clear up the mystery all that much,
but the fact is theat the fuzziness and ambiguity of the SW has been a
primary feature ever since its inception in 1998. In fact, if we look futher
back in time to the creation of the WWW, we see that the plans for the SW
are very close to the original plans for the WWW; you could say that the SW
is the ideal aim of the WWW.
There are a few technologies being developed for the Semantic Web: RDF, RDF
Schemas, XML Schemas, and of course XML. To some extent, XSLT comes into
play as well. In short, the SW will be a Web of metadata, logic and proof
validations...
