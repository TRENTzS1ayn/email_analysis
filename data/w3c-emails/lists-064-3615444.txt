This tool mostly exists, if you are happy to use the W3C annotation service
(except that the server for the annotations is temproary so it will lose the
annotations). Alternatively, what is required could probably be implemented
in a piece of javascript for a tool like dreamweaver or golive.

As an authoring tool amaya allows you to put annotations where you like (for
example with the document on your own server, so it is only a case of having
an annotation that specifically includes the bit of RDF you are looking for -
that is next on the development agenda.

  At the risk of this proposal being "out of scope" I would propose that we
  encourage (or perform) development of a simple tool that inserts into an
  XHTML file an assertion that the author (whose email is xxx@yyy) claims a
  particular level of conformance to WCAG 1.0 and that the document has been
  tidied, validated, and personally checked with available tools to enable
  this assertion  on our beloved "Web of Trust".

  Although, in theory, the mere placement of a certain logo on the page might
  enable one to locate files bearing such claims, the use of RDF for this
  purpose makes possible a much finer potential availability of this
  assertion as well as freeing one from the obligation to have the site bear
  a certain "appearance" - as well as the problem with "image text" in the
  currently recommended logo.
