I just read the "Notes On Making Classes Accessible" document. I haven't had
so much fun reading a W3C related "product" since m12n went to CR [but for
opposite reasons!] :-)
Still, I did have one quibble:-
[[[
The question remains: how to associate title with class.
It could be done via RDF.  For example, to associate the title "priority 1
checkpoint" with p1
<rdf:RDF>
    xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.organizations/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
    xmlns:s="http://www.w3.organizations/class titles/">
    <rdf:Description about="http://www.w3.organizations/wai-classes/p1">
      <s:title>Priority 1 checkpoint </s:title>
    </rdf:Description>
  </rdf:RDF>
]]] - http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/classuse.html

This RDF example doesn't quite make sense...even the RDF namespace is
incorrect for some reason (and it doesn't parse on SiRPAC [1]). Anyway, the
notion is a valid one, and it got me wondering what the best way to
associate classes with "titles" using RDF is. Hence I came up with this
little bit of RDF:-

<rdf:RDF
   xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
   xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#">
  <rdf:Description rdf:about="[@class='p1']">
    <rdfs:label>Priority 1 Checkpoint</rdfs:label>
    <rdfs:isDefinedBy
       rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/#priorities" />
  </rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>

Now, try going to SiRPAC [1] and pasting that little bit of code in, and it
gives you a nice response with RDF graphs and so on. [I'd like to have
attached the image to this email, but I'm not sure what the status on
attachments is]. I have to admit that this is a pretty neat use of RDF.

[[[
However, from a practical point of view, it's simpler to say
    .p1 {title: "priority 1 checkpoint" }
]]] - ibid.

I agree that until the use of RDF becomes more widespread (and valid in
XHTML!) we need an alternative. Looking at this makes me wonder why you
don't use HTML titles, or at least:-

.p1:before { content: "<span title=\"Priority 1 Checkpoint\">"; }
.p1:after { content: "</span>"; }

But it would be nice to have some kind of description and comments mechanism
in CSS. Another good thing to have would be an 'alt' property (I think the
CSS & FP WG are considering that one). Lastly, it says in the document
"Users shall be able to choose any class and then step through all elements
of a particular title..."; could someone explain that for me (preferably
with examples)?

P.S. Here are the triples from my RDF example:-
triple('http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label',
       '[@class='p1']',
       'Priority 1 Checkpoint').
triple('http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#isDefinedBy',
       '[@class='p1']',
       'http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/#priorities').
