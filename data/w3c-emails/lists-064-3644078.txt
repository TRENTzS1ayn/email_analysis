I propose we copy the conformance section from WCAG 1.0 as a start on this.
(Note that this is an endorsement of that system, against the strawman put up
that had a simple yes/no scheme).

  Since it is on the agenda then we might want to recommend that WCAG 2.0
  provide a spot for it in the guidelines?

  Specifically that there be a "placeholder" sort of thing that deals with
  making a conformance assertion in order to be conformant?
