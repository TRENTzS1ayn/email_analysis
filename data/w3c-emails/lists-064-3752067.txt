I like to think there aren't cases where an absolute size is needed. A quasi
exception is things like image width and height that accept only pixel
measurements (appropriately given the nature of images). Especially with
tables, I use percentage sizes if I want it to scale, and no sizes if I want
it to stay as small as it can on the basis of its contents. I have been
known to sneak in a transparent image if I wanted to impose at least a
minimum size on a table cell though...

On forms - I think if a table is being used to lay out a form, the scaling
of the table shouldn't affect layout aside from adding whitespace. The
author does need to be aware of potential font size scaling impacts on the
form layout, so if the table can accommdate that, it shouldn't need a size
constraint.

Frames is tricky - there certainly can be cases where it seems there is an
appropriate fixed width for a frame. But I think Charles is right that that
fixed width may not always work. I usually use a relative width that works
out to be close to the preferred width on most monitors, then make the frame
resizable so the user can correct if needed.

Could there be some cases where an absolute size in tables and framesets may
be appropriate?

An absolute size is OK if:

If the table contains a form - the author may not want the form layout to be
changed by a table changing size.
If the table column or frame contains images (navigation buttons for
example) that are a set size - the other table columns or frames may change
size but the column containing the images should stay put.
If the entire table or frameset size is less than 640 X 480 pixels - this
will fit on the lowest resolution monitor.
