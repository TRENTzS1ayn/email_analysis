I think the problem is that the HTML spec does not define relative units for
table borders. The "em" unit does not exist anywhere at all in HTML - only
in CSS. The only measurement units available in HTML are pixel sizes,
percent sizes, and a number from 0 to 7 to represent font size. Of those,
the table border attribute only accepts the pixel size. I'm surprised
browsers were able to do anything with an unrecognized attribute value type,
but am not surprised that they pretend it's a pixel measurement.

What I've begun experimenting with is I'll use a pixel measurement for a
table's border attribute, one that seems like it will work in most
situations, for backward compatibility. Then I also apply a stylesheet that
uses a relative measurement, such as an em. That trick has worked in Opera
and I think IE but not in Netscape. By worked, I mean, if I scale up the
font size, the border thickness scales too.

I just tried a test table with Netscape 4.7 and IE5. Both browsers exhibit
the same behaviour.

Any table border size 1em or less shows up the same as a 1 pixel border,
independent of the document font size.
A table border of 2em displays the same as a 2 pixel border, independent of
the document font size.
A table border of 3em displays the same as a 3 pixel border, independent of
the document font size.

So it appears that the browsers ignore the relative 'em' size and convert
the border to an absolute number.
