Hello participants of WAI PF and ER.

After some chair discussions, I'd like to announce that our next
face-to-face meeting will be joint, and held in the Washington DC area 
Monday December 4th and Tuesday December 5th (first day focused on Er, 
second on PF).

The registration page will be up shortly and the host will be
announced later.

This is piggy backed onto the XML2000 conf in Washington DC (from 4th
to 
8th).
