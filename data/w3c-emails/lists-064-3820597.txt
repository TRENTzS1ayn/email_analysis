Next telecon:

Monday Oct 9, 10:00-11:30 Eastern USA Time (GMT -05:00) on the MIT bridge 
(+1 617-258-7910).

Agenda:

- Report back from people attending device independent workshop

- AERT open issues

Checkpoint 6.2 - Ensure that equivalents for dynamic content are updated 
when the dynamic content changes
(cf http://www.w3.org/TR/AERT#frame-has-html-src)

How do we verify that equivalent changes?
even if equivalent changes, do current agents pick it up?  E.g. if ALT text 
of image changes with image on focus event, does user get informed (we may 
need to ask GL for clarification)

Checkpoint 3.3 - Use style sheets to control layout and presentation
Do we really want to advise people to use style sheets for layout?

Cf. CSS bug list of positioning at 
http://www.richinstyle.com/bugs/table.html . Also, example at 
http://astro.temple.edu/~kasday/wai/css-em.html shows that text can overlap 
when enlarged even when ems are used.
