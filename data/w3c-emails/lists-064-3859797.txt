If anyone tried to read this and found that it was forbidden, that is no
longer the case.
If anyone hasn't tried to read it yet, please do so well before the meeting
on Tuesday

  This fulfills my action item to write up the discussion from the AU WG f2f 
  last Saturday.
  
  I propose that we discuss this at the join AU and ER meeting on 
  Tuesday.  The questions that need to be answered:
  1. Do people agree this is a good direction to move in?
  2. If yes, who needs to do what to make it happen?
  3. What communication mechanisms need to be in place for the ERT WG to feed 
  info into the document if it is being maintained by AU WG?  What will AU be 
  relying on ERT to do?
  
  Other questions?
