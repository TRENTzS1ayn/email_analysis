William,

There's now a way to add a Wave link to Opera, similar to the wave buttons 
on NN and MSIE.

See http://www.temple.edu/inst_disabilities/piat/wave/operasc.html

It lets you browse to any page in opera... then you just select the Wave 
link off the "Lists" menu and it runs the page through the wave.

Thanks for asking.  That brings us up 1/100 of a release point to Wave 2.01.

Now on to more items in the wish list....

Len
