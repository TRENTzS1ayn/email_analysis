I looked at Wendy's mapping [1].  It is a good job of comparing WCAG 1.0
with 2.0.  However, tools generally check things that are technology
specific, so I propose to be more productive that we start with the
technology specific checklists and identify those that can be checked [or
are actually implemented] by a tool.  This could be done by  mapping ATAG
and ERT [5] against the technology specific checklists[2].  The problem
with [2] is that I don't think it is complete enough yet to do the mapping.
Perhaps more useful would be to take the new TECHNOLOGY SPECIFIC TECHNIQUES
[3] and map them to the 1.0 vs 2.0 mapping, then add the mapping of ERT and
ATAG tool/machine checks.  The new gateway techniques document [4] does the
mapping already to 1.0, but what I haven't seen yet is the mapping to the
proposed 2.0.

Wendy, could you add to your mapping document [1] three columns "CORE,
HTML, CSS" that come from [3] and [4]?

This may end up being a WIDE table, but the analysis will be useful.  Look
what Wendy found just mapping 1.0 to 2.0 (See [1]).
