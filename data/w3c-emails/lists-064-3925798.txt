I think we need to focus on "what checks" a tool can make, not "which
checkpoints" can by checked by a tool.  The problem with the latter being
explained by Len.  I see this task as simply mapping the existing
documented checks in ERT to the 1.0 vs 2.0 mapping, or as I proposed in a
separate note, a technology specific checklist that maps to 1.0 vs 2.0.

Phill
