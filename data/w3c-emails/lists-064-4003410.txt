It was great to have Tim present at the joint ER/AU meeting tuesday.  I was 
happy to hear that the ERT document was useful in your product 
development.   Will one of you be at our Monday ER meeting?
(Monday 1/23, 10:00-11:30 Eastern USA Time (GMT -05:00) on the MIT bridge 
(+1 617-258-7910).

If so could we hear about your approach?  This is short notice of course, 
and if you can't make it, how about a meeting in the future?
