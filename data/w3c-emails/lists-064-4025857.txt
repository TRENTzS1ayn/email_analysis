William,

I updated the text Opera instructions

http://www.temple.edu/inst_disabilities/piat/wave/operasc.html

(the screenshot still shows opera 3.62 but the description of how to add a 
Wave link to opera reflects version 4).

This is a javscript link: if you browse to a page the usual way in Opera 
then simply selecting the link should run your page thru the Wave.

Please tell me if it's working for you now.

Len
