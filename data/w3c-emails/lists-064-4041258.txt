We have been working on a means of storing the accessibility evaluation of
an HTML document. Our current approach is to store the evaluation in an XML
document. The XML doc contains the original HTML with any accessibility
problems marked with new XML elements. For example, the following snippet
contains the evaluation of an IMG element that is missing the 'alt'
attribute:

<problem problemName="MISSING_IMG_ALTTEXT" problemID="1234">
<![CDATA[ <img src="rex.jpg" longdesc="rex-desc.html">]]>
</problem>

The XML file that contains the above evaluation is attached to this message.

Each accessibility problem is given a code number so it may be referenced.

A report tool can take the XML document and prepare a report of
accessibility problems.

A repair tool can take the entire document, or pieces of the document, make
repairs then update the original XML document.

The original XML document can be easily converted back to HTML by XSLT or a
simple program.

If the group can agree on a set of specifications then all tool makers can
generate and use the same XML evaluation document.
