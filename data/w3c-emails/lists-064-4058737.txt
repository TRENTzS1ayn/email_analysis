What do you propose to do when the sections of original-HTML hypertext that
give rise to the problem assertions overlap?

Did you consider using X-Path to mark ranges in the source, and leave the
source in a separate file?? [You would have to first tidy the HTML into XHTML
1.0 so the X-Paths are well posed, but that works, doesn't it (I mean tidy)?]

Did you consider using RDF for the problem assertions?

If we are going to interleave problems and original content in one XML
document, why not use namespaces to distinguish them, as opposed to burying
proper hypertext in PCDATA inlines?

This is not sustainable.? Use URI references to AERT clauses, using an URL for
the AERT which is specfic to a dated version thereof.

The early points are aesthetic, questions of highest-and-best use of XML.

The final point [URI-references for identification of the problem] is a must.?
I would want three good reasons before I fought this one all the way to the
Director's desk.? This is in Tim's eyes the capstone principle of the Web.?
You
don't take the dictionary of error cases private by using an opaque, private
numbering scheme where there is a Web-compatible means to identify them by
reference to the WAI utterance where they are authoritatively defined.
