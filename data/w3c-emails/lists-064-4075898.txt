AFAIK IE5/Mac is the only shipping browser that _does_ support OPTGROUP per
the spec.  Here is a page (using examples from the HTML4 spec) which
demonstrates this.

http://www.tantek.com/HTML4/OPTGROUP.html

It is true that previous versions (4.5, 4.0, 3.0 etc.) of IE/Mac did not
support OPTGROUP.

If you have a valid HTML page that uses OPTGROUP which has problems in
IE5/Mac, please forward me the URL so that I may see if I can do something
about it.

I'm sorry to hear that that was your experience, as we believe we have fully
implemented HTML4 - first to do so.  If you could forward any other
problematic URLs of valid HTML4, I would appreciate it.

Thanks,

Tantek
