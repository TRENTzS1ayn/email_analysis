This is a simple project that is designed for 3 year olds and not accessible
to wai standards.
Frankly I feel it would be a waste of time to produce a text based example,
though blind users require similar encouragement.

However what efforts are being made to provide a graphical means of browsing
the web?
interactive video is not what I am describing.
