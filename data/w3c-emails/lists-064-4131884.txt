Not in Opera 4.02 (drag/drop doesn't work) or Netscape 6.3 (only the first 
shape loads and nothing further happens). In MSIE 5.5 it works as 
advertised although the window size is frozen (unlike in Opera). This is 
not atypical of problems facing people creating real stuff. It led to the 
old "get a real browser" annoyances and now makes using CSS a 
mini-nightmare. Oh, well!
