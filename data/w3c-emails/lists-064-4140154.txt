Apologies all, I am in the midst of trying to ship a version 2.1 of our
evaluation tool.   I spent all week staring at the XML violation export code
and thinking about how best to capture the data.  I should be able to put
together a decent post on this subject before the end of the week.

I've heard from Tim Springer that SSB uses an XML doc in their evaluation
process and he will post some details to the list. Maybe there will be some
new ideas there too.

We're thinking of using attributes for each problem type, like:

<problem missing_alt_text="yes" missing_longdesc="yes" problem_id="1234">
<![CDATA[ <img src="rex.jpg">]]>
</problem>

(Note: this is different from my original example.)

No we haven't considered this. We wanted the evaluation and the original
document in the same file so they wouldn't get out-of-sync with each other.
(I'm not familiar with x-path. Can you give me a link to some info?)

We're thinking about it. There has been some work and discussion on using
RDF for this purpose on the list. Creating attributes to define the problem
was the easiest thing to get going.

I think you have misunderstood the purpose of the code number. The code
number is only relative to the particular document. It's used to refer to a
particular problem. For example: A repair tool is fed problem "1234" from
the evaluation document. The repair tool fixes the problem and returns some
text and the problem number "1234". The evaluator knows to replace the text
in problem "1234" with the new text.

I think that you may be referring to our problem type attribute (example
missing_alt_text="yes"). These directly map to the AERT document and we
could use AERT technique numbers instead of text strings.
