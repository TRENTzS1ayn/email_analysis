Censors?  Advertises.

For related capabilities, check out participants in research meetings on
"Image
and gesture analysis."

Cataloguing (indexing and describing) the images of the whole Web is a project
that I have toyed with proposing to Entropia as part of their cause marketing

something you just wouldn't think you could do until they come on the
scene, so
they win twice.
