Hi - thanks for the follow-up. Your example helped me to see what was going
on. The LABEL attribute of OPTGROUP is required, which is what I hadn't seen
before. When I removed that from your example, I could replicate the problem
I experienced. I'll make the appropriate changes on our web site - in a week
or less I hope it will be up at www.cast.org. It is great to see an OPTGROUP
actually implemented.

Since IE5/Mac supports HTML 4 completely, could you describe to me how it
supports the LONGDESC attribute? It wasn't obvious to me - I was thinking it
might appear as an option in the context menu for the image ("View
description" that would pop up a small window, more than a tooltip but less
than a full browser window). I'd love to see a graphical browser that
supports that, I think the LONGDESC attribute could provide major benefits
to users who can see images but need a supplementary description (beyond ALT
text) to understand it. This comes of course from my perspective working in
an educational organization.

Michael

AFAIK IE5/Mac is the only shipping browser that _does_ support OPTGROUP per
the spec.  Here is a page (using examples from the HTML4 spec) which
demonstrates this.

http://www.tantek.com/HTML4/OPTGROUP.html

It is true that previous versions (4.5, 4.0, 3.0 etc.) of IE/Mac did not
support OPTGROUP.

If you have a valid HTML page that uses OPTGROUP which has problems in
IE5/Mac, please forward me the URL so that I may see if I can do something
about it.

I'm sorry to hear that that was your experience, as we believe we have fully
implemented HTML4 - first to do so.  If you could forward any other
problematic URLs of valid HTML4, I would appreciate it.

Thanks,

Tantek
