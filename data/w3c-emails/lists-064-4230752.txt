Tim,

Thanks much for your proposal!  Here's  couple of intitial reactions

First, a minor practical note: Would you resend the xml attachment with the 
suffix changed to .txt ?  Otherwise, I get a browser error when I try to 
open it (browser insists on an XSL stylesheet).

Very good point about difficulty of "repair" when the content is generated 
programmatically.

As far as your note that combining the violations with the source creates 
problems of re-ordering, because of lack of functionality with XSLT and 
XPATH.  Could that be handled with a separate filter (e.g. Perl using 
XML::Parser)?

There's the other method of pointing into the source with XPATH, like Al 
mentioned.   Would these be semantically equivalent, e.g. you could convert 
form one into another?  Or are there some fundamental differences in 
capabilities from those schemes?
