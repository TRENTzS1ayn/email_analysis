Monday, Oct. 30, 10:00-11:30 Eastern USA Time (GMT -05:00) on the MIT 
bridge (+1 617-258-7910).

Agenda:

Evaluation Results in XML, per recent discussion on the list.
     - how to link evaluation to document: Interleave evaluation results in 
source?  Put evaluation in separate file and point into document via 
XPath?  Via Line Number?  Via added pseudo-id attribute?
     - how do these methods hold up when part of document changes, or parts 
are re-arranged?
     - where to maintain text describing violations? Individual tool 
makers?  W3C?  If W3C, which group: er or wcag?
     - Do "evaluation results in XML" cover saving the state of a document?

WCAG 2.0.  We all had an action item to look at what checkpoints could be 
determined automatically.  This discussion may need to be brief, given the 
first item.

I anyone has other agenda items please post to the list.
