Leonard -
I have inlined the two documents (see below).  This should be a LCD (Lowest
Common Denominator) for transmission.  If you would like the originals I
have put them up at the following URLS:
http://www.ssbtechnologies.com/software/ssb_report.txt
http://www.ssbtechnologies.com/software/ssb_report_proposed.txt
The mime type will be set to text however IE will render them as XML.

Hope that helps!

Tim,

Thanks much for your proposal!  Here's  couple of intitial reactions



Very good point about difficulty of "repair" when the content is generated
programmatically.

As far as your note that combining the violations with the source creates
problems of re-ordering, because of lack of functionality with XSLT and
XPATH.  Could that be handled with a separate filter (e.g. Perl using
XML::Parser)?

There's the other method of pointing into the source with XPATH, like Al
mentioned.   Would these be semantically equivalent, e.g. you could convert
form one into another?  Or are there some fundamental differences in
capabilities from those schemes?
