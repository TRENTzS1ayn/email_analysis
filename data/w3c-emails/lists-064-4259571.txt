Leonard,

I don't appreciate your distinction.

Perhaps you could elaborate?

Re graphical means to browse the web.     Are you asking
- what to do to help a non-reader find sites that would interest him or her?
- Or what to do to help him or her navigate the site once he or she gets
there?

---

My point remains that whilst there is not enough suitable graphical material
on the web, the far more serious problem is the lack of an animated
graphical browsing interface(including a search facility), that links these
materials.

The nearest I have as a proposal, is hopefully what svg promises, and
something like java/flash but with links to external sites, but without the
'lurching' or stop-go currently encountered.
