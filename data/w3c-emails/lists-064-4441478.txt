Makes sense to me to not check A elements for valid text, given that an
image with ALT text would be acceptable. However, we would need then to
perform the validation on the image's ALT text that we might otherwise
perform on textual content of an A element, like forbidding "Click here". As
you say, that's covered under 13.1.1 but we'd need to be sure it's stated
that it includes validating ALT text, or any other form of textual
equivalent inside an A element.

I suggest we remove technique 1.1.11 - "Check A elements for valid text
content" for the following 2 reasons:

1) This does not really fall under guideline 1 "Provide a text equivalent
for every non-text element".
2) It's covered by technique 13.1.1 "Verify that the target of each link is
clearly identified"

OK?

Chris
