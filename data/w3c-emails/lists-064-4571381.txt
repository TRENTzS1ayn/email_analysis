  Next meeting Monday, 10:00-11:30 Eastern USA Time (GMT -05:00) on the MIT bridge (+1 617-258-7910).

  Agenda

  Three items, described below

  Charter
  Open AERT issues, especially how to write assertions about accessibility in machine readable form
  Feeback on WAVE 2.0

  ==============================

  First Agenda Item: Charter (draft new charter at http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/erwg-charter-20000531.html )

  - It's going to be one group again, just "ER Working Group", no longer any distinction between ER IG and ER WG

  Mission.
  Judy Brewer wrote:
  ER WG: mission is unclear, some of it sounds more like the impact the group
  wants to have on the field, rather than the scope of work that the group
  will take on. i think what the group actually does is more along the lines
  of developing techniques that describe how to evaluation and retrofit Web
  pages according to WCAG 1.0; reviewing evaluation, retrofitting, and
  transformation tools; tracking tools and related resources and maintaining
  reference links to these; developing a limited number of tools where no
  appropriate tools exist. also needs activity and history links, and needs a
  good explanation for that history (e.g. that this new ER WG merges the two
  previous ones, and links to those groups. By the way, might consider moving
  ER WG activity back up to /WAI/ER once this charter goes into effect, no?
  Does that make sense?)."

  Success.
  Judy wrote:
  ER WG: the stated success criteria are very impact-oriented, and only
  indirectly related to the actual work of the group -- how about some
  concrete ones that relate more directly to production of ER WG deliverables?

  Deliverables:
  Judy wrote:
  On
  the "related deliverables" to make the ER WG role clearer, I'd suggest
  stating simply: "Reviews of externally developed tools: review and provide
  feedback to developers of blah blah blah."


  -----------------

  Second Agenda Items: Open Issues on AERT http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/ert-open-issues.html

  Especially, How do we describe accessibility of a document in machine readable form?  This would include assertions that there are problems, or there are no problems... for web page as a whole or individual elements.
  E.g.

  1. Simply add a class to each checked element.  E.g. if an image has ALT text that has been validated by a human, write

     <IMG class="access:ok"  src= etcetera etcetera>

  2. Use RDF?  How? We need examples.  RDF was discussed at http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/minutes/20000807.html which inlucludes references.

  3. Other? E.g. meta tags?

  -----------------
  Third Agenda Item: The WAVE

  If there's time start giving suggestions for new version of the WAVE
  http://www.temple.edu/inst_disabilities/piat/wave/

  New Help Screens
  Now handles Frames, SSL.
  Provides icons for logical tags H1, H2, Lists,etc.  Also Access keys
  Warns of mouseovers, javascript popups
  Features "Add WAVE button to your browser"
