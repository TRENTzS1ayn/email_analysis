I took an action in today's meeting to rewrite the mission statement in the 
charter.  How's this?

The mission of the Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group (ER WG) is:
to make it easier for Web content developers to determine if a Web site is 
accessible and when it is not,
to make it easier for Web content developers to repair inaccessible Web sites.

The working group does this by maintaining a list of existing tools, 
developing new tools, and documenting techniques that tools may implement.

thanks,
