There's no such thing as "accessible or not".  Accessibility doesn't
exist in a vacuum -- this should either say "to which audiences the
site is accessible or inaccessible" or "if a Web site is in compliance
with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines."  I think the latter
phrase is closer to the work that's been done.

Hmm.  Still thinking about this one.

Thanks for doing this, Wendy, and getting the ball rolling!
