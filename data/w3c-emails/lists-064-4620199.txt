WAVE 2.0 is up and running at

http://www.temple.edu/inst_disabilities/piat/wave/

WAVE is an accessibility checker that focuses on helping humans make the 
myriad human judgments needed to properly judge accessibility, e.g. is ALT 
text appropriate for the image or area?  Is reading order sensible?  Are 
logical tags (Hx, UL, etc.) used appropriately?

It also does some automatic checks.

This version adds frames, ssl support, additional checks.
Also features a WAVE button that you can drag to your browser's link bar. 
Clicking this button will send whatever page you happen to be browsing 
through the WAVE.  You can then click through the site... provided the site 
doesn't get too fancy with javascript.

So please tell me what you think.
