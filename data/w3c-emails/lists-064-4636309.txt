Oh, there's a typo on the icon definition page (or you've coined a new 
word) "Alterative Applet" - should be "alternative" unless you mean an 
Applet that alters! My email spell checker didn't flag "alterative" so I 
posed it to an online dictionary - result:

Dictionary has no entry for alterative


Since earlier today I encountered "rain-runneled" I thought maybe this was 
a 2-new-words-in-the-vocabulary day. No such luck although I like 
"alterative" quite a bit.

2.0 also makes me feel good about my "guideline guide" site which I'd like 
you to look at: http://rdf.pair.com/guide.htm (any comments gratefully {and 
I hope gracefully} accepted).
