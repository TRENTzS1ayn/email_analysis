WL: I got to them OK but Opera has so many pre-empted keystrokes that I 
don't know if there's any point to <accesskey>. The listed keys do nothing. 
As to tabindex I think tabbing is just like it always is, goes to the next 
link. I think there'd have to be a lot of implementation before much can be 
determined.

This whole thing's going on my back burner. It's an unavailable solution 
looking for a so-far-undetected problem as far as I can determine at this 
time. Let's talk about something else.
