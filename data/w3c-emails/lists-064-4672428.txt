I suggest a slight rewording to sharpen the focus (new words between
asterisks):
"...make it easier for Web content developers to *test whether* Web content 
conforms..."

Kynn,

Good comment. The mission statement now reads,
<blockquote>
The mission of the Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group (ER WG) is:
to make it easier for Web content developers to determine if Web content 
conforms to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0,
to make it easier for Web content developers to repair Web content that 
does not conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0.

The working group does this by maintaining a list of existing tools, 
developing new tools, and documenting techniques that tools may implement.

This work is part of the WAI Technical Activity. The original charter for 
this group was approved June 1998.  This work continues the work of that 
charter as well as pieces from the Evaluation and Repair Interest Group 
charter.  The Interest Group no longer exists.

Does the above change alleviate your concerns for this one?
