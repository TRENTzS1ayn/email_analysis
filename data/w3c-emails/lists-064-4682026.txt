If clicking on a button or link invokes javascript to get the next page, 
the WAVE doesn't follow that link.  To get there you need to go to the page 
from the normal, un-waved site, and once you are at the page, click the 
"WAVE"button on your browser.  Or, if you haven't put a wave button on your 
browser, type the URL of the page into the wave entry form..

There's a complication if the site also uses frames though.  If javascript 
replaces just the contents of one frame, you have to open that frame in a 
new window, and then wave it via a button or the form.
