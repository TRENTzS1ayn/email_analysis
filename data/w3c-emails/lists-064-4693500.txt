"conforms to guidelines" is not exactly defined: what is defined is 
conforming to particular compliance levels, A, double A, triple A, or 
checkpoints.

How about adding word "checkpoints" so it reads like this:

The mission of the Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group (ER WG) is:
to make it easier for Web content developers to determine if Web content 
conforms to checkpoints in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0,
to make it easier for Web content developers to repair Web content that 
does not meet WCAG checkpoints.

This more obviously includes tools that focus on a subset of the 
checkpoints rather than the whole guidelines, e.g. tablin.
