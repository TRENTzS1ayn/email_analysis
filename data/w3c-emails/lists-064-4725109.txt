Re Williams note

>2.0 also makes me feel good about my "guideline guide" site which I'd like 
>you to look at: http://rdf.pair.com/guide.htm (any comments gratefully 
>{and I hope gracefully} accepted).

Yes, in addition to showing the alt text next to the icons for checking, 
Wave 2.0 shows where William used structural markup (H1, H2, UL....), so we 
can see that the page uses real headings and lists instead of HTML that 
merely looks like headings and lists.  And we can check that they are used 
the right way.

These are things that can't be checked automatically... at least not until 
we have computerized pattern recognition and artificial intelligence with 
common sense.

My only comment would be that people who aren't using screenreaders (or the 
WAVE) miss some information.  E.g. that icon showing a sailor at the wheel 
has alt text "your navigator to the WCAG guidelines".   A person who 
doesn't see the alt text doesn't know what that icon means.  It true that 
if they put the mouse there the alt text pops up, but they might not put 
the mouse there, and if they have a motor disability they never wind up 
putting the mouse there  (simply tabbing to a link doesn't pop up the alt 
text).

Same comment for most of the other icons.
