Hello,

The W3C management has been discussing a W3C All Activity Meeting.  Here is 
an excerpt from Janet Daly's message to the chairs sent 8 September 2000 [1].

<blockquote>
In summary, the proposal is for a three-day, all-activity meeting to which 
all W3C groups (Working/Interest/Coordination) would be invited. We plan to 
have
1.  meeting rooms available for face-to-face meetings
2.  plenary sessions open to all attendees
3.  space available for groups to meet each other, and exchange ideas
</blockquote>

The current timeframe under consideration is the last week of Februrary.

1. Would you be interested in attending a three-day multigroup/all activity 
meeting?  Would you want to piggyback a WG face to face meeting on one day 
either side of the multigroup/all activity meeting?

2. What content/structure would make this more appealing to you? What 
format would you prefer?

3. Which working groups or interest groups should we try to coordinate some 
meeting time with?  Particularly, are there groups outside of the WAI 
domain that you would like to see us discuss particular issues with?

4. Are you available the last week of February?

Thank you for your comments,
--wendy
