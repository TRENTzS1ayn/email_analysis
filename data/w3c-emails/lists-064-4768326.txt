Agenda (please post additional suggestions to the list)

1. Update from Wendy on the new WCAG

2. Open Issues

http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/ert-open-issues.html

notes:

- the Applet/Object open issue may actually be closed... will check before 
monday
- propose we skip how to indicate how warning has been checked for now...

- open issue that may create discussion
     - how to test that a alternative page (e.g. the infamous "text-only") 
is truly equivalent?

- another open issue that may create discussion:
       Should we delete the following two checks?
The first header element in the document must be H1
There must be only one H1 element in the document
