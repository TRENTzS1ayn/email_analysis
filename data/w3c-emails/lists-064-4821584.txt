Good approach... at least for fixed web pages, or for reporting on the 
status of a page at a particular time

Problem comes in if page has changed.  You do spot that via the hash (or do 
you mean checksum?).

But if a page does change, it would be useful to retain as much information 
as possible, not just say that the RDF no longer applies.  One way to do 
this is to make sure all elements have unique id's that do not get 
changed.   Or, if a checkpoint refers to a regions of a page, with many 
elements, that section should be wrapped in a <span> with a unique id.

Still have a problem if regions overlap instead of being nested.... hmmm... 
can  xpointer specify regions between two elements?
