I have updated the open issues list [1] with the resolutions from today:

1 issue was closed (# 10)
2 issues were added (#'s 43 and 44)

We now have 35 open issues, several of these rely on the WCAG WG.  I will 
add a pointer from their issues list to ours.

Please take a look through the open issues to determine if you think they 
have been closed or not, or if they need clarification.  Also, please read 
through the closed issues to make sure they are in fact closed and that the 
appropriate follow-up has been finished.

For example, issue #42. Attaching semantics to classes  had a lot of 
discussion on the WCAG list, but was it resolved?  Len - did you receive a 
satisfactory answer?  Seems to me it was still being discussed.
