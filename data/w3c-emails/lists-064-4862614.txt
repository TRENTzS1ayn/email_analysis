There is a canonical XML spec that could be used. And IDs are better than
checksums, since you can find them faster - comparing checksums element by
element isn't as good, just possible and saves human time. But  of course the
ids can also be changed (fragment identifiers aren't part of the URI in the
http transaction at the moment...)

  Yes. Neat.
  
  Only suggestion is would be to cannonicalize whitespace before doing 
  checksums.  E.g. replace all white space with exactly one space and omit 
  whitespace between > and <  .

  Yes, I realised that. The value of doing it over elements specified by
  xpointers is that you can also have a checksum for the particular elements,
  so you can figure out which of those are different, break the document down
  and up again keeping as much as is still fine.

     Good approach... at least for fixed web pages, or for reporting on the
     status of a page at a particular time
  
     Problem comes in if page has changed.  You do spot that via the hash (or do
     you mean checksum?).
  
     But if a page does change, it would be useful to retain as much information
     as possible, not just say that the RDF no longer applies.  One way to do
     this is to make sure all elements have unique id's that do not get
     changed.   Or, if a checkpoint refers to a regions of a page, with many
     elements, that section should be wrapped in a <span> with a unique id.
  
     Still have a problem if regions overlap instead of being nested.... hmmm...
     can  xpointer specify regions between two elements?
