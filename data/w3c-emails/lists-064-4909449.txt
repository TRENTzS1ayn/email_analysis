Could the 'border' attribute be an exception to this rule? It's a common
practice to use 1 or 2 for a table/image/frame border to indicate that there
should be some sort of thin line surrounding the object. If we do require a
relative measure for a border, what would it be? (I think that an 'em' or
'ex' would be too large to replace a 1 pixel border.)
