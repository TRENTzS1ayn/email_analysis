In my opinion the issue was not sufficiently resolved and while
I like Len a lot, I don't like his proposal. :)  I feel that
exposing the arbitrary inner workings of HTML and CSS to the
end user -- i.e. by identifying specific "classes" -- is a
very poor solution to the problem of poor semantics in HTML
code.  A better solution would be to increase the semantical
content of HTML markup, not try to modify CSS in the proposed
manner.
