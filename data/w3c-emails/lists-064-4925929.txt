My Checkpoint Checker http://rdf.pair.com/checker.htm now links to the ER 
tools list. I have also separate links to items within that list (at least 
Bobby) and would like feedback on what choices from the list might be 
appropriate, if any. The idea is to "filter" some of the tools as direct 
links from the Checker. If the WAVE has an icon that would work nicely.

Also if you have any "pet" Webliographic materials I would like the URIs 
for those as well.
