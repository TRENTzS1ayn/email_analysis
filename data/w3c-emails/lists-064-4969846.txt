Do ALL device specific event handlers (e.g. OnMouseOver) require replacement
with device independent handlers (e.g. OnFocus)?

Many pages use OnMouseOver to change the appearance of buttons on the page.
This is a small change in appearance and does not affect the functionality
of the page if it's missing. Should we require that these pages add an
OnFocus handler as well as the OnMouseOver?
