I think, and I'd guess this agrees with what Chris had in mind, that no, we 
don't need a mouseover replacement there.

This brings up another problem though.

What if an object already has both a mouseover and an onfocus event?  They 
are logically different after all.

Simply replacing the onmouseover with onfocus doesn't work in that case.
