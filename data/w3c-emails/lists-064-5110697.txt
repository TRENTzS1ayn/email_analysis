Hmmm. Now if we had links from each checkpoint to tools taht can be used for
that checkpoint, and information about each tool that said what checkpoints
it tests for, that would indeed be cool...

@@action Charles - this can be added to the tools database we already have.

  My Checkpoint Checker http://rdf.pair.com/checker.htm now links to the ER

  Bobby) and would like feedback on what choices from the list might be 
  appropriate, if any. The idea is to "filter" some of the tools as direct 
  links from the Checker. If the WAVE has an icon that would work nicely.
  
  Also if you have any "pet" Webliographic materials I would like the URIs 
  for those as well.
