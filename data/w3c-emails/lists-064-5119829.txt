.1 em is a good size. For someone who is using a very large fot so they can
see it, a 2px border may just disappear, but a .1 em border will still be
visible.

  Could the 'border' attribute be an exception to this rule? It's a common
  practice to use 1 or 2 for a table/image/frame border to indicate that there
  should be some sort of thin line surrounding the object. If we do require a
  relative measure for a border, what would it be? (I think that an 'em' or
  'ex' would be too large to replace a 1 pixel border.)
