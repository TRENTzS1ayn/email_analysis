WL: By Jove, I believe you've got it. Right at the moment I am hopeful that 
this little table entry to the checkpoints can wag the dog so that when one 
links from a checkpoint number in Checker the resulting location's links 
aren't SO repetetive - if that doesn't happen I'll have to do all the links 
within Checker. That however precludes the virtues of contiguity/lostness 
of the sort that enables discoveries of unintended information acquisition.
