Dan,

FYI I just added rfc2html.pl to our web accessibility evaluation and repair 
tool list at http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/existingtools.html.  Even though it's 
a special purpose filter for rfc's, I figured it could be a good starting 
point for people, esp. perl affectionados, needing to filter other 
standardized text  documents.   Plus of course, good for anyone who wants 
to make rfc's more accessible by adding structure to the raw text.
