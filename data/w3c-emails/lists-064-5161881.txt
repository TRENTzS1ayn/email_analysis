As I delve into http://rdf.pair.com/checker.htm I find that a main purpose 
might be to relate an evaluation tool specifically to each checkpoint in 
WCAG. As this list fills in it will then become possible to have some way 
to test every aspect of a document's accessibility.

IOW we should be looking for individual testing elements for every checkpoint.
