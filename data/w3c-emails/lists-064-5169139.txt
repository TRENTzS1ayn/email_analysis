If you look at http://rdf.pair.com/checker.htm#tab2 you will note that 
checkpoint 5.3 has logos preceding it that link to the core techniques, the 
html techniques, and the css techniques documents. For full impact there 
should also be an "evaluation tool logo" that links to an appropriate tool 
for testing whether the checkpoint has been satisfied.

For this to happen I need to find an appropriate tool for each (or at 
least, most) checkpoint.

Any candidates?
