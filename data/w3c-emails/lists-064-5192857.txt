Hello,

To help us keep track of which open issues we are currently addressing, I 
added a section at the top of the issues list called, "Issues we are 
currently addressing."  Currently, there are 3 issues in this list:
9. Author indications that a warning has been checked
30. Alternative pages
45. Detecting accessibility issues in scripts

These issues also appear in the full list of open issues.

Note that we closed issue #21 today, "header nesting."  However, there is a 
related issue that we are waiting on WCAG WG to address (issue #33 - only 
one heading per page).

I was impressed last week with the organization and efficiency of the Voice 
Browser Working Group.  One mechanism that seemed to work well is 
prioritizing open issues and tasks.  For example, which 10 issues from our 
issues list do we want to address before publishing our next working draft? 
I propose at least the current 3.  Perhaps they are enough?

When do we want to publish our next working draft?  Our last public working 
draft is from 26 April 2000.  We were aiming to publish another one in 
July, but we've obviously missed that.  Do we feel we are ready to publish 
the current draft as a public working draft?  Could everyone give it a good 
read to look for typos and obvious errors that we don't want to release 
publicly?

thanks,
--wendy
