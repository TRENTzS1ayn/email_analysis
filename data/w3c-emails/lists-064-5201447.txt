http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/WD-AERT/ must be a time-warped one since its 
header says "W3C Working Draft, 23 August, 2000" or is it somehow not 
"public"? Since the Web site is public, then I thought the contents were 
also. Oh, well!

I'll try to read it before I leave for Bristol, but the plate's a little 
full. Although if UA is going to keep theirs secret for a while, I guess I 
can squeeze in an hour or so.
