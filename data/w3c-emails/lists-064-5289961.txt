I _like_ command lines but I certainly get your point. ;)

Yes, I think that WCAG 1.0 is a good set of information but a
bad implementation plan and the "bugs" are an indication that
it is not really "fully implementable."  I think this is something
that we need to seriously address in WCAG 2.0 before submitting
it for approval as a recommendation.

If the WAI site itself can't be made "fully accessible" -- triple-A
accessible -- without undertaking major effort, sacrificing design
considerations, damaging usability, and imposing undue burden, then
obviously there are problems with our working definitions. :)
