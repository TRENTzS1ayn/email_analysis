Picking up a bit on the discussion about duplicating mouse events - somebody
said if you have "onfocus" to duplicate "onmouseover", the thing will be
"active" forever, you need an "onlosefocus" event. There is, but it's
"onblur". In fact, if you have an "onmouseover" without an "onmouseout", the
thing will still be eternally activate after the first mouse over event.
That's the reason I see these things as coming in pairs:

onmouseover = onfocus
onmouseout = onblur
onmousedown = onkeydown
onmouseup = onkeyup
onclick = onkeypress = onactivate
