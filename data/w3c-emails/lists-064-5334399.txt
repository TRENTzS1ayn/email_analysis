I forgot last week to follow up on the request of me to dig up information
on alternative content for applet, object etc. Here it is:

APPLET supports both the "alt" attribute and nested content.
OBJECT supports only nested content.
IMG supports only the "alt" attribute.
EMBED (not in the HTML spec, but widely used) supports only nested content
(according to htmlcompendium.org)

Thus, I propose that IMG be checked for alt text, OBJECT and EMBED be
checked for nested content, and APPLET be checked for both and passed if
either one are provided.
