In general applets provide functionality. If there is only an alt, then it is
not going to provide a lot of functionality (ther are exceptions - I really
like the applet lake that runs on (among other inaccessible
sites) http://www.wendyrule.com but it doesn't really do anything
much. Hmmm. Even in that case it provides an image, and the image at least
should be in the alternative content.

Also, checking for nested content should exclude param elements that are
included, since they are only useful for the initial object/applet.

  I forgot last week to follow up on the request of me to dig up information
  on alternative content for applet, object etc. Here it is:
  
  APPLET supports both the "alt" attribute and nested content.
  OBJECT supports only nested content.
  IMG supports only the "alt" attribute.
  EMBED (not in the HTML spec, but widely used) supports only nested content
  (according to htmlcompendium.org)
  
  Thus, I propose that IMG be checked for alt text, OBJECT and EMBED be
  checked for nested content, and APPLET be checked for both and passed if
  either one are provided.
