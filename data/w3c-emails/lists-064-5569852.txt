It's not merely a question of people choosing to not emply assistive 
technology out of whim or stubborness.

Assistive technology may not produce as good a solution as accessibility 
built into the web page, as I noted when I talked about problems with 
magnifiers.  Don't get me wrong: magnfiers can be invaluable tools, and 
some people will need them no matter what is done with the web page.  And 
people need them when the web page hasn't built in the accessibility.  But 
they aren't as effective as being able to simply magnify the text.  That's 
why real text should be used everywhere, unless there's a really good 
reason, e.g. company logos.
