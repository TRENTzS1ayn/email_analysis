Agreed.

We disagree on whether or not this is the job of the web designer
to fix.

Not all people who are completely blind use screenreaders or braille
terminals.

The content of the image is accessible (through an ALT tag); the
user agent simply is not set up to give this information to the
user in a way it may be manipulated.

>2. The user cannot configure the user agent to change the color of the text

You realize that most web designers don't necessarily want the
user to be able to change the color the text? :)  [I am bracing 
myself for another round of "the designer's wants/needs are
worthless."]

>3. The user should be able to configure the user agent to turn images off, and the resize and change the color of the text equivalent for the image.

That's what I'm suggesting right there.

>Resources designed in this way will force some users to turn off images for access to the content.

That's not necessarily a bad thing.  (I'm not saying it's a _good_
thing, but I also believe that a flat priority 2 ban on textual
images is a crazy idea.)
