No offense, David, but this is one of the most useless bits of
accessibility advice to come down the stream in a while.  If we
are going to have specific rules which we expect (somehow) to
be able to impose upon web designers, we need to be a lot clearer
than just saying "don't use 'tiny' graphical text, but it doesn't
have to be 'big' either."
