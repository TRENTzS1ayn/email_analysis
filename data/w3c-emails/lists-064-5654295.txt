I took that as an "action item" :) and I forwarded the request
with background info to the Wise Women discussion list (see
http://www.wise-women.org/), which is home to a number of very
skilled graphic/web designers.  Here's the first reply back from
that list:

>a recent project of mine was the site for author graham joyce (http://grahamjoyce.net), the site needed to both transmit the eerie horror/dark fantasy style of his books and his personality. one of the themes for his book covers was a smoke/mist effect and on 90% of them his name was set in a specific font. carrying this brand/connection over from his books was very important and was a very good reason to use graphical text as opposed to html text.
