>4) I know people with older browsers can't see CSS formatted pages properly
>(if at all), I do know they can see graphical text or the ALT tags.

>5) Sometimes I need absolute control how much space "text" should take up.
>I then use graphical text.

>6) Sometimes the only graphics on the page are the graphical text nav
>buttons. Without the buttons the page would be too text heavy and too boring.
>
>7) Maybe this has changed... but don't you need to use images (usually
>text/images nav buttons) for mouseovers/image swapping?
>
>9) Looking back on the sites I've done...  I've used graphical text on
>every one.
