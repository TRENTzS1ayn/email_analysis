Thanks Kynn.

In this example, the author's name "Graham Joyce" was part of an 
image.  I'd consider that an example of what I consider an allowable use of 
html text in logos... the logo happens to be rather large here.

As the designer points out, there were some navigation links that were html 
text, but only for the purpose of mouseovers.  The mouseover effect is 
simply to change the font color, so it could have been done with CSS rather 
than image text. And the designer herself says that the font wasn't 
critical there.

Meanwhile, the rest of the text and links on the page are real text, with 
font and color coordinated with the logo.

So I think her page comes close to an example of how to use real text... 
and could have been complete aside from what she says was a design decision 
rather than a requirement.

Gorgeous page by the way.
