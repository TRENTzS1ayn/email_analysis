Kynn,

This is a really enlighening series of answers from web designers.

I think it would be best on the wai-ig list.  Would you  repost all the 
wise-women responses to wai-ig?

Meanwhile

TO EVERYONE ON ER IG
If you have opinions on these answers please wait till they are on wai-ig 
and answer there.
