Apples, oranges, William.

>At some point in the so-called "design process" that text that became "image-text" was actual "text - text". Just as the PDF text or table was once not a "scanned-type" of text. The proportion of today's text that is not at some point in its career in digital (dare I even say it "ascii") form is miniscule. I don't know why "image text" is any different than any other image in requiring a text equivalent? In short I think this is already covered early in the guidelines.

I think you may be missing the point -- the discussion has not been
about "should image text require a text equivalent", it was "should
image text be thrown out entirely for double-A compliance".

>Let me repeat "image-text is in fact image". 

I don't think anyone is claiming it's not, so I'm not sure you need
to make this point so forcefully. :)  However, I think you may have
missed _my_ point, because your response doesn't really address it...
