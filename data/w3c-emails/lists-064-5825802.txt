I just tried a test table with Netscape 4.7 and IE5. Both browsers exhibit
the same behaviour.

Any table border size 1em or less shows up the same as a 1 pixel border,
independent of the document font size.
A table border of 2em displays the same as a 2 pixel border, independent of
the document font size.
A table border of 3em displays the same as a 3 pixel border, independent of
the document font size.

So it appears that the browsers ignore the relative 'em' size and convert
the border to an absolute number.
