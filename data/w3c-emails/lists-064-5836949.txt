Which is not the greatest implmentation I can think of, although I can see
that it is quick to implement (i.e. just take all units as pixel units...)
but doesn't make it a bad idea to use relative units as far as I can see.

  I just tried a test table with Netscape 4.7 and IE5. Both browsers exhibit

  Any table border size 1em or less shows up the same as a 1 pixel border,
  independent of the document font size.
  A table border of 2em displays the same as a 2 pixel border, independent of
  the document font size.
  A table border of 3em displays the same as a 3 pixel border, independent of
  the document font size.
  
  So it appears that the browsers ignore the relative 'em' size and convert
  the border to an absolute number.
