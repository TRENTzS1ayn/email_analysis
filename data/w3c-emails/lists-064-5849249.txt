Could there be some cases where an absolute size in tables and framesets may
be appropriate?

An absolute size is OK if:

If the table contains a form - the author may not want the form layout to be
changed by a table changing size.
If the table column or frame contains images (navigation buttons for
example) that are a set size - the other table columns or frames may change
size but the column containing the images should stay put.
If the entire table or frameset size is less than 640 X 480 pixels - this
will fit on the lowest resolution monitor.
