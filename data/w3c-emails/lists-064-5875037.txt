640x480 is not the lowest resolution monitor. Any more than IE is the browser
everyone uses.

If the font size changes and the table size doesn't then the layout may/will
change anyway.

The navigation images issue is related to the use of images of text. Is there
a problem that it causes to have 80% of my 320x240 screen taken up by a
navbar? (I think so...)

  Could there be some cases where an absolute size in tables and framesets may
  be appropriate?
  
  An absolute size is OK if:
  
  If the table contains a form - the author may not want the form layout to be
  changed by a table changing size.
  If the table column or frame contains images (navigation buttons for
  example) that are a set size - the other table columns or frames may change
  size but the column containing the images should stay put.
  If the entire table or frameset size is less than 640 X 480 pixels - this
  will fit on the lowest resolution monitor.
