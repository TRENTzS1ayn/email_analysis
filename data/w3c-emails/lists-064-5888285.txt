We suggest that they use .3 em and realise that under current implementations
they may not get their desired effect. Which is not ideal, and I imagine that
in practice they will use pixel sizes.

specifying 3em if they don't want something 3em is clearly wrong.

Do you have a test page we could use for a few more browsers?

  So what do we suggest that the author use to set the border size? If they
  want a thick border and specify 3em that will work fine now. But when the
  browsers implement em size properly, the 3ems will be much too large.
