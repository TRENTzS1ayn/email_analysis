Note from the field: we implemented Technique 12.3.1 in Bobby, and used that
on our beta new web site. We implemented OPTGROUPs in SELECT elements per
the requirement. Guess what happened? In Internet Explorer 5 (and maybe
earlier, haven't tested) for Mac, drop-down lists had no options show up.

It's highly distressing that a browser (and a new one at that) has
destructive incompatibility with the HTML standard. But, that being the
case, can we have this technique? Nobody can safely implement the
requirement.

On a related note, about the threshold of triggering if there are 7 or more
option elements, there's an article at
http://www.humanfactors.com/library/sep00.asp that says the number 7 is from
a single 50-year-old study and shouldn't be given too much credence. I
wonder if that observation might affect our discussions?
