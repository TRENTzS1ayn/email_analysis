What would you think of using RDF to indicate

1. that the class is informationally relevent for the user  (i.e. more than 
just appearance)
2. A description of what the class means.

If we want to push this much further it's a matter for PF.

Although it is a candidate for inclusion in EARL.

p.s.
I had once suggested adding at "alt" attribute to style sheets to convey 
the meaning of a class, but it ran afoul of the philosophy that style 
sheets should contain no content.
