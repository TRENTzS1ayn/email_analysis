Or, you could anotate the message with a "seeAlso" type anotation - pointer
to somewhere else...

By the way, the bookmarkelt thing that Art Barstow developed is col and works
in iCab as well as other javascript capable browsers.

The basic idea is that I have a bookmark entry that is
javascript:dotherightthings() (well, it's longer than that...) which I call
"Annotate this page" and another that I call "get annotations for this page".
SO I don't have to rely on having Amaya. (Un less I want to annotate a
particular part of the page - browsers aren't normally smart enough to do
that).

BTW I wrote a thread on xtech about the annotea stuff:

  p.s.
  I omitted the question about combatting annotation spam to focus on the
  more EARL related questions.
