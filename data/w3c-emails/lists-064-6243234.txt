I know that HiSoftware provides an accessibility package that works with
FrontPage, although I have not used it and can't verify for its
functionality.  See http://www.hisoftware.com/access/Index.html.

Kathleen,

I would agree with you, but where are you at 3:00 Am when I need you?

LOL

Seriously however if anyone from Microoft is on this list, I would be
using
you to help build such a wizard.... Maybe you can get us all a beta
copy!
It would for sure help a good many people at a minimum of cost.

Sincerley,

Mike Burks

I like to think of my self as *being* the FrontPage Accessibility Wizard
:-)  By that I mean using FrontPage to produce accessible web pages and
web
sites. I looked at the list archives for those two dates and I would
also
like some more information.

Thanks,
