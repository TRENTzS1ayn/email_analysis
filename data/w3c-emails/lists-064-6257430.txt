WebCleaner [2]

An Open-Source (GPL) filtering HTTP proxy.

"It can disable animated GIFs, compress documents on-the-fly (with gzip), 
enhance your privacy (remove user-agent: header and obfuscate IP address), 
and remove all HTML crap. It can be completely customized to your needs."

Although not advertised an an accessibility tranform tool, the 
customization feature would facilitate that use.

Also, the customize file is in XML and the language is Python.
