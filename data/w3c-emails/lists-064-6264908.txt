Hi,

Just a short note announcing the release of Betsie version 1.5.7. Betsie is
the automatic html transform tool used by the BBC and others 

Changes are all fairly minor bugfixes, and are detailed in the newly updated
readme.txt file. Anyone actually using Betsie is strongly recommended to
join the newly set up Betsie-devel mailing list via Sourceforge -
http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/betsie-devel .

Cheers etc.,

Wayne
