At the PF f2f this week, I took an action item to propose ERT to
release a "stable" version of EARL asap, so that people can start
playing with it.

I suggest we release a document under
 http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/earl0.9
using the RDF version 
 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2001Mar/0028.html
+ use the english prose at
 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2001Mar/0015.html
for documentation.

Comments ?
