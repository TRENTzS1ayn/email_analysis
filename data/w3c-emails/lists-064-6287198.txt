Great!

Well, we have http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/ sitting there doing
absolutely nothing... I guess that could be the namespace for the
schema, and the documentation could be put at /WAI/ER/earl0.9, or
whatever. I'd like to have a datestamped namespace for the terms, due
to persistence. The W3C's persistence policy [1] only covers
date-stamped URIs.

Yep, fine, but this will have to be converted into an RDF schema as
well. The RDF in /w3c-wai-er-ig/2001Mar/0028.html is just a few cases
of non-normative examples really... but it will be easy to make an RDF
schema from them.
