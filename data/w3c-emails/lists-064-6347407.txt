OK, I've requested an agenda slot for this on the SW CG. With WWW10 and
the W3C AC meeting looming, we may not get to this immediately. If you
don't hear back in 3 weeks ping me by email or IRC. (I'm not asking for
any big decision from SW CG, just want to keep everyone informed of
interest in N3...)

Dan
