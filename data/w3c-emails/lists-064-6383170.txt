I'm also very glad to hear that.  N3 much easier for humans to discuss.  If 
there's a rigorous correspondence between N3 and RDF, or a N3 and subset of 
RDF, I'd see no problem in using it as an alternative notation.

Philisophically after all, not everything is in angle brackets.  For 
example The Xpointer

xpointer(id('list37')/item[1]/range-to(following-sibling::item[2]))

One could imagine an angle bracket notation for this, e.g.

<xpointer>
   <id arg="list37" />
   etc, whatever ...
</xpointer>

But a more compact notation is used.
