Accessibilty, right? Sean's picture is understandable, N3 is ok if you've
spent a lot of time with Swiss [1] people, RDF/XML is about as humanly
comprehensible as my cat's bottom, by design (sorry, the cat's bum is quite
straightforward, or backward).
Personally I have trouble with the normative W3C stuff, and the informative
don't help in the slightest (unless you are Swiss, see [1]).
My humble opinion is that your normative & informative should be a bloody
picture, not unlike what Sean's done. Please don't end up in a slurry.

[1] Swiss people come and fancy my cat. Each to their own.

  I'm also very glad to hear that.  N3 much easier for humans to discuss.
If there's a rigorous correspondence between N3 and RDF, or a N3 and subset
of RDF, I'd see no problem in using it as an alternative notation.

  Philisophically after all, not everything is in angle brackets.  For
example The Xpointer

  xpointer(id('list37')/item[1]/range-to(following-sibling::item[2]))

  One could imagine an angle bracket notation for this, e.g.

  <xpointer>
    <id arg="list37" />
    etc, whatever ...
  </xpointer>

  But a more compact notation is used.

    OK, I've requested an agenda slot for this on the SW CG. With WWW10 and
    the W3C AC meeting looming, we may not get to this immediately. If you
    don't hear back in 3 weeks ping me by email or IRC. (I'm not asking for
    any big decision from SW CG, just want to keep everyone informed of
    interest in N3...)

    cheers,

    Dan
