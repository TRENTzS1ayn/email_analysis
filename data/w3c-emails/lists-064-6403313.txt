Hmm... the two problems with "bloody pictures" is that they're 1) not
machine processable, 2) difficult for me to draw. That little SVG
picture (actually, I'm quite proud of it) of the EARL schema took me
many hours... the N3 schema takes seconds.

But you're right... we have to make sure that anyone can understand
this; this is the WAI after all. That's why I drew the diagram,
because I knew that if *I* had a hard time understanding what I was
writing, that other people would too:-)

Incidentally, the schema has progressed quite a bit onwards, and is
now looking quite a bit more ordered. I'll try to produce a stable
version so that people can discuss it on the telecon properly, without
having to worry that it'll change in five minutes because I forgot
something! In fact, I even wrote a little RDF Schema validator, to
help make sure that I did it right.

I'm trying very hard to make sure that the RDF model is a very close
replica of what Daniel drafted up.

P.S. Danny, in future - please try touching your nose with your eyes
shut before you send a mail. If you can't do it, don't send the mail
:-)
