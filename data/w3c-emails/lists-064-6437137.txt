Aaron, could you reformulate the examples at
  http://infomesh.net/2001/03/earl/0.9-ex[1,2,3].n3
with your model, so see how simpler it is ?
(with all the bits, not a simplified n3 version like here)

Sean, what do you think about Aaron's model ?

Thanks




> I've been working with Sean on the EARL Schema, and I've come up with this
> simplified model:
> 
> :Sean earl:asserts { :page :altTag [
>   :result :Fail ; 
>   :confidence :High ;
>   :comment "He put in a longDesc but forgot the alt for some reason." ;
>   :date "2001-04-22" .
> ] .} .
> 
> Or in English: Sean asserts "page fails the altTag test".
> 
> The basic concept is that an evaluator (a person or a tool) makes an
> assertion along the lines of:
> 
>     testSubject -test-> Result
> 
> This model can be considered analogous to the buttons on the bottom of pages
> that say "Validate This Page". They link from the page (testSubject) to the
> Result. The result includes more information about the output of the test,
> including comments, confidence, etc.
> 
> While this would be the basics of the EARL assertion, further information,

> the document or gathered from elsewhere. This improves extensibility
> greatly, since other parties can provide information about the evaluators,
> pages, and tests involved. An example would be:
> 
> :page 
>   a :WebContent ;
>   earl:testURI <http://example.org/page> ;
>   earl:testDate "2000-04-22" .
> 
> :Sean
>     a :Person ;
>     :name "Sean B. Palmer" ;
>     :email <mailto:sean@mysterylights.com> .
> 
> :altTag
>     :name "Alt Tag" ;
>     :comment "Test for an altTag on every image." ;
>     :suite <http://example.org/images/> .
> 
> I'm not on the list, so please CC responses to me. Thanks.
