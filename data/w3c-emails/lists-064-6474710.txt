>    - EARL - the Evaluation And Repair Language

At the PF f2f, we also discussed the fact that Repair in EARL were
sort of "not core", and so maybe the correct expansion of the acronym
should be
  EARL: Evaluation and Reporting Language.

What do people think ?
I think it's still time to change it but later on it will be more
problematic.
