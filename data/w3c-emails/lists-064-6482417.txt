Why are you saying repair is not core?

Personally speaking at least, I think it's an important part of EARL.  For 
example, if I'm evaluating a web page, and I see some poorly worded ALT 
text, I'd certainly want to have a way to suggest better ALT text.  And 
once I do that, the output can be used for repair.

Repair has been in the user scenarios for months... e.g. see the part 
starting at http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/earl.html#evaluation .
