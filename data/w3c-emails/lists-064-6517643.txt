I updated the Lift entry on existing tools [1] per their description [2].

It now reads

quote
Lift Online and Lift Site are both Developed by UsableNet, Inc. (Last 
update: 24 April 2001 LRK)
?       ?       LIFT Onsite is software that allows web designers and web 
owners to test and repair accessibility and usability issues, including 
site navigability, download speed, graphic quality, accessibility, 
searchability, etc. It integrates with web editors such as Dreamweaver, 
GoLive, FrontPage, BB Edit. .It runs locally on MacOS.
?       LIFT Online is the evaluation portion of LIFT Onsite. It is a 
subscription based service.
