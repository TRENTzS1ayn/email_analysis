The need for the language was not only to report the results of evaluations 
but the results of repairs.  Therefore to report:
- repairs that have been performed as well as those that have not yet been 
performed
- results of evaluations they have manually performed on the content as 
well as results of automatic tests.

Therefore, "reporting of repairs" whether they exist in the past or 
future.  We "report" info on both evaluations and repairs.  Or perhaps just 
"reporting language." :) Regardless, I think changing the name to 
"Evaluation and Reporting Language" would be fine.  Reporting is a good 
general concept.
