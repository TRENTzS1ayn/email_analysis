Hello all,

Just FYI, I head to Hong Kong tomorrow to attend the Advisory Committee 
(AC) meetings and WWW10.  Therefore, I will likely miss this week's and 
next week's meetings and will not be active on the list.

Even if I am able to make it, could we have two volunteers to take minutes 
for these meetings?  In advance - I really appreciate your help!

Note that I will be presenting about WCAG, EARL, and implementation 
experience at the AC meeting.  If anyone has interesting insights they 
would like me to share with the AC, let me know and I'll do what I can to 
incorporate them.

Be well,
--w
