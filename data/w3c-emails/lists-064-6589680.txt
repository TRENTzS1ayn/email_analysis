I think it's worth doing it now.

I started updating the EARL home page.
  http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/

I don't see any mention of Repair in the RDF schema (N3 or XML), nor
in the graphics or the examples, so it was easy.

I'm still working on cleaning up the EARL home page (trying to give it 
a more kosher W3C note look).
