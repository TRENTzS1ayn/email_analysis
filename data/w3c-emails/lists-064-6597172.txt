I'd suggest we leave it alone.

I see Daniels point that it doesn't fully describe repair at this time.

However, we don't want to paint ourselves into a corner where we can't add 
it.  So it has that potential, even it it's not in the intitial release.

And even now, it can be used FOR repair.

Also, "Report" sounds too much like just one of the applications, making a 
human readable output summarizing the results.  So it makes it too narrow, 
and we need to omit the name "report".  This leaves the "R" in EARL meaning 
nothing.

If someone can think of some meaningless thing for R to stand for that 
would be OK with me.

Having said all that, if the consensus of others is to make it Evaluation 
and Report Language, I'll go along with it.
