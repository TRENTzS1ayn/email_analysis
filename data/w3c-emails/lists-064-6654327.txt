For this you'll need to download the following files into a directory
somewhere:-

   http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/0.9.n3
   http://infomesh.net/2001/rdfsvalid/srules.n3
   http://infomesh.net/2001/03/earl/earl-filter8.n3

And run the following command line with cwm.py [1]:-

   python cwm.py x.n3 0.9.n3 srules.n3 -think -filter=earl-filter8.n3
     > x-out.n3

Where "x.n3" is an EARL test file, for example one of the following:-

   http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/0.9-ex1.n3
   http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/0.9-ex2.n3
   http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/0.9-ex3.n3

You'll get out a pretty printed list of how many test subjects there
are, and hence a list of all the evaluations being carried out. If you
mess around with "earl-filter8.n3", you'll be able to filter out many
more ststements like this. Here's an example of what you get if you
run the filter on "0.9-ex1.n3":-

   http://infomesh.net/2001/03/earl/0.9-ex1-out.n3

Enjoy!
