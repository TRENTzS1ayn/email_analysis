Ain't broke - don't fix. Just the "trivial" changing of a bunch of 
documents is tedious. Also changing it won't *change* it because it's 
embedded and the rewriting of history is absurd. All together now "what 
does the 'U' in "URI' signify?" - I bet more people say the incorrect 
"universal" than the correct "uniform".

Let's call the whole thing off?
