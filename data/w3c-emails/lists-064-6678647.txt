I just posted email to the User agent list [1] about a tool I whipped 
together for folks with signficant motor disabilities.

It assigns shortcuts to every link and inserts keyboard accessible buttons 
for every object that has a mouseover.  Moving focus to the button produces 
the mouseover effect.

I posted it on the user agent list because the right place for this feature 
is the user agent.  Please continue any discussion on that list [1]
