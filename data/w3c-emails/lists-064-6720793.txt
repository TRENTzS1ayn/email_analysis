What I meant was that it didn't deal with "Accessibility" in the WAI sense. 
My goal is to emphasize all our activities as "accessibility" with a lower 
case "a" and the *feel* of her report is in that direction rather than the 
eternal message that we're about helping out some *other* set of people who 
are categorizable by their "disability". We are all members of one another 
and *every one of us* is significantly "disabled" until we can play/compose 
as well as Mozart, etc. We are all in this together until the gamma ray 
burster (or a big comet) hits, and "aCCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE".

We've got to get over the idea that just because our society still 
imprisons/sterilizes/murders those who differ isn't any reason to pretend 
that there's some *they* out there who need *our* help. We're all out there 
and we all gain from this help - even something as "trivial" as an 
evaluation tool. It's not just for blind guys, it's for QA like the piece says.

Love.
