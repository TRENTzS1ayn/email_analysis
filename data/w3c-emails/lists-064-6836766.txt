Wendy,

Thanks for the quick feedback. In answer to your questions:

I think that they have failed this test. But this test comes from the AERT
section on "suggested repairs" so the test doesn't have the weight of some
the other tests. You must mark the tests correctly then process the EARL to
find out how the tool performed. For example, they may have passed only 50
tests but they were all P1 tests so the tool is excellent on P1 items.

Sorry about that

We're still working on the test files and should have this fixed up in the
next couple of days.

Yes, comments are not getting stored in the output file. I'm not exactly
sure how we should store them in EARL and am waiting to hear back from Sean.
I hope to have this implemented very shortly (perhaps tomorrow).

Cheers,
Chris
