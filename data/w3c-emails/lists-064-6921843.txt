Let's also discuss Karl and Sharon's  comments on other people looking at 
EARL and applications of it.

Our next teleconference will be held Monday, 6 August 2001 at the regularly 
scheduled time: 10:00 AM Eastern Time (14:00 UTC/GMT).  To find out what 
time it is in your time zone use the Time Zone Converter [1].

It will take place on the MIT bridge: +1 617.258.7910

Agenda for Monday:
- ATR tool and test files, although Chris won't be at the meeting. I 
thought we could go through some of the test files.  If anyone has gone 
through them all (Josh? <grin/>) we can discuss what else we need.  I've 
only been through a small portion.  They're really good.

What is the cross-section with WCAG test files?

- EARL that ATR generates.  What will the tool look like that collates all 
the data from the ATR?  A comparison table (that linearizes well) of tools 
by checkpoint is what I had in mind. What are your thoughts?

- List of existing tools.  How can we make it easier to read and use?  Will 
this be replaced by the comparison table  just suggested?

Be well,
