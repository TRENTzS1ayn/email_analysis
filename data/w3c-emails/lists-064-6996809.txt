8 August 2001: Due to a power outage in the MIT LCS W3C building on Tuesday
and Wednesday, 7-8 August, parts of the W3C site were down, including
mailing list operations. W3C apologizes for the inconvenience. Services
were restored at 22:00Z on 8 August.

Messages posted to W3C lists during this time have been stored. My
expectation is that they will appear on W3C lists and archives over the
next day, so you do not need to resend any messages sent during this
period. We will provide additional information if this changes.

Regards,

- Judy
