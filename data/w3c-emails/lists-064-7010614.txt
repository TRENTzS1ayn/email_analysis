HB Is there any means of certifying metadata? If we are going to make 
assertions, should we include certifications of metadata on a document.

WL Pics?  Since we are proposing EARL for that function, is META the place 
to put it...

HB Looking at DC, they have a typed vocabulary.  Since PICS is a W3C Rec...

WL Often proposed a place to include certifications.

HB Open-ended?

WL Yes, more general than pornography although that's what it has been most 
associated with.  Freedom of speech issues made people pull back, but it 
had good stuff. It may be that you provide EARL similarly to logo, where it 
validates it.

HB Hope that we could get to the point that someone doesn't have to assert 
that a doc complies or doesn't.

WL Not have to but get to.  Is there any way to say "A, AA, etc." logo, but 
it doesn't link, that's the assertion.

WC We have a PICS schema, refer to #7 in the Errata.
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WAI-WEBCONTENT-ERRATA

WL Do user agents do anything with it?

WC Don't think so.

WL This should be in a new version, no one will use it.  Ridiculous that 
can't incorporate a spelling mistake.

WC Talk with judy. Have discussed. Decided not to pursue 1.1, since so many 
changes needed. Instead move forward with 2.0.

HB agree.

WL Will take too much time.  Why not release a version with errata 
incorporated?  Already approved...already modifying.

WC It's publishing a whole new Recommendation.  I wonder how they did XML 
1.0 second edition?  But, please take the issue to Judy.
