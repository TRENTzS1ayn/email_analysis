I appreciate several peoples efforts to help my comprehend EARL a months or so ago, but I couldn't get through to EARL nirvana.  I would appreciate if someone could give me some example XML
representations of the following types of assertions.  N3 alone will not help me.  If you want to give N3 in addition, that is fine.  If I've dropped some actors in the following statements, please
feel free to rewrite them before showing an XML representation.

Statement 1:

A parser configuration (for example, Xerces-J 1.4 with ignoreElementContentWhitespace=true) fails a test by not satisfying an assertion (for example, the return value should be null).  (Is it
necessary or desirable to identify who, or what software agent, made the determination?)


Statement 2:

The DOM WG has decided that a particular test should be included in the DOM 1 test suite.  (Extra points for adding a dissent or two and references to archived emails)
