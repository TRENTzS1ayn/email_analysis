I would be intersted, provided that it was either jointly with AU or didn't
overlap.

  Hello,

  How many people are interested in meeting at the next W3C five-day All Group
  meeting?  It will be held Feb 25-March 1 2002 in Cannes, France.

  Last year, we had several visitors working on RDF to discuss EARL and had a
  joint meeting with AU and WCAG.

  Here is the agenda we had last year:

  and the minutes from the meeting:
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/2001/03/01-f2f-minutes.html

  As part of that we resolved to meet again at the next plenary.  Are we
  still interested?  We need to decide by 21 Sept. to reserve space.
