We now have a new accessibility evaluation tool ready for testing. It's
based upon the successful tool HTMLTidy and displays a list of accessibility
problems found in an HTML file. It also does all the regular HTML Tidy
checks and if you're a user of HTML Tidy then you can replace your Tidy with
the new Tidy.

This is an early beta version and we're looking for feedback and users
willing to test the software.

You can download it from: http://snow.utoronto.ca/chris/AccTidy.html

This version has been compiled for Windows but we will make the source code
available so it may be compiled for other systems.

Please take a look and let me know your comments.

Thanks,
Chris
