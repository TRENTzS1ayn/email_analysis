Hi Chris,

have you added tis stuff to the sourceforge tidy project (it got moveed there
so Dave didn't have to keep managing it)? This would have a big impact on its
use I think.

Cheers

Charles

  We now have a new accessibility evaluation tool ready for testing. It's
  based upon the successful tool HTMLTidy and displays a list of accessibility
  problems found in an HTML file. It also does all the regular HTML Tidy
  checks and if you're a user of HTML Tidy then you can replace your Tidy with
  the new Tidy.

  This is an early beta version and we're looking for feedback and users
  willing to test the software.

  You can download it from: http://snow.utoronto.ca/chris/AccTidy.html

  This version has been compiled for Windows but we will make the source code
  available so it may be compiled for other systems.

  Please take a look and let me know your comments.

  Thanks,
  Chris
