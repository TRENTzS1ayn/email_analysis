We haven't added it to the Sourceforge project yet but plan on doing so. We
plan on making the source code available under their public license. I
wanted to get some feedback on the usefulness of our program before merging
it with their code base.

All our accessibility code is in a separate file but there are a few small
changes that need to be made to the Tidy code. So there will be a small
impact in adding our code to theirs.

Chris
