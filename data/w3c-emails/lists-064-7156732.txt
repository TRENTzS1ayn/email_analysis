Well, I tried it out, and they haven't yet got the perfect tool either. It
did a bunch of neat stuff, and it goes through the whiole of WCAG (P1 P2 and
P3) but there seem to be some bugs in their checking system.

Specifically I ran it against http://www.peepo.com (using the online demo)
and found that it missed (or seemed to miss) some important tests, such as
scripts ahving device-independent triggers (should be auto-checkable to some
extent) or even whether they are required.

But there were some ice things about it too.

Does the ER group review ER tools, or should AU be prepared to review partial
solution tools on the basis that some whole guidelines will be not
applicable?

cheers
