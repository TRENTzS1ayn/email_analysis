I'm on the point of launching a new Site Valet service dedicated
to Quality Assurance on the Web[1].  It generates a range of
Site and Page reports for webmasters and page owners.

Part of the thrust of this is that users will be encouraged to
display a QA badge, in the manner of the W3C "Valid ..." icons,
offering owners and visitors alike a click-through to a Site
Valet Report.  This offers an ideal opportunity to invite user
feedback on a page or site, and serve it in an ordered manner
to the webmaster responsible.

As a starting point, I'm thinking of something like Sean's bookmarklet,
hooked into the Valet database.  This could potentially be a major
new EARL testbed application.  This message is slightly premature,
but I'd like to give notice that I may wish to raise the subject
in todays [tele|IRC]con.

    everything to work quite yet.
