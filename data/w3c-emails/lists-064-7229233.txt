Here is an example of using EARL with a filter to give you a summary
of where people disagree with each other about a particular
evaluation. The files attached are:-

* <<agree.n3>> The input file, containing an evaluation by Daniel, and
by Chaals. They disagree on whether a page passes the alt text test or
not.
* <<agree-rule.n3>> The rule file: containing a rule that sniffs out
disagreements, and compiles a report
* <<agree-out.n3> The result, using command line at [1].

The result correctly identifies that (in this hypothetical example)
Chaals disagrees with Daniel, and also points to the specific page and
checkpoint that they disagree over.

Cheers,

[1] python cwm.py agree.n3 --think --filter=agree-rule.n3 >
agree-out.n3
