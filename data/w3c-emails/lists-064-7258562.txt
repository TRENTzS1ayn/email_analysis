(I can't guarantee the syntax, but it is something like that)

The issue is whether you have a way to define what the site is. (If you do,
you could state it in something that you could then discuss...)

  <sbp> I am here, but I am very tired
  <nick_kew> OK nevermind, I'll post to list instead
  <sbp> no, it's O.K., give me a whirl
  <sbp> but expect replies to be at a slightly lower level of coherance than
  normal (if that's possible!)
  <nick_kew> earl:testSubject
  <sbp> Uh huh...
  <nick_kew> How would it work if this were more than one page
  <nick_kew> - e.g. an evaluation on an entire site?
  <sbp> that's one of our main issues. There are a handful of ways in which
  it could be done (match against a RegExp, use some of the log stuff, have
  multiple objects, use URISpace, come up with some URISpace-in-RDF-a-like),
  but we haven't really discussed it, yet alone settled upon anything
  <sbp> come back, rdf:aboutEachPrefix!
  <nick_kew> OK, I'll have to run ahead of you for Valet, since I'm
  accepting user comments on either "this page" or "this site"
  <sbp> that's fine; if you have to implement something now, just go
  ahead... but let us know :-)
  <nick_kew> will do.
  <sbp> cheers :-)
