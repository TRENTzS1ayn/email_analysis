So, want's wanted is a webpage which lists all the testcases, what they
should do, and provides a chance for the user to input what actually
happens, I'm a bit vague what actually wants to be reported - we're just
judging the HTML and not in any relevance to the AT that's been used? (ie
when there is ALT text available, someone using "UselessBrowser"
shouldn't mark the test as failed, just because their AT hides it?)

Where /how's the EARL to be stored?

Generating EARL from simple pages would be pretty trivial add to what I
already have (and very trivial if I could limit it to Mozilla and IE5 -
but that's unreasonable I feel, but may be worth doing as a starting
point.)

It's certainly something I'd look at doing, but there seems to be a lot
of UI in there and as people have probably heard me saying - I don't do
UI.  So if someone can come up with a reasonable specification I'll look
to do it.

Jim.
