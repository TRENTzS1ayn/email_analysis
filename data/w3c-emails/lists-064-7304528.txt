Thanks to TimBL adding [1] log:outputString as a built-in to CWM [2],
it is now possible to write conversion tools in Notation3 [3]. To that
end, I've sketched out an RDF Schema to XHTML converter in Notation3:-

   http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/rdfstoxhtml.n3

To run it, either do:-

   TARGET=mydoc.n3
   cwm rdfstoxhtml.n3 --think --strings > out.html

or edit rdfstoxhtml.n3 where appropriate (pointers are given in the
file), and run without setting the environment variable.

Example outputs are given at:-

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Dec/att-0026/01-0.
95-schema
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Dec/att-0026/02-rd
fs

Note that there are a handful of bugs, such as duplicate reports and
so on (CWM seems not to recognize log:notIncludes). If anyone can
suggest fixes for that, or have any other comments, they will be
gladly received.
