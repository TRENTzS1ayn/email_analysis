Our next chat will be held Monday, 10 December 2001 at the regularly 
scheduled time: 10:00 AM Eastern Time (15:00 UTC/GMT).  To find out what 
time it is in your time zone use the Time Zone Converter [1].

It will take place only in IRC (i.e. no bridge) at:
irc server: irc.w3.org
port: 6665
channel: #er

Agenda for Monday:
- Continue discussion about threads in EARL as a possible solution to the 
state issue.  I tried to summarize the issues and a few things to consider at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/2001/12/05-minutes.html#summaries

Towards the end of the discussion, Jim and Sean were talking about 
threading between multiple test subjects instead of trying to represent 
state info in EARL.

- Jim asked to add "querying earl" to the agenda

- We still need to discuss combining EARL reports

-  Please let me know if you are unfamiliar with IRC, have trouble typing 
or try to limit your typing due to injuries or other reasons, or have any 
other concerns with IRC-only meetings.  It seems to be an effective method 
for this group, but I want to ensure that everyone is comfortable with it.

Are there other topics people would like to nominate for the 
agenda?  Please send suggestions to the list.

Be well,
--wendy
