Certainly, although I don't see how we, when we're external to the
resource, can know enough to state that some resource is newer version of
the old.  (it could be the same, with different content negotiation, or
just failure to identify it at the same resource, or it could be a
resource which changes regularly but rotates so old resources are still
valuable.)  My point is that we're introducing anything new, just that
we're introducing the idea that testSubject/reprOf is threaded (ie an
evaluation on a resource with a later date supercedes an evaluation on an
earlier dated resource), and what about things we evaluate which are not
time dependant, they just have different states.

I don't (yet) see it as any clearer, some examples will probably help...
