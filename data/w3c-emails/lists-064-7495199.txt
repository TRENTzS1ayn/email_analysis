A noble idea and one much touted in the Accessibility groups for what
CC/PP does, however the actual working documents for it provide no
mechanism to say any such things, they are concenred only with platform
and operating system, this is something that does nothing to promote
Device Independance, it only promotes segregation and author choice of
what's best for me, based on the browser I'm using not what I am (for
example, I like to scroll horizontally in AvantGo on my PDA, it makes
pages feel more like their non PDA versions which I'm familiar with and I
want images on my PDA's - This isn't generally the assumed author choice
the PDA versions of sites are generally weaker than accessible normal
versions.)  It also introduces barriers to entry for new browsers, which
means they will have to lie within their CC/PP settings or get something
perhaps less than is reasonable - as has been shown throughout the short
history of the web so far, due to content negotiation on browser (via
HTTP_USERAGENT) browsers lie in their UA.  CC/PP doesn't change this.

In the mobile world there maybe a case for it, and this is where the
Working Group seems to be working with CC/PP (although there's little sign
in public of development at all.)

Such information does need to be reflected in EARL, I just don't see how
chasing CC/PP is valuable against subclassing platform ourselves.
(Assuming Sean hasn't turned this up...)
