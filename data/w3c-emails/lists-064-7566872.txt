I'm incorporating content hashing into the Site Valet problem reporting
and tracking database, as a system-determined measure of what has
changed when a page is updated:

* User asserts [some aspect of page] needs fixing
* Valet makes hash on [that aspect]
* Valet checks again when webmaster claims to have fixed it

I'm not sure how useful this will be, but it's one step up from
purely manual inspection.

For this, I've switched from Base64 to hex for the hashes, to
make my own parsing easier.  The two are of course functionally
equivalent.

Anyway, can I ask folks to take a look at the system: does it look
basically sensible as it stands:

* Go to any page displaying the Site Valet badge
  (e.g. http://valet.webthing.com/qa/)
* Click on the badge to get a report
* Click on the "comment on this page" link
* Does this Form make sense to you?
