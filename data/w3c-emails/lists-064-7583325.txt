Hi folks,

there are a couple of reviews of Dreamweaver against ATAG, that would make a
good test case for merging data if we converted them to earl
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/reviews/dreamweaver/twob4

But here's the Rub. One version is against Wombat, and includes the
Accessibility extension, one is against ATAG 1.0 and doesn't.

First question is how much we can do about merging the two datasets assuming
the same test subject. I can go through and create EARL, and do it for things
that aren't different between the test subjects.

But I would need some help to work out how to specify equivalence rules - for
example meeting checkpoint 1.4 of ATAG wombat is the same as meeting
checkpoint 3.3 and 1.4 of ATAG 1

I think  the second problem is dealing with relative priorities. In ATAG
there are checkpoints where you have to meet a number of WCAG checkpoints
with respect to the prticular ATAG checkpoint. Anyone got an idea how we
express those  individually, since different people did different test sets?

(From memory we sort-of addressed this in the demo dan and I did, but I am
not sure of the status of that work now. Anyway, it is linked under the
further reading section of the earl page)

And then we can merge the data and see what we get in terms of a real
report, and how we go about genereating real reports for people out of it
all...

cheers

chaals
