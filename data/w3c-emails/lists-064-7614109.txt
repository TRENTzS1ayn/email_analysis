Hello all,

Some of us have holidays the next 2 Mondays (24 December, 31 December).  Will people be around the next 2 Wednesdays?  I will be and willing to chat.  I still need to publish a summary of the Team review of EARL (from 13 December) and the minutes from the 10 December meeting.

I'll try to have these out before midnight GMT on 26 Wednesday and whoever is around can check it with each other.

Otherwise, Happy Holidays! Happy New Year!

Be well,
--wendy
