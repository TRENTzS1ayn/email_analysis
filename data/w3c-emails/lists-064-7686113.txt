I suggest that further discussion of this idea take place in the WAI ER
working group and that we drop the other groups from the list, since they can
always read the archives..

One useful feature of such a tool would be that it can provide definitions
along with words.

  I have once wrote algorithm for helping dyslexics/LD with spell checking.

  In principle, a spellchecker suggests words by mapping one spelling as close
  to another. As LD use a different mechanism for spelling, the mapping is
  often off.

  Practical ramifications: A spell checker will often not suggest the correct
  word. Homonyms (which witch is which?) or rule based misspellings are
  undetected.
  (When "pluralizing" I randomly choose between using a "s" and an "es". I
  once was writing a memo about test procedures and chouse the wrong way to
  pluralize the word "test").

  Normal spell checking algorithms do not cut it.

  However rather then insisting that everyone uses my algorithm (which I
  should unload sometime anyway) a simple Tesaurus, or definitions facility,
  would help a lot.

  A Tesaurus that can be used backward, so that I can find the word I want by
  typing in a  word with a similar meaning, would be even better.

  Could, or how could this be integrated into guidelines.

  Could the whole algorithm (quite a nice bit of c code, but can be rewritten)
  be linked.
   through RDF?

  No, I am not taking this on as an action item. My RDF is not up to it.
