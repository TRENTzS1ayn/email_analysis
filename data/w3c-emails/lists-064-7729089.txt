Yes, but it's not valid RDF because DanBri's original letter wasn't in RDF.
To get it to work, you'd have to convert an entire letter/page/+ to data,
spell check it, and then convert it back - i.e. as part of a specialized
spell-checker, not an RDF processor.
Having said that, I do like the ideas from Charles/Lisa about using RDF for
spell checking, a thesaurus, a dictionary, etc. DanBri's Wordnet stuff is a
good indicator of what RDF can do, and it would be very easy indeed to
modify it to become a thesaurus or a dictionary. Since Dan is now an
official unlurker on the list, maybe he can chip in :-)
