> annotations work being done in Amaya.

Until there is a permanent annotations server (is the W3C one permenent
yet?), or, even better, fully ported annotations server software (I run
IIS... why are there no tools for IIS???; I end up having to write my own),
I doubt it will take off. Amaya is good because it attempts to bridge the
UI gaps that TimBL mentioned [1], but I don't find it intuitive enough to
use at the moment for XHTML. Only plain text tools are direct enough for
XHTML, IMHO. [The DIAP problem has been getting progressively worse now for
ten years, and it'll probably never be fixed.]
