So WordNet is indeed a very interesting case. Unlike many Library
thesauri, the modelling has been done cleanly enough to project the
broader/narrower axis onto RDF's class hierarchy. This is because WordNet
makes distinctions such as:

(excuse the ascii art rdf)

    fido -- type --> Dog -- subClassOf --> Mammal

rather than the looser

    fido -- broaderTerm --> Dog --> broaderTerm --> Mammal

...which is often what you find in thesauri. This is great for WordNet,
since each word it defines becomes an RDF class, allowing us to write RDF
that looks quite intutiive as XML:

<wn:Image>
  <foaf:depicts>
    <wn:Person foaf:name="..."> ...etc


In the DESIRE project and at ILRT we have also done a bit of work
reflecting classical thesauri into RDF, adopting the
broaderTerm/narrowerTerm modelling style. I recently
started to clean up these docs (there's an implementation too, pretty
simple over SQL based RDF store).

Writeup (as yet uncirculated in present form...)

http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/01/rdf-thes/
RDF Thesaurus Specification (draft)

Conceptual relationships for encoding thesauri, classification systems and
organised metadata collections and a proposal
        for encoding a core set of thesaurus relationships using an RDF Schema

Feedback / suggestions / applications welcomed. This is intended to be a
spec that gets deployed not one written up for academic purposes :)

cheers

Dan
