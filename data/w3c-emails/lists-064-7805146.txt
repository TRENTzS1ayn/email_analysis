If that attitude perseveres, we might come out of this alive after all! 
Finally "getting it" that RDF (even in as "scribbleable" a form as N3) is 
how we provide "accessibility" for our slave-machines (which are 
cognitively impaired) so that they can "read" our files. Sort of "alt text 
for computers".

The "scrapers" and UWIMP-style indexing facilitators seem ripe for 
inclusion in the utilities ER could encourage/develop to provide authoring 
tool developers with paste-in features that speak to the "everything" part 
of "everyone, everything connected" dream.

In fact I think a week in Amsterdam would clear this all up very nicely. A 
joint meeting with PF in April?
