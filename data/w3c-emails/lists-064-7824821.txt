Depends what one thinks of as RDF. At the starkest core, RDF is just a
bunch of edge-labelled graph data. However the RDF Model and Syntax spec
defines some basic utilities, such as rdf:type, and the RDF Schema spec
defines additions to these, fleshing out the class system a bit. So yes,
RDF (Model+Syntax and Schema) do have these notions 'built in'.

It maps onto a reasonably intuitive model. In WordNet, they catalogue
the nouns hierarchies using a template of "A ___ is a kind of
___". Eg. "A _Dog_ is a kind of _Mammal_". With implied (er,
whadderyoucallit... transitivity), so 

fido <-type- Dog <- subclassof-- Mammal <-- subClassOf-- LivingThing

allows us to say that "Fido is a kind of Dog; all Dogs are mammals, all
Mammals are Living things". ... fido is a Living thing etc etc

So the rdf:type and rdf:subClassOf license different inferences. We
wouldn't say that "a fido is a kind of Dog" because fido (in my
example) is an individual, not a kind of thing.

BTW classic conflation of these two concepts is the word "isa" which can
be used in either sense...

So this stuff gets really fun when you stuff it inside JPEGs, PNGs
etc. You can say that an image depicts a (some-detailed-class) and have
implied class membership further up the hierachy. See
http://www.tasi.ac.uk/2000/09/rdfmeta/ for a sketch of this with PNG
images of Lions (interactive demo currently offline...)

Does this make any sense?
