I performed a couple of tests in IE5 and Netscape 4.7 and they both support
image map area rectangles of 1 pixel (e.g. 10,10,11,11). Empty rectangles
(e.g. 10,10,10,10) did not seem to work. So it is possible to convert the
server-side image map 'point' over to a client-side 'rect'. I've updated the
file that describes the conversion process to include this new information.
