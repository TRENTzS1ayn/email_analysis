I'm experimenting with statements about statements, and I believe this is 
the way to say

according the the wave tool
http://x.y/foo.gif has the property "alt_status"  equal to the value "missing".

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
   xmlns:e="e/"
 >

<!-- the alt_status of "image" is missing
      call this "statement_1" by setting bagID="statement_1"
-->

<rdf:Description about="http://x.y/foo.gif" bagID="statement_1">
     <e:alt_status> missing  </e:alt_status>
</rdf:Description>

<!-- statement_1 was detected with the Wave tool -->

<rdf:Description aboutEach="#statement_1" >
         <e:toolUsed> e:wave </e:toolUsed>
</rdf:Description>

</rdf:RDF>

----------
Note that "toolUsed"   is not a property of the image.  It's a property of 
the statement _ABOUT_  the image.

I ran this through SiRPAC but I'm pretty sure I hit a bug in 
SiRPAC.  SiRPAC generates id's., and there's an id in the diagram that 
isn't in the set of triples, and visa versa.  If I set them equal the 
diagram make sense.  If I leave them as they are, the digram doesn't match 
what I was trying to say.

Also, when the set of triples is even more verbose than the RDF.  We need 
to use more of a shorthand to help the discussion along.
