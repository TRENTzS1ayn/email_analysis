As Chaalz noted, this only solves the problem if someone is using
those specific types of image map software and if the file is
available to the repair tool.  In a number of other cases this
will not be true and thus this is only a partial solution.

However, it's a somewhat workable incomplete solution.  Only problem
is there's no ALT text in your example!  How would you generate this
from a server-side map?  I assume A-Prompt will request the information
from the user?
