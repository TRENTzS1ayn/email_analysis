To:w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org

To move things along, here's a sample EARL file written in N3, the 
abbreviated RDF described at http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/Primer that 
Sean pointed out (thanks Sean!)

I added a couple of things to that notation
- everything after // is a comment, a la C++
- URL's that start with / are relative to earl:domain  @@ hmmm.

(please tell me if I got this notation wrong)

Here goes.  As you can see, issues spring up right away once you start 
pinning things down.

// define namespaces
@prefix rdf:  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .

@prefix aert: <http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/ATAG10-EVAL#> . // ER techniques
@prefix e:  <http://www.w3.org/2001/10/earl#> .  // doesn't exist yet

// remember that N3 lists triples  SUBJECT FIRST

// define website :site, a name internal to this file

:site      e:domain  <http://www.foo.com>
:site      e:homepage  <http://www.foo.com/index.html>
//@@ how to define sites that span different domains?
//@@ how to describe sites that give different users different views, 
especially if both view have same URI (e.g. though use of cookies or logins)

// define  human evaluators
:hu1 e:type e:human
:hu1 e:name "Samuel R. Hawk"

:hu2 e:type e:human
:hu2 e:name "Joe S. Dove"

// define tool
:t1 e:type e:tool .
:t1 e:uri <http://astro.temple.edu/piat/wave> .


// now lets talk about a particular image tag
:img1 = </dog.html#/1/2> .  // using xpath here

:img1 e:type e:tag .
:img1 e:name "img" .

:img1    e:partOf    :site
// we have to be explicit.  It's not enough to simply be in
// same earl file, as mere presence carries no semantics
// @@ can we get partOf from some other namespace?

//@@ do we really need type and name in the earl file?

// what tools and humans say about this tag

// tool flags it as suspicious
:t1 e:says {:img1 aert:altStatus aert:suspicious} .

// :hu1 says alt bad, suggests new value
:hu1  e:says {:img1 e:altStatus e:fail } .
:hu1 e:says {:img1 e:altShouldBe "Smiling puppy" } .

//@@ instead of ad-hoc "altShouldBe" can we have generic way of describing 
changes to tags, attributes, etc?

// :h2 contradicts :h1, says alt is OK
:hu2  e:says {:img1 aerte:altStatus e:pass } .

// consumer of this data must choose to take advice of :hu1 or :hu2
