This could use a technique I am proposing to deal with TITLE and ALT
attributes (possibly also more obscure things such as LONGDESC).

The repair software will keep a lookup table of URL -> title (easy)
and URL -> alt (more problematic).  When it encounters a missing
alt or title, it will first look them up, and enter them in the
page if found.

The interesting part of this is how to populate the database.
In the case of TITLE there's often an easy way: for every link to an
HTML document, use the TITLE of the target.  For ALT, and for TITLE
in the case of non-textual documents, it will make *provisional*
entries in the database whenever it encounters any link having
credible values for the attribute, and will use these thereafter
in the absence of anything better.

Going back to the specific case of an imagemap, wherever it links
to an HTML document, the TITLE of the target could be suggested
also as an ALT value.

I will implement at least this TITLE repair in the Site Valet in the
not too distant future.  But it's also part of an altogether more
exciting proposal, about which I will try and get around to posting
in due course.

(I hope the above makes sense, but it is Saturday night as I write).
