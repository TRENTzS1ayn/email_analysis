From terms used by Daniel [1] and Len [2], I have melded them together to
form (another) seminal EARL vocabulary:-

earl:asserts (x asserts y)
earl:comment (x comments that y)
earl:confidence (x is asserted to a confidence level of y)
earl:detail (x has a fuller assertion y)
earl:domain (x has the root domain y)
earl:testpage (x has test page y, or x is an earl:testpage)
earl:langtype (x is of langtype y [e.g. x earl:langtype "XHTML"])
earl:mode (x has a test mode of y)
earl:person (x is an earl:person [@@ rdf:type discrepancies])
earl:result (x has the result y)
earl:status (x has the status y)
earl:tool (x is an earl:tool)

[1] These are the terms that Daniel invented, sans explanation. I have
added some alternatives in [brackets].

edl:TestId [use rdf:ID]
edl:TestResult
edl:TestConfidence
edl:TestMode
edl:TestProgram
edl:TestPerson
edl:TestDetail
edl:TestComment

[2] These are the terms that Len recently used in the N3 EARL example, with
annotations.

e:domain
e:homepage
e:type [use rdf:type]
e:human
e:name [use foaf:name]
e:tool
e:uri [use rdf:resource]
e:partOf [use daml:intersectionOf???]
e:says
e:altStatus

Note that there are some equivalences between [1] and [2]. For example,
edl:TestProgram = e:tool, and edl:TestPerson = e:human.
