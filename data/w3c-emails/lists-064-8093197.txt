in teh SVG access note we included a link to metadata about the Note. The
address of that is http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG-access/metadata.rdf and the stuff
we included at the time is

A fairly simple statement. There's also a bug in it - it doesn't say what
level it conforms to WCAG at. (I recently adjusted the ATAG sources so that
there is an explicit URI that can be used for asserting conformance at each
of the three possible levels). There are some obvious bugs, but there are
also obvious things we could do to improve on it, like list WCAG conformance
checkpoint by checkpoint instead of in one hit - that would be a whole lot
more useful in my opinion, and is how I intended to be able to use the thing.
Also, it would be fairly easy to make WART output this information.

Cheers

Charles
