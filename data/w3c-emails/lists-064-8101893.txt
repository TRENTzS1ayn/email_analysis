I'm starting a thread on notation issues to keep it out of the more 
substantive issues

That sounds like an improvement.  It bothered me to use commas, semicolons, 
square brackets, or curley brackets depending on how many elements you were 
factoring out.  semEngish sounds simpler syntactically, more lisp-ish.  Do 
you have a pointer to it?  Should we switch to semEnglish?
