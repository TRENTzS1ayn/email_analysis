Kynn,

Yes, the conversion algorithm I described is only a partial solution.
Server-side processing of image maps may be quite different from the
processing of client-side image maps and a 'map' file may not be used at
all.

Yup, the server-side 'map' file has no ALT text so you must get it from the
user. With A-Prompt we do ask the user for ALT text after doing the
conversion to a client side map.
