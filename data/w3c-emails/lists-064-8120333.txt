I just got email about the deadline for the discount hotel 
reservations.    This email says the deadline has been extended to Feb 8, 
although the w3 meeting announcement says Feb 5 (today), and the form 
itself still says Feb 26.  I'm checking...

But regardless, it appears you can still get the discount rate if you 
register today (2/5) and possibly as late as 2/8.
