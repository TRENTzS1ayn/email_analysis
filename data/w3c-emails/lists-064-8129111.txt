>   earl:asserts (x asserts y)
> CMN Use DC:author

I evolved that from Len's e:says. I think it is analagous to earl:comment,
so there is probably no need for it in actual fact.

>   earl:comment (x comments that y)
> CMN how is this different from earl:detail ?

A comment is generic, whereas a detail is specific.

     earl:detail rdfs:subClassOf earl:comment .

>   earl:domain (x has the root domain y)
> CMN What does this mean? (i.e. why is it useful?)

This is another of Len's terms: it may be that you are saying something
about an entire "site" rather than a specific page. This is a
representation of that. Possibly domain is a bad word to use, and my
definition was well off of the mark. Call it a group of pages.

Well, you'd want to know what it was tested by? Manual or automatic, human
or tool. earl:person is an object.

     "x" testedBy earl:person .

>   earl:result (x has the result y)
>   earl:status (x has the status y)
> Why is result differnt from status. Use case?

I think that status would be something that is in flux, so if for example a
tool was fixing something as it went along, the EARL that it outputs would
be using status, whereas if something is a final definitive result, then
use result.
