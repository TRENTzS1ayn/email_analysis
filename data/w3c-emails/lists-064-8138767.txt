This is good. We need to consolidate all of these terms, and come up with a
simple Schema for it all really. It would be nice to have "modules" for it
as well, as I hinted previously, and intructions for adding your own terms.
I see EARL as more of a framework and a meta-language than something
viable; all stemming from the ERT-PF F2F where ADL became EDL...
