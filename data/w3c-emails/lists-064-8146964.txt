No - it was pointed out shortly after Seth wrote the thing that an "]" is
an allowed character in a URI, making it rather tricky. Therefore, you
can't use [URI], because the trailing "]" could be part of the URI... if
Seth used something like ^ instead, it might work, but the main problem is
that there are no tool to process it anyway. N3 has an N3 => RDF parser,
and even a logic based query engine: CWM. This is a shame, because
structurally, semEnglish is a great improvement over Notation3.
