I think it's better to distinguish between an assertion and a comment.

A comment would be free form text

An assertion would be a logical construct that carries semantics.

so for example if we have the following statements (dropping namespaces for 
the moment)

:len :asserts {:apple color red} .
:sean :asserts {:apple :color :green} .

a logic engine properly programmed to know what "asserts" means would find 
a contraction.

On the other hand if we have

:len :comments "apple color red" .
:sean :comments "apple color green" .

a logic engine would find no contraction (assuming the logic engine doesn't 
parse and understand strings).

BTW, comments are typically about something.  Which gives us more info than 
can fit in a triple. So what we really would need is something like

:com
    :type :comment;
    :madeby :len;
    :appliesto :sometag;
    :contents "apple color green"
.
