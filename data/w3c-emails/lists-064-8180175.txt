This is legal, but it means that you go fetch the thing identified and there
is a step required where a person has to read the document to understand
where to find what triple-A means.

(I should have used meets1 or meets2 - these are defined within the scheme
already, and mean "meets to priority 1 level")

  Instead of having a separate wcag URI for each level of conformance,  could
  we use wcag to define a namespace? e.g.

  <rdf:RDF xmlns:wcag="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/#Conformance"
                 xmlns:conform="http://www.w3.org/1999/11/conforms/">


  <rdf:Description about="Overview.html">
       <conform:meets wcag:triple-A>
  </rdf:Description>

  Is this legal?  If so, any advantages or disadvantages?
