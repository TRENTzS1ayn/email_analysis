  A comment is generic, whereas a detail is specific.

       earl:detail rdfs:subClassOf earl:comment .

I figured that a detail is different from a comment in that it is attached to
something at a different level, not that it is a different type of property?

  This is another of Len's terms: it may be that you are saying something
  about an entire "site" rather than a specific page. This is a
  representation of that. Possibly domain is a bad word to use, and my
  definition was well off of the mark. Call it a group of pages.

OK, makes sense. Isn't there an RDF construct for this already?

  Well, you'd want to know what it was tested by? Manual or automatic, human
  or tool. earl:person is an object.

       "x" testedBy earl:person .

yep.

  I think that status would be something that is in flux, so if for example a
  tool was fixing something as it went along, the EARL that it outputs would
  be using status, whereas if something is a final definitive result, then
  use result.

Nothing is final and definitive.It's just as far as we got for now. So I
think we only need one of these.

(Anyone tracking what properties we still have?)

While I am at it, there is a question of whether it is helpful to have the
three conformance level properties that I had for ATAG relative priorities.
They allow us to directly use WCAG as an object, but I am not sure how
important each of those goals are.
