I think a detail is something that is more specific, like an assertion,
whereas a comment is simply generic - a bit of prose. I think earl:asserts
deprecates earl:detail.

I don't think so... unless you mean like a "bag", but what if you don't
want to list all of the URIs? You just want to say "anything uner this
diman/subdirectory"; a bit like a namespace prefix...

O.K, in that case I'd go for result, because it is a bit more specific.

Nope :-) I'll make an RDF Schema of all of the properties that we end up
with when the discussions reach some "satisfactory point".

I think it is better to use them as objects rather than something that is
written into a property. Just an opinion, but I think that way you lessen
the amount of properties that use use, and the system is less complex.
