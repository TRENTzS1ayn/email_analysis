See the new list [message: EARL Syntax and Vocabulary]. I defined it as
being a property, not an object (as I have incorrectly done above).

Unless there isn't a strict definition... but most langauges do have
specifications. What would you use as the :conforms for SGML, C++, Java,
and so on?

I'm not sure what I mean by mode (actually, I think it's one of Daniels
properties), but I reckon this would be better as a class, so that people
defining new modules can speicify their modes as being a sub property of
this class. i.e. earl:mode becomes earl:Mode.

There are some new TimBL additions to N3, (such as ":-") that I need to
look through and work out, so maybe there is a better way of representing
this now?
