As for how we notate comments...

Charles suggested

>:len :asserts {:apple :comment "well, it's really sort of a reddish yellow
>with a touch of violet haze"} .

I agree with what you're getting at, but I think that unfortunately  this 
isn't the way to notate it.  I say "unfortunately" because I'm finding it 
awkward to reduce everything to triples, as RDF requires.

The problem is that if we consider these two statements

:len: :asserts {:apple  :comment  "well, it's really sort of reddish yellow" }
:chaaz  :assert {:apple  :comment "to my eye it's more of a tan" }

they indicate a disagreement between :len and :chaaz because they describe 
an apple with a single property  called "comment", and :len and :chaaz 
disagree about the value of that property.  It's the same disagreement as 
saying

:len :asserts {:apple :color "red" }
:chaaz :assert {:apple :color "yellow"}

Now, a human reading these, who knows what the word "comment" means, will 
treat these two pairs of statements differently.  But an RDF interpreter 
with the general rule that

:p :asserts {:x :y1 }
:q :asserts {:x :y2 }

are contradictions if y1 does not equal y2

will consider the comment constructs to be contradictions.

That's why I wrote this as

:c  :type :comment .
:c  :author: :len .
:c :applies_to :apple .

(this can be be abbreviated but these are the underlying meaning)

At least, this is how I interpret it.  People who think otherwise, please 
pile on <smile />
