There are RDF parsing tools that allow queries on RDF - the stuff we used for
the inital atagdemo (proto-EARL thingy) used one. So long as the RDF is
available, the querying beciomes a sort of seperate thing (except that  we
would like to build up results from aggregated information, for efficiency,
so some form of standardised query would be cool).

As I see it...

  There is some initial work on RDF Query, is there?

  Would that provide a way of expressing that we wish to collect [as a bag] all
  the pairs (comment, what comment is about) that share the value "what comment
  is about"=<node> and then format that into a report?
