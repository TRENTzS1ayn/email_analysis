It looks to me that you want to be able to add external metadata to Web 
pages, and that is what we have done with Annotea annotations. We create 
the annotations with Amaya, and store them to a metadata server. Now the 
content of the annotations is usually HTML but I don't know why it couldn't 
also be some more metadata (only problem is to have an easy user interface 
for producing it).

With Annotea it is possible to have different types of annotations, 
comments are already there. Maybe assertion is a new type or a subtype of 
comment where the user can add to the content some EARL metadata too and 
the server can then fetch this logic and do queries also about that.

I'll discuss with the Annotea group if it makes sense for them to use 
annotations for making these statements. I'm also writing a public page of 
what we are doing so hopefully I can provide some more information soon.
