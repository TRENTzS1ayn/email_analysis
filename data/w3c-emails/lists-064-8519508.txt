Dan, re your analogy to what we're trying to do with comments:

 > FWIW I have been using http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/made to relate a 
http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/Person
 > to any http://purl.org/rss/1.0/channel that they created. Is that a 
similar idiom to what you're after?

It sounds closely related in that :

- two different people can associate two different channels with the same 
web page  (i.e. the web page is seen in two different channels));

- and two different people can associate two different comments with the 
same web page;

- and in both these cases there is no conflict

(of course, "associate" means different things in these two cases; a web 
page is broadcast through a channel, and a comment is applied to a web page).

So I'd like to see how you notated that.  But when I look at 
http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1  I don't see any definition for "made"  (I just 
pointed my browser there and did a "view source" to see the rdf).  So I'm 
kinda guessing at what you had in mind. Could you point to some more 
details?   Thanks!

Len
