I've been looking at converting the APPLET element to OBJECT and it seems
quite difficult to do it properly. Sun Microsystems has a program that will
do this but the result is very messy. Information is available at their
site:
http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/1.3/docs/tags.html

For example, this APPLET:

<APPLET code="XYZApp.class" codebase="html/" align="baseline"
    width="200" height="200">
<PARAM NAME="model" VALUE="models/HyaluronicAcid.xyz">
    No Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition v 1.3 support for APPLET!!
</APPLET>

- will be converted to about 50 lines of HTML that includes Java script. The
resulting HTML still needs the original APPLET element to run under the
Macintosh OS.

Has anyone seen a clear simple method of converting APPLET to OBJECT?

Chris
