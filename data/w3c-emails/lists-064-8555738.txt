I agree. Do we have anything that we can play around with, though? We need
some sort of foundations of a vocabulary before we can do anything with it.
At the moment, an idea about EARL is out of date before it is even
published. Still, it would be possible to extend the type of thing that I
showed earlier with the CWM rulsfile, where we can make assumptions based
on any given EARL (N3) file.

Yes; I think that anything which isn't a "core" to EARL should be defined
in an EARL module. "needsLongdesc" and "needsAlt" could be part of an ADL
module, i.e. these could both be types of earl:requires, where
earl:requires is a class. I'd like people to think more about
modularization of EARL: if we have all of the central, most definitive,
"universal" terms all in the core vocabulary, then it means that it can be
solidly maintained. Every time someone adds a new tags to an XML langauge
that needs asserting about, we don't want to have to update EARL. We can
let people do this themsleves in an EARL module.

This is all core vocabulary stuff, I think. These are examples of terms
that could be universally applied to any subset use of EARL.

http://purl.org/swag/whatIsSW works great in IE5...

> LK Need a rating scale?

Rating systems are odd because a lot of the time they are ambiguous.
Sometimes it is difficult to tell if a page is WCAG AA compliant... and
what if a page is fully AAA compliant, but fails on one "A" checkpoint?
EARL needs to be able to say *exactly* what's going on, not some "well, I
think this document is 95% accessible", although it should allow for that
too.

Sorry I couldn't be on the call... *sigh*
