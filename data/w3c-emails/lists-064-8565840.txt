One of the problems with coming up with a simple EARL example is that EARL
is so encompassing and generic. If we had an example of EARL where a page
was being WCAG rated (i.e. rubber stamped), there is nothing in that that
can provide an example of testing an SVG graphic for accessibility or one
of the many thousands of things that EARL could be used for.

Maybe we should all work on a few examples each, and then submit them to
the list? That way, we shall get many issues covered at once. If all
examples had some sort of summary of problems faced, etc., then that would
be even more sueful. If we can first come to some knid of agreement about
the vocabulary, and how we use it, then we can all see how many more terms
we needed to invent for our actual practical examples. Note that if you
invent a new property, it might be possible to define it as being related
to something that has already been defined in the EARL vocabulary... this
is the kind of modular thing that I keep ranting on about.

Is this a good idea? I think pragmatism will warrant useful results for
EARL at this stage.
