Or, instead of having "needsAlt" as part of earl, we'd just have

needsAttribute

and then let the HTML 4.01 spec be the reference documentation for the 
attribute names, e.g.

:x      earl:needsAttribute      html:alt .
where the html: namespace is defined by http://www.w3.org/TR/html4

or (dropping name spaces for a moment)

:x :needs :y .

:y :type :attribute
:y :name :alt .
