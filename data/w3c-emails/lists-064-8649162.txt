I'd be happy to work on an example, but I don't know exactly what that 
means.  What do you envision?  An evaluation report of site A written in 
EARL?  For example, if I look at the output of WAVE on 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/  I can see that WAVE asserts a reading order of the 
page.  WAVE also asserts that every image has alt-text and that none seem 
to be suspicious.   Now I need to figure out how to state these assertions 
using the syntax we've been discussing...

First attempt will be to assert that I think the alt-text on the image that 
linearizes the table is ok.  Using Sean's latest summary of a syntax [1] 
combined with what we discussed on Monday [2] and Len's summary of that 
discussion [3]...I have thrashed the syntax, but here's a stab...probably 
in the dark. (I've combined my references in this paragraph with 
prefixes...hope that isn't confusing)

[1] @prefix 
s:http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2001Feb/0060.html
[2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/2001/02/12-minutes.html
[3] @prefix 
l:http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2001Feb/0097.html
@prefix h:http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/
@prefix earl:http://earl  #doesn't exist

#use XPath to express which image we're making an assertion about
<h:img[@src="/Icons/detab"]> has <h:@alt> of "change column layout"

<earl:person> <#name> "wendy"

"wendy" <earl:asserts> "the alt attribute of <h:img[@src="/Icons/detab"]> 
has <l:quality>"

#The assertion shouldn't be a string, but wasn't sure how to fit it into 
the vocabulary or syntax.  All of these should be strung together into one 
assertion, shouldn't they?

Not sure what to do about reading order.  Sean, is this the type of 
exercise you were hoping we would do?
