> The goals of this language are twofold:

Or perhaps more so. I updated the "EDL Overview", so that it is now the
"EARL Overview", and the URI has "changed" to:-

     http://infomesh.net/earl/
     - EARL Overview

The old URI will still point to the EDL overview, but I'll post a note
saying that it has been replaced. Len, you might want to update the ERT
page.

Wendy: hopefully there are some useful things in there that you could use
in the ERT/AU/GL note.

You should probably change that to "thanks to Len Kasday", or better yet
"ERT IG".
