Done: http://infomesh.net/earl/#p2 (and also in the further reading
section, which I have yet to update properly). BTW, I hacked off the
".html" from the end of the URL. The W3C server handles pages without file
extensions, which is good for URI persistence: what if in twenty years time
we don't use HTML anymore? "/earl.html" is going to become redundent, but
"/earl" hopefully isn't (of course, EARL may become redundant too, but
historically it wont be. Really, date stamping it would be best). This is
all from http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI "Cool URIs Don't Change -
TimBL".

No probs.; the old one was rather out of date.
