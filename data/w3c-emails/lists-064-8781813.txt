Sean,

Is there more info on the neat CWM processing tool you found & used to 
perform logical operations on N3 scribblized versions of RDF?

There's an intro at http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/

Source at http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/cwm.py

and the CGI interface to CWM at http://swag.semanticweb.org/cwm

However, the referenced logic definitions http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/log.n3

gives a "not found".

And in general, it would be good to know the scope of logic that it can 
handle. Have you found anything addressing these in your travels around w3c?;

Of course, anyone else with info about this, please chime in.

Len
