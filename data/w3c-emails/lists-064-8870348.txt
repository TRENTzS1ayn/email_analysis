I think it is the same as the stuff Dan alluded to, but he is also doing some
other stuff.

  There's also the work on annotations mentioned by Dan Brickley [1] [2]

  Is this tied in with the annotea in Amaya marja mentioned?

  It looks to me that you want to be able to add external metadata to Web
  pages, and that is what we have done with Annotea annotations. We create
  the annotations with Amaya, and store them to a metadata server. Now the
  content of the annotations is usually HTML but I don't know why it couldn't
  also be some more metadata (only problem is to have an easy user interface
  for producing it). With Annotea it is possible to have different types of
  annotations, comments are already there. Maybe assertion is a new type or a
  subtype of comment where the user can add to the content some EARL metadata
  too and the server can then fetch this logic and do queries also about
  that. I'll discuss with the Annotea group if it makes sense for them to use
  annotations for making these statements. I'm also writing a public page of
  what we are doing so hopefully I can provide some more information soon. Marja
