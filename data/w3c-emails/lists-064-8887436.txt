I quizzed Seth about using XPath in semEnglish (the considered alternative
to Notation3) after seeing it put to good use in EARL (thanks to Wendy).
This is his response, which is very interesting. Seth is working on a lot
of stuff involving N3 and semEnglish, so it could be useful for us to take
a closer look.
