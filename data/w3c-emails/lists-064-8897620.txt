I thought it might be a good idea to have a "definitive" list once and for
all of the background materials and resources pertaining to Notation3 and
similar ways to represent EARL.

[1] http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Notation3
The Notation3 Specification - TimBL

[2] http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/Primer
A Notation3 and SW primer - TimBL (very good intro.)

[3] http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/cwm.py
CWM - Closed World Machine
A Semantic Web query engine that parses N3 and to some extent XML RDF. Runs
under Python (checked on V 1.6 - 2.1). See http://www.python.org/

[4] http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/
SWAP- Semantic Web Area For Play
Contains details of N3 projects by TimBL and DanC

[5] http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/notation3.py
Notation3.py - DanC/TimBL
A Python module that can parse N3, including an N3 to XML RDF convertor.

[6] http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/test/
Some example N3 scripts.

[7] http://purl.org/swag/n3tordf
A Web interface for Notation3.py N3 to XML RDF conversion. This uses an
up-to-date version of Notation3.py There is an out of date version on the
W3C server at http://cgi.w3.org/cgi-bin/notation3.py with a built-in CGI
interface. See also http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/tab2n3.py which is a
hack to convert tab separated data into N3.

[8] http://purl.org/swag/cwm
A Web interface for the Closed World Machine [3]. It parses filter files
with a command of -think, as far as I know. I believe that it is the only
WWW interface to CWM currently in existence.

[9] http://robustai.net/mentography/semenglish.html
semEnglish - Seth Russell
Seth Russell's proposal of some updates to N3, making an N3 variant that
offers some distinct advantages over N3, but that lacks tools and other
implementations (currently).

[10] http://infomesh.net/swr/
Semantic Web Resource
Some assorted links to explanations / articles / tools etc. pertaining to
the Semantic Web.

[11] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2001Feb/0105.html
Pragmatism: An EARL Processing Example (that actually works)
An example of using CWM [3] to process EARL.

[12] http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/logic.n3
N3 Logic Schema
Contains some essential URIs that enable CWM to come to logical assumptions
about the N3 that it parses - especially in filters. Note that the
namespace for this schema is bizarrely
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/log.n3 You should use the namespace URI, not
the schema URI, when processing N3.
