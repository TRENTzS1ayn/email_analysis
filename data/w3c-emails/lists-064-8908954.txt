I paraphrase some objectives of EARL: to identify accessibility limitations on
a document, per WCAG checkpoints. Also possibly consider ATAG and UAAG
checkpoints. This metadata is expected to be useful to help a user have a
measure of understandability limitations, based on accessibility assertions.

I find an interesting reference on Annotea:

     http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/~checkout~/Amaya/doc/amaya/Annotations.html

The EARL needs should be harmonized with the Annotea work. The Amaya testbed
might be used to experiment with EARL.

Is there a meta means in a document to point via the annotation server
to any (one or more) annotations about it? Or, is there a single implicit 
means to make that linkage? Can conflicting annotations about a single
document be assessed?
