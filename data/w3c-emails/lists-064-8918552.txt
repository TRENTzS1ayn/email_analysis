A single document should permit several variants of EARL commentary, by 
different people or programs, and for assessment by different authoring tools.

A revised document needs revision tracking on
EARL commentary. Need to permit page providers/authors
to get revisions reassessed, and get rid of assessments
no longer pertinent.
