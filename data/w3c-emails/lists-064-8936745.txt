This would be a specific violation of ATAG chackpoint 1.2 Ensure that the
tool preserves all accessibility information during authoring,
transformations, and conversions. [Priority?1]

I realise this isn't proof against it, but Tool developers should be aware of
this anyway. It is a major concern in marketing terms too - most Tools now
have been designed to provide clean round-trip of source.

For a tool that doesn't support EARL the assertions may no longer be relevant
- this is why we wanted to have a way of saying that assertions are about a
particular version of a document (via a checksum or something).
