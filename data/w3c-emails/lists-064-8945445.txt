Can the annotea service provide the annotation information aas out-of-line
Xlinks?

As I nderstand it the annotea service provides annotations that are linked
out of line - in other words the principle is that without touching the
document itself it is possible to make annotations to it. To get them you
have to query the annotations service rather than the document itself.

And currently it can handle multiple annotaions about a single document,
cannot resolve "conflicting annotations" (since they are just human-readable
assertions, and there is no logic processing component defined. For that we
need an EARL processor).
