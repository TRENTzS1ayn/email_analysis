One of the values of having EARL as an RDF language is that the basic units
of RDF are URIs. This means that a statement can be about something that has
a URI. for example, attributes (using xpath) of a particular element. or all
attributes meeting particular conditions. Or a fragment of a document, or an
entire document.

And it can be aserted that this thing conforms to anything with a URI. For
example, ATAG will define a URI specifically to for each level of
conformance, or there is the confomrance levels linked to by the icons - they
are URIs. There are also AERT techniques. Or tests in a test suite.

If we can make these statements, and we can also state things like "section
508 conformance means conforming to the following list of things", and
"confdorming to section 508 (g) means meeting some technique from AERT" then
we just need a simple logic engine to stack up the assertions we have.

If you like we can add trust in a modular way - for example "remove
statements by charles, then add up what is left".
