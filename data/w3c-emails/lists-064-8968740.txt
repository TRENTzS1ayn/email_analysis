Dear Annotaya folks...

As marja pointed out [1] (thanks marja!) there's work we're doing in the 
Web Accessibility Initiative Evaluation and Repair Tool group (WAI-ER) [2] 
that's closely related to annotea.  It's called EARL [3] (Evaluation And 
Repair Language) which annotates web pages (or web sites) with RDF 
statements related accessibility (e.g. ALT text for an image is judged 
inaccurate; reading order of this group of elements doesn't make sense, 
etc.).

So I'd like to welcome you to join our EARL discussions at the face to face 
in boston.  The agenda is at [4],  The general EARL discussion will be 
Thursday Morning, 8:30-10:30.  This is followed by a break, and there may 
be further discussion of EARL afterwards, depending on other issues.

We'll also be getting into nitty gritty EARL issues in breakout sessions 
Friday, 10:45-3.  If this is longer than you can spend, it would be better 
for us if you were there in the beginning, say before the 10:30 break, so 
what you say can inform the rest of the discussion.

Hope you can make it!

Len
