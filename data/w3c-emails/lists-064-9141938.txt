  Now, regarding your suggestion, I don't see how a standard dictionary
  somewhere on the web is any better than a standard dictionary on my
  server.  However, a more interesting idea is a Dictionary Protocol,
  designed to allow dictionary servers to exchange information on-demand.
  However, I suspect this isn't really the right forum to discuss a
  dictionary protocol.

I understand the issue of whether something should be on the web or on the
server as a bandwidth one. I agree that there is a lot of protocol stuff in
it, and I think the answer has a lot to do with caching dictionaries, which
can be built into clients if people want...

  E alcuni anni fa quando sono stato in Italia, ma credo che Lei e sbagliato!

(my translation - it is some years since I was in Italy, but I think you are
mistaken)

I am not sure if it is correct Italian or not, but it is certainly a very
practice (see comments about using AP style in english) to write
abbreviations as we write "proper nouns" in english - first letter only is
capitalised. E.g. Dna instead of DNA. And it is some hours since I was
reading Italian newspapers.
