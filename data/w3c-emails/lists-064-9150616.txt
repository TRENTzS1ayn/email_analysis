Registration is open for the meetings:
http://www.w3.org/2001/02/allgroupoverview

Note that the registration form asks you which groups that you are not a 
member of that you wish to observe.  I believe a note is then sent to the 
chair(s) of that working group.  Are there working groups that we wish to 
invite to our working group meeting?
