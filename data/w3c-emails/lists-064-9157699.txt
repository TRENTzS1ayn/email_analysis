Yep. And this post is the opening salvo in that since I've double-posted it.

One of the main "training" methods that the Web itself imposes (largely 
through usual search engine practices) is the emphasis on "topic sentence" 
sort of things which makes summarization more natural/intuitive/simple. In 
many cases authors will, because of tools doing on-the-fly ToCs and 
summaries, be likelier to conform to the "pyramid" method of composition.

The nature of the tool would be to do that - perhaps have a window showing 
what the ToC and summary look like and at the whim of the author "indexing" 
this in the http://uwimp.com manner. It would be popular because it would 
let designers know what is likely to appear in search hit info.
