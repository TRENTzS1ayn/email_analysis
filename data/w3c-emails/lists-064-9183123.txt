Suggestions for the agenda at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/meetings/9jan01.html

Re Evaluation (and Repair) language (EARL) which is already on the agenda:

What would motivate authoring tool designers to input EARL?  To output 
EARL?  E.g., to avoid need to do all testing, to address test results from 
third party.

What should authoring tool do to make application of EARL easier (e.g. id 
on each element)


Possible additional topic:
Also discussion of plenary.  How to coordinate meetings?  Have one big 
meeting?  Whom to invite?
