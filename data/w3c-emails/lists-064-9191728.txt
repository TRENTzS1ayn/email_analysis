Added.

Please also review the draft prepared by Jan Richards to integrate the AERT
techniques into ATAG techniques and check that there are not things missing
or things that should not be there. (Long URI warning):

  Suggestions for the agenda at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/meetings/9jan01.html

  Re Evaluation (and Repair) language (EARL) which is already on the agenda:

  What would motivate authoring tool designers to input EARL?  To output
  EARL?  E.g., to avoid need to do all testing, to address test results from
  third party.

  What should authoring tool do to make application of EARL easier (e.g. id
  on each element)


  Possible additional topic:
  Also discussion of plenary.  How to coordinate meetings?  Have one big
  meeting?  Whom to invite?
