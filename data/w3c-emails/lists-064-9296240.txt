This sounds like a great idea to me - but it may be pretty hard to
implement.

Consider the following:

- What is the relationship of the (Java)Script to the displayed document?
Possibilities are: 1) it is embedded in the document 2) it is generated
along with the document 3) it is linked to the document 4) it generates a
document all by itself (yuck - but I've seen it done)
For a linked script one uses syntax like:
<script type="text/javascript"
src="Scripts/popupWindow.js"></script>
Note that the src attribute may contain either a relative or an absolute
reference (do we open it from the Internet to check it?)

- Variable names.
Two examples:
1) A window to be opened could be named, but does not need to be; the
statement becomes like:
window.open( pageToLoad,winName,args );
Do we parse the whole document to find assignments before interpreting such
statements?
2) To make the window available to give focus to, syntax like the following
is used:
popup = window.open( pageToLoad,winName,args );
popup.focus();

- Methods only?
Instead of parsing and interpreting variable names you might try to look for
methods only ( .open() , .focus() , etc.) but this is tricky, too: different
objects could share the same method names.

Essentially, then, to be able to apply any of this reasonably reliably one
would need to implement an almost complete (Java)Script parser.

I still like the idea ... <grin/>

Cheers,
Marjolein
