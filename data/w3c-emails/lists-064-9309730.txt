Yes, it is true that the best way to do the test is to have a complete (more
or less) Javascript parser. But then that isn't such a big deal - there are a
number of them around, and even implemented in relevant software.

Otherwise, it would make sense to do the checking on methods, with a bit of
work to determine where they are applied. The discussion in the ER group
about serilaising languages into BNF and then XML to be able to apply RDF in
the form of EARL (Evaluation and Repair description Language) to it is
relevant to this approach.

Anyway, I figure it makes some more useful information to expand the
technique...

cheers

  This sounds like a great idea to me - but it may be pretty hard to
  implement.

  Consider the following:

  - What is the relationship of the (Java)Script to the displayed document?
  Possibilities are: 1) it is embedded in the document 2) it is generated
  along with the document 3) it is linked to the document 4) it generates a
  document all by itself (yuck - but I've seen it done)
  For a linked script one uses syntax like:
  <script type="text/javascript"
  src="Scripts/popupWindow.js"></script>
  Note that the src attribute may contain either a relative or an absolute
  reference (do we open it from the Internet to check it?)

  - Variable names.
  Two examples:
  1) A window to be opened could be named, but does not need to be; the
  statement becomes like:
  window.open( pageToLoad,winName,args );
  Do we parse the whole document to find assignments before interpreting such
  statements?
  2) To make the window available to give focus to, syntax like the following
  is used:
  popup = window.open( pageToLoad,winName,args );
  popup.focus();

  - Methods only?
  Instead of parsing and interpreting variable names you might try to look for
  methods only ( .open() , .focus() , etc.) but this is tricky, too: different
  objects could share the same method names.

  Essentially, then, to be able to apply any of this reasonably reliably one
  would need to implement an almost complete (Java)Script parser.

  I still like the idea ... <grin/>

  Cheers,
  Marjolein
