The new US 508 rules have a new requirement: that information written to 
the screen by javascript be accessible to a screenreader. To avoid 
crossposting, I wrote the details to WCAG.  You can see them at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2001JanMar/0212.html

Please continue the thread there until it gets to the point we have 
something to test.  Then we'll bring it back here.  After we figure out a 
technique we'll send it over to AU where they're documenting the 
techniques.  And then we'll point into the AU document with EARL/EDL.  AU 
may in turn want to reference that feature of EARL.  Ah, process.
