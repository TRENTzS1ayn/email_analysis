As someone who lives in a monarchy, I am rather fond of EARL. Besides, it
reminds me that I should try to talk to someone of that name.

I am sure there are other interpretations of any acronym we come up with. It
doesn't matter much I don't think, so long as we provide an expanded form for
each reference (e.g. once in an email message, in title attribute of HTML
abbr/acronym element, as an HTML ruby, as the reference if we use a
semantic-web technique for defining acronyms...) that we make to it. In
accordance with WCAG <grin>

Cheers

  My handy acronym lister has several entries, some of which are sort of
  evocative of what this is:

  EDL is an acronym for:
  ?       Edit Decision List [not too far a reach]
  ?       Electronic Delay Line [let's avoid this!]
  ?       End Degrading Link [a noble goal]
  ?       Equipment Deficiency Logs [very close!]
