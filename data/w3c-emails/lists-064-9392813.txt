Can I ask that Site Valet be listed in the existingtools page?

It is probably by now the most relevant to accessibility of
any evaluation and repair toolkit available on the Web,
with the possible exception of Bobby.

Suggested entry:

Site Valet, at http://valet.webthing.com/

Site Valet offers a powerful online toolkit, together with
an automated website monitoring service.  The tools include:

* Page Valet - a formal validator, basically similar to the
  W3C and WDG validators, but offering additional options for
  accessibility checking and for generating normalised code.
* Link Valet - spider to check links and collect HTTP information.
* Form Valet - toolkit for testing and debugging forms and scripts.
* Code Valet (SP Online) - a collection of SGML power tools for
  content analysis and transformation.
* Tidy Online - a WWW interface to Tidy.
* Website monitoring service to notify users of potential problems,
  integrating the above online tools into site reports.
