Charles,

Yes, indeed as I noted, it's more techniques than guidelines. I also noted
that the examples did not themselves have alternative content :) (But then
that was not what the examples were illustrating, at least not the ones I
stumbled over.)

While one could classify the whole exercise as "too little, too late," I'd
rather see it as "better late than never". It may not be perfect, and they
don't have all the terminology straight. OK, so they're still learning, but
they are making an effort, and the current result is at least useful for
Flash developers. Much better than nothing, in my view.

I would suggest we refer to it, rather than including it. We could add some
sort of qualification, too (not complete, good starting point?).

Platform-specific guidelines? I don't think so; technology-specific
guidelines (rather, techniques!) would be more to the point - comparable to
guidelines / techniques for SMIL; it is another multimedia-presentation
technology, after all.

[As an aside, I'd also like to note that whereas many sites really try hard
to force Flash down your throat (I encountered one this morning that just
kept on reloading the image, and popping up the dialog to download the
plugin, making it practically impossible to even click on a link; I had to
try really hard to get past the home page), Macromedia do not make that
mistake. There is only a small link on their pages that you can follow if
you _do_ have the plugin. Excellent example of how to have Flash content
without forcing everyone to load it.]

Cheers,
Marjolein
