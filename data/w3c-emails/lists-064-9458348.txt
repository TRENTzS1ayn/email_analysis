Thanks nick.  I added it to the tools page under evaluation tools, with an 
extra reference at repair tools.

I also added a reference to it in the section on tidy since it offers an 
online version of tidy.  A very convenient service  I did have to mention 
that not all tidy options were available on the online version though.
