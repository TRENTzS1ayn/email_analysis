Edapta -- now a part of Reef -- has been working on server-
generated adapted interfaces for a while now.  Much of our
current work is still under wraps, but we have an old
"proof of concept" demo from last year at:

This demo isn't comprehensive or even reflective of our current
approaches; it was created as a way to convey the -types- of
changes which we can make using Edapta's methods.
