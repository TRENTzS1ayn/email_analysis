IBM is offering "Web Intermediary" (WBI, or "Webbie"), an open source 
development kit from IBM, an architecture and framework for creating 
intermediary applications on the web.  It's a programmable proxy and web 
server that can run on the user's machine or remotely.  A very promising 
platform for building filters and transformation tools for repairing web 
sites.
