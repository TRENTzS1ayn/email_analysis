Telecon Monday, Jan 22,
10:00-11:30 Eastern USA Time (GMT -05:00) on the MIT bridge (+1 617-258-7910).

Agenda

A. How do we evaluate alternate pages, e.g. from web sites that generate 
different views of pages on a server ?

Cf. recent email from wendy [1] and Kynn [2]

B. AERT Open Issues.  Wendy and I made some proposals to close some open 
issues.  The open issues list is at [3].  Please search for word "Proposal" 
to quickly get to the items.

C. Face to face meeting. We shall be meeting as a group Thursday.  The 
afternoon will be a joint meeting with GL and AU.

Plus: There will be an ad-hoc subgroup meeting among people interested in 
the nitty gritty RDF notation of EARL on Friday, during the technique 
breakout sessions of WCAG.  This will be a working meeting aimed at a 
common understanding that can be used for writing real code.

Who's interested in the ad-hoc subgroup meeting?
