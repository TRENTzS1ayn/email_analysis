  C. Face to face meeting. We shall be meeting as a group Thursday.  The
  afternoon will be a joint meeting with GL and AU.

  Plus: There will be an ad-hoc subgroup meeting among people interested in
  the nitty gritty RDF notation of EARL on Friday, during the technique
  breakout sessions of WCAG.  This will be a working meeting aimed at a
  common understanding that can be used for writing real code.

  Who's interested in the ad-hoc subgroup meeting?
