One of our committee members wrote "Six Steps to Accessibility
Certification" at:
http://www.cmac.state.ct.us/access/tutorials/certification.htm   It
describes the process she went through to ensure that her agency site was in
compliance with our state policy
http://www.cmac.state.ct.us/access/policies/accesspolicy40.html
A few other people here have tried it and it seems to work well. Please
note, however, one of the tools we use only works with FrontPage 2000, and
these steps are performed to ensure compliance with our policy, not Section
508.
