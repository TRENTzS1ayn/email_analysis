Do you guys collect stuff like this?

(It is a repair tool, although it only works with sepcific software. Is that
a problem? I would have thought not - after all, half the repair tools
available are themselves specific software...)

cheers

Hi:
There a free FrontPage 2000 addin available at:
http://www.jimcoaddins.com/  called "Alt-text for Image Maps"; it's a
utility that makes it easy to add alt text for hotspots in image maps.

We've been teaching state webmasters about it in our our web site
accessibility training classes.  It works really well.
