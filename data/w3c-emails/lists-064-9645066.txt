[Brian, David: re-sent to ER as well because they are working on what would go
in the message.]

[ER: here's an idea that relates to the 'protocol' side of how one would apply
EARL or whatever it gets called.]

The function you are describing is equivalent to the Errors-to: header in
email.

A review of the latest email RFCs and the site [overview] profile for RDF
would
see if this is covered in that scheme.? But it seems dead easy to go ahead and
just put:

<meta name="SMTP-equiv" value="Errors-To:&ltedress&gt">

and create a backward-compatible option in that way.
