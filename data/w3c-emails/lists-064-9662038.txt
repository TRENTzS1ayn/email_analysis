That doesn't make much sense to me.  Site Valet (when not set just
to mail to a subscriber's address) will use either of the more
conventional

<link rev="made" href="mailto:author@domain">
<meta name="author" content="mailto:author@domain">

and default to webmaster@domain as last resort.

I don't speak for Mr Streett, but I am firmly recommending - and seeking
sponsors for - incorporating a range of automated repairs into an ISP
service targetted at blind users (and others with accessibility
requirements, or even those who just prefer less junk with their
information).

I have identified a number of repair techniques which I can easily
implement in software, transparently to both page authors and end-users.
I'm not ready to post them publicly (not least because I don't have
the luxury of any income at all if I do this without backing), but
I certainly hope to publish at some point.
