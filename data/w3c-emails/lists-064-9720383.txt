Chaalz, that's what I want to explore, especially since my job is to
provide software that allows people to have "equivalent" (or
perhaps "parallel") experiences using different user interfaces on

I'd like some discussion of what we mean by "equivalent", or even
if that is what we are striving for here.  Maybe we don't mean
equivalent at all.
