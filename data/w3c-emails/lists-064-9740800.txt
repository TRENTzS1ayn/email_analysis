If a person can find out when the train's coming, order flowers, or get a 
synopsis of "War and Peace" using the alternate version.

Ultimately it's pragmatics at its best. Kelly Ford had a problem ordering 
groceries and if the alternate version allows him to do so then it is for 
his purposes equivalent.

Or some such. I don't think he'll be as concerned about sunsets but might 
well like to know something about why they have some emotive affect on the 
retinally-blessed?

Maybe it falls into the "I don't know what it means but I know it when I 
encounter it" category. But I'll bet there's widespread agreement in a lot 
of cases as to whether an "equivalent site" works and we hope to codify 
what it takes to make how to do that clear.
