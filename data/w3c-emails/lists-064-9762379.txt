Here's a start.

Two interfaces are equivalent if:

(1) The same functionality is available in each interface.

(2) The same content is conveyed through each interface.

(3) The same meta-content -- if not interface-dependent -- is conveyed
     though each interface.

(4) The branding/identity components of each interface are
     as similar as possible given the limitations of each
     interface type.

Additionally, each interface should be constructed so as to maximize
the usability of that specific interface by the possible user
types.  (For example, if a screenreader presentation is created,
the interface should be optimized for screenreader use.)

These are the principles we are using at Reef as we build web sites
which edapt to the needs of their users.
