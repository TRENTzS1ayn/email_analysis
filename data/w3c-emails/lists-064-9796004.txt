Not completely. This assumes that you have access to the processing, and that
it does indeed use this system. but it is possible to use arbitrary code, for
example to convert the coordinates on a map into latitude/longitude pairs. I
suspect this is more like what happens for mapping sites, which are one of
the legitimate uses for server-side maps that I can see (i.e. it is rather
difficult to convert them to client side maps).

In general, for applications where there is a dynamic interpretation you
might not be able to do a straightforward conversion and may need to rethink
the process.

In fact I also think that this conversion technique is a WCAG technique
really (which is just to say that it is more broadly useful than just ER
tools).

  Please take a look and let me know if you would like any changes. Does the

  This should resolve open issue #26:
