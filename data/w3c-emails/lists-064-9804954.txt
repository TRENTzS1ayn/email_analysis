I wonder if it's possible to convert Point objects as well? I don't know how
they function, but assume they define a pixel at a certain location. We
could define a rectangle for the same location - e.g., 10,10,10,10 should
define a 1-pixel rectangle at pixel 10,10. That way we can make sure to copy
all active areas over. This could bloat a client-side image map if they were
used a lot, but should work. Michael

Attached is a file that describes the server-side to client-side image map
conversion we use in A-Prompt.

Please take a look and let me know if you would like any changes. Does the
description make sense?

This should resolve open issue #26:
