The difficulty here is getting decent text alternatives for each point. I
think that at some point there is value in looking at a different kind of
user interface  for example selecting a coordinate from a form is a simple
conversion...

  define a 1-pixel rectangle at pixel 10,10. That way we can make sure to copy
  all active areas over. This could bloat a client-side image map if they were
  used a lot, but should work. Michael

  Attached is a file that describes the server-side to client-side image map
  conversion we use in A-Prompt.

  Please take a look and let me know if you would like any changes. Does the
  description make sense?

  This should resolve open issue #26:
