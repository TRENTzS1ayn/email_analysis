For me, personally, the graphics added information in the sense that they 
were concrete examples of the more general terms they illustrated.  For 
example, "interior design" is really an idiom: it means "interior of a 
living space" but it could easily mean design of the interior of a 
PC.  Even though I personally know what it means, I find my mind sort of 
relaxes when given these concrete supports. It is a benefit.  And I suspect 
these concrete examples help people who are blind also.  So they should be 
part of the equivalent.

Hmm.  Perhaps alt text should have "e.g." in front of each picture to make 
it read better?

Of course the pictures also help people with dyslexia but that's not the 
topic of this tread.. we're just talking equivalence here.
