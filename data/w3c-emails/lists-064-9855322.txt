I haven't looked at the site, I just relied on the description of the
graphics. For me the description didn't add to the original, but I agree that
there is an issue.

  For me, personally, the graphics added information in the sense that they
  were concrete examples of the more general terms they illustrated.  For
  example, "interior design" is really an idiom: it means "interior of a
  living space" but it could easily mean design of the interior of a
  PC.  Even though I personally know what it means, I find my mind sort of
  relaxes when given these concrete supports. It is a benefit.  And I suspect
  these concrete examples help people who are blind also.  So they should be
  part of the equivalent.

  Hmm.  Perhaps alt text should have "e.g." in front of each picture to make
  it read better?

  Of course the pictures also help people with dyslexia but that's not the
  topic of this tread.. we're just talking equivalence here.
