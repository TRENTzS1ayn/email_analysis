I just tried this tool for the first time.

On first reading, I had expected it to perform automated online
tests, in the manner of Site Valet or Bobby.  When I found the
response to be very slow, I naturally thought it was fetching
and analysing my page.  But I find it's a purely manual process.

It seems to me that if this tool becomes popular, it could easily
be abused (intentionally or otherwise) to "cry wolf" with bogus
reports.  Indeed, I could even use it as a spam machine, by
pointing a 'bot at it and causing it to crawl the web and mail
messages 'from' Site Valet or any other such service to webmasters.

Most of the tests implied in rep3.cgi *can be* easily automated.
Can I suggest that automation be built into the service where possible,
to help users prepare reports and - more importantly - avoid generating
bogus reports that could devalue the service / bring it into disrepute.

I've got the software, so I can put my money where my mouth is here.
If anyone would like a more detailed proposal, let me know.
