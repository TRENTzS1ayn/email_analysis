Per my action item from today...

I checked the AU document, especially the section on evaluating 
accessibility [1] and did not see the requirement we discussed today, to wit:

Provide means to record the results of manual checks of a document.  This 
enables the author to avoid performing those checks again.

- The manual check results should reference the particular parts of the 
document to which they apply.
- If the document changes, the results document should be updated, but only 
to the extent it's actually impacted by the changes in the document.  For 
example, manual checks of ALT text on an image should not be affected if 
HTML text changes elsewhere.   It may be most convenient to implement this 
feature in object oriented architectures, where each object (e.g. an image 
tag) is responsible for tracking manual accessibility decisions relevent to 
itself.
- A possible format for recording the accessibility decisions is that being 
developed in the EARL activity of ER [2]

If we have consensus within ER on this proposal, I'll send it to AU for 
their consideration.

p.s.
I said  "manual checks of ALT text on an image should not be affected if 
HTML text changes elsewhere"
Hmmm.  Are there actually cases where ALT text would depend on context?
