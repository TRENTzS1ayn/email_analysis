There was a disucssion of using EARL...

There is an implemented EARL designed for measuring conformance to ATAG. The
new source documents have provided anchors for each conformance level
specifically to support any RDF that wants to use this. The checkopints
already have anchors, and they are not going to change their names.

The annotations work being done for Amaya is dealing with a lot of the same
problems - the only difference is that their primary use case calls for HTML
text instead of RDF data as the information about a particular point in a
document.
