Not really a "summary" in this case. A means of tracking which checks 
(especially manual ones) the author asserts having performed, the results 
of said checks, whether anything has changed that requires their being 
re-performed,  etc.

Then, of course, the summary will be  made discoverable by the handy-dandy 
"outside agent".
