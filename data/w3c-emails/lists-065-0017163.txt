Well said.  It's a browser/display issue, not a content issue.  The web
site [2] says the problem goes away at 100mhz, so with the right display,
and the animations turned off by the browser - is the problem solved or
not?

Again we need an expert here, not us wan-a-bees.

BTW, is this now a WCAG issue?
