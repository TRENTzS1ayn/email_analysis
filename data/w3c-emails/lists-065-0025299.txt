I've been in communication with Dr. Harding (one of the people who helped 
write that article as well as a textbook [0] on the subject).  I blind 
cc'ed him on the message to see if he could help.

>BTW, is this now a WCAG issue?

it's always been a WCAG issue.  It's a WCAG 1.0 checkpoint [1] and thus was 
incorporated into WCAG 2.0 [2].  I sent the question to this list since 
WCAG is trying to figure out methods to test to add to our success criteria.
