We'll have to take that the WCAG WG.

In the meantime, I heard back from Professor Harding and there is a system 
that checks for flicker.  It's based on his research and produced by 
Cambridge Research Systems. http://www.hardingfpa.co.uk/

Not sure how much it costs, how easy it is to use, or how well it works on 
web content...but I'll contact CRS to find out.
