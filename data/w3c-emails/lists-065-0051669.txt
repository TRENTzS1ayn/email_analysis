Hmmm. I'm not sure I agree. If I understand correctly, photosensitive
epilepsy is triggered by specific frequencies of flicker that can be
generated by an animated GIF or a Flash file[0], or possibly even dynamic
content altered via a javascript. Achieveing a flicker rate of between 5
and 60 Hz (which is what the website suggest as the most dangerous range)
should be possible even accidentally. Making sure your content does not
contain any such seems emminently suitable for the WCAG, if perhaps a bit
obscure.

But I may be mistaken?


Whether it makes sense to attempt to _test_ for this is a different matter.



[0] - Based on the fact that certain video games and tv programmes that
      for one reason or another (showing strobe lights, say) cause the
      screen to flicker in certain patterns are claimed to induce
      epileptic attacks.
