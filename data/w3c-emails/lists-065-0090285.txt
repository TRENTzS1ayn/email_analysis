Hello,

Let's chat at the usual time and place:

17:00 to 22:00 GMT on Wednesday

    Server: irc.w3.org
    Port: 6665
    Channel: #er

I've been working on a spec.  http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/EARL/

I've been generating it from the schema (xml rdf format). Here's the XSLT 
(kind of ugly, but fun): http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/EARL/earl-spec.xsl

It still needs a lot of work, but I'd like to get some initial reactions 
(i've mostly been playing w/the XSLT instead of writing 
content...suggestions welcome...as well as EARL for the various user 
scenarios towards the end).

Here's the current timeline:
- publish a more polished draft before the F2F (24-26 june)
- do some work on the spec at the F2F
- publish a revision soon after the F2F
- once we all agree on it, publish a working draft to TR and solicit wide 
public review (make sure  to get comments from QAWG, RDF groups, etc.)
- incorporate comments and publish as a Note (there is ongoing discussion 
about whether this will end up as a Note or be put on the Rec track)

Thoughts?  Reactions?

Also, I've been working on an XSLT that transforms LIFT XML output to 
EARL.  Then I hope to do another transform that combines HiSoft EARL and 
LIFT EARL into a checkpoint-by-checkpoint comparison of results for a 
particular resource (i.e. I'm evaluating a mock-site and want to compare 
the results that each tool gives me).

What have you been up to?  Please send a brief report.

Best,
--wendy
