Hello,

I'm playing with ETA, the W3C issue tracking tool.  I've added the 2 issues 
raised during today's chat about the EARL 1.0 working draft.

http://cgi.w3.org/ETA/issuesList.php3/wai/ER/

Please send additional comments about the draft to the list. I'll keep 
track of them using ETA.

Thanks,
--wendy
