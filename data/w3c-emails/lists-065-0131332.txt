<JibberJim> When you say "WebContent is synonymous with "Document Source"
in UAAG
<JibberJim> Is there a proper definition of it in UAAG - google only gave
me http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0132.html
where it's a bit wolly.

check out:
http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/CR-UAAG10-20010912/uaag10#def-document-source

I noted in the EARL schema that "Document Source" in UAAG as defined above
is equivalent to "representation" in RFC 2616, but now I feel that it is
actually equivalent with "entity-body" as defined by section 7 of RFC 2616
since a representation includes both the entitiy body and it headers.
