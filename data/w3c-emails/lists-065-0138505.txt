Hello,

I've run the mock-site that Matt May created [1] through a few eval/repair 
tools.  None of them have caught or warned me about the markup of the table 
of stock price data that is only a couple rows and a couple of 
columns.  The data are separated by br elements.  Thus you read the entire 
list of stock symbols followed by the entire list of stock prices.

Also, when I use table wizards to repair them (again, I haven't tried all 
of them), dividing a single cell into multiple cells is not an option.  It 
seems like that it would be fairly easy to:
1. ask the user if the table is for layout or data
2. if (table is for data)
and (only has a couple rows and columns)
and (a single td contains several br elements)
then
(prompt/assist the user to divide that single cell into multiple cells).

Thoughts?  Do any of the tool developers on the list think this would be 
possible to implement in a future version of your tool?  Since I didn't run 
this through all of the tools, do one/some of them already do this?

Thanks,
