Catching that one is an interesting thought: maybe "anything directly
concerned with layout - eg <br>, <pre> or even <table> - occurring within
a <td>" might generate a warning.  Once the new HTML Valet is fully up-
and-running, you'll be able to incorporate such a test into your own
accessibility schema if it isn't in any of the system-supplied ones.

I can't see how you could try to repair this without human intervention.

Page Valet doesn't pick up on the misuse of <br>, but does generate
quite a lot of complaints about the table, and it seems to me that
if you address the complaints you should see the problem in doing so.

What WCAG checkpoint(s) are being violated specifically by the <br>?
