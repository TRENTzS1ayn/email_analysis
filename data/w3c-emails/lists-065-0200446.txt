I have extended the HTML normaliser to incorporate accessibility testing,
taken from Page Valet.  I'm also messing about with the presentation of
results, and expect soon to offer a choice of HTML renditions, and
an EARL option.

Compared to Page Valet, this is a great deal simpler and more efficient,
but it is not a validating parser.  As of now it is likely also to be
less robust: bug reports much appreciated!

Comments welcome, with the proviso that the presentation aspect is very
definitely work-in-progress.
