Hello,

Based on the feedback I have received from people, I've added to the agenda 
[1] a list of topics to discuss on Monday and Tuesday.  I've included links 
to references for most of the topics.

Please let me know if there is a topic you would like to add.

There's a lot here, so we'll have to prioritize which to cover.  I would 
like to start with the specification since we're aiming to publish 
something to TR in early July.

Best,
--wendy
