Hello,

One comment about the 12 June draft was to group properties and 
classes.  I've added the following section called "Properties of Classes" [1].

Is this what you were looking for?  It's still really rough, but I think it 
makes it more clear as to which properties you can use with which classes.

I treated Assertion differently from the other classes since it's the basic 
building block.  I could do something similar with Evaluation (the more 
basic building block).

Thoughts?
