That's down to RDF, innit?  Without that, we can be much briefer.

That seems to lose much of the structure of the original>

In principle, that's what Valet is doing.  It generates XML that
expresses its findings, and uses XSLT to transform it to formats
such as HTML and EARL.

Not sure about that.  I wouldn't use it directly, because it doesn't
express valet's internal workings (at least, not now).  But if it
could express the two-part test definition + test application problem
discussed in my last post, I'd seriously consider working towards it.
