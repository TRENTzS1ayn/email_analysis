The following resource contains sample EARL data that is probably typical of 
what could be used by working groups to store the results of passing UAs through 
their test suites in preperation of exiting CR.

    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2002Jun/att-0034/01-blah.xml

Specifically, the data represents the result of passing IE6 through the static 
tests of the HTML version of the Selectors test suite (128 results).
