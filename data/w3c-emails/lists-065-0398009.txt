Alright, this is a bit of an old issue, but I'm starting to reconsider it.
To convert an {:x :asserts :y} triple into a {:y :assertedBy :x} triple is
really not a big deal, so on the one hand I think it'd be reasonable to let
people use either, but on the other it should also be reasonable to let
people author with asserts/assertedBy as they wish, and then get them to
normalize to assertedBy on the output.

Neither earl:asserts nor earl:assertedBy carry any intrinsic advantage over
the other (there are test cases in XML RDF for each where you can cut down
the amount of XML junk), hence my resistance at making an arbitrary choice.
Moreover, I'm just used to writing "earl:asserts" by now! It's not a major
issue, but it really bugs me.
