It would be possible to convert *some* EARL instances into the abbreviated
form, but I was thinking of it mainly in an Authoring=>Publication
scenario. I agree that since most EARL is likely to be produced by tools,
it means that there is less (i.e. virtually no) use for an abbreviated
syntax, but perhaps some of the spin-off applications (thinking about the
EARL model, and porting the approach over to other RDF languages that *are*
authored by hand) will prove more productive.

The other main benefit for abbreviated EARL is that you can easily validate
it: validation of EARL has been an issue for quite some time, and linear
XML subsets of EARL--whilst not being as expressive as M&S XML RDF--are at
least validatable.

Right: I wasn't proposing the abbreviated format for storing EARL: it's not
as expressive as XML RDF and N3, and it's not as efficient for reports with
an {o{s, p}} optimal model (as you pointed out to me). In other words, I
don't expect people to use it for interchange; rather, I think it would be
useful for people producing a lot of EARL by hand, or even just a lot of
EARL that they don't want to have to store using such a verbose format.

Right; since it's XML, it has no particular model, which is why we use RDF
for EARL in the first place. However, all of the answers to the questions
asked above (and therefore the "specification" to some extent for the
abbreivated syntax) are in the XSLT sheet that I attached to the original
email. As I said in the original email, if people expect to actually use
this for anything, I don't mind writing up documentation for it, and some
sort of schema to validate it against.
