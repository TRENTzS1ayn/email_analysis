Cool stuff. The idea for a linear version of EARL in XML has been floating
around for a long time, but this is the most comprehensive schema so far.
In fact, the use of para in some of the documentationproperties is an
extension: I hadn't thought about allowing XML structures in there
(although that's an RDF grey area).

The same kind of issues raised about
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2002Jun/0029 apply here:
that an abbreviated syntax is not useful for the majority of people that
automatically produce EARL; that validation is the main advantage, as long
as a standard transformation is used; that consensus must be reached upon
the level of features to be included in the linear format.
