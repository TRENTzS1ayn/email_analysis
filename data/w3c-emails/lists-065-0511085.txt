My own view is not against the idea of providing a failurePoint or
whatever, but that the scope of "where it has failed" is too general to
be in EARL, I think it needs to be an extension, we can hang anything off
of the resultProperty, but information that locates where in a xml
document it fails or elsewhere is too specific to be in core EARL.

So I guess my problem can be solved if you can tell me what would it look
like in a few of our use cases?

Jim.
