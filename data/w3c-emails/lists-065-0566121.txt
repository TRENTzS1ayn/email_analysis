Hmmm ... I have another consideration, which is that I want my users to
generate this test definition language via a few simple CGI forms.
I need something that will work with a very simple frontend.

Valet doesn't do that.  Some Valet tests do analyse text nodes, but they
act on an element and look at the text it contains.  For example, a
<th> with no abbr attribute and too many words, will generate a
warning suggesting an abbreviation.

Good point.  My schema is intended to be general-purpose, but I hadn't
considered that particular issue.  If I got the general-purpose right,
it should presumably work.

Yes, I think we can & probably should introduce this and other
EARL vocabulary.  But not tonight!

That's what I'm doing ... the use of <valet:code> was just 'cos I
didn't think of anything more imaginative to call it.

Sounds good to me.
