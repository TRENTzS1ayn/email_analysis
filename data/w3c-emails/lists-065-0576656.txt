  Hmmm ... I have another consideration, which is that I want my users to
  generate this test definition language via a few simple CGI forms.
  I need something that will work with a very simple frontend.

ep, I agree. I think this will take us some time to get right. And this is an
important use case. (Build use cases, and work out what they require, Then
we work out for real what the format looks like and whether it meets our
needs)

  Valet doesn't do that.  Some Valet tests do analyse text nodes, but they
  act on an element and look at the text it contains.  For example, a
  <th> with no abbr attribute and too many words, will generate a
  warning suggesting an abbreviation.

Right, but to make this valuable (to anyone other than you ;-) It needs to be
generalisable beyond Valet. See your next response ;-)

  Good point.  My schema is intended to be general-purpose, but I hadn't
  considered that particular issue.  If I got the general-purpose right,
  it should presumably work.

  Yes, I think we can & probably should introduce this and other
  EARL vocabulary.  But not tonight!

sure...

  That's what I'm doing ... the use of <valet:code> was just 'cos I
  didn't think of anything more imaginative to call it.

  Sounds good to me.
