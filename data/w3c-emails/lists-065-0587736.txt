Sorry, my last reply gave a politicians answer to that one:-(

In the sample posted, I defined the object of the test definition
as a collection of things like
  <html:element>img</html:element>

Valet also uses tests on <html:attribute> - for example, on encountering a
color attribute it applies a test hasPeerAttr to check that a background
is also specified.  It could just as well apply to anything else in an
html: namespace, or - perhaps better - a dom: namespace.  That includes
text and cdata nodes, etc.

Generalising a bit further, if the subject of the tests isn't markup,
then neither is the object of the test spec.  So if we want to apply
a test definition language more widely, we will have to allow
something else in our object.  Seems fine to me.

What would Hixie need to use for CSS tests?
