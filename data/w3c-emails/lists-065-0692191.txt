Can you provide me with the Algae queries you use, and pages where you
have annotations stored.  So far all Algae Queries I do on EARL submitted
comes back all disconnected graphs, losing all the information - I assume
it's my queries, but haven't yet solved the problem.

For example, the algae:
(ask '(
 (http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/0.95#testSubject ?b ?s)
 (http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#predicate ?q
http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/0.95#fails )
) collect '())

returns (modified to be valid.)
http://jibbering.com/2002/2/earl-0.95-annotest-result.rdf
http://jibbering.com/2002/2/earl-0.95-annotest-result.svg

which doesn't associate the testSubject with the predicate, I always get
this result.  I need Algae help!

I have two clients which both post straight XML without problems, the
above page is wrong, but only in that it omits the <?xml ... > with that
included it works fine for me - what problems do you have?

http://jibbering.com/2002/2/annoteaearlnew.rdf is a typical submitted
XML, with:
  Content-Type: application/xml
  Accept: text/xml
  user-agent: FillyJonk IRC Bot
  Content-Length: 1000

as the headers (content length obviously accurate.)

I definately don't like this for submission - url length is getting long,
I don't trust proxy's even if I can trust annotest to be okay with it.

This is solved if you use one of the test-servers - I'll leave it to
EricP if he wants to open it up to the list.

Also I believe it's important we agree on a namespace to use, algae
queries really need to know what namespace you are using and it would be
nice if we could all use the same one.
