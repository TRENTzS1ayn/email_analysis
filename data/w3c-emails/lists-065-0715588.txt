We're working it out on IRC now.  I think I understand now how to structure
a query, but I'll need to do some exploring.  I'm not sure I entirely
understand what's going on with what I get returned, though.

(ask
     '((http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type ?a
          http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/0.95#Person)
          ) :collect '(?a))

Returns:

<earl:Person
    xmlns:earl="http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/0.95#">
      <a:Attribution
r:resource="http://iggy.w3.org/annotations/attribution/1014886708.379036" />
   </earl:Person>

along with a bunch of empty earl:Person tags.

I'm assuming all the empty Person tags come from every report that matched,
but why is there only one with the annotea Attribution?  It's always the
same attribution, too.  Eric told me that that one attribution would point
to a combination of the reports that matched, but it doesn't seem to.

Ahh... I had left that off.  It works fine now with straight XML, thank you.

I'm still using POST.  The only difference is the URL-encoding.  So
apparently the script accepts both methods.  I'm glad to not have to
url-encode now.

Yes... unfortunately, EARL looks like it's going to continue to change.  Is
it time to decide on a 1.0 now?
