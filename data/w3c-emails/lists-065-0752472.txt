Oops - something I didn't mention: b) will basically be the most
complicated to query, followed by c), and with a) as the easiest. It's
annoying that the "broken" option is also the easiest to query. Of
course, if we want to go with it, we can just draft up some prose
saying "hey, you've got to put an rdf:type property arc on your
TestSubject, and it has to tell us what kind of test subject it is
w.r.t. evaluating".
