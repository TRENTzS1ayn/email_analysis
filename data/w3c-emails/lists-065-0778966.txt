Agreed, and well-put.

Noted.

Coincedentally, Jonathan Borden just published a modelling of HTTP
transactions in RDF.

   http://www.openhealth.org/xmtp/HTTP
   Modelling HTTP in RDF, March 1, 2002

Although he uses the RFC's IANA URI as a namespace which I consider to
be in error, it's a vocabularly that may be worth using in EARL.

I love (isl: hr?fast) the idea of having a transaction metadata
property cascade for query engines, but doing "else if" in declarative
queries is not all that easy, in my experience. I also don't think
it's a true one dimensional cascade: you may want to query according
to several of the properties, for example by location, the HTTP last
modified date, *and* the actual local timestamp.

Aside: or some checksum derived from a part of the representation, as
per Nick's experiments.

Fair enough... but on the same page, we can't be too specific as to
the type of information that is attached for disambiguation; e.g. we
can't force people to use hashes.

Which may well have been caused by a rigidity in the test case
frameworks - not allowing for extra information because it would bork
the mechanism, and cost too much money. The fact that we're using a
decentralized/Webized format doesn't solve that problem - even though
creating a new property is just a matter of minting a new URI for it -
because deploying the changes still takes effort. But the
decentralization might help someone, somewhere.

Good point.

SHA is genrally considered safer for huge databases, and since EARL
promotes test cases being stored on a global scale, perhaps SHA-1 is
not secure enough (although there have been no noted collisions to
date).

As a UUID, you mean?

Ooh, stunningly good point, but what does this mean in terms of the
EARL model/vocabulary? I wanted to create classes that let the
assertor [1] of the evaluation tell people how they interpreted the
test subject with regards to their particular test. In other words, I
think that the EARL test subject sub classes are too objective to
merit your "police car" example as being a valid analogy.

[1] Archaic? But Kant, R.S.Candlish, and Prior seem to have used it
according to a cursory Google search. "er" seems counter intuitive to
me, and not as phenomic. And then there's Aaron's wonderful
intentional misquoting of Thomas Macaulay: "<AaronSw> The assertors of
liberty said [assertor was] not a word." OTOH, we could have used
"Rsigosrig": it wouldn't have mattered.

P.S. At the moment, there are 987 results for "assertor" on Google,
and 7 of those on the front page are EARL-related :-)
