OK, so I had a go at writing some things up...

It is pretty rough still, but I guess it is a start. I will try to get more
into it...

cheers

  Just to put on record and follow up to what I said earlier on IRC
  when Chaals raised this subject.

  (1) A longer-term goal for Page Valet is to offer a full-blown API
  for users to define their own set of tests, e.g. as an XML schema
  or as EARL.  This will serve to support XAG, and could of course
  easily be applied to SVG.

  (2) At a much simpler level, it would be possible to create a set
  of tests for SVG within the existing Page Valet, if I had a suitable
  set of guidelines to work from.  For example, it would be a matter
  of just a few minutes work to offer checks for title and desc
  within each <g> element.

  (3) I've now looked at http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG-access (from which I
  picked up the example of checking for title and desc), and I don't
  think I can use it in isolation as guidelines for this.  If anyone
  has better guidelines, I can take a look.  Or alternatively, if
  anyone cares to open a discussion here?

  (4) Anything implemented in Page Valet will automatically share the
  full range of report formats (XML, HTML, EARL and EARL->Annotea).
