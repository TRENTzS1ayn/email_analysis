Yep (and a lively discussion that was)!  Fundamentally we should add
not only a time dimension (my original point) but also an HTTP
dimension before our pointers are reliable.

Dealing with HTTP is simpler, insofar as we can make the assumption
that two equivalent requests will generate equivalent responses.
We should however extend the protocols to keep a record of HTTP
negotiation headers[1], so we can be sure we're not annotating
totally different resources.

Yep.  I think I'll crosspost this back to ER, in case anyone from
our original discussion has more to say.

[1] simple test: where there's a Vary header, keep a record of the values
    used for negotiable headers in the request as part of a pointer.
