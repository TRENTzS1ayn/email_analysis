Hi All,

I volunteered to arrange a meeting time for ERT this week. As
usual, we're going to be holding it on IRC:-

   Server: irc.w3.org
   Port: 6665
   Channel: #er

But we need to arrange a mutually acceptable time. Wendy is quite
busy this week, so I'm not sure how things will fit in for her.
Nick is free on Wed and Thur, but busy on Tues and Fri. Jim will
be available on Wed, but I'm not sure about the rest of the week.

As a last resort, we could open over a period of a few hours -
say 17:00 to 22:00 GMT on Wednesday - and then people can just
chat whenever they are able to. Wednesday seems to have worked
quite well in the past, although 16:00 is generally too early for
me... and 17:00 onwards may be too late for Nadia and Chaals.

Suggestions?
