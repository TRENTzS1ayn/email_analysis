We will be posting the actionlog and latest working draft this afternoon.
They will both be linked to from the GL home page.

>> Discussion: Comment1:  Section 2 Recommendation 5. We should also add
>> "descriptive link title", or "description anchor title" to disambiguate
>> with the IMG title.(the example is clear, but it's dropped from the
>> checklist for instance)
>> Comment2:   this might make the guideline confusing. The checklist
>> is to remind them. The guidelines includes the example if there is
confusion.

>I think there is a real risk of misunderstanding and using the IMG
