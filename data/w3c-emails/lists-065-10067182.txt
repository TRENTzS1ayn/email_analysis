>  WAI Accessibility Guidelines: Master Reference Document
>  WAI-MASTERREF
PJ:: I agree (with 'Document' deleted, guidelines document is redundant and sounds like a printed book)

>  WAI Accessibility Guidelines: Authoring Tools
>  WAI-AUTHTOOLS
PJ:: I would add "hosting" to include other tools that (for example) automatically generate pages from non-html sources that don't really have end-author interaction.  : Authoring and Hosting Tools. The code name AUTHTOOLS is fine.

>  WAI Accessibility Guidelines: Browsers
>  WAI-BROWSER
PJ:: From these titles I'm not sure where guidelines for the screen reader manufactures, speaking browser manufactures, and the soon to come out speaking agents (in automobiles) and other assistive technology developers would be found.  So, I would suggest both a more general and specific title: "Browsers and Assistive Technology".  I had considered "User Agents" but rejected the term as "unknown and too academic" IMHO.  The code name BROWSER"S" (with an s added) is fine.


>  WAI Accessibility Guidelines: Page Authoring
>  WAI-PAGEAUTH
PJ:: I really like the 'old EXISTING' title of MARKUP guidelines.  MARKUP doesn't steer one to think of only pages, nor only authoring them, nor does it sound like 'authoring tools' - which might be confusing later on. MARKUP talks about the HTML source, whether authored by an individual using an editor, or an authoring tools, or generated on the fly from pieces of stuff, or style markup, or issues for whole sites (not just page).  Maybe I missed the rational for changing, but I like MARKUP best.  : Markup.  WAI-MARKUP code name is fine.


>  WAI Accessibility Guidelines: Users [if we do that set]
>  WAI-USERS
>GF:  I don't think "Users" is clear.  Is a user someone...
>JB:  Yes, this name needs more work.
PJ:: I would suggest "Surfers".  Surfing the web is a well known term, includes the idea of reading, listening, even feeling the experience... And, yes I think we need a set of guideline that would really be the base s
