Yes.

Actually, "User Agents" is very clear, and probably no more unknown than
"Hosting."  Other reactions?

>PJ:: I really like the 'old EXISTING' title of MARKUP guidelines.  MARKUP
doesn't steer one to think of only pages, nor only authoring them, nor does
it sound like 'authoring tools' - which might be confusing later on. MARKUP
talks about the HTML source, whether authored by an individual using an
editor, or an authoring tools, or generated on the fly from pieces of
stuff, or style markup, or issues for whole sites (not just page).  Maybe I
missed the rational for changing, but I like MARKUP best.  : Markup.
WAI-MARKUP code name is fine.

Markup was confusing to a # of people, we kept getting questions.

And, yes I think we need a set of guideline that would really be the base s

Has some zing, too...
