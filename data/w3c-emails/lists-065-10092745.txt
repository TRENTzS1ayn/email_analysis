I was wondering if there hasn't been enough noise about
client/server architecture so that 

"WAI Accessibility Guidelines: Client Software" 

would pass as general English.

To me User Agent says "the program that does HTTP" in a way that
"Client" doesn't.  I am not quite sure.  But if subjected to a 
poll, I would say "Client Software" was more likely to be understood
to include the screen reader [or other adaptive accessory] and 
"User Agent" was more likely to be interpreted to exclude it.  This
is funny.  Neither can be trusted to convey a precise meaning to the
breadth of our readership.
