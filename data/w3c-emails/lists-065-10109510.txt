From these titles I'm not sure where guidelines for the screen reader
manufactures, speaking browser manufactures, and the soon to come out
speaking agents (in automobiles) and other assistive technology developers
would be found.  So, I would suggest both a more general and specific
title: "Browsers and Assistive Technology".  I had considered "User Agents"
but rejected the term as "unknown and too academic" IMHO.  The code name
BROWSER"S" (with an s added) is fine.

Actually, "User Agents" is very clear, and probably no more unknown than
"Hosting."  Other reactions?

GF:  I think "user agent" is very unclear.  BROWSERS would be a better term (despite what I said earlier...), or BROWSERS AND something else.  Phill is right-- "user agent" is too academic and I don't think it conveys a concept that is instantly recognizable.  To everyone in the industry, "user agent" might mean something.  I don't think I've ever heard anyone else use it to refer to their browser.

geoff.

Yes.

>PJ:: I really like the 'old EXISTING' title of MARKUP guidelines.  MARKUP
doesn't steer one to think of only pages, nor only authoring them, nor does
it sound like 'authoring tools' - which might be confusing later on. MARKUP
talks about the HTML source, whether authored by an individual using an
editor, or an authoring tools, or generated on the fly from pieces of
stuff, or style markup, or issues for whole sites (not just page).  Maybe I
missed the rational for changing, but I like MARKUP best.  : Markup.
WAI-MARKUP code name is fine.

Markup was confusing to a # of people, we kept getting questions.

And, yes I think we need a set of guideline that would really be the base s

Has some zing, too...
