Hello all,

Let's schedule a period of a few  hours - 17:00 to 22:00 GMT on Wednesday - 
and then people can chat whenever they are able.

    Server: irc.w3.org
    Port: 6665
    Channel: #er

Agenda:
- At a previous chat last Wednesday we noted one issue:
1. Identifying specific elements on the page. XPointers are ideal, but they 
can change as the document is modified. Jim and Nick implemented fuzzy 
pointers - Nick's statement of problem and proposal for solution - 11 April 
2002.  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2002Apr/0029.html
charles makes a locations proposal:

- Here are agenda items not covered in previous weeks:
1.  i want to go through the ontology and make sure that all the Things 
that could be asserted to be disjoint are [from EricP]
2. cardinality (particularly of dates) [from wendy and eric]
3. test corpus [from Nick]
4. direction forward: goal is stable EARL. based on earl test 1.0? slimmed 
down more? [from wendy]
