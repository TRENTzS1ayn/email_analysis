In a message just sent to the WAI interest group, I remarked that the page
author guidelines were intended for several distinct audiences: (1)
individuals who are creating web content; (2) software developers whose
applications, whether they be authoring tools, file conversion packages or
other products, generate documents in formats such as HTML which are
intended for delivery via the Web. A brief note drawing attention to the
intended audience could be added to the introductory paragraphs of the
document, thus drawing it to the attention of the groups for whom it was
written.

Also, the authoring tool guidelines should refer to the page author
guidelines, and explain how software tools can implement them (E.G. by
including in the user interface features which encourage appropriate
practice).
