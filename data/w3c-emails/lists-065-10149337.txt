I think this recommendation needs to be specific to HTML. Basically, the
ALT attribute is always required to be included with any IMG element,
whether or not it appears in the content of an anchor. The advisory TITLE
on anchor may be helpful, but if the content of the anchor is an image
with ALT text, then the title attribute would appear to be redundent,
except under those circumstances in which it is necessary to provide both
a description of the image and, separately, the title of the resource to
which the link refers. Normally however, an image acting as an anchor does
not convey any content other than an indication of the destination of the
link, and thus only the ALT text is needed.
