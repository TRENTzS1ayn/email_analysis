DD:: I don't really understand what Hosting means in that context.

I'd keep it just "Authoring Tools", and make sure "batch" not just
"interactive" authoring programs are included.(The AU group charter
doesn't specify, so it's for both).

DD:: I like Al's "Client Software"

DD:: I agree with the remark that says that these guidelines are
really for people that *knows* about the Markup, not just people
authoring pages with a nice GUI tool. So I prefer Markup too.
