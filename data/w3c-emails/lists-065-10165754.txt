JW:: Without re-reading the HTML specification on this point, I am under
the impression that any markup inside the PRE element (prior to the end
tag of PRE itself) is treated as part of the preformatted text rather than
as markup. My memory may be wrong here, however. If I am right, then using
the CLASS attribute of the PRE element to distinguish code from text in a
natural language would appear to be the only feasible option.
