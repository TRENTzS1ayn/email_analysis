DD:: I concur.
I'd add that first thing in this intro.

DD:: Also need to fix the mention of "the DOM working group." in the Status
section.


DD:: on 1. StyleSheets
As I said before, it was not my intent to change using SS as
Recommended.
The way it looks now is nad: a Required that says "make sure it works
without SS" and a Rec that says use it. Bottom line sounds too much
like a "do not use them".
Please revert to Required and change the order to use first and unsure
second.

DD:: 2.1 Image ALT
I think 2.1.4 that would say something like : for decoration image,
uses ALT="", even if we don't all agree, is better than saying nothing
on the topic in the first public draft.

DD:: 9.1 Frames and NOFRAME
I still think strongly that we got this one backward: it's not a
[New], it's an interim (even though FRAMESET are new in HTML4, they've
been around for a long while in products, and lynx already handles
them).


DD:: Regarding Issue 5 "Need more examples for AUDIO/VIDEO"
Question: Do you want examples of transcripts or how to link to the
transcripts?  Most of these guidelines discuss creating separate
documents and would be hard to create HTML specific examples for.
DD:: Yes, I would like to see example of how to link to transcripts.

DD:: Regarding Issue 7 "list that use image as bullet here"
OK we need to discuss more the case, but I think the part that explain
how to deal with purely decorative bullet is a no brainer
UL { list-style: url(button.png) }
There is no opportunity to put any ALT in here anyway.

DD: Regarding Issue 8: "Offer navigation bars"
I proposed <div class=navbar>.
Comment 2: Should we wait to recommend this until the UI group has
created a guideline for the browser side of things?
DD:: yeah, you're probably right, we need to wait for the UI group to
tell us what they need in terms of Markup to achieve a good UI.
