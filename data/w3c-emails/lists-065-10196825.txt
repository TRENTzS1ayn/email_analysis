AG::
I agree that the <div class=navbar> solution is conjectural until
the browser implementors consider their options.  Markup-aware
navigation where the "start" command takes you to the senior
header[1] in the document, could be one other way to work this
problem.

What I might like to see here is a some sort of a caution, with a
hyperlink to wherever the "too many introductory links" problem
is discussed.

This is an area where the technology doesn't yet offer a
universal solution, so an unqualified "Do this:" is misleading.

Note [1]:  Senior header could be the first H1, and if no H1
the first H2, etc.
