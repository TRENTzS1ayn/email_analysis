Just for the record, very little is said in the HTML 4.0 spec
about "longdesc". I don't believe user agents are required to
support it (you'll see intentionally vague language about this
in the spec, as desired by the Working Group). Consequently,
I don't think its employment by authors should be required
(already the case).
