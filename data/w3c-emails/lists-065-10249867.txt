In the discussion of navigation bars on this list, it has been noted,
correctly, that further work is needed in this area, both in the PF group
and in respect of the interfaces provided by HTML user agents. It would
however seem clear that some means of isolating the HTML block comprising
the navigation bar is needed, such as the use of the DIV element with
CLASS="navbar". Perhaps this could be introduced into the guidelines as a
"new" and "recommended" item.

Also, it may be preferable for authors to use the LINK element within the
head section of the document, together with the link types listed in
section 6.12 of the HTML specification, whenever practical, as a
substitute for a navigation bar in the body of the document. The rendering
of the LINK element is left entirely to the user agent, and this maximises
the availability of presentation (braille or speech-based software could
provide a user interface option that offers access to the list of links in
the head of the document, rather than presenting them at the start of the
document itself). This strategy would of course require complementary work
within the UI group to ensure that visual user agents provide a common and
acceptable rendering of LINK elements.
