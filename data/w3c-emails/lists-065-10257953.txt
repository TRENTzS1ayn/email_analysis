A word of caution:  please don't post this thread onto the WAI IG list (two
messages have already gone there, I think by accident); if it generates 30
messages on the GL list I dread the volume it will generate on the IG list.

I did not suspect such impassioned debate about naming.

Thank you to Phill Jenkins for summarizing the dialog so far.  Lots of good
points made.  Regarding the suggestion to work it out in the charters, the
charters have already been developed & approved by W3C, & I think they
clearly state their scope and expected deliverables.  If you look back at
the charters and feel that there are gaps, please send comments to the
chair of that group.  Working group charters are periodically revised & we
can adjust scope at that time.

I suggest we leave the discussion here, and let the chairs of the three
guidelines-related groups work it out between them, in coordination with
WAI/W3C.
