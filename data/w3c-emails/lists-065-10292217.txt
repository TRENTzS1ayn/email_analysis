I noticed that a number of the response postings went something like:

Although I will take blame for any errors and omissions in the posts and 
editing of the guidelines , I want to be sure that everyone is aware of the 
herculean role that Wendy Chisholm is playing in the guidelines.    Many of 
the postings that list all the changes end up with my name at the bottom 
because I end up posting them after the final review and discussions 
(between editors and co-chairs etc.).    But the bulk of the hard work 
compiling everyone's comments, and processing, reviewing, smithing and 
maintaining the guidelines documents has been done by Wendy.   (And it has 
been a beast, especially the last few months and weeks).   Im posting this 
note just so credit goes where credit is due.

Thanks Wendy - from us all.
