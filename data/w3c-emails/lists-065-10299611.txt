Having read the editors' helpful comments in their recent summary of
changes, I would suggest that the guidelines indicate that future user
agents supporting speech and/or braille output may alter the reading order
of the document. In particular, navigation bars may be read only in
response to a command issued by the user, or may be moved to the end of
the document so that they are not repetitively announced at the start of
each page on a site. To facilitate such intervention, authors are advised
to identify explicitly the block of HTML that comprises the navigation
bar: E.G. <div class="navbar"> [...] </div> or to use LINK in the head of
the document as a substitute. The second alternative only applies where
the target documents provide tables of contents, indeces, previous and
next sections in a composite document, etc., and can thus be classified
according to the link types listed in section 6.12 of the HTML spec.
