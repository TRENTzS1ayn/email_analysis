There actually is an issue here.  Using &mdash; is more universal
than &#151;

Do the WAI Page Author guidelines deal with this at all at
present?

What does HTML4.0 say about this?  [sorry not to be telling you]
Ian?  I am sure there was a lot of thought given to
internationalization in the development of HTML4 and I don't have
it on the top of my head.

Is there a note from Dan Connolly somewhere about "Charsets
considered harmful?"  Is this W3C policy, or personal opinion?

Hi

I've just noticed that the Lie and Bos book on CSS
(www.awl.com/css/) has this under the list of special
characters:

&mdash;

However NN4 does not seem to support it :-(

Should there be something in the WAI check list advising
people not to use things like &#151;?
