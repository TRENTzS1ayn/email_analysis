Unfortunately, on today's Web, &#151; is more universal despite not being 
a valid character in any HTML standard.  Few browsers support &mdash; 
(notably missing is Netscape), but all Windows and Mac browsers that I 
know of except Lynx show &#151; as an em dash.

I still recommend two hyphens in place of &mdash; or &#151;.
