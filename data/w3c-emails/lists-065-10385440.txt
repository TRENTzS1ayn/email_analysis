JB:  I think this is an interesting point.  Many people who are potentially
interested in these guidelines really don't know about the assistive
technologies involved, but would like to.  This goes among the "most
frequently asked" questions I get.  Even two sentences introducing adaptive
computing, combined with links to more info, would give people somewhere to
start.
