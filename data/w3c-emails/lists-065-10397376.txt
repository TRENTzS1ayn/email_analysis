cpl:: Judy and Jason - I agree with Gregg... I thought that "a summary of
the issues" was the purpose of the level 2 document.  The fact that it has
not been written yet (at least, not specifically for the WAI) is a bit of a
problem.  Should we be asking for a volunteer to get started on that section?
