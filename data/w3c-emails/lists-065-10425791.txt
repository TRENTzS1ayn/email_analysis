I think that my original position has been somewhat overlooked in the
ensuing discussion. What I am suggesting is:

1. A paragraph of two of text introducing assistive technology, in the
appendix to the guidelines.

2. A sentence referring to this information, included in the introduction.

Given that the appendix already includes (1) checklist, (2)
acknowledgments, and (3) references, and that it is not part of the
guidelines proper, I do not think that the issue of unduly lengthening the
guidelines genuinely arises. An author who wishes to do so can retrieve
the document via the web, read quickly through the introduction and the
guidelines, and then ignore the appendix, without any loss of efficiency.

I would also reiterate Judy's point that "how does a person with a visual
disability use a computer, let alone the web?" must be placed at the top
of my list of frequently asked questions, in any discussion of these
issues with people who are unacquainted with assistive technology. A brief
explanation would not only satisfy understandable curiosity, but also
provide insight into the rationale for the guidelines. The more interested
readers can then refer to the level 2 document or the central reference
document for a more detailed analysis.
