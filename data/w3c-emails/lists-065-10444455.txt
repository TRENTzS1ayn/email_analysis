For the benefit of those reading the archives, the original message to

This is indeed precisely the principle which I have been advocating in
this working group for some time, and which I understand to have been
accepted as a broad position of concensus.

I partially agree. The ALT text, however, is appropriate in that it both
identifies the presence of the graphic and indicates the nature of its
contents. However, it would be inadequate unless accompanied by a long
description, which would convey the detailed information presented in the
graph, for instance by means of a table or by a description of the graph.
In an educational setting in particular, or if a person with a disability
is discussing the information with her/his colleagues who are viewing the
graph, it is helpful to know at least which axis is used to express which
variable.

The example should be modified to include the LONGDESC attribute.

The question here is whether it is important for the reader to know that
there is a logo present at this point in the document, as well as the name
of the company. The best solution to this problem would actually identify
both the name of the organisation and indicate the signifiance of the
logo. For an excellent example, see http://www.srl.rmit.edu.au

I agree. The logo is best described perhaps only once, on the home page.
Thereafter, it could be treated as decorative and receive a null ALT
value.

I agree.
