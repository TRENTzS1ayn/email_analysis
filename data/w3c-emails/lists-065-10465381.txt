An important correction to what I just wrote is as follows. With regard to
the "logo" example, a brief description of the logo is appropriate on the
home page (here the purpose is primarily to acquaint visitors to the site
of the organisation's logo). On subsequent pages, just the name of the
organisation would suffice.
