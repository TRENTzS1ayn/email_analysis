I've tinkered a little more with it since our earlier discussion.
Nothing I do seems to improve the appearance of the RDF, or the
number of anonymous nodes, but I haven't finished with trying yet.
I will revisit my IRC log - in particular Wendy and Nadia's comments -
within the next day or two.

I have implemented Jim's suggestion of accepting Content-Location
as an identifier.
