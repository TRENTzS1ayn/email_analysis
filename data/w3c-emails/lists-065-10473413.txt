I agree with Liam's interpretation. To simplify the matter, I would
suggest that the TITLE attribute should not be used in connection with
IMG. Use ALT to provide a genuine substitute for the image which conveys
the informational content of the image, or, if associated with a long
description, gives it an identifying label so that the reader can decide
whether to access the resource referred to by the LONGDESC attribute.

TITLE on anchor elements is perfectly acceptable, and indeed the HTML 4.0
specification clearly demarcates its role as providing the title of the
resource to which the link refers. It is an "advisory" title in the sense
that it is displayed prior to the actual retrieval of the information
designated by the link.
