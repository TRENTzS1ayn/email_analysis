And as you know, I strongly disagree with your interpretation :)

A lot of HTML books have mistakes in them.  The fact that the W3C 
Recommendations have never been clear on ALT increases the likelihood of 
misinterpretation.

No.  What I'm saying is use TITLE as descriptive information in all cases. 
 When you use TITLE with A elements, you're describing the link, not 
providing the function of the link (since the function--more information--
is implicit in the link itself).  Using TITLE to describe an IMG makes it 
consistent with other uses of TITLE.

I don't see the exception.  In your example the TITLE of the IMG describes 
the graphic and the TITLE of the A describes the link.  It seems perfectly 
consistent and natural.

Why does a text-only user *need* (ALT being required) to know that there 
is a picture of the world?  How does that help, when the point of the 
image is as an entrance to another page?  If I saw or heard "picture of 
the world", what would I expect to find upon following the link?  Probably 
a JPEG or GIF of the world.

The ALT attribute is required on IMG because the function of the image is 
vital to text-only users.  What the image looks like may be of interest to 
some text-only users, so we have the TITLE and LONGDESC attributes, which 
are optional.  If TITLE were to give the all-important function of the 
image, it should be required in HTML 4.0.

The function of an image is context-sensitive, so the fact that the 
image's pixels are not functional on their own does not mean that the IMG 
element--as used in the document--has no function.

So you're using TITLE on A to describe the function of the IMG?  That 
seems counter-intuitive.  TITLE on A should describe the link, and should 
be independent of the image or text that anchors the link.

TITLE is not replacing ALT.  ALT always was, to me (and I assumed others), 
used to give the function of the image, since this is what is useful to 
the person not loading images.  TITLE provides the long-desired ability to 
describe the image, especially useful for those using graphical browsers 
with image loading disabled.

>getting it accepted.

The meaning of ALT as I've always understood, and as documented for years 
at <http://ppewww.ph.gla.ac.uk/%7Eflavell/alt/alt-text.html>, is to 
provide a replacement for browsers not loading images.
