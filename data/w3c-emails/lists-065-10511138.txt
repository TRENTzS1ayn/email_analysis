Since TITLE is part of anchors, couldn't TITLE just be the TITLE in the
HEADER block of the document that the anchor references?

This seems very straight forward and the user would not need to think abut
it to much if the TITLE has aready been defined in the other document.
Authoring tools could also easily use the TITLE information of the
referenced document to fill in the TITLE statement automatically without
the author even needing to know about it.

ALT text would be a description of the image.
