JRG: This could be an option in the browser, but an author or authoring
tool could use just look at the title in the header of a URL (either
electronically or with a browser) and insert the title text in the TITLE
attribute of the ANCHOR element.  People were discussing simple usage
strategies for TITLE, ALT and LONGDESC.  This seemed to be one option that
I thought would be good for the TITLE attribute.
