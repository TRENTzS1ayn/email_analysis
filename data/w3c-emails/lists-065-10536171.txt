I think Jon was thinking more in terms of authoring tools that of
browsers, although both options are possible.

The issue with authoring tools is that pages the might be authored
off-line and the "automaric title extraction" is not possible,
otherwise, it could be nice addition as it can help validating the
link going out of a page at authoring time.
