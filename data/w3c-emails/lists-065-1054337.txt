[[[
18:44:37 <ericP> it may be handy to move assertedBy into a separate
namespace to encourage others to reuse it for non-earl purposes
]]] - http://notabug.com/er/chatlogs/2002-05-22.html

The important thing is that it's documented as being reusable, and is given
an unrestrictive domain and range in the schema. The comment for the
property in the most recent schema reads:-

[[[
For earl:assertedBy(y,x), in general, the assertor (x) asserts the
assertion (y). EARL has specific classes for the domain/range
]]]

but it could do with a bit more documentation, I suppose. Note that the
restrictions on using the property on EARL are geven as DAML restrictions
on the Assertor class, not as domain and ranges on the assertedBy property.

[[[
18:53:44 <nadia> um, aaron doesn't like assertedBy because it's a verb and
not a noun?
]]] - ibid.

Right, but Aaron and I have argued about this in the past, and it's such an
arbitrary decision that it's not really worth worrying about.
assertor/assertedBy: flip a coin.

Can't wait for Wendy's revised specification, BTW.
