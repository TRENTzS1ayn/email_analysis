It is an easy rule for people to remember when people are hand coding the
TITLE attribute of an ANCHOR.  There is no ambiguty on what to put in the
TITLE attribute.  Just put the TITLE in the HEADER block of the referenced
document.  This would be easy to explain in the guidelines.
ALT text could be a short description of the image (icon, logo, picture) or
the purpose of the image (chart, graph, map).
LONGDESC would be an interpretation of the image.  This chart shows... or
this graph shows...
