Irrespective of the fact that the "meaning of the placeholders" is not,
IMO, being distorted, by implication you're saying that backwards
compatibility is irrelevant?

Again, there is no distortion AFAICS. ALTernative means "replacement".

>It's hard enough to get people to use ALT as is.

True. And for those who _do_ use it, there's no surer way to discourage
them from doing so in the future than to arbitrarily alter the meaning,
which would require... thousands? hundreds of thousands? of pages of
current content to be redesigned to fit the new meaning.

>ALT/TITLE/LONGDESC have to be clearly defined.

Agreed! Otherwise we get <a href="http://www.the-net-effect.com/bad-
tooltips.html">BAD</a> implementations :(
