Why do you feel that to be the case? Surely the logo merely serves to
identify the company, and, if not present, a suitable ALTernative
company identifier should appear in its place - the fact that the logo
is not being displayed is irrelevant (not to mention obvious!).

I assume you refer to the first image on this page: 

  <IMG SRC="http://www.srl.rmit.edu.au/images/1cmsunriselogo.gif"
  ALT="A smiling yellow sun rising into a blue sky: the sunrise logo"
  HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=22 ALIGN=RIGHT>

IMO this is incorrect usage of ALT, since the additional information -
that the image is a logo is of _no_ benefit to those who

 1. have chosen not to load images
 2. are using a web-to-speech device
 3. are blind

I would suggest that better examples for this image would be:

 A. ALT="" (since the page is already identified in the header)
 B. ALT=" Sunrise " (if it is deemed necessary to reinforce the message
    that this page is about an Organization called "Sunrise")

If required, "A smiling yellow sun rising into a blue sky" would, IMO,
be better included as a LONGDESC, describing the image.

Option "A" above has the added benefit that <A HREF="http://www.the-net-
effect.com/bad-tooltips.html">BAD</A> browsers don't show an irritating
tooltip of the ALT content...

This assumes a linear reading of the site, which is not what happens in
practice - visitors can, and will, drop in anywhere; so if your
ALTernative information is deemed of sufficient import on one page, then
shouldn't it appear everwhere else, too?

Me, too :)
