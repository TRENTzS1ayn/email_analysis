Colin,

Thanks for the feedback on the standards.   My comments preceded
by LRK::

LRK:: this is intresting, but surely you don't mean that no alt text is
shown anywere.  There are some large images, e.g. 145x170.  Which images
don't show the text?   .

LRK:: This is not what the AT&T alt text standards recommend.
For bullet, they simply say to use one word, "bullet", except, to quote
the standards

"Include color or description of bullet if it has meaning, e.g.
if red bullets imply higher importance than blue bullets. "

LRK:: Although it's a smaller number of responses than I would have
liked, they were accommpaniend by explanations that made them quite
compelling to me.   When you say that "this is something which I (and
others) feel is totally inappropriate"  how many people (you plus
others) does this represent and how many are blind?     At most, I think
we have to recognize that there are differences of opinion here among
users that we need to consider.     We can't say that anything is
"totally inappropriate" if thats what some people prefer and it does no
large harm to others.

If we could get feedback from a wider cross section of blind users that
would be great.  Especially if we could get feedback from people who
don't normally participate in listserv's.

Anyone have any ideas on that?

LRK:: While I concede that these standards don't make the page
optimal from an aesthetic point of view for lynx (e.g. "bullet" instead
of "*"), I don't see that it impedes function for lynx users in the
least.  I think the priority should be

1. function for blind users
2. aesthetics for sighted lynx users

As for browsing with images off, I don't see how the standards
affect either aesthetics or function.  So I don't see how this is
comparable to constructing bollards.
