The fact that Netscape Navigator doesn't display the ALT text when a image
HEIGHT and WIDTH are too small is a limitation of Navigator.  Text browsers
and Internet Explorer (and it's derivatives) do not have this limitation.

No guidelines should recommend to authors that they specify minimum HEIGHT=
and WIDTH= attributes, since the radically affects page layout.

Subject: ALT text survey

In the "Requirements for New Pages" section specific recommendations are
made for the pixel sizes of images in an (admirable) attempt to provide
minimal legibility.

When this page is viewed with the latest Netscape Navigator browser
(4.04/Win95/1024*768 resolution) (with image loading turned off) _no_
ALT text is displayed on my system[1] for _any_ of these images,
demonstrating the futility of such precise instructions when authoring
content for the WWW.
