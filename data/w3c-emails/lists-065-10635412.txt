No, that's exactly what I _do_ mean - on my system NONE of the images
shows _any_ ALT text (except as tooltips!), which is why I said that
giving pixel-perfect instructions is pointless.

Which standards?

With respect, you're nit-picking. Substituting "red bullet" for "Large
Yellow Bullet " and "blue bullet" for "Small Red Bullet ", that gives us
instead:

      red bulletIntroduction
      red bulletThe Problem
            blue bulletHistorical Analysis
            blue bulletCurrent Situation
      red bulletThe Solution

Hmmm... looks the same to me, if not worse, because of the lack of a
space separator after "bullet" in the ALT content.

In any case, why do you want to use coloured bullets to indicate
importance? The content _already has_ this information, via the nested
list. The browser _should_ be able to grok this and render the
information accordingly.

I don't know of any definitive studies, but there have been estimates
bandied around for some time that as many as 30% of users of graphical
browsers use them with image auto-loading turned off. Don't you think
that it's necessary to cater for the needs of these users?

As to how many are blind - that's irrelevant. Blind users can best be
served by development of an appropriate browser which renders the
content accordingly for their special needs: but such a browser is
unlikely to be developed until we have an unambiguous definition of the
_meaning_ of each attribute of each and every element.

ALT is just a very good place to start.

But that's just the point: catering exclusively for the needs of one
minority (eg blind people) disenfranchises another group (eg those who
choose to browse with image loading turned off).

Until we have unambiguous descriptions of the meaning of the markup,
differences of opinion are _bound_ to arise - such is the nature of
ambiguity.

Yes, it no doubt would be of great benefit to someone developing a
browser for blind people - but it wouldn't help the issue at hand, that
of determining what ALT means.

May I refer you to a posting made by Alan Flavell on w3c-wai-ig, which
sums up the position neatly:
