LRK::
MSIE with AA has done an admirable job overcoming this glitch.  Plus,
browsers like lynx never had it.  However, I believe that when you run
Explorer version 3.02 without AA it has this limitation (albeit it goes
to smaller heights).  Thats what people with this older version, and
people who simply have images off, run.  

Furthermore, just as web sites seek to accommodate sighted people who
don't have the optimal and latest software, we should do the same for
people who rely on screen readers.  And whether or not we "should" do
this from a moral or legal point of view,  it's just plain good business
sense for a site to make it's customers happy, and maximize their use of
the site even for people who don't always have the latest stuff.

LRK:: 

It's not true that this must radically affect page layout.  

Typically this glitch occurs for things like horizontal lines for which
aesthetically there's a few pixels above and below anyway.  Adding a
transparent border gets around glitch with no affect at all on
appearance.

Where it is sometimes a problem is the width requirement.  If you use
this for a bullet with no space in front or behind it's a problem.  If
the bullet is indented you can add transparent border on left, which
actually simplifies the HTML since it eliminates the need for a spacer
image.

Since it can at times be a problem, not mandatory, it's just suggested,
in the AT&T ALT text guidelines.
