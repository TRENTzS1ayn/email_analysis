In a informal survey of various sites, I found all of them used HEIGHT and
WIDTH.  People and authoring tools put them in, so that the page is
formatted correctly before the image is loaded.

Even the primarily text based http://www.yahoo.com uses them.  So while you
might not think that HTML isn't a page layout language, it's certainly being
used as one.  

Obviously, the guidelines must reflect the real world of HTML development.

Concerning your comment about competition-bashing.  That wasn't my intent.
However, we will take credit for the accessibility features that have been
present in Internet Explorer for awhile now.  That is the goal of these
groups isn't it?  To affect the development of Internet products to make
them more accessible?

Why not? "Height" and "width" are _attributes_ of an image; they
describe the content. That's what "markup" is all about.

Ah. That's where you've gone wrong. HTML is not a page layout language.
