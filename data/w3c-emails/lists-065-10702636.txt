thanks for the better explanation of alt text, but I think the original

LRK:: Thus people still run into this problem if their screen reader
doesn't turn on the flag.  Do all screen readers in use today turn on
this flag?  I think not, and as in interim practical measure it's
desirable to accommodate folks using those readers.

plus

sighted people who have images off just for speed would benefit from
seeing the alt text

plus

not everyone has IE.

LRK:: that is a very good feature.

LRK::
Ah, I see the misunderstanding.  The our guidelines do not say to omit
height and width.  In fact, they absolutely require height and width.
What they suggest is to try to make the height and width large enough so
that the ALT text shows.
