Thanks.  Will fix that next time I log in and tinker with it.

The webservice parses XML you POST to it.  That is to say,
anonymous input.  It assigns it a system identifier of modxml:input.

Jim wanted to be able to post a document from a URL, and have the
results refer to that URL.  So we decided in chat to use the
Content-Location HTTP header.  If the Client sets a Content-Location,
mod_xml will (now) use that as the System Identifier of the input.
