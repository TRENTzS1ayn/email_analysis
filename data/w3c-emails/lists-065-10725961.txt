Nonetheless, our guidelines should not work around "bugs" (AT&T's term) in
browsers.  If we do, we get into this argument of "what is the worst popular
browser" and go from there.

I'm not saying that it should be eliminated (it won't be, it's too useful),
but it's silly to think we can tell people how big their images should be.

Looking at http://www.att.com, HEIGHT is used with less than 24 points 7
times out of 15.  Also, the numbers are arbitrary - what if the font size is
larger?  Then 24 points isn't enough.  That only means that the text isn't
clipped vertically, what if the ALT text is greater than a few words, it
might be clipped horizontally as well.  Given this logic, we should have
minimum WIDTH as well, based on a metric of the size of the text, etc.

People create small images, they will wonder why the W3C says not to.  We
will say "because old graphical browsers can't display the ALT text."  They
will say "Upgrade to something that works!"

Guidelines should not work around browser implementation.  I will say that
over and over and over again until it sinks in.

In order for the guidelines to gain acceptance, there has to be a clear
understanding of the problem and that has to be grasped by the HTML author
(who will certainly be using the latest tools him/herself).

If we load up the guidelines with exceptions and such, the author will not
be as understanding to the problem and less likely to make a change.  Lets
make this document incredibly lightweight and useful rather than a series of
workarounds.
