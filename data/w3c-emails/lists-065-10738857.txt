It's not a secret that it's my position as well, i.e. "Get the
guidelines straight and fix the browsers - We're working for the
future generation", but we're in a world of consensus building and I'm
happy with the classification system we adopted: Required/Recommended
and Interim/New.

So rather that saying

> Guidelines should not work around browser implementation. 

I prefer to say that I'm fine with mentioning current browser issues
as long as they are properly marked (Interim/Recommended in that
case).
