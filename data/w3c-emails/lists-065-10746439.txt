I ALWAYS use them, and I will always recommend they be used.  Pages
that do not are frustrating.  Netscape won't paint the page until all
of the images are downloaded.  You have to wait just to know if you
want a page.  I can't count how many times a day I hit a page and click
off of it long before all the images are there - only possibly because
the author used the sizing tags so the text was rendered immediately and
I could find what I was looking for without waiting for images.  It 
would be a giant step backwards not to use them.
