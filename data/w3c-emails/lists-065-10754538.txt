I don't like this - Height and Width should be set to the image height
and width.  Period.  Articially enlarging images is never going to go
over.  A little 1/8" round bullet graphic is just that size - if you
set the size any larger it either expands or you need to pad the image,
which then eats more space on the page defeating the entire purpose
of the small bullet.
