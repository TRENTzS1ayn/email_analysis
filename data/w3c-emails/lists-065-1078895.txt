That was actually one of the problems we ran into in our discussion
yesterday - earl doesn't seem to have a property that uses earl:fails as a
value.  I picked earl:validity because it seemed the closest thing to
suggest at the moment, even though it's technically incorrect.

So assuming a user is really set on using earl:fails instead of just
earl:Fail, but wants to qualify their predicate with other properties like
Nick does, what would you suggest?
