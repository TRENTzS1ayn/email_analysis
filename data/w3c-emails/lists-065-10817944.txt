I'm sorry, I have to admit that in trying to be brief I appear to have
over-stated the case.  It's quite true that there have been improvements
in the rendering in the latest version of MSIE.

Well, crudely stated, the "real problem" is that one cannot choose to
use such a graphical browser sometimes as a text mode browser.  It never 
forgets its graphical origins.

Yes.  Looks much nicer, doesn't it?

Well, it's good to know that there are obscure benefits, even if they are
hidden away from the normal user.

I would have immediately selected such an option if I had ever found
it (and I'd have wondered why it wasn't the default).

Clearly a good idea.

On the contrary.  HTML is not a DTP specification language, browsers
are expected to do the best possible job in each situation with the
material that they are being asked to present.  Stubbornly preserving a
layout that has been designed for images, when there are no such images
present, seems to me to be counterproductive.

A well-designed HTML page adapts itself calmly to any browsing situation;
it does not try to stubbornly maintain a pixel exact size and shape
regardless of the browsing situation.  

An author who understands HTML would not hold such intentions for their
"layout", and would prefer their content to be presented in the best
interests of each diverse browsing situation, in my opinion.

I praised one aspect of Opera's presentation.  Please, let's not get
distracted into browser advocacy in general, let's concentrate on
accessibility guidelines.  (Actually, I see that Opera 3.1 uses the TITLE
attribute that's specified in the enclosing <A HREF...> as its tooltip, if
the author bothered to set that attribute.  Which is rather nice, and
brings us back to the related suggestion in the guidelines.  I must make a
note to use that more often.)

Indeed.  But users can only make a decision when they are aware that there
is one to make, and have given thought to the issues.

Yes, that's an improvement.  I concede that I was unaware of it and have
been unable to find it in the version I'm using (for the record, the exe
file is 4.71.1712.0).  Could I ask what, in your view, is the benefit of
not making it the default behaviour? 

best regards
