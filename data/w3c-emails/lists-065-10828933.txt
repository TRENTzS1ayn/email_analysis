Hello,
Leonard Kasday suggested that it would be a good idea to get feedback on
the use of ALT text from a wider cross section of blind users, especially
those who do not participate in listservs.

I am in the process of setting up an evaluation of some aspects of the WAI
Page Author Guidelines and Checklist.  I will be asking blind Web users to
evaluate Web pages designed to the Guidelines.  The pages could include a
variety of different presentations of various elements, such as different
uses of ALT text.

If you have any ideas for other elements the test pages should include,
please let me know, either directly or via the list.  I will also be
checking the archives of this list for other 'hot' topics.

I am intending to recruit blind people to evaluate the pages from the
numerous email lists and have some contacts at the Royal National Institute
for the Blind, but am not sure how to get in touch with other people who
are not on email or the web.  Any ideas?

I look forward to getting your comments and ideas.

Chetz
