My impression from the AT&T test information posted is that many blind
users, like sighted users, view the Web as a visual medium, and hence seek
ALT text to describe a page visually.  This is a problem that has to be
overcome if the Web is to become truly accessible.  At the same time, I
find it hard to imagine user testing that would not be clouded by this
misconception.  Perhaps what is needed is users who know nothing about the
Web?
