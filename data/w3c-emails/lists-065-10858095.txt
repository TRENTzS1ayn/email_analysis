I have noticed that the temperature of the discussions has been heating up 
as of late.   While there is always a little heat where there is a lot of 
light, I would like to put in a request for everyone to re-read their memos 
before they post them and make sure that all the energy that may have 
gotten poured onto the page is turned into respectful if still forceful 
dialog.

Some may think that it doesn't matter what the tone is, but it usually 
isn't the case. When a list heats up two things happen.

1) Many people who might comment fall silent.  They don't want to risk 
getting yelled at if they say something wrong or if they just are in a 
different position.

2) Some people sign off.  Sometimes key people.   And we don't need that.

I know we are all busy,  and so we sometimes dash things off,  sometimes 
over-express ourselves then hit send, etc.

But if you find yourself typing fast or hard when you answer, please 
re-read your message and make sure that it is a good try at diplomatic 
education and evangelism of a point of view.

Thanks much.

Oh and by the way,  the discussions have been quite good.    I think we are 
getting at the issues.   And I think we have most peoples points of view. 
 Now lets see if we can try to understand all the points of view and work 
toward a solution.    Can we find the common ground?  As a number of you 
have said, we need to come up with some clarity, what we have is ambiguous 
and irregular across documents and implementations.     A suggestion is 
that we not look at current definitions and implementations as being things 
we need to accommodate.  I think it is clear that what we have is inter - 
incompatible.  We need to change something to move forward.

Thanks all for your efforts.
