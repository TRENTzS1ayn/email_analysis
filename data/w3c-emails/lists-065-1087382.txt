Consider that user A wants to use {earl:fails :myLevel :Severe} and user B
wants to use {earl:fails :level :Light} (or even that user A later wants to
use a different level). When you merge the two you get a conflict; you
can't declare things about terms in the EARL namespace that you don't know
to be true, and in this case aren't true. Note that we already have a
confidence level set for earl:fails: {earl:fails earl:confidence earl:High
(earl:Certain in the latest draft)}.

earl:Fail is there so that people can create their own properties, with
different confidence levels or whatever; these properties do not have to be
anonymous, of course.
