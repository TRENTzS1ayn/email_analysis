Thanks for the information on ACCESSKEY.  But isn't the browser
implementation kind of a big deal.  If I put a statement like "Press S to
submit the form", the user has to press more than S in most browsers.  So
many people will think it doesn't work.  But if I put the "Access key for
the submit button is S".  Most people won't know what an access key is.
There must be a better way to use the access key for authors to adopt it's
usage.
