Erm, you're dealing with qualifiers that are subjective measures.
The severity property for a validation error is clearly defined,
so if two validators disagree then one of them is buggy.

These errors are Confidence: Certain.  Severity is a different property.

Likewise, when a document fails validation, errorCount is a property
of that failure.

The point is that an RDF predicate may need to have properties
additional to an earl:Fail.
