Is there any reason why ACCESSKEY does not work for me using IE 4.01 for
Win95 at <http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/csscheck/>?

The browser should underline the character, not the author.  If the author
underlined it, users of non-supporting browsers and browsers with a
different method of selecting an ACCESSKEY would be somewhat confused.
Also keep in mind that the U element is deprecated in HTML 4.0.

A more explicit implementation, and one that would allow for an access key
not actually present in the label, would be for the browser to output
[ALT-S] (for ACCESSKEY=S) before or after the form control.  The
my-layout-or-no-layout crowd would probably throw a fit, but it might be
useful at least as a user option.  In general, though, I'd rather as a user
have the convention of my operating system used--for Windows, this would be
underlining, but other operating systems may have different customs.
