I don't know, but I will find out.  Thanks for pointing it
out.

The HTML specification is fairly clear as to the usage and
presentation of ACCESSKEY.  Use the platform conventions.  For Windows that
would be an ALT key prefix and an underline character.  Other platforms have
other conventions.  I regret to say that we don?t present the underline
character in the current version of Internet Explorer.

Programmatically, the ACCESSKEY attribute is available
through Active Accessibility and the Dynamic HTML object models with
Internet Explorer.  I?m sure the final Document Object Model (DOM) that the
W3C DOM group is working on will also contains a property for this.

Is there any reason why ACCESSKEY does not work for me using
IE 4.01 for
Win95 at <http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/csscheck/>?

The browser should underline the character, not the author.
If the author
underlined it, users of non-supporting browsers and browsers
with a
different method of selecting an ACCESSKEY would be somewhat
confused.
Also keep in mind that the U element is deprecated in HTML
4.0.

A more explicit implementation, and one that would allow for
an access key
not actually present in the label, would be for the browser
to output
[ALT-S] (for ACCESSKEY=S) before or after the form control.
The
my-layout-or-no-layout crowd would probably throw a fit, but
it might be
useful at least as a user option.  In general, though, I'd
rather as a user
have the convention of my operating system used--for
Windows, this would be
underlining, but other operating systems may have different
customs.
