It was impression that Scott Issacs of Microsoft submitted and pushed hard
for ACCESSKEY to help make HTML forms (and HTML dialogs) work more like

The same is true for LABEL, and TABINDEX.

Is the ACCESSKEY attribute only for use for accessibility purposes?  
There is no other purpose for ACCESSKEY?
