I think of it like a dialog box.  Most dialog boxes don't say "Press ALT+F
to go to the File Type combo box."  Windows user know when they see a
underline (or their screen reader announces the accelerator) that they can
use ALT and that key to keyboard activate it.

Similar, Macintosh users know then they see the little clover character
(whatever it's called) that they can use the CMD key.

The fact that IE and Netscape don't represent the ACCESSKEY is a browser bug
and fails to meet the HTML 4.0 specification.  I'll see what I can do to fix
that.

Thanks for the information on ACCESSKEY.  But isn't the browser
implementation kind of a big deal.  If I put a statement like "Press S to
submit the form", the user has to press more than S in most browsers.  So
many people will think it doesn't work.  But if I put the "Access key for
the submit button is S".  Most people won't know what an access key is.
There must be a better way to use the access key for authors to adopt it's
usage.
