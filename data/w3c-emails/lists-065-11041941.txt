It's a little weak and too focused on artistic information.

HTML4.0 says:

longdesc = uri [CT]
     This attribute specifies a link to a long description of the image.
     This description should supplement the short description provided using
     the alt attribute. When the image has an associated image map, this
     attribute should provide information about the image map's contents.
     This is particularly important for server-side image maps.

and I'd like to reinforce that this way in GL:

A long description should be used to supplement an image short
description whenever this short description alone is not sufficient to
convey the meaning/function of the image and detailed understanding of
the image content is required for the overall undertanding of the
document (e.g. a graph or a chart in a formal specification).
