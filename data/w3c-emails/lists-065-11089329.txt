Oh no, that is in no sense "alternative text to be presented when the
iamge is not being displayed".  It's useless as a substitute for the
function of the image, except in a few special cases.

In a sense, but I wouldn't put it like that.  TITLE and LONGDESC are
two needed functions, that have little or nothing to do with the
function of the ALT attribute.

Oh dear, which way is that?  Old documents that have been properly
marked up can still be viewed on new browsers.  New documents can be
browsed as well as they ever could on old browsers (but presumably
anyone who is using the D-link convention will want to continue to
do it for quite some time yet).

"Function" is the right word here.  ALT text needs to replace the
function of the image, just as it always did.
