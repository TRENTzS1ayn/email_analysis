I would use the following:

<H1><IMG SRC="banner.gif" ALT="Welcome to Archimedes Plumbing, your best
plumbing value" TITLE="Archimedes in the tub" LONGDESC="banner.html"></H1>

And for the actual long description,

The <A HREF="banner.gif">Archimedes Plumbing banner</A> shows Archimedes, a
white-haired 60-ish Greek gentleman, sitting in a sudsy bathtub, wielding a
pipe wrench above his head. His boney kneecaps just break the surface of
the suds. The color scheme is based on cool blue. At the bottom of the
banner is the slogan "Your best plumbing value".
