I don't think it should be clear.  Since the ALT text is a replacement for
the image, the average reader shouldn't even know which text is normal text
and which is ALT text.  A document presented aurally would flow much better
without screams of "Hey, there's an image here".  Naturally the user should
have the option to enable those distractions if he or she chooses, but, in
my opinion, the default should be for ALT text and normal text to be
indistinguishable.

I prefer Lynx's default presentation of ALT text.
