My apologies.  I should rather have said that it's the job of the
browser to give the reader the option to be alerted to the fact that
the ALT text is standing-in for an image.  Readers who do not wish
this should, of course, have the option to turn it off (or to not turn
it on).

And so do I, usually; but anyone who prefers to be alerted would have
to issue the "*" keycommand, and the resulting [LINK]-[IMAGE]
displays may be considered rather obtrusive.
