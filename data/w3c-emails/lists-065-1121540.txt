Hi all,

regrets :(

On the other hand, in talking to the folks at UsableNet they said that the
location thing is going to be really pretty important for providing
interoperability in the scenario wher a repair tool gets the information
about what is wrong for a different tool. This is backed up by the fact that
HiSoftware felt the need to have a tightly-specified way of referring to the
location of a problem, and used their own namespace to do it.

Cheers

Chaals
