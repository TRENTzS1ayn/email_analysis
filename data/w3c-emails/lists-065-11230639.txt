Hi Liam,

I see you added the words "Welcome to" in your ALT text for Archimedes
plumbing, even though those words don't appear in the banner.

I take it that this follows the philosophy that ALT text should reflect
the function of the image, rather than a literal rendition, right?

Thus, we'd have "Welcome to Archimedes plumbing etc." on the home page,
but if the banner is repeated on other pages the words "Welcome to"
would be omitted.  Do you agree with that?

I'm comfortable with this, at least now that we have TITLE and LONGDESC.
 If all we had was ALT text, then there'd be the conflict of function
vs. literal description.  People have strong feelings on both sides of
that conflict.  This allows us to avoid that conflict.

The only unfortunate thing is that the attribute name "TITLE" doesn't
really communicate what TITLE does.  Something like SHORTDESC would be a
better match for the functionality we're giving it (e.g. "Archimedes in
the tub").   But this doesn't bother me too much, especially if
authoring tools make the function clear.  (After all, how many people
using wysiwyg tools know whether to use "SRC" or "URL" in their code).

What do other folks think, as if I need to ask (smile)?

Len
