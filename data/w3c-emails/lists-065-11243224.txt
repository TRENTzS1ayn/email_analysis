Right, my including "Welcome to" was mostly to emphasize the functional
nature of the ALT text.  In practice, I'd probably leave it off for brevity.

Yes.

Think of the TITLE attribute as analagous to an HTML document's TITLE
element.  In other words, think about what you would use as a title for an
image (or paragraph or applet, etc.).  For the A element, the TITLE
attribute could logically be the TITLE element of the linked HTML document.
