Roger,

It is rare that a spammed message gets through to our mailing list.  It is
an unfortunate fact that sometimes,  these e-mail broadcast services get a
list-serve address by some means.  It is the price we have to pay for
making our list open to the public.  I hope, as do you, that we can get
"unsubscribed" from their mailing list, but that is sometimes a very
difficult task.

Sincerely,
Chuck Letourneau
