I don't really understand 5.3, a REQUIRED about
 "Do not misuse presentation elements for purposes of structure"

Are we saying that documents should not have any HR ?
But HR is accounted for in CSS, you can control its look.

This can't be a REQUIRED anyway, can it ?

Second, I still thing 8.1, about Link text making sense out of context
should be REQUIRED.


Third, I think making a Requirement not to use TT, I, B, BIG, and
SMALL, which are non deprecated HTML4 presentational markup, is too
strong. Maybe it would be simpler requiring HTML 4 Strict DTD
compliance.

Besides truth and beauty, what's the difference for a user agent if B
is used instead of STRONG, or TT instead of CODE ? Is there any
accessibility concern here ?
