I concur with Daniel's comments. In fact, the HTML 4.0 specification
provides a default algorithm which is to be applied whenever explicit
HEADERS and SCOPE attributes are not included. For the sake of simplicity,
should we recommend (as a helpful, not a required guideline) that HEADERS
and SCOPE be introduced in all cases, and also make it clear that HEADERS
and SCOPE are required whenever the algorithm would not properly identify
the headers associated with each data cell?

Stated differently, the recommendation would be that authors include
HEADERS and SCOPE just to ensure that the user agent will render the table
correctly, but these are only really necessary where the algorithm
detailed in the HTML 4.0 specification would otherwise fail.

The two sections dealing with the use of tables for layout purposes can be
collapsed into one, perhaps with two separate guidelines: (1) required, do
not misuse tables to generate columns of text; (2) recommended, do not use
tables for layout purposes at all, but take advantage of style sheet
positioning instead.
