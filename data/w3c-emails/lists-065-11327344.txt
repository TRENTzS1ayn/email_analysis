Until all the browsers support CSS positioning well, it's not likely that
authors will abandon using tables for page layout.

Does anyone have any evidence, antidotal or not of how popular Navigators
<LAYER> tag is?

The two sections dealing with the use of tables for layout purposes can be
collapsed into one, perhaps with two separate guidelines: (1) required, do
not misuse tables to generate columns of text; (2) recommended, do not use
tables for layout purposes at all, but take advantage of style sheet
positioning instead.
