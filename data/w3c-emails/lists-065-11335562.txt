1. Concerning association of cells with row and column:

It seems that in simple tables there is no real necessity that the author will
"Associate table cells with row and column labels explicitly"

The HTML4.0 spec indicates that the above mentioned association may be rendered 
in a speech browser by annoncing the label.

If one has a table that lists people and  three additional columns specify
phone number, email address and office number, a user of a non-visual browser
may not need a reminder for every article whether it is 
an email address or a phone number. So in this case, I think, an author can leave 
the decision about annoncing the column to the user's defaults/stylesheet
(as the browser should be able to find the column on its own).

On the other hand if one writes a rather complicated table with cells
*spanning* over columns or rows, the correct association may very well 
depend on the context. In this case, it seems, that explicit association 
is required.

2. Layout and columns:

It seems that making columns is a particular case of layout. Another example
is writing a one-row two-cell table where all the text is in the second cell
and the first cell is used to create indentation. Clearly, this example
is not that terrible from the point of view of accesibility. However,
the guidelines may be more explicit about the consequence of using 
tables for layout, and provide more examples.
