There are some rare cases that it makes sense 
to write links text (i.e. Anchors' content) in a way 
that doesn't stand well in isolation. 

Example: 

For off line reading, versions of the guidelines 
are available in PDF and in PostScript formats.

The natural thing to do here is to link "in PDF" to the PDF version,
and "in PostScript" to the PostScript version. These anchors don't 
tell what is in PDF/PostScript.  

In this case one can recommend to use the title attribute 
to provide the answer to "What in PDF?"
