The question is not if your site has frame based pages,
but how they are used.
I agree fully following is not always true, but for some
sites it might work. Especially if one frame acts as a "menu"
and another one is used to display information.

Proposal:
If you use frames on your pages use alternate links in 
your NOFRAMESET paragraph of your FRAMESET page to refer to
each of the pages of the frames. The anchors in the pages in the
frames may use the TARGET atrribute. This is skipped anyway.

Use a text-based or no-frame supporting browser to try my
siple example at: www.inter.nl.net/users/jvleliev/ebutc.htm

I'm interested to hear your comments,

Best regards,
Jaap
