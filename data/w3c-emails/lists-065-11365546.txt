I have two suggestion for the "WAI Accessibility Guidelines: Page Authoring"

First, add a reference in
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH#References

<LI><A HREF="http://www.austin.ibm.com/sns/access.html">
IBM Guidelines for Writing Accessible Applications Using 100% Pure Java</A>
-- IBM Special Needs Systems</LI>


Second, add an explanation to 3.5

3.5 [Required] If an applet [or object] requires user interaction...
More information is available...and the "IBM Guidelines for Writing Accessible A
pplications Using 100% Pure Java".

<li class="gif"><span class="man">[Required]</span> <strong><span
class="guideline"><br>
    If an applet requires user interaction (e.g., the ability to manipulate a
physics
    experiment) that cannot be duplicated in an alternative format, make the
applet directly
    accessible.</span></strong><br>
    More information is available through&nbsp;
<a href="http://trace.wisc.edu/world/java/java.htm">the Java Accessibility page
at the Trace Center</a> and the "<a href=
"http://www.austin.ibm.com/sns/access.html">IBM Guidelines for Writing
Accessible Applications Using 100% Pure Java</A>". <br>

Subject: IBM Guidelines for writing accessible Java applications

The "IBM Guidelines for Writing Accessible Applications Using 100% Pure Java"
are now available!  This is the industry's first set of 100% Pure Java (tm)
application development guidelines for accessibility. The guidelines are based
on the Java Accessibility API and their implementation on the Java Foundation
Classes.  IBM is focusing on the Java platform for accessibility and is
encouraging developers to exploit this new technology. Learn more about the
accessibility issues being addressed and read the guidelines on IBM's
Accessibility site:
