Question 1: Should a guideline state that labeling of simple tables is not
[required]?

If yes, then:

Question 2: When does a table become complicated enough for labeling to be
[required]?

Note 1: [required] is the sense defined in the guidelines -  Required,
otherwise it will be impossible for one or more groups of users to
understand the page.  (Whereas, [recommended] means - Makes page easier to
understand and use.)

Note 2: labeling refers to the new TABLE markup available in HTML 4.0 such
as header, id, scope, and summary
