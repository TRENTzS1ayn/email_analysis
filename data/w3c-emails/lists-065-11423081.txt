Hello,

My name is Bruce Townsend and I am a visually impaired student at the   College of the Rockies in Cranbrook, B.C., Canada and I am currently   completing a post graduate program in New Media Communicaitons. As a   project for the Communications component, I am creating a small web site   that is created without using the WAI guidelines, and then reconstructing   it using as many of the required and recommended guidelines as possible.

I would like to have your permission to quote directly from your   guidelines and to place links to your WWW site so that others can become   aware of how to create accessible sites. I would also appreciate any   suggestions as to where I may find examples of good sites and help or   suggestions for creating accessible sites - ie, listserves. As well, are   there any other sites or institutions that may be interested in seeing my   final project, and would be willing to give me feedback on how well I   did. I am aware of  Bobby!

Thank you,

Bruce Townsend (Blinky)
