JRG::
I think tables for navigation bars and other standard tables should have
specific labels like "navbar", or if there are more than one "navbar1",
"navbar2", "navbar3"...

If tabling (is tabling a word?) is used for formating, maybe the label
should just be: "table is being used for xxx visual formatting."

Are there other structures besides nav bars that could have "standard" labels.

JRG::
I think on one level labels sould be used to desribe why the tabel is
there, but on a functional side that seems a bit extreme for the author to
have to define.
