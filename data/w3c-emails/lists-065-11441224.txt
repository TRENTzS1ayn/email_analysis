Dear Bruce,

Yes please feel free to quote the "WAI Accessibility Guidelines: Page
Authoring," with appropriate credits to the W3C's published working draft,
which in turn credits the authors and contributors to the guidelines.

I'd also request that you let us know when your material is up so that we
may link to it.  This sounds like just the type of "before and after"
example that we're interested in showing people.

Thanks for your interest.

- Judy

that is created without using the WAI guidelines, and then reconstructing
it using as many of the required and recommended guidelines as possible.

there any other sites or institutions that may be interested in seeing my
final project, and would be willing to give me feedback on how well I
did. I am aware of  Bobby!
