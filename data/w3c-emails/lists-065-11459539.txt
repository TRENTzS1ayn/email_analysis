> 7.2 Avoid using tables to arrange text documents in columns.

This item needs to be reclassified as an INTERIM measure. 
Hopefully screen readers in the near future will be able 
to look at the browser's document object model and read 
down a column, cell by cell, etc. through a table.

In addition, the point needs further clarification.
For example, using the TH element to produce table
headers is a good idea. However, text headers
will also produce multicolumn-screenreading problems.
Using the hack of putting BRs at the end of each
table cell changes the accessibility of multicolumn text
for Lynx but not for Navigator. Does this need
to be added as an interim guideline as well? 

What 7.2 is really saying is that for specific
combinations of screen-reading software and browsers,
multicolumn text of any kind is a problem. 
In order to give 7.2 the precision it deserves these problem
combinations of browser and screen reader must be 
specified in the guidelines albeit maybe the longer document.

Further, it would seem that one additional step would be 
to generate statistics on the relevant combinations of 
browser/screen-reader software so that we can judge 
over the next 2-3 years when to phase this and other 
interim points out.
