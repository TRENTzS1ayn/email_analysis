I think it would be helpful to indicate in the guidelines under which
circumstances authors should take advantage of the HEADERS and SCOPE
attributes in HTML 4.0. Stated differently, in what types of situations
does the algorithm prescribed in the specification for locating the
headers that correspond to each cell, produce erroneous results? One such
circumstance has already been mentioned in this discussion, namely, where
data cells span columns. Another would presumably occur whenever the first
column of the table provides what Al once aptly characterised as de facto
row headers, even though the cells in question are contained in TD rather
than TH elements. Are there any other situations of concern? We need to
enumerate them in the guidelines, albeit briefly, and thereby advise
authors when to use SCOPE and HEADERS attributes.
