Liddy handed out the DC-2002 call for papers at the WWW2002 workshop...

Is anyone interested in co-authoring a paper about EARL for DC-2002?
http://www.bncf.net/dc2002

Papers are due by 15 June 2002.  That's not much time, but I thought it was 
worth asking.

Possible idea for a paper:
Role of metadata in an accessible Web

It could contain a write-up of the user scenarios at [1] and [2] +others 
and provide overview of EARL tools as a specific language example.

If you are interested, please let me know what you could contribute and on 
what timeline.

Best,
--wendy
