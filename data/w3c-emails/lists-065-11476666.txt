Another category of "simple table" is tables with only a single cell each.
Such tables are frequently used for purely formatting purposes and aids
should have no problem working with them, by ignoring the fact that they are
tables and only looking at standard attributes such as coloration, title=,
etc.

This is of course the tough question.

I talked to Dave Raggett about this issue and I think we both agree
that there is a threshold below which a table can be considered
"simple".


I propose the following:

   - if it only has a single row of header cells at the top
    and/or
   - if it only has a single column of header cells on the left side
     (modulo right-to-left directionality)

In these two cases (which should be treated together), given a cell,
it is really easy for an agent to find the column and the row header
they belong to without requiring the author to add more markup.

In other words, there is a potential "default" value for the scope
attribute on TH that can be defined as: 
   - if all the cells in a row (TR) are header (TH), 
         then scope defaults to col 
   - if only the first cell in a row (TR) is a header (TH)
         then scope defaults to row

We might go as far as trying to define default values for rowgroup
and
colgroup cases (covering sub-headers) but I'd be happy with just
that
in the guidelines.

summary and abbrev should be RECOMMENDED regardless of the above,
they
do no serve navigation but description.
