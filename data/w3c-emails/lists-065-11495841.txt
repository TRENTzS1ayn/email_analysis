I like this for a vest-pocket example.  You can get around it and
observe the safety net links in almost no time.

I had been thinking of "in-vivo" examples which are real sites
that are currently doing something.  But it's good to have one or
two "in-vitro" examples, too.

I had just one change suggestion.  The ALT text "No frames
please" is, to me, jargon that may not communicate except to Web
groupies and particularly HTML speakers.  I don't have an
overwhelming favorite for what to call this link, but something
like "Frames-free home" might convey what is available at the end
of the link a little more reliably.
