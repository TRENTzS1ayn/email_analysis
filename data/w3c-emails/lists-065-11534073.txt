This seems silly to me ? the purpose of LONGDESC is to provide a place for
HTML markup.  Both FRAMESET and OBJECT allow you to put as much markup in
them as you want.  Thus, no need for LONGDESC.

Ask the authors of the HTML4.0 spec. 
why there isn't a longdesc atribute in the FRAMESET, but
only 
in FRAME and IFRAME. 

Also OBJECT which is very similar in nature to 
IFRAME has no longdesc attribute.
