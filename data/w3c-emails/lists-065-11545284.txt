As does IFRAME, but it has a LONGDESC attribute.

That depends on what the purpose of LONGDESC really is.  To me, LONGDESC
for IMG is a long description of the image--a nice implementation of the
"D-link".  This is very different than with the OBJECT or IFRAME element,
where the element content provides a *replacement* (not a description) of
the object or inline frame.

I don't see the point to a LONGDESC attribute on FRAMESET.  The TITLE
attribute on FRAMEs should be sufficient to give the contextual
relationship among the frames.  If the relationship cannot be expressed in
a few plain text words, then I suspect it's too complicated for any user,
sighted or otherwise.

If LONGDESC for IMG is indeed a long description of the image, as I believe
it should be, then OBJECT should also have a LONGDESC attribute--provided
we accept that the content of OBJECT is a replacement rather than a
description, which is really the only sensible way to interpret an OBJECT
within an OBJECT.
