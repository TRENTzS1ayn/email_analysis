Another purpose of adding LONGDESC to FRAME was to allow a long
description to be provided where the content of the frame, designated by
the SRC attribute, is either an image or another non-textual resource.
Under such circumstances, instead of using SRC in the frame itself to
refer to the image, authors are supposed to provide a "wrapper page", that
is an HTML document which contains nothing other than an IMG or OBJECT
element, including the necessary textual alternative. However, recognising
that this is a cumbersome approach which some authors may not be inclined
to follow, LONGDESC has been added to FRAME and IFRAME. Thus, the long
description of the non-textual resource referred to by the SRC attribute
can be associated with the frame itself.

Also, LONGDESC enables a more detailed description to be given, where
necessary, of the nature of the frame's content (where this can not be
conveyed in the TITLE attribute).
