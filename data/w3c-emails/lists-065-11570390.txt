Your site--WAI Accessibility Guidelines: Page Authoring--has been chosen as a
selection for the Scout Report (February 6, 1998), the premier weekly
collection of useful Internet sites for discerning Internauts. Care is
taken in the selection of items included in the Scout Report. Basic
criteria include depth of content, author, information maintenance, and
presentation. The content of each resource is briefly described.

If you would like to inform your colleagues and site users about the
inclusion in the Scout Report, we are providing a small icon for that
purpose. The icon says "Scout Report Selection" and a graphic of the icon
is attached to this message. If you would prefer to download the image
from the Web, it is also available at the URL below.

Also, you can provide a link to the Scout Report home page, where your
users can see the annotation for the site and the other selections for the
week.
