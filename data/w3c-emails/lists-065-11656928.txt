LONGDESC is designed to eventually replace the D link.   For awhile we may 
still need the D link til browsers support LONGDESC.  However, the 
information in the LONGDESC and D link should be identical.... Or rather I 
should say that they should both point to the exact same place & text.

Excuse me, I thought that LONGDESC was the properly engineered
attribute that was intended to replace the D-link kludge.

I mean no disrespect to the folks at wgbh, they did something that
needed doing, and did it with the tools at hand.  But a properly
engineered solution is still surely better?
