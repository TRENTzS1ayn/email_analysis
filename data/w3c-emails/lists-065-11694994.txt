Providing the meaning rather than the visual indication of that meaning
would be better, in my opinion.  For example, if a site uses images of
orange dividing lines before warnings and green dividing lines before
notes, then ALT="Warning:" and ALT="Note:" would be better than ALT="Orange
Divider Line" and ALT="Green Divider Line".
