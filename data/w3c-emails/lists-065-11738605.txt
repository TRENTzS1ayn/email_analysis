All:
It's not useful to have a long thread of messages with the
subject line
"Ok is this more useful"

When you send a message to these archived lists, give some
thought to how people might be able to track the discussion
at a later date.
Remember: these conversations we have online are not like
hallway conversations where you might say something and walk
away-- these bits are going to be around to haunt you for
the rest of your life-- so:

A) Use meaningful subject lines 
B) and where possible dont limit the above good intent just
to the subject line:-) use meaningful message bodies that
you will be proud to tell your grandchildren about
