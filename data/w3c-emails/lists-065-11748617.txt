To: HTML Guidelines Working Group<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>


In the GL charter, it is made clear that one purpose of the group is to
prepare usage guidelines for CSS. Now that CSS 2 has achieved the status
of a W3C proposed recommendation (http://www.w3.org/TR/PR-CSS2/), it may
be appropriate to start considering what types of guidelines are needed.
Some are obvious: for example that style sheet developers should, whenever
appropriate, ensure that their style rules are restricted to the media in
which they are relevant; relative lengths such as percentage values and
EM and EX units should be specified wherever appropriate so that the
author's style rules will be scaled correctly if the user has chosen a
large font size; the creation of an audio style sheet should be
considered, especially when designing a complex web site, etc.

Is it proposed that a separate document be written to provide CSS usage
suggestions, or will this be incorporated into the existing page author
guidelines?
