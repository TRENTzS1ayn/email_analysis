LQ:  But "section divider" isn't a substitute for the function of the
image; it's a description of the function of the image.  A substitute would
be "end of section", which seems a bit more natural and seamless if
listening to a Web page.  Even less awkward ALT text may be possible given
the context, as with my previous example of "This concludes the section on
Widgets."
