CSS 2 makes it possible to associate an audio cue with the HR element.
In some circumstances, this may suffice as an auditory analogue of the
horizontal rule. I would also suggest that it is preferable to indicate
structure by means of the DIV element rather than the horizontal rule,
since the former allows hierarchies to be generated, as in the following
example:

<div title="part 1">
<div title="chapter 1">
[...]
</div>
<div title="chapter 2">
[...]
</div>
</div>

Given a structure of the form outlined above, a user agent could provide
navigation options which facilitate efficient traversal of the hierarchy,
for example as a means of gaining an overview of the document or locating
sections of interest in the absence of an adequate table of contents. The
use of HR alone to indicate divisions within the document would offer no
representation in the HTML markup of its structural organisation. If both
HR and DIV are used together, then the functionality of the TITLE
attribute of one of these elements becomes redundant.
