I think this is one area in which input from the user agent guidelines
group would be helpful: should the title be presented in the DIV element
so that the browser can easily present a structural overview of the
document, or would it be preferable simply to make use of CLASS values in
DIV and leave the title of each section to be designated by a heading, or
perhaps even a TITLE in the HR element? I agree that contextualised style
rules, such as can easily be constructed with CSS selectors, will often
obviate the necessity of making the structure of the document explicit by
including a CLASS attribute in each DIV element. However, since the level
of nesting may vary from one document to another, it may be helpful to
define standardised CLASS values that represent different types of
structural division. This topic relates, as has previously been remarked,
to the "reading order" problem, namely the need to establish a means of
modifying the sequence in which the structural components of the document
are rendered in different media.
