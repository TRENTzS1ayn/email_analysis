At the WAI GL meeting at CSUN, I took an action item to re-organize
the style/text structure section toward or more pragmatic (wrt
Required/Recommended) and simpler approach.

Here's what I have in mind, and I'd like some feedback before I move
forward in more details.

Basically, I'd like to merge section 1 on Style and section 7 on Text,
Symbols, etc in a new section 1 called "Style and Structure" and only
make Required items that are required.

Required: 
     use valid HTML4/CSS2
     document is readable without style
     use proper nesting of headers (no use of H3 for big font)
     use UL/LI for list (not for indent)
     avoid blinking or scrolling text [Interim]
Recommended:
     no text in image when CSS can achieve the same (but of course if
             you use image as text, ALT is required)
     no invisible 1pixel image for adjustment
     no B,I,TT,ALIGN,BORDER,FONT,BACKGROUND (HTML4 deprecated++)
     use proper phrase elements: EM, STRONG, DFN, CODE, SAMP, KBD,
       VAR, CITE, ABBR, and ACRONYM
     use proper Quotations: BLOCKQUOTE and Q elements
     provide title for HR
     specify structure with DIV and SPAN (example NavBar)
