B, I, and TT are not deprecated, and they still have some use for
situations where HTML lacks a suitable phrase element.  For example, <B
class="vector">x</B> and <I lang="la">i.e.</I> are in my opinion better
than <SPAN class="vector">x</SPAN> and <SPAN lang="la">i.e.</SPAN> since
the B and I elements can express the meaning to visual browsers that don't
support style sheets.

The BORDER attribute of TABLE is also not deprecated.  Given the weak
browser support for style sheets (particularly with borders and tables), I
don't see the harm in using the BORDER attribute.

Is it too early to recommend using Q when almost no browsers support it?
