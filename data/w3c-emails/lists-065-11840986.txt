By deprecated++, I meant to encompass [deprecated thing + a couple of
presentation markup not yet deprecated in HTML4].

Yes, B and I have acquire some semantics over the years.

I guess we need to be more precised and mention that we do not
recommend their use for purely typographical presentation: use CSS
instead, and if it's to note strong or emphasis, people can use STRONG
and EM.

How about [Interim] and then CSS2 ?

How about [New] ?
