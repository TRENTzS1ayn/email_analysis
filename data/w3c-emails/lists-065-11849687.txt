Right; B, I, and TT should never be used in place of a phrase element that
expresses the meaning.  But I don't think we should object to combining B,
I, and TT with poorly supported phrase elements (e.g., using I with Q or
INS), nor to using B, I, or TT in place of SPAN.

I guess...  But is there really any accessibility harm in an author
specifying table borders in HTML?
