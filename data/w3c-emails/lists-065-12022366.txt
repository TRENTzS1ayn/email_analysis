The agenda for today is currently

1) EASY READ VERSION
    Short discussion re ideas for the Easy Read version
    of this which we will need to write as soon as this
    one stabilizes

2) HOW TO HANDLE INTERIMS AND FUTURES.
     We have a great format developing but still need to 
     figure out how to handle these tough issues.  We 
     have an idea and are looking for feedback 
     and/or any other ideas.  For convenience, the idea
     is in a separate memo titled 
    "HOW TO HANDLE INTERIMS AND FUTURES."

3)  THE 'ENOUGHS'
     In a number of places we say that you must do some-
     thing if it is 'enough'.    For example, if tables are 
     complex enough you must blah blah.   If images 
     present enough info you should use LONGDESC,
     if Frames   etc.

4)  USER AGENT GROUP COOP
    There are a number of places where we need to 
     closely cooperate with UA group.  For example,
     LONGDESC and ALT text handling.  
     What are all the areas?   How best to cooperate.

5)  TECHNIQUES DOCUMENT
     We need to get to work on the Techniques doc 
     too.  We would like to being this dialog and    
     harvest any ideas people have.
