Actually, I thoroughly disagree. The use of tables to provide formatting 
is simply poor practice for accessibility, and it should be made clear 
that this is so. Instead we should point out that until browsers 
implement CSS there is no accessible way to provide pixel-level 
positioning. Probably about the same place that we point out why 
different sized display devices (not to mention braille displays etc) 
mean that providing absolute positioning is foolish.

We might as well write guidelines for how to do it right. If people want 
to use the medium incorrectly for an effect they thinik they are getting, 
then we ought to point out to them why they shouldn't (x.y Use a proper 
DTD, and use the elements properly) and hope that some of them actually 
listen. If they are told that table-forced layout is inaccessible then 
they will realise that to meet the guidelines they hvae to find some 
other mechanism - an alternative format, or convince their graphic 
designer that varying spatial layout is now part of the brief.
