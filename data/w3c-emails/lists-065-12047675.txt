Maybe I seemed a little carried away on one issue in my last post (it's 
very early here, and I am a night-bird). The point I was trying to make 
is that we should encourage people to recognise things which limit 
accessibility (such as lack of stylesheets) as limits of the medium, in 
this case a restriction on the availability of formatting control.

In other cases, such as the use of D-links or LONGDESC, then we should 
identify D-link as the Interim solution. We should recommend that 
LONGDESC be included as well as D-link, which is necessary until such 
time as HTML 4.0 compliant browsers are more or less universal. We should 
also point out that this is likely to be some considerable time away.
