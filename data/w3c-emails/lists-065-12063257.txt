This is a first bash at it. Any comments folks?

A Frameset should provide information about the individual Frames, and 
their relation to each other. In many common cases this can be done 
simply by using the title of the frames, e.g.

<FRAMESET COLS="20%, *">
  <FRAME NAME="navbar" TITLE="Navigation Frame" SRC="toc.html">
  <FRAMESET ROWS="20%, *">
     <FRAME NAME="banner" TITLE="Banner - no function" SRC="xx.html">
     <FRAME NAME="content" TITLE="Main Content Frame" SRC="welcome.html">
  </FRAMESET>
  <NOFRAMES>
     <H1>Brilliant Stuff</H1>
     <P><A HREF="welcome.html" TITLE="entry to BS site">Welcome to BS Inc.'s 
accessible site.</A></P>
     <P><A HREF="toc.html" TITLE="BS web contents">Choose from our table 
of contents</A>, which you can only get to from this page, or</P>
     <P><A HREF="bs.html" TITLE="BS banner">See our lovely banner</A> (or 
<A HREF="longdescs/bs.html" TITLE="bs banner description">Read about 
it</A>), an option we will offer you about five times on every page 
throughout the site.</P> </FRAMESET>

(CMcCN:: Maybe I should make the example a little less facetious.)

For this case there are three frames: Navigation Frame, Banner - no 
function, and Main Content Frame. These names are fairly self-explanatory.

For less common uses of frames, there should certainly be explanation of
the functions and relations of each frame. 

It would be possible to produce a site with ten frames, nine of which 
held images (for example) and one of which held the images index. In this 
case, if the TITLEs of the frames were Image Frame 1, Image Frame 2, etc, 
and Image Index Frame, the relationship may be unclear, and need further 
explanation. 

Another example would be where two frames are used and new pages are 
loaded alternately into one or the other. In this case it should be 
explained what is going to occur. 

In any Frameset, there must be a NOFRAMES section, which should
explain what each frame is, provide links to the SRC document for each
frame, and explain the relationship between each frame. The example above 
provides a "seamless" version of this, which assumes the user doesn't want 
to know whether they are reading a frame-based site or not.


Techniques:

In HTML 4.0, each frame can have a LONGDESC attribute, which points to a 
document explaining the relationship of the frames more clearly.

otherwise???
