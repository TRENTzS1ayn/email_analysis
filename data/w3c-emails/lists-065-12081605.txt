I am uncomfortable about the idea of the guidelines being used as a 
checklist in a legal situation. They are Guidelines, and must be 
interpreted. Although we anticipate that an individual with a reasonable 
amount of intellect and some skill at web development will be able to 
understand them and produce accessible code, I do not think we can 
guarantee that they will be sufficient to mark off a website against in a 
legal situation. As well as that, there is the question of our own 
liability if such use is made, but that should be handled by lawyers.

(Besides, doesn't this offer us all lucrative stints as expert witnesses 
in discrimination actions? I'm sure at a suitable rate we could argue 
with each other for about 3 months, and then take the rest of the time on 
holidays. But I digress, and facetiously at that.)
