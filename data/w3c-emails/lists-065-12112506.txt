Unfortunately, it is not possible to duplicate frame semantics
with CSS2 and HTML 4 alone. Special values of 
the HTML 4 "target" attribute (see [1], section 6.16)
allow authors to specify the window in which a document is meant
to appear. While CSS2 positioning allows authors to create
frame-like appearance within a single window, CSS2 does not
allow authors to refer to other windows.

This is one reason why frames weren't "more deprecated" in HTML 4.0;
the target window behavior could not be reproduced in CSS.
