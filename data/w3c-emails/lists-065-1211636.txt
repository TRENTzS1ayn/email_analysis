Thanks Wendy,
Yup, we have been looking into rdf and accessibility, emphasizing RDF
accessibility support  techniques in contrast to evaluation techniques.
A care taker or volunteer could  retrofit a site through annotation and
these annotations could be available to anyone, making the site publicly
accessible.
I will try to get a demonstration going, although probably not this week.

Would this list be interested in reviewing this work, and maybe explore
incorporation with EARL ?

All the best,

Lisa Seeman
