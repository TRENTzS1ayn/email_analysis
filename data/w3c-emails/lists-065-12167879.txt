Dear GL members

We are building a list of open issues on the P A Guidelines.

Below is a summary what we have so far.  For the complete document please
see http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wai-gl-issues.html .   Please help us with any
other
ones you know of that aren't in this list.  

The first pass at the new techniques document will be available tomorrow in
preparation for Thursday's teleconference call as well as an updated
version of the GL home page.
