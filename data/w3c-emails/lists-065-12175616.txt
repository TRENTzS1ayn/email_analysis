Issue 7 - how do we handle ASCII art...

This issue probably ties in with the braille subgroup of PF, who are (I 
belive) also considering the problem of tactile representation of graphics.

The CSS solution I proposed before would solve the problem for CSS 
compliant browsers. If there were a marker at each end, then 
non-CSS-compliant non-text-display browsers could skip from one to the 
other (an anchor which is a bidirectional link would encourage them to do 
so...)
