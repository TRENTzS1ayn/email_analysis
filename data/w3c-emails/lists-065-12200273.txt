Indeed.  We should lead by example.

I'm maintaining /Mobile Web area at W3C, and all documents under
/Mobile are conforming to HTML 4.0 Strict DTD (I never publish
Web pages without validation!).  And also, I'd love to make our pages 
conforming to WAI Page Author Guidelines.  Mobile Access does
need accessibility consideration, so input from WAI is greatly
appreciated.

If you need help, I can validate and fix the documents.  Now I'm
fixing up markup errors of previous press releases (under /Press ).
If necessary, I'll do the same work for /WAI as well.
