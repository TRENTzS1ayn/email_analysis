Wendy,
I would like to expand the D-Link reference issue to be a more generic use
of the REL attribute of the ANCHOR tag for adding semantic markup of the
document.  REL could be used for not only identifying D-Links, but site
navigation anchors and items in or for a table of contents for a dcoument.
UAs could use this information to create pop up lists.  This could be part
of the META information section of the PA guidelines.
Jon
