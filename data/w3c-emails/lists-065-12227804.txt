Hello GL members,

From the newly updated GL home page you will find three links:

1.   the table version of the guidelines
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/19980624.htm
2.  the linear version of the guidelines
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/19980624txt.htm
3. the techniques document http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/techniques.htm

Please note that the following changes were made:

for the guidelines (both the table and linear) only three items were edited.  

1.The Techniques for B1 (separate content and structure from presentation)
to reflect discussions from last week's teleconference.
2.  two notes were added at the end of the general recommendations and will
be polished in the near future.

within the techniques document please note that there are only two small
sections that are polished enough for public consumption.  This is the
first guideline in the first section (A.1.1 - alternative text see
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/techniques.htm#A ) and the first guideline of the
second section (B.1.1 - separate content and structure from presentation
see http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/techniques.htm#B )

The rest has been pasted from the previous version of the guidelines (the
april 14th version).
