LONGDESC seems to be a solution to a problem that would largely go away 
if the OBJECT element were implemented properly. In the meantime I would 
recommend that OBJECT be used with content that includes (for example) 
the IMG element and a D-Link.

The only problem I have with that element is a UA one - it would be nice 
if all the pieces were accessible somehow, so that If I happen to get the 
movie I can still find (in a graphic example) the image and the 
alternative content by right-clicking or something.

(This gives complete access to the information without looking in the 
source. Not strictly necessary, but nicer in my opinion)
