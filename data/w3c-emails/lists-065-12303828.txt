To:"'GL - WAI Guidelines WG'"<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>


The focus for our phone call today will be

1) Are there any techniques that are listed as recommended that a
person cannot reasonably do (or be required to do)
- Example - we used to say that they should use style sheets and
not tables to lay out a page... yet no browsers today support
positioning with style sheets.  And if they did, a webmaster
still couldn't use this approach since most (or at least a large
part) of their audience would not yet be using these new
browsers.      So we would be requiring them to do something that
they cannot really do.

2) After identifying them... can we reword the recommendations to
make them realistic

3) How do we go about rating techniques separately from the
guidelines.   We have some not so important techniques that are
part of a list of techniques under a very important (required)
guideline.

The goal is to have a table form of the guidelines that could be
used to evaluate a site for accessibility if at all possible.
That is, the techniques would be there and something to indicate
the priority of the techniques and the expectation that they
could be (and SHOULD be ) put into practice today.

See you one the line
