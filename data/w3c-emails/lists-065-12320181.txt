Hey Charles... that is kind of neat!  I think it would be a valuable
addition. 
I have seen books on HTML and CSS that are structured sort of like that, and
they are useful because they present "the same old information" in a way that
suits a particular mind-set.  There are times when I want to look at my coding
in that way (just as there are times when the other ways suit my needs).
Maybe
an appendix?  Maybe an alternate view?
