The must / should / may approach is borrowed from W3C technical specs.

I think thta to go with it there should be a 'top ten bad moves' list. 
But the only one of those I read was in a book about how to use fancy 
Javascripts and applets to make your website completely useless. Oh, I 
mean look really flash on your own computer, and some people like you.

It does indeed rely on the W3C guidelines. And it is not a substitute - 
it is a 'dumbed down' version for a quick look. But it does seem an 
approach that can provide an interim level solution.

I would be interested to hear what others think who have followed the
guidelines from the beginning, but my feeling is that they are themselves
becoming simpler and better written. (Since I get up at 6am every week to
try and achieve this I hope so....)

(As always, this is my own opinion. I just try and get a lot for my 2 cents.)
