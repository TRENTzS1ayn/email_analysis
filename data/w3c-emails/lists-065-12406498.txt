Roberta  Cummins suggested us (http://www2.comune.bologna.it/bologna/aice/) to visit your very interesting 
website, many compliments!
I agree with her to invite you to issue guidelines for animated images and large area of blinking test in 
relation to photosenvitive epilepsy.  Large areas of blinking text could cause problems above all if there is 
a strong contrast of light that changes rapidly, at the some way problems may have with certain animated images 
which can be really dangerous to some people.  Note that they're not a problem in general, only that change 
rapidly from dark to light, like a strobe light.
Tank for your attention. Your sincerely, Giovanni Battista Pesce
