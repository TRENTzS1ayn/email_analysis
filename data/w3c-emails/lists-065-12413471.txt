Looking back over them, I think the things not yet covered are
ALT text for spacers, etc (this is a techniques thing. I haven't looked, 
so it may be there)

The priority given to making things keyboard accessible.

Daniel said that this was really a UA problem. Except for Scripts and 
applets, I am inclined to agree. But I think it is nonetheless P1

Tables. Mmm, tables. I'll talk about those in another mail later today.

But I think we have covered everything else?
