This is something like what I would like to see
It avoids the 'complex tables' language which really concerns me, and I 
think refers, perhaps briefly, to all the things I can think of.

I have put it into my linearised version of the latest guidelines, about 
which more in a minute

Priority 1
<H4>For tables, provide summaries, associate cells with row and column 
headers, and where appropriate group cells into categories.</H4>
Many user agents restructure tables to present them. Without appropriate 
markup the tables will not make sense when restructured. Tables also 
present special problems to screen-readers.
<OL>
<LI>Tables which produce text displayed as columns require a plain-text 
alternative. See last resorts [Priority 1]
<LI>Provide summaries for tables ("SUMMARY" on TABLE) [Priority 2]
<LI>Identify headers for Rows and Columns (TH) [Priority 2]
<LI>Where tables have structural divisions beyond those implicit in the 
rows and columns, use appropriate mark-up to identify those divisions 
(THEAD TFOOT TBODY AXIS SCOPE COLGROUP etc) [Priority 2]
<LI>Provide abbreviations for header labels ("abbr" on TH) [Priority 3]
