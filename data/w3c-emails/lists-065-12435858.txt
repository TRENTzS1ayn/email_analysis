I'm not sure who is working on them at the moment. I combined what was 
the 'latest version' yeterday with (I hope) most of what went on in the 
call today, and then added some stuff I thought was important 
(class="new"). So it's not quite the current version anymore - that got 
sent to a few folks this morning.

My linear version (minus links to the techniques) is at
