Hello All,

For over a year and a half HiSoftware has been running our free
accessibility checking system online as an educational tool:

http://www.hisoftware.com/access/sitetest.htm

As of about ten minutes ago it has been updated to include the following
additional capabilities:

1. Alt Text Quality Report
More information on this report:
http://www.hisoftware.com/cc/altquality.htm

2. Searchability Report
More information on this report:

3. Metadata Policy Report (Accessibility and Intellectual Property
tests)
More Information on this report..

Feel free to take it for a test drive! Also if anyone can thing of
another report/custom test suite that could help users of this web test
please let us know so we can include it into this web based test system.
Examples (XML Test, SVG Test, CSS Test etc... Or another set of HTML or
XHTML test suites)

Cheers,

Rob Yonaitis
