I agree that HTML should be used as the HTML architects intended to
separate content from presentation.  WAI should do all it can to support
the efforts to educate authors, user agent developers and authoring tols to
support this concept.  The separation of content from presentation is not
done in practice by most HTML authors and probably will not become part of
practice for a long time.  Most HTML authors really do not understand the
principle or even very much about HTML, and look at HTML as a presentation
language.  Most authors will use what ever HTML tags work to make the pages
look how they want people to see them.

The choice of WAI is to stand fast and say this is wrong and that authors
should do it the "right" way.  Which means there will probably be low
compliance, at least for a long time until other pressures or technologies
push authors in that direction.

One other choice is to work with how people actual use HTML and try to
provide information that can be used by user agents and authoring tools to
improve access to information by persons with disabilities.
