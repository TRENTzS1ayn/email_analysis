My approach is pragmatic since tables are used for formatting.  Current CSS
positioning implmentations on Navigator and Explorer are slightly
different, resulting in compatibility concerns by authors wanting to use
CSS positioning instead of tables.  

Being in the area of rehabilitation for a long time.  I don't think that
WAI saying that people should not use tables will be compeling enough for a
number of reasons:

1. Most authors using authoring tools may not even know the difference
between TABLES and CSS.
2. Many HTML authors are concerned primarily with the visual look and feel
and view HTML as a presentation language and would not switch to CSS if it
meant their pages would look significantly different in non-CSS graphical
browsers.
3. Most documentation on HTML and educational resources talk about using
tables for formatting.
4. To people who know about the foundations of HTML they can see the "hack"
of using TABLE for spatial layout, but for people with less information
they do not see it as a "hack".  To tell them it is a "hack" and they
shouldn't use them may turn them away from accessibility.

My primary interest is improving accessibility.  If we can make the authors
more comfortable and give them more flexibility in providing accessibility
I would be willing add META information to TABLEs to help them improve
accessibility.  If the language is being missused from original intent, I
don't think WAI should ignore that in it's guidelines.
