As I recall META itself can only be used in the HEAD. For TABLE, there 
are meta-information markers such as AXIS, TH, COLGROUP, which are 
recommended in the guidelines.

TITLE for link was there, but fell out in favour of providing proper 
information in the text of the link.

TITLE for HR fell off the list of necessary things. HR is really a  visual
border, which can be reproduced in CSS using DIV. If it is dividing a 
document into sections (its most common use) then DIV or H1 H2 H3 etc are 
the best approach. If it isn't, what is it doing in the page?

D-link can be used to provide meta-information about images and things 
EMBEDded.

OBJECT (and APPLET)
can provide their own metadata.
