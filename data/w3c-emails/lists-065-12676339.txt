I still don't get the bit about using D-link with frames.

One can't put anchors in the FRAMESET, and the FRAME element
is empty.

The idea is to describe the frames in the NOFRAMES section?
If so, I don't like it. The NOFRAMES section hould "behave"
like a normal page, as if the site has no frames.

Nir Dagan.
