I was very interested to read your guidelines.  I wondered whether you are
aware of the needs of people with photosensitive epilepsy, whereby
flickering images, patterns and some colour contrasts can trigger an
epileptic seizure.  Whilst it is probably impossible to remove all risk, the
risks can be greatly reduced without spoiling the visual impact.  In the UK
we have strict guidelines for TV production designed to protect people with
photosensitive epilepsy amd it would be good if we could carry this kind of
care through on to the web.

If you require further information please do not hesitate to contact me - we
would be delighted to help.
