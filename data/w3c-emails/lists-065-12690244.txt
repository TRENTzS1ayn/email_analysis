JRGs response to Jason White.  
I am not advocating the missuse of tables for positioning.   I am saying if
someone is using a tables for positioning or for data display that they can
label how they are using the table to improve accessibility by a user
agent.  I don't think WAI or the W3C can stem the tide of people using
tables for positioning.  I am sure that if you ask most Web authors if they
thought positioning was a missuse of tables they would say no, since most
authoring books, workshops and authoring tools tell them to do it that way.
 I have concerns about waiting for majority of the HTML authors to switch
to CSS positioning techniques for pages to become more accessible.
Remember that most HTML authors have not even heard of the W3C and most
view HTML as a presentation language, not a structural language.  While
this is unfortunate, it is also reality.  I have done presentations here at
UIUC on using CSS for positioning and the feedback I get in why people will
not use CSS is the incompatibility of the current browsers that support CSS
positioning and that authors want their pages to look how they intended on
older 2.x and 3.x browsers.
