Tables:

1. I have tables that look and read fine in Lynx 2.4.2 through 
2.7.2, that make sense in HelpRead (formerly Read To Me), but 
which fail the "sheet of paper over graphical browser screen" 
rule of thumb.  How do screen readers really work?  Straight 
across, or taking cells and paragraphs into account?

2. Bobby (CAST) implies that a text-only version is required 
for all tables with more than one cell.  I believe this imposes 
an undue burden on webmasters.

3. If tables are discouraged, I think conscientious webmasters 
will make greater use of imagemaps... but I also believe that 
imagemaps are a greater burden to accessibility than well-designed 
tables.

ALT text: What is appropriate ALT text for a thumbnail?

Audio/Video: What sort of visual transcription is proposed for 
audio files of instrumental music?  Conversely, what sort of 
audio file must accompany a tablature arrangement of music?
