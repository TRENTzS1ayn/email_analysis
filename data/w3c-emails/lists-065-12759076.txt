In Netscape browsers one uses the EMBED element to add plugins
or background sound (The OBJECT element was added as of
Navigator 4.02 or 4.03 but the support is pretty paltry).

Although EMBED is not part of HTML 4.0 or HTML 3.2, Netscape
does provide a NOEMBED alternative element which should be
filled in to improve accessibility. This should be placed in
the guidelines, possibly the C.1 section.
