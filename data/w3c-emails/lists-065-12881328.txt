Let's be realistic folks.  EMBED is not "invalid HTML", it's a
browser-specific tag, but that alone doesn't make it bad.  At the Face2Face
meetings in Peterborough, I pointed out that the guidelines also said "Don't
use <BLINK> and <MARQUEE> because they are propriety."

Well, that's not a good enough reason not to use them.  The guidelines
should focus on the accessibility aspects of things and that's all.
