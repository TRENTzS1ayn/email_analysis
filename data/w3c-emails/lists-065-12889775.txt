B.1.3. Use relative sizing and positioning rather than absolute.

I'm not sure what this is referring to. In the FONT element
there is no way in HTML 4.0 to do anything other than the
relative 1-7 font sizes. Navigator has a proprietary attribute
to FONT called POINT-SIZE but this fall under the edict
of not using proprietary extensions to HTML.

If this is a style sheet issue, then it shouldn't be a problem
because the user should be able to override the value with
their own style sheet settings. Anyone know what this is
about?
