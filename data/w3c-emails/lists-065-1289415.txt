Hello,

There is more work to do, but a new draft is available.  This is primarily 
to let you all review the latest structure I'm using.
http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/2002/10/WD-EARL10-20021004.html

Major things to take care of before publishing as a TR draft:
1. make sure the use of terms in the prose matches the terms defined in the 
schema
2. minor touch-ups on schema
3. outline issues related to the schema. My understanding is that we have 4 
issues:
     1. testMode - is it just manual and automatic or do we include 
heuristic?
     2. defining groups of test cases.
     3. uniquely identifying user agents
     4. uniquely identifying pieces of content (the hash/normalization issue)
4. Make sure all terms defined in schema are described in prose.
5. Clean up as many comments as possible.

For the classes and properties, I used a structure similar to what Nadia 
suggested at the June F2F.  Let me know if this works.

Please review this draft for:
1. General flow and content
2. Is the intro too general?  Too long?  How does it flow?
3. Will a reader who doesn't know RDF or XML have difficulty understanding 
what it is about?
4. Will a reader who knows RDF and XML find fault with any language used? 
examples?
5. There are 2 intro paragraphs, which do you prefer?

Thanks much,
--wendy
