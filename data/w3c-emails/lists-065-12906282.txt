Proprietary extensions to HTML should be completely avoided. In the first
place, they tend to be layout mechanisms that would be better implemented
through style sheets. Secondly, they are only supported by specific user
agents and are thus detrimental to interoperability. This is a
particularly important point: an accessible document must be able to be
rendered equally well in a variety of different media with a range of
software and output devices. The effect of proprietary elements and
attributes is that the author's intention is only fully realised by a
particular user agent. Thus I disagree radically with Chuck Opperman's
assertion that recommending against the use of such extensions involves
moving beyond the purview of universal design. Use by all, irrespective of
ability, implies interoperability in the sense that the reader should be
able to access the document via different devices, employing different
HTML user agents.
