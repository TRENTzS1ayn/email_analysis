In my view the WAI guidelines try to define what is 
an accessible HTML document. In order to to that one 
first has to define what is an HTML document.

The approach that I support is to take HTML4.0
as the definition of an HTML document, and restrict 
attention to accessible documents within this scope.

It is possible to write invalid accessible documents.
However in order to write a well defined guidelines, 
there is a need to write a new HTML spec/DTD that takes 
into account the extentions that we want to consider.

For example saying use NOEMBED whenever you use EMBED
implies the question "What is the content of NOEMBED
and what elements allow NOEMBED as content?"
 
"See Netscape documantation" is not an answer since 
this documentation tells you that you can write CENTER
inside P, and gives  <A name="foo"><H1>heading 
in anchor</H1></A> as an example of how to use anchors.
