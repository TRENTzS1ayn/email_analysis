There are two different things to consider.

One is defining a list of roles for document relationship like "next in 
print order", "toc", etc.

The other is defining how to encode this relationship.

We can work on the former in our WAI forum, although it could probably 
be handled somewhere as it is pretty pervasive (some of it is already
in the HTML spec)

For the second, the issue is that we have a W3C technology, RDF,
that's coming along with a solution for metadata like that, and we
also have attributes, such as rel, that already exists in HTML.

One question is whether it's worth defining a bunch of roles without
an agreed way to implement them (assuming we can't make our mind
between RDF and simple/obsolete rel) and what will the UA do with
either a too-modern solution or a too-old solution: maybe nothing.

Since it's in the HTML spec, we could push on author and authoring
tools for adding rel for LINK in the HTML head (like the W3C
slidemaker tool does) and on UA for presenting them to user (like lynx
does).
