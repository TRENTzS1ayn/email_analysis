again, two things: what are the information we want to convey: data,
layout (but isn't it officializing it to give it a code name?),
row-first, col-first.

and how to mark it up: one way is the HTML class attribute, another
might be RDF again, but we don't have it quite ready yet.

same dilemma: which AU or UA is going to implement it using class when 
RDF is the next hot thing ?
