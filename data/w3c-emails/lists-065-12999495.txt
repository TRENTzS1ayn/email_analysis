three options: 

- free style: in the object content, which is its short
description, put a link to the long description in plain french or
using a D.

<OBJECT data=gif>
photo of the earth from space <A HREF=long.htm>D</A>
</OBJECT>

- rel convention: in addition to free style, you mark the A to the
long desc with rel=longdesc (or dlink)

<OBJECT data=gif>
photo of the earth from space <A REL=longdesc HREF=long.htm>D</A>
</OBJECT>


- using param: 

<OBJECT data=gif>
photo of the earth from space <A HREF=long.htm>D</A>
<PARAM name=longdesc value=long.htm>
</OBJECT>


adding semantic (like REL or PARAM) allows for better processing on
the UA side. we need more experience from user or object param to
decide.


Wendy also raised a issue with nested OBJECT and which long desc
applies to what, that I'd like to see presented in relation to that.

none, I think we should drop mention dlink for IMG altogether, just
talk about LONGDESC, people that do longdesc before it's in tools will
and can decide for themselves if they add D links or not.
