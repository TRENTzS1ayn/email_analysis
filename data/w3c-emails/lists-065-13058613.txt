I agree it's more important.

where does "structural markup" stop and "metadata" start is the 
issue: what's data to one application is meta to another.

how about the example of attributes added to table to allow for better 
navigation: this is within a page.

where does frame navigation or form navigation fit ?

the HTML4 spec already defines a list of such relationship
(http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#h-6.12)

agreed, to the extent that they can both be used together without
breaking anything

also agreed to the extent that one (LINK) is a much simpler way of
doing something the other supports (or will) more exhaustively.

yeah, but that's really a last resort hack (to paliate poor xml
include facilities in html) and shouldn't be used as an argument
