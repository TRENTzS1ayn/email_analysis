using PARAM to provide a LONGDESC for OBJECTs is analagous to using 
LONGDESC. It can point to a full document, with all the markup you could 
want. It can also handle the cascade of objects nicely.

The use of OBJECT content is slightly different - it is an either/or 
situation.

The sort of problem which PARAM could solve is where an OBJECT is used 
with a MAP, and it is desirable both to present the OBJECT, and to give 
users access to a fuller description of it.

This does not mean OBJECT should not have content - it MUST.
