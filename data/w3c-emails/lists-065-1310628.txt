Do any of the evaluation and repair tools place a meta data tag in the html
source of a web page after the page is evaluated and/or repaired?

Bobby 4.0, PageScreamer 4.1, and Lift (to name a few) do not seem to have
that option.  Some have the option to add an icon to the page (Lift and
Bobby for example have "approved by" icons).

Should the tools have the option to add meta tag?

Does Dublin Core provide a standard or reserved "name" for E R T's?

Would/should a meta tag ever point to an EARL file?

For example,

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">
<html lang="en-US" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
<title>Some validated and repaired Web page</title>
<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1" />
<meta name="copyright" content="copyright (c) 2002 by IBM corporation" />
<meta name="owner" content="pjenkins@us.ibm.com" />
<meta name="validated and repaired" content="Some tool name, date, and
perhaps EARL url here" />
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="IBM WebSphere Studio Homepage Builder
V6.0.2 for Windows">
