I heartily encourage everyone to look at the NEW   Bobby 3.0

1)They have much improved and enhanced it.
2)it is a beta   -  so if you have input or comments, or whatever   they
are most useful if you send them in as soon as possible. (it will have a
short beta cycle before being released in final form)

Oh,  the URL is
