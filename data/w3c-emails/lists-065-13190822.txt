Two comments are in order here:

1. The guidelines document itself should comply to the HTML 4.0 strict DTD
and take advantage of all relevant features of the HTML specification,
especially in the marking up of the table which summarises its substantive
requirements.

2. It is, and ought to be, mandatory for authors to comply with a W3C HTML
DTD (or ISO HTML, assuming that the latter is adopted). Perhaps a note
could be added in the explanatory text which calls the attention of page
designers and software developers to the deprecated elements mentioned in
the HTML 4.0 specification, which ought to be avoided in favour of style
sheets, particularly when user agent developers have implemented the
latter in a reasonably consistent manner.
