Can people take a look at that please?  It's taking a slightly different
approach to Page Valet, and I'm contemplating bringing Valet into line
with this.

It asserts that a page passes or fails validation - no problem there
(so long as we accept no-reification).

In the case of a fail, it adds a set of further assertions for each
validation error.  These use rdf:about to identify the page, and
identify subject as the offsets within the page[1].  They also use
validation error messages as EARL testcases.  I like it, but I wonder
if it might be too much of an "interesting" approach.


[1] I note a bug in the "offset" field; will try & fix that ASAP.
