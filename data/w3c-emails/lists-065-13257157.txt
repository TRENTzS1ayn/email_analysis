Nir, English is the way it is writ, so hyper-textual could be acceptable. 
(There is something funny about having a Frenchman and a Spaniard working 
out how to put stuff in plain English)

More to the point, Daniel's suggestions sound very sensible to me. 
'Degrading Gracefully' seems to be what Daniel's section A covers. And I 
think a section C 'General Guidelines' or an introduction is a good idea, 
again as per Daniel's suggestion.
