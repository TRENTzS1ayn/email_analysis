There is a new version of the Guidelines Working Draft up on the GL website
http://www.w3.org/wai/gl/

as before there is a table version and a linear version of the guidelines.

Table version is http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/19980806.htm
The linear version is http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/19980806txt.htm

This set has incorporated as many of the following as we could (compatibly)
cover
-comments on the lists
-comments made at Peterborough
-the results of coordination talks between the chairs of all the guidelines
and tool groups

We still have a few to work on but wanted to get this out to the list for
use, study and comment.

We will be using this document as a reference document from here forward.
That is, we will begin logging changes that are made to make it easier to
follow.  So much has happened though that we haven't been able to do that in
the past while.    So give this one a thorough read and we'll reference
discussions back to this one.

Thanks everyone for all the input and hard work.

Gregg for the Chairs and Editors
