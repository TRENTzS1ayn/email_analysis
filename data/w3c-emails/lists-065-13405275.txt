I've looked at Susan's Lesch's versions of the W3C 
home page.

My conclusion: Tables are dead. CSS now.

I am using Windows 3.1 with low resolution 
(about 600 pixels wide.)

Both Netscape 4.05 and Explorer4.01 render 
almost identical layout, and look great.
and in my view both are easier to read than 
the actual W3C page. 

The right column becomes very dense in the W3C site,
where in Lesch's pages it appears well.

I find the design with unordered lists more appealing.

An interesting point is that the logical order of things 
is different in Lesch's pages than in the W3C. 

In W3C the right column (starting with "User Interface") comes 
right after the latest new article, where in Lesch's 
design it comes last.

I wonder if a CSS layout can be done while keeping the 
original logical order of the content.
