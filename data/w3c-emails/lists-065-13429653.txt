Well, unless CSS can provide the same layout capability than table,
and keep the same reading order when turned off, it's hard to
say.

That's my point.

W3C's home page layout design is 2 major columns with 2 sub-columns in
the left major column; the right major column is the table of content
into the domain activities and the left column contains 3 zones: a
lead story cell starting with our logo, 2 background info sub-columns,
and some trailer text (not to mention a bunch of margins)

ascii art, that gives something like:

  lead story lead story       domain column
  lead story lead story       domain column
  lead story lead story       domain column
  lead story lead story       domain column
                              domain column
  -----------------------     domain column
                              domain column
  background   background     domain column
  background   background     domain column
  background   background     domain column
  background   background     domain column
  background   background     domain column
  background   background     domain column
                              domain column
  trailer trailer trailer     domain column
  trailer trailer trailer     domain column
  trailer trailer trailer    


and the reading order is:
  lead story
  domain column
  background
  trailer


Is that doable with today CSS implementation ?
I don't think so, but maybe I'm wrong, I haven't spent much time on
it.
