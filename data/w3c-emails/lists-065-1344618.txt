A-Prompt does not place EARL or a meta tag in the page. We store the
evaluation/repair results in a separate file in EARL format.

I like Nick's suggestion of adding meta info that points to the
evaluation/repair report:

>
> <meta name="access.summary" content="earl#fails; repairs identified">
> <meta name="access.report" content="report.rdf">

I wonder what users would think of a tool that added a couple extra lines to
their files?
