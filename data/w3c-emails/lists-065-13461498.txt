Copied below you will find some advice I gave, in an unguarded
moment, to someone about a form on their website.

One of the things I said was "put the explanation of a text-line
entry field before the entry field on the same line."

I couldn't find a basis for this recommendation in the current PA
guidelines draft.  Is this suggestion unnecessary?  Should it be
in the PA guidelines?

For your forms (minimum short-range plan):

1. Ensure that entry filed description and entry field
appear on the same line.

2. Initialize all text-entry fields with some placeholder
content.  Don't leave them empty, initially.

3. [Work with XXXXXXXXX to] arrange for some hands-on
evaluation by people using varied adaptive technology
suites.  Use this after you have a next-iteration version
implementing at least the above two points for fine tuning
and final approval.
