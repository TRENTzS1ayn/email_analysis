Thanks for the quick response and the reference.

The testing referred to in the analysis only mentions checkboxes.

The specific control I was dealing with was an <INPUT TYPE=text>
entry item, used for entering name, address, etc.  I probably
didn't make that clear.

I suspect that the bottom line is the same, however: there are
enough users out there today whose screen readers won't be told
about the label-for relationship so that it is good practice to
make read-line succeed in explaining what is going on.

Is that true?
