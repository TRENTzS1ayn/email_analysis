In Internet Explorer 4.01 TITLE always supercedes ALT as the ToolTip.

So:
If ALT="Only ALT" then the words "Only ALT" appear in the image box and the
ToolTip will be "Only ALT".
If ALT="" then nothing is printed in the image box and no ToolTip appears.
if ALT="ALT text" and TITLE="TITLE text" then "ALT text" appears in the
image box and "TITLE text" appears in the ToolTip.
if TITLE="Only TITLE" then nothing appears in the image box and "Only TITLE"
appears in the ToolTip.
if ALT="ALT text" and TITLE="" (null) then "ALT text appears in the image
box and no ToolTip appears.
if ALT="" (null) and TITLE="TITLE text" then nothing appears in the image
box and "TITLE text" appears in the ToolTip.
if ALT=" " (space) and TITLE="" (null) then the image box contains the space
and no ToolTip appears.
if ALT="" (null) and TITLE=" " (space) then the image box contains nothing
and a small blank ToolTip appears.

So, if ALT exists and TITLE does not, then the ALT text is used for the
ToolTip.  However, a page author can suppress the showing of a ToolTip by
making TITLE="", regardless of what is in ALT.  

The ALT tag is always shown in the image box.

In the Active Accessibility object model, both attributes are always
available.

[Note In-reply-to header above.  Current thread on WAI-IG]

Does anyone know what the various tool-tip implementations
do if instead of 

>    <IMG SRC="foo.blah" ALT="alternative_string" TITLE="tooltip_string">

they encounter

  <IMG SRC="images/blank.gif" ALT=" " TITLE="">  ?

Can one get a non-popup of the tool-tip by a null TITLE string?
Or null ALT in the absense of TITLE?
