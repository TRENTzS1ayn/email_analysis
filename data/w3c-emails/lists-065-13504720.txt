I'm not sure what your question is, Al.

>Can one get a non-popup of the tool-tip by a null TITLE string?

The fact that the IMG ALT is defined as a space is irrelevant. If TITLE
is null, then no tooltip is appropriate.

If in the example given a UA represents the space by a tooltip, that UA
is BAD (Broken As Designed). 

>Or null ALT in the absense of TITLE?

I've been through all this before on www-html in the thread to which I
referred. IMO IMG TAG should *never* be used as a tooltip, since it is
ALTernative textual content to replace an image which is not available
to the user agent, whereas tooltips are supplementary information. 

Provision of the former as the latter in an environment in which the
original image has already been rendered merely provides confusing
clutter in the display. For example - the case posed by the original
poster in this thread.
