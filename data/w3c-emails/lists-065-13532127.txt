In the era of stylesheets color blind people may override all 
author defined colors, asuming their browsers 
are designed for usability. To a large extent this would be 
a solution.

There are web creatures in which you cannot override colors, e.g.,
images of types used nowadays. (vector graphics may be different)

Also some older browsers do not allow to override colors defined 
via table cells (TD) or the FONT element. And some recognize 
the FONT color, but not the TD background color.

So my recommendation is first to promote the usage of stylesheets 
for colors (without restrictions concerning color blidness) and 
put all the color blind restrictions with respect to images.

Using FONT and TD for colors should be generally discouraged 
as it gives trouble to everyone.

Regards,
Nir Dagan.
