DC.Relation.conformsto would be the obvious choice from teh Dublin Core
vocabulary that I know. But I don't think that inside the page is the best
place to put this kind of information - apart from anything it restricts the
ability of people to decribe information they cannot directly edit - which
cuts out the possiblity for third parties to provide valuable information
taht would help users (one of the neat features of PICS...)
