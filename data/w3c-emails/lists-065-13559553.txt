At the moment the WAI guidelines suggest that if you use complex 
java-, script- or table-based layouts you need to provide an alternative, 
text-only version.

RMIT University developed a Java version of their front page, and by some 
miracle were persuaded to have a non-java version as well. In fact the 
non-java is the default, with the option for java. Apparently (so says 
the webmaster but I have no figures) the Java version is almost never 
visited. I believe that frames (the most useful of all the design 
elements which cause accessibilty problems) elicit a similar response. 

So perhaps we should suggest that if you want to use tablebased layout it 
should be your secondary (rather than your primary) version - that your 
front page should be without them, providing an equal front door to all 
users, and then you can offer people the choice of visual pages or 
universal pages.
