I agree with Gregg, we need to get HTML authors to take the page author
guidelines seriously and guide them into thinking and learning more about
accessibility, especially CSS for formatting and positioning.  If the
guidelines say tables are forbidden, I think many authors will discount the
use of the guidelines.  I think "whenever and whereever" statement on CSS
needs to be expanded to include more detail and guidance, but that may be a
job for education and outreach.  

I think another critical aspect of the equation is when will tools support
the guidelines, most authors understand little about the underlying HTML.
So tools will be critical.
