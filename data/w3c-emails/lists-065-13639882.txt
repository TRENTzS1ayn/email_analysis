To:"GL - WAI Guidelines WG (E-mail)"<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>


There is a new version of the GL guidelines up
You can get to both the Table and linear versions at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/

for convenience
the table version is http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-19980825.html
and the linear version is
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-19980825-txt.html

There is a techniques document under preparation which is attached to the
both of the guidelines.

The GUIDELINES (which has the major techniques listed in it) is close to
being ready to send out.  SO PLEASE look it over carefully and give us any
feedback.  This document needs to be cleared by GL and we are trying to do
it in the next 7 days.      It will then be sent to IG for review  ---
After covering comments from both GL and IG and making any adjustments it
will be headed for a public release.

We want this one to be a good one? and one that can lead us to a
recommendation in the near future.

So once again,  please take the time to look it over carefully.


THE TECHNIQUES document (which gives more detail on the techniques along
with examples, is not done. But we have posted it for your comments and
input.     We would like input both on content and organization.

(NOTE   all of the links from the Guidelines doc to the Techniques Doc  will
take you to the top of the Techniques doc.    Later we will link them in to
the specific place they belong.

Thanks much

The editors and chairs.
