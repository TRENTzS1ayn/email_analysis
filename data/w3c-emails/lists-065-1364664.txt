As (most of) you know, AccessValet 1.0 generates diagnostic messages
to help a web content developer identify and fix violations of
WCAG or Section508.

AccessValet 1.1 extends the capabilities of 1.0 by taking the operator
through a process of classifying each warning: is this in fact a
violation, and if so what to do about it.  The purpose of this is to
generate a briefer accessibility report that can form part of a
management or QA process.  EARL is of course a primary target format.

I've been messing around with how to express this in EARL, and I'd
like to ask for review on my current ideas.  I've taken a brief
Valet report, and added comments to the EARL to make it clear what's
going on (chaals - does this use of "heuristic" meet your approval?)

I still don't think I understand the significance of reification here:-(
