Hello,

If you have already been looking at the latest version of the guidelines you might have noticed that the technique for A.12.2 was a little short.  It used to read, "If possible, ensure that see also A.11" while it should (and now does) say, "If possible, ensure that all elements that have their own interface are keyboard operable (see also A.11)."

A matter of missing quotes.
thanks,
--wendy
