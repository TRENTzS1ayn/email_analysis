I found only seven miniscule things to mention in the Techniques' Examples (except that including optional end tags like </TH> in the TABLE examples may help Netscape and maybe others' CSS display). Sorry for any mistakes introduced here.

Keyboard access: lines 503 to 504
LABEL element needs to refer to an ID attribute (rather than to NAME).

Lists: line 701
LI element needs a ending greater than (&gt;).

Tables: lines 752, 804, and 828
I don't know the meaning of 'TABLE border="border"'. (In HTML 4.0, border accepts a value in pixels.) 

Brief descriptions for images: lines 984 to 985
IMG element needs TITLE attribute.

Long descriptions for images: line 998
URI needs a closing double quote (").

Pictures of text: lines 1406 to 1409
The CSS 'first-letter' pseudo-element may not be widely implemented yet, and it might or might not make sense in place of the SPAN dropcap example.

Rules and borders: lines 1544 to 1546
The CSS class ".redline" could stand alone, or needs IMG as a selector (rather than HR).
