I like the new version, especially in the table form :-).

One thing that bothers me still is that HTML does not use alt-text
long-desc and maybe also the other attributes consistently. It would be so
easy to say that with every object with an image or a video or animation
use alt-text for purpose X and long-desc for purpose Y.

Now we need to have separate techniques for OBJECTS that are not explained
in guideline 2 techniques and with FRAME we need to explain that you have
to use a HTML file just because src attribute does not take alt-text
(guideline 5). And a FRAME does take a long-desc attribute.

I think it is important to try to make these more consistent. Now these are
harder to explain and there is more chance that different authoring tools
interprete the attributes differently. If we later have other similar
attributes things just become more and more complicated.

As there are probably some things we cannot change right now, should we
have an additional column in the table that explains how be wish these
things would be done in the future versions of HTML?
