I think the priority wording should be different than for Guidelines. 

In fact, it is confusing to use the same term (Priority) as for the
guidelines.

I'd prefer if we use [1st Choice] or [Preferred] [Advised].

If this is a tutorial that can help with techniques, but not
techniques, we should consider moving it in Annex.

We could say that most presentational elements are deprecated in 4.0.

> 
> Structural elements

I would carry the attributes under the same section.
  Structural elements and attributes

> Presentation elements
> 
> Style sheets
>      STYLE

If the message is that presentation element is bad, we should consider 
moving this one in structure, which it is, considered under the angle
where it *announces* style.

Cut&paste typo here I guess.

better use an example that's not the default behavior.

Is alt="*" OK ?

Also show the example where the longdesc is a dlink within the
content.

    <OBJECT data="97sales.gif" type="image/gif">
           Chart of our Sales in 1997. 
           A <A HREF="desc.htm">textual description</A> is available.
    </OBJECT>

> <SPAN alt="smile" title="smiley in ascii art">:-)</SPAN>

No ALT on SPAN, can use class=smile instead.

Mention that INPUT image are server side image map as well.

You mean HR, not IMG

Is the FRAME name an abbreviation of its title ?

When I read that I thought, this is bogus, NOFRAMES can only be used
in the FRAMESET section of a frameset document. 
But when I checked the HTML4.0 DTD, I found that the Transitional DTD
support NOFRAMES as a regular block.

I wonder where are described the semantics that you present here
(HTML 4 only mentions the frameset case), but I guess they are
correct. 
 
> the initial title of the frame ("Apples") will no longer match the current
> content of the frame ("Oranges").

How is this different from saying "Frame title=TOC" and later on
loading an index in the frame ?

I guess my point is we should recommend that frame title/name are
stable and that we should drop this guidelines specific to images
(but mentions longdesc support when we talk about image longdesc)

Actually, anything that is not a known target will create a new
window.

[I already raised this bug in HTML before: UI effect should not be
specified in the markup (this is similar in nature to saying Button2
spawns a new window, which has nothing to do with HTML)]
