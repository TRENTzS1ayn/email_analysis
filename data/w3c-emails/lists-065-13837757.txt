I think the priority wording should be different than for Guidelines.

In fact, it is confusing to use the same term (Priority) as for the
guidelines.

I'd prefer if we use [1st Choice] or [Preferred] [Advised].


GV:  The priorities for the techniques are used in the guidelines document.
In fact the rating for the guidelines and the rating for the techniques are
tied together.   So the two are directly related.   It would be very
confusing to have two different ratings in the same doc.   Also, I think it
is the techniques where the ratings are most important? since it is there
that the authors will evaluate their pages and decide what is important to
do or not? or whether their pages pass or not.

So we think they need to be the same.  In fact we think it is important that
they be the same.

Your thoughts?  Others thoughts?
