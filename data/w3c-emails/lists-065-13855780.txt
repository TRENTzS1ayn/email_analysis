In the new techniques document, all of the structural elements and the
presentation elements are separated into two lists. We can link to this
definition from the guidelines document.

good point.  This seems to fit better in A.1 where we discuss image maps.
Particularly with A.1.5 For all graphical buttons (INPUT type="image")
provide alt-text (via the "alt" attribute)

Yes, it seems a set of buttons creates a "what to do next" structure, i.e.,
here are the possibilities of what you can do once you've filled out a
form.  The separate buttons would hopefully be identified by both a group
label and individual labels that would make their purpose and grouping clear. 

 "Buttons" refers to 
 <INPUT type="image">
or
<INPUT type="button">
