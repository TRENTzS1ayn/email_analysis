Daniel,
thanks for the comments.  you raised quite a few issues!  See our comments

thanks for your faith, Daniel.  <grin>
Yes, we agreed that the organization needed to be simplified.  We heard
that from a few people.  Thus, we took the suggestions we were given and
worked out what you have read in the most recent release.  We think it
works pretty well <grin>, and would like to comment further on your
suggestions for moving a few of the guidelines around.  More comments follow.

We'll leave it for now.  Although it is a bit wordy, we hope it is clear
and can stand well on its own.

Hmm.  

The first section (A) is about "Graceful transformations."  A
transformation is not necessarily a textual representation of a graphical
or auditory element.  It could be a still image of a frame from a movie, or
auditory descriptions of the visual presentations within a movie.  So, our
definition of transform gracefully is, "a page remains usable despite user,
technological, or situational constraints."  Therefore, A.6, A.7, A.9, and
A.12 are definately guidelines for graceful transformation.

again, this is the last ditch way to make a page transform gracefully. so
we believe it should stay where it is in A.

The recommendation will be just the linearized version of the guidelines
(to be posted after this is sent).  The techniques will be a separate
non-normative document.  However, links to the techniques document will
appear throughout the guidelines - as they appear now.  (The "leading"
techniques are the items in the techniques column?)

so, if we leave this technique link as is, but include a definition in our
definitions, this will satisfy this concern?  How about:  
image:  a graphical element presenting information visually
image maps:  images that contain links
applets: applications that can not stand alone (i.e., a sub-process that
runs within a user agent process space).

how about "or any users who have chosen not to view graphics."  Some people
choose not to view graphics either because they can not due to a physical
disability, or they have chosen not to because it would take too long to
download.

we think it best to leave the link as is, and provide the detail in the
techniques document.

content may be provided using the APPLET element.  OBJECT is covered in
technique #7 ("If OBJECT is used...).

exactly, which is why we have technique A.6.4 ("do not use an image map to
create a set of buttons...") and per the earlier e-mail response to
Marja-Ritta we are moving it into A.1

since this sentence appears in the guidelines (which will be normative) and
we aren't sure what all is possible or needed, we were purposefully vague
with this one.

some of the technique type of wording is needed in order for an author to
determine if they need to follow this guideline.  alt-text is "a" technique
described under "alternative text."  How about we change this to, "2.
Provide descriptions for graphics, scripts, or applets that convey
important information unless they are already fully described (through

alternative text or in the document's content). [Priority1]"

hmmm, this sounds similar to: "If an image is decorative, what do we put
for the alt-text?"  because *something* is needed.  It's going to depend on
how the audio is incorporated into the page.  If someone provides a text
link to the audio clip, oftentimes the link phrase provides sufficient
information.  In your example, I would argue that a transcript *should* be
provided since there are many ways to appreciate a song.  If the artist is
not only a good guitar player but a poet as well, I'm gonna want to read
those lyrics.  However, if it's Beethoven's 9th, will I provide the score?
No, but the caption "Beethoven's 9th played by the Chicago Symphony
Orchestra" should be sufficient.  Therefore, all audio gets captioned.

yes, this one got stretched pretty thin to accomodate the technique.  We've
been wrestling with it for a while and earlier this week folded the
technique (source of a frame must be an HTML file) into frames transforming
gracefully (as you suggested, also).

Well, it could fit into "separate structure from presentation" but we
thought it would be easier for an author to understand and find if we
grouped the two color techniques into one color guideline.

tee-hee.  if we change Hertz to "flashes per second" does it still make you
want to dig out the analyser from the basement?  We can't provide a good
way to determine the high end (the low end is fairly simple), but know it
is an established set of limits.  any ideas?

hmmm. What you have as rationale is part of the guideline.  The rationale
is, "Some pages will be unable to transform gracefully at this time either
because the visual components are too complex, or because assistive
technologies or user agents (browsers) are lacking a specific feature.  For
example a complex table (e.g., of text and numbers) must be converted into
a linear version."

yes, it is a UA issue and luckily a couple UAs have made some headway on
this (lynx and Jaws).  So, we are moving this to A.12 - "Use interim
accessibility solutions so that assistive technologies and older browsers
will operate correctly" and making it a Priority 2.

we continue to disagree with this one.  a series of "click here's" does not
make the page inaccessible.  Meaningful link phrases make the page easier
to use.  a p2.

using bobby does not make a page accessible.  nor does it necessarily make

still only a good practise.  does not necessarily increase the usability or
accessibility of the page.  we think it should remain p3.
