Hello,

Does anyone want to volunteer to write an app that would transform 0.95 
earl to 1.0?  Sean wrote an 0.9 to 0.95 conversion in python (that converts 
earl in n3) [1].  It would also be nice to have help writing up a prose 
version of the diffs between 0.95 and 1.0 to be included in an appendix.

spec update
- I finished incorporating the rest of sean's writing from a while 
ago.  Are there any pieces that people feel I missed?
- There are some new bits throughout the introduction.
- Finally filled in the extensibility section [2] based on an example Sean 
wrote.  Since we decided not to add Severity to the schema, I used it as an 
example extension.

Today I'll be making some changes to the schema (primarily testmode), 
describe reliance on DC terms (e.g. date), and include the 
normalization/robust metadata proposal as an issue to be resolved in a 
future draft or separate draft (it could be its own thing - thoughts?).  If 
no one volunteers to do the diffs between 0.95 and 1.0 then I'll do that as 
well.

I have to do the usual checks (spell check, syntax validity, w3c 
publication rules, etc.), fix one of the images, make sure images are 
described well, properly link to references, etc. etc.

All in all, hoping this goes to TR *soon*.  Any and all comments welcome.

Best,
--wendy
