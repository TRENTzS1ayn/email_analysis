Daniel,

more great comments.  thanks!  we've got a few questions and comments.

>> Structure vs. Presentation

presented

what do you mean by, "can help with techniques, but not techniques?"  are
you saying this will help you follow the techniques, but it is not actually
a technique to do anything in particular?  if so, while it could be put in
the back as an appendix, having it in front as part of the "accessibility
themes" acts as a nice introduction and helps to create an overall picture
for the guidelines.  It also acts as a type of table of contents for the
techniques (those related to structure vs those related to presentation).
further ideas?

we don't understand this comment.

oops. thanks.

good point.

>> Deprecated example.
>> 
>> <DL>
>>    <DD><IMG src="star.gif" alt="Item">Audrey
>>    <DD><IMG src="star.gif" alt="Item">Laurie
>>    <DD><IMG src="star.gif" alt="Item">Alice
>> </DL>

>Is alt="*" OK ?

currently - no.  since it is considered punctuation, it might not be read
if someone has turned punctuation reading off or to a lower level in their
screen reader settings.  a "lower level" means that only some punctuation
is "read" or "paused for."  

anyone feel otherwise?

>> <UL>
>>    <LI class="newbullet">Roth IRA <SPAN class="newtext">New</SPAN>
>>    <LI 401(k)
>> </UL>

oops. thanks.

right-o.

>> Example.
>> 
>>    <OBJECT data="97sales.gif" type="image/gif">
>>           Sales in 1997 were down subsequent to our
>>           anticipated blah blah blah...
>>    </OBJECT>

>Also show the example where the longdesc is a dlink within the

>    <OBJECT data="97sales.gif" type="image/gif">
>           Chart of our Sales in 1997. 
>           A <A HREF="desc.htm">textual description</A> is available.
>    </OBJECT>

good suggestion. will do.

>> <SPAN alt="smile" title="smiley in ascii art">:-)</SPAN>
>
>No ALT on SPAN, can use class=smile instead.

ahh, right.

>> Server-side image maps
>> 
>> When a server-side image map must be used, authors should provide an
>> alternative list of image map choices. There are three techniques:
>> 
>>    * If an alternative list of links follows the image map, authors should
>>      indicate the existence and location of the alternative list. If IMG is
>>      used to insert the image, provide this information in the "alt"
>>      attribute. If OBJECT is used, provide it in the "title" attribute.

is in there, different place.  will move.  (see previous e-mail re:
guidelines)

>>   <STYLE type="text/css">
>>         HR.redline { color : red }
>>    </STYLE>
>>    <IMG class="redline" title="End of Chapter 7 - Visual Displays">
>>    <H1>Chapter 8 - Auditory and Tactile Displays</H1>
>
>You mean HR, not IMG

yep.  thank you for your thoroughness!

>> For reasons of orientation, frames should all be named (with the "name"
>> attribute) even if they are not potential targets for updated content.
>> 
>> Example.
>> 
>> <FRAMESET cols="10%,90%"
>>           title="Our library of electronic documents">
>>     <FRAME src="nav.html" name="navbar" title="Navigation bar">
>>     <FRAME src="doc.html" name="doc"    title="Documents">
>>     <NOFRAMES>
>>        <A href="lib.html" title="library link">
>>              Select to go to the electronic library</A>
>>     </NOFRAMES>
>> </FRAMESET>

>Is the FRAME name an abbreviation of its title ?
> 
hmmm.  I think it should be frames ought to be "titled."  name is used
programatically rather than for the user to orient themselves.  

in this example, yes name it an abbreviation, but it should be whatever the
author wants to use it as.  it's title that we're concerned about.

can

>>      </NOFRAMES>
>>           ...the rest of the document, always available...

will look into.

o.k.

damn.  ick.
