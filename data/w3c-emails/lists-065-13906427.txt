Greetings!

The latest versions of the guidelines and techniques are available from the
gl site at http://www.w3.org/wai/gl/

notice that the main version of the guidelines is the linear version and
the table is now just an overview.  Changes from the 19980825 draft are
noted in the change log.

we look forward to your comments!
