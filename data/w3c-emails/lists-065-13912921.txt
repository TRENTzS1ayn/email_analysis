The NOFRAMES element appears in the DTD of regular 
documents (loose.dtd), but has no function according 
to the HTML4.0 spec.

The reason for this strange situation is historical.
Until and including the proposed recommendation of HTML4.0 
there was a paragraph in the spec. suggesting that using NOFRAMES
element in a regular document means that the browser has to show 
the content if the page is not rendered "framed", but hide it when 
the document is "framed".

This was ommitted from the recommendation, but the DTD
was left without change.

As far as WAI recommendation, I think we shouldn't recommend 
using NOFRAMES in regular documents, but only in frameset.

Best,
Nir Dagan.
