The latest guidelines are now up - but the table version is not completely
caught up to the Full Linear version

Sooooo

Please review the linear version.  Also please note.. that the linear
version is now (and from now on) the official version.  The table version
will be maintained as a convenience for those who find it helpful (at least
that is our current plan)  but the linear version is the official version.

Looking forward to all your great comments.

Gregg
