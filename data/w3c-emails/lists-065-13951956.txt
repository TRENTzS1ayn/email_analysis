It is true that STYLE is presentational, but stylesheets may be used to 
enhance presentation of structural elements in the BODY
of the document. This is a big difference between other presentational 
elements that are often used instead of structural elements. 

If the guidelines would mention STYLE as presentational, this difference must 
be very much emphasized.
