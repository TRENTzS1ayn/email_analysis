I still disagree, but I guess we're down to expert/religious opinion,
so I'll give (just tell me why A.6 is in A and B.2 in B, rather than
both in B)

I view it as the last ditch to make a page *accessible*, so I'll put
it at the end of the guidelines.

That's the way we should do it, but we need to be very careful that
the normative part holds together as a unit.

We need to add in the notion of "still" I think, vs. moving/video
which come later.

There is no such thing as an application that can stand alone: they
all stand on a lower layer (down to the silicium), and in the case of
an applet, the lower layer is just an interpreter embedded in a
browser.

I thing a better characterization for applets is the notion of "mobile
code", that is, programming code (by opposition to declarative markup)
that is downloaded in a user agent and run in this context.

If I'm using a mobile browser, I just *cannot* view graphics: my
browser doesn't fetch them and show them. You might argue that I chose
to use this image-less mobile browser, but maybe not, maybe that's
what my company had bought for me.

So where is my case in your list ? I am not blind, doesn't have low
vision, and I have not chosen not to view graphics.

How about we have both "or any users who cannot or have chosen not to
view graphics" ?

Sure, the details should be in the techniques, but the way it is now,
it's hard to find the list bullet alt and the space alt
details. Wherever the direct links to these techniques are (please
tell me), it seems obvious to me that they should also be here
(redundancy helps, there is already some for imagemap I think).

We cannot be that vague in a Recommendation. If you take Technique 1
in this list "For all images (IMG) provide alt-text", this is not
vague, this is very precise, and the techniques document answers the
next series of questions about what goes inside alt-text. 

I think we should mention that "For OBJECT, specify alt-text either
with the "title" attribute or in the body of the OBJECT element", and
point to the techniques.

How about all the words of the "Ode to Joy" ? (last movement, which is
also the European Anthem - see http://europa.eu.int/en/eu/anthem.html)
These are important to caption!

To me, "Beethoven's 9th played by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra" is
not a caption, it's a title.

So here, we have an interesting case: I'd argue that if what you're
putting online is the 9th, then a descriptive title is enough, not
need for attaching all the lyrics, but if what you're talking about in
your page is Anthems, then you need to provide transcript for this
part, because that's an important aspect of the information.

Same things goes for regular songs or audio. Only the author can judge 
what is important or not.

It's not that it could fit into "separate structure from
presentation", it's exactly what it is, and setting it aside just adds
to number of guidelines, which is bad.

More to the point, as an author, what control do I have over the
frequency of moving element on the user agent side ? probably close to 
none.

So I would just say "Avoid any blinking or updating of the screen that
causes flicker" and mention the Hertz thing in the technique documents.

OK, can you remind me what it means to have a P1 Technique for a P2
Guideline ?
 
 

You're right in theory for the priority on Bobby, HTML validation,
etc, but in practice, if we keep them to P3, we're not encouraging
their use, and that's bad, because they really help catching a lot of
things.

So I would really prefer to extract them from the Guidelines set and
put them (the whole C.4) at the end, as an annex.

In fact, these are not guidelines about page content, but guidelines
about page validation (i.e. tool), so they ought to be set aside from
the rest.


Couple of new comments:

I'd add ".. for important graphics"...

As an author, what control do I have over the movement of animated
GIF?

None I think, it's done in the browser.

Do are we saying: no animated GIF ?

I think this is for A.12: interim stuff for old user agent.
