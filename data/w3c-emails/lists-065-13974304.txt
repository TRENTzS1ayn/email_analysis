<BLOCKQUOTE>
The NOFRAMES element specifies content that should be
displayed only when frames are not being displayed.
User agents that support frames must only display 
the contents of a NOFRAMES declaration when configured 
not to display frames. User agents that do not support 
frames must display the contents of NOFRAMES in any case.
