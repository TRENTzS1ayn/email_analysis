I'll not get home to late that night. I'll be off email till then.
I'll review materials over the weekend and send comments late, but before 
Wednesday 8:00 a.m.

Materials make nice impression. Good separation of guidelines from techniques.

I note mention of PWWebspeak and Lynx in the guidelines. There should be 
links to them, as there are now in techniques for Lynx Viewer and Lynx-me. 
Check for other missing links to mentioned products, such as Bobby, 
or Quicktime 3.0. Check consistency of W3 tool references.

As we discussed this morning, we'll need to bring User Agent guidelines 
into conformance, using similar partitioning, and cross-referencing to
revised subsections.
