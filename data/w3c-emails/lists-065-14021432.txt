Technique A.1.6

The problem is that there is no ALT attribute defined for SPAN
in the HTML4.0 spec, so this example violates guideline C.4.1.  I
suppose a long-term solution for someone who wants to create ASCII art
for text users (for example if they can't or don't want to generate an
image) with alternate content for blind users would be something like

<OBJECT DATA="cow.txt" TYPE="text/x-ascii-art" TITLE="drawing of a cow">
Cow
</OBJECT>

Recommendation A.2

What's an invisible d-link?  The Techiques document
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wai-gl-techniques-19980908.html#img-dlink>
only defines a d-link, not an invisible one.
