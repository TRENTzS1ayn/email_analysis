Wendy Chisholm replies:

>"title" is a valid attribute on SPAN.

Whoops, I was quoting the wrong example.  I was thinking of
the subsequent paragraph

" Another way to replace ascii art is to use human language
" substitutes. For example, <wink> might substitute for the emoticon
" <SPAN alt="wink" title="wink smiley">;-)</SPAN>,

which uses ALT as well as TITLE on a SPAN (although I suppose it's not
actually an example).

Oh, and of course <wink> would have to be written as
&lt;wink&gt;.

Although only useful if agreement is reached on the MIME type
and browser makers are aware of it.
