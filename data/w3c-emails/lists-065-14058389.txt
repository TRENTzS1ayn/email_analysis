Especially relevant in this context is the text/html subtype,
which one would expect screen readers to have a crack at.  (There was
a debate on www-html recently about the use of text/html OBJECTs, but
I think the consensus is that it's an independent document rather than
a client-side include.  So a screen reader might just present it as a
link to the HTML document, which is what the contents of the OBJECT
are likely to provide anyway.)

Well, it could also be an external text document that nobody
has bothered to convert to Hypertext, which should be legible,
although not as easily interpreted as HTML (since it might use fixed
width spacing rather than TABLES, wouldn't contain any H1-H6s, etc).
So the question is, is it sensible and/or safe for a browser for the
blind to refuse text/plain OBJECTs?  Probably, since the ones that
aren't just ASCII art are likely to contain links to the text
documents, e.g.,

<OBJECT DATA="rfc1766.txt" TYPE="text/plain" TITLE="RFC 1766">
<A HREF="rfc1766.txt">RFC 1766</A>
