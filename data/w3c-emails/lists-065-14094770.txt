Dear webcaster:

We're currently working on a major report on Webcasting, defined 
as transmitting full motion video over the Internet, to be  
published in our October 98 MIPCOM Issue. We believe it will be 
the most up-to-date and comprehensive analysis of Webcasting yet 
published. The report will touch every aspect of Webcasting, 
including high speed transmission modes, video streaming 
technologies, multicasting, regulations, ad sales, programming 
and program licensing, and future developments (such as 
line-doubling technologies and Web content over broadcast TV 
signals).
The report is resigned for U.S. and international broadcasters 
and film and TV program producers and distributors: a total of 
12,000 top level executives, with bonus distribution at the 
world's major TV market, MIPCOM, in Cannes, France.

We believe your company should be part of this special report 
with a full page ad showing your services and product to the 
world wide television industry.
Full page (10 7/8'' x 14 3/16'' trim) 4/c ad is especially priced 
at $3,500 net (regularly $4,500). Material (positive film, 133 
line screen) must reach our N.Y. office by September 19,1998. No 
premium positions are available.

Please tune to our Web page at: www.videoageinternational.com to 
sample our English version, at www.VideoAgeLatin.com for the 
Spanish-language version.

Feel free to call us direct at 212-288-3933

Sincerely,

Dom Serafini
(Publisher)
