In this case I would be inclined to humor the existing browser 
population.  I am not sure what the techniques doc. should say
in this case.

My reading is that it is a violation.  It takes too much of a
stretch of English to turn "frames are being displayed" to "this
HTML contains a FRAMESET."  "Frames are being displayed" refers
to the state of the browse session, not the contents of the
immediately enclosing HTML element.

But if the industrial consensus is lacking in practice, we should
not put our eggs in that basket.
