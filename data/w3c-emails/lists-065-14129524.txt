I agree with Gregg's conclusion, and this is why it was important for
LONGDESC to be included in HTML 4.0. However, I think that over the long
term, OBJECT, with its greater flexibility, arising from the possibility
of including block-level content in the leement itself, should be favoured
over IMG and LONGDESC.
