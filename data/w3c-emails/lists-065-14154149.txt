To: WAI Markup Guidelines<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>


The guidelines state that where an OBJECT element refers to an image,
script or applet, alternative (textual) content must be provided where the
object in question conveys important information. I think this formulation
may give designers too much latitude in deciding which items convey
"important information" and which do not. The issue is made even more
confusing by the "priority 1" rating of this guideline.

Suggestion: Rewrite the guideline so that images are treated separately.
It should be made clear, as in other parts of the guidelines, that
alternative textual content is always required with respect to images. As
regards scripts and applets, an appropriate statement would be to the
effect that alternative content is needed where these convey visual or
auditory? information which is significant in relation to the purpose to
be fulfilled by the web page.

I am sure that the editors can express this idea more succinctly.
