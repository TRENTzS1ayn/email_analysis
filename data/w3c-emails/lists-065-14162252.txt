Hello
Please help with this non-guidelines problem. When I acccess the web-site to
read and /or print any of the pages on the WAI site my browser can't get the
W3C icon in the top left corner I use a MSIE4.0? browser. I have to stop my
browser in order to print the text. I have had this problem since 25.08.98.
when I tried to print that version, and today I experienced the same problem
with some of the others recommendations and also on the W3C web pages.
Kind regards
Helle Bjarn?
