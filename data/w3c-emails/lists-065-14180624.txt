The basic requirement should be that all information be represented
textually. This includes descriptions of audio/visual content. Some people
have both visual and hearing disabilities and would thus need to access
the document via tactile means alone (namely a braille display). Their
needs are not adequately taken into account in a formulation that requires
content to be presented visually and auditorily.
