To: WAI Markup Guidelines<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>


I agree with Jason, that at present the basic requirement for information 
to be rendered by the variety of media available is that it be available 
in a textual form. This allows for various kinds of markup, and that 
which is most frequently used (and useful) is structural markup and the 
hypertextual markup of HTML - linking pieces of information together in a 
multi-dimensional way, rather than as a linear object.

It is important to recognise, however, that text itself is not suitable 
for everyone, and some users will find plain text documents very 
difficult to deal with, while they have no problem with information 
presented through fairly complex visual or aural representations.

I feel that the guidelines could state this more explicitly in the 
abstract, but I am happy with them 'as is'.
