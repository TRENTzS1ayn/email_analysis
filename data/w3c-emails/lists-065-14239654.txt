Hello,

There has been discussion about the current A.13 ("If, after all of your
best efforts, any page is still not accessible then you MUST provide a link
to an alternative page that:...").  Please comment on the following
proposed changes:

1.  move A.13 into C.1 ("only use W3C technologies")
2.  link from A.9 ("all new W3C technologies must transform gracefully") to
C.1
3.  Reword C.1 to read:

C.1. Only use technologies defined in a W3C specification and use them in
an accessible manner. Where not possible, provide an accessible alternative
that does.
  [Priority 1] 

Many non-HTML technologies (e.g., PDF, Shockwave, and other non-W3C data
formats) used to encode information require either plug-ins or stand-alone
applications that often create pages that cannot be viewed or navigated
using standard Web access tools. Also, W3C technologies may be used in ways
that do not transform gracefully (e.g., because the visual components are
too complex, or because assistive technologies or user agents (browsers)
are lacking a specific feature).  By avoiding non-standard features
(elements, attributes, properties, etc. only supported by a specific
browser type) and ensuring that all technologies transform gracefully, your
pages will be accessible to more people using a wider variety of hardware
and software. 
Note. Not all PDF pages are accessible or readable after being run through
a PDF translator. Individually test each page for readability after the
translation process. If a page does not automatically translate, either
re-layout the page in PDF or manually generate an HTML or text equivalent. 

1.If W3C technologies are used:
    1.Use the latest W3C specifications whenever possible. [Priority 2] 
    2.Avoid deprecated elements whenever possible. [Priority 2] 
2.  If, after all of your best efforts, you can not avoid using a non-W3C
technology or any W3C technology in an accessible way then you MUST provide
a link to an alternative page that:
*  is accessible,
*  has equivalent information,
*  is updated as often as the inaccessible (original) page [Priority 1]

Note.  Alternative pages should be provided only after you have tried all
of the other pertinent techniques outlined in this document to make your
original page accessible.  Another option is to provide a phone number, fax
number, e-mail, or postal adress where information is available and
accessible, preferably 24 hours a day.

than alt to original, etc.)
