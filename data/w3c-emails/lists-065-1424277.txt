I don't think earl:result is a subProperty of DC.Relation.conformsTo since 
they define it [1] as, "A reference to an established standard to which the 
resource conforms."   I think this is similar to earl:testcase without the 
detail (confidence, validity) of earl:result.

I expect people can use conformsTo to make a simple conformance claim along 
the lines of:
<meta name="DC.Relation.conformsTo" 
content="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG1A-Conformance">

At the DC2002 meeting, I was hoping that people could use conformsTo to 
point to EARL, e.g.:
<meta name="DC.Relation.conformsTo" content="http://example.org/mypage.earl"/>
but now I'm not sure if that is appropriate since 
http://example.org/mypage.earl is not an "established standard"...it is the 
metadata defining how the resource conforms to an established standard.

Suppose we can tweak it that way?
