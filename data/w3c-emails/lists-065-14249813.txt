Well said!

One small puzzlement you might be able to help with:

to follow up on what McCain Tom said on the WAI-IG list:

"text-only" is the colloquial term for a page in super-accessible
style.  Unfortunately, if one gets down to brass tacks, the idea
that it is only text is neither necessary nor sufficient for this
added level of usable-by-anybody quality.

If you can think of any word or phrase that would capture the
real meaning and still speak to the general public, it would be a
great help.  Among engineers I would call them KISS pages but I
would be reluctant to promote that as the name for a "general
audience."

Perhaps what we need is a sub-guideline that clearly identifies
a stricter level of guideline to apply to alternate pages, but
dispels the illusion that text is a panacea.
