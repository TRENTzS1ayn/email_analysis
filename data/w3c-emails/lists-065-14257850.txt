Where it says "either re-layout.." etc.

Say "revise the page until its PDF representation converts
appropriately through the publicly-available converter(s) or
prepare and post an HTML or plain text equivalent."

"Manually" is unnecessarily restrictive.  The key is that there
will be two forms available from the server.  It may be as simple
as dumping to HTML from your word processor instead of printing
to PDF.  But the result has to be linked into the site from which
the PDF version is served.  That is the trickier part.
