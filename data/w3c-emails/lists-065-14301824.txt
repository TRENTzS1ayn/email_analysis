I was intrigued when a blind man told me, "I don't want to go to text-only
pages." I try to remember that but forgot it when I wrote item 8.

Perhaps it should be a text-enriched site. The lesson I want my users to
get is that if it is a "photo of a Vermont village, nestled under church
steeples, hugged by snow-covered hills, bathed in moonlight"...

say so.

And say it well. Simply converting to text is not enough; it carries an
added responsibility for clarity and inclusion. We have to think past what
we assume, what we take for granted.
