thanks for your comments, Harvey.  our responses follow.

what do you mean by "scripting object?"
while the applet element is deprecated, applets themselves can still be
embedded in a page using OBJECT.  also, applets aren't necessarily
"scripted" since some form of "compilation" occurs.  Per previous comments
from Daniel, we have defined our use of image, image map, and applet in a
way that will allow us to use these terms in the guidelines, even as
technologies change.

we have had many questions about invisible d-links.  We will include
further discussion in the techniques document.  Basically, it is a small
image (1 pixel) or transparent image used as a link whose alt-text is
"D-link" or "D."  It is an attempt to solve the issue of people not wanting
to use d-links because having a "D" next to a graphic disrupts the visual
presentation.  If images are not loaded, the "invisible d-link" is now
visable.  (Note.  the alt-text could be anything you wish, we have used it
several different ways...just as it is with "visible d-links" it depends on
the author's preferences.)

this is something for the techniques document, since we can not link to
non-normative references from the guidelines.

how about, "(or input device other than a pointing device, e.g., a mouse)
will have a difficult time navigating a page if operation requires a
pointing device."

>A.12. _LI6_
>_6. Enable audible icons (earcons) from a user profile to denote

is this a user agent issue?
what assistive technology or browser shortcoming does this temporarily fix?

done.

>d-link would seem to leave any user, not just low-vision or blind user,

well, with alt-text associated with it they will be as clueless as they are
with "visible" d-links.  <grin> since, as is the case with all d-links,
there is no clear indication which image the d-link is attached to.

how would you mark up a table used for layout to make it more accessible?

the Auto PC is a Microsoft product.  it uses speech input and output for
hands and eyes free "in-vehicle computing."

correct. what are you suggesting?

good fix, done.

this URL and specific reference to Bobby are found in the techniques.
