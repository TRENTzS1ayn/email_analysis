hello,

any suggestions?  what ideas in particular need to be expanded?

we changed both of them to ANDs.

we have included the following definition of "screen reader" in the
appendix, and will link to it from throughout the guidelines:
Screen reader
A software program that reads the contents of the screen aloud to a user. 
    Used primarily by individuals who are blind, screen readers can only read 
    text that is printed, not painted, to the screen.

>
>#3, Current >>>>>>>>>>>>>
>   3.Always separate the content on your site (what you say), and the
>way you choose to structure that content (how you organize it), from the
>way the content and structure are presented (how you want people to
>"see" it).
><<<<<<<<<<<<
>    I?m having trouble understanding what that means.

>Does it mean:
>
>    ?Use HTML4.0 elements and stylesheets for their intended purposes.
>For instance, giving text the attribute <BIG> or using a header
>attribute like <H1> may both increase the visual size of text on the
>screen. But <H1> should be used to indicate the start of a new document
>section (not just to display larger text), and <BIG> should only be used
>to display bigger text (not to indicate the start of a new section).
>Following the standards will ensure that your content, information
>structure, and presentation directives (what you say, how you organize
>it, and how you want it to appear) can all transform gracefully when
>accessed with alternative browsing methods.?

yes, this is exactly what it means.

>#2, Current >>>>>>>>
>    2.Ensure that pages will be operable on various types of hardware
>including devices without mice, with small, low resolution, or black and
>white screens, with only voice or text output, without screens, etc.

>May I suggest moving #2 down to #3, and reword to something like:

we have moved 2 to 3, and added the phrase "Guidelines A.1 - A.12 address
these issues." after the list of 3.
