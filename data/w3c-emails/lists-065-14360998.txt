Should we have a guideline for designers using frames to enable users to
see the followed links and therefore be able to use back and forward
buttons and bookmark the links? 

To my knowledge the current techniques is having TARGET = "_top" in the
FRAME links so that all the frames updated everytime a link is followed.

Maybe some less burdersome ways can be invented later.
