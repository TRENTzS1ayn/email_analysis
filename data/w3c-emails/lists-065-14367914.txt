Yes. "Don't use frames" is a good guideline.

This kills the only advantage of frames: saving download time by having 
the navigation bar cached in the browser and replacing only the content 
page. Loading a new frameset involves of loading three documents (frameset 
+ at least two frames) every time someone follows a link.

There is one already. It is called CSS2 positioning properties.
You download one page when you follow a link and the cached 
stylesheet does all the multiple scrollbars stuff.
You can bookmark every page, and you can use the back and forward key 
without having any surprises. You can even print without problems,
as the frame-look is only suggested in the stylesheet for screen.
