I have two comments on the latest page authoring guidelines.

One:
A1 technique 7 suggest to use an OBJECT's title as alternate content. 
I think it is not that good, since "older"  browsers
which do not support OBJECT will never render the title. 
They would ofcourse render the content of the OBJECT element.

Also HTML4.0 browsers that were developed before 
the WAI UA guidelines became W3C recommendation 
may not render the title of an non-retrieved object, but 
will do as the HTML4.0 spec says, i.e. render the content. 

Two:
"C1. Only use technologies defined in a W3C specification..." 

So we can't use javascript or even HTML2.0?
