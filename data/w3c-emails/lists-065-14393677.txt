Only use w3c recommendations means we can't use JavaScript or HTML 2.0

And I reply:
Well, HTML 2.0 in so far as it is a subset of HTML 3.2 or HTML 4.0 is 
fine. Actually, HTML 3.2 is not altogether OK, because it allows for IMG 
without ALT (for example)

And Javascript is not really accessible. I don't if it is not used at 
all. But that won't cut much ice in the real world.

Perhaps we should think about where the guideline fits - it is of crucial 
importance that platform-independence can be maintained, and the 
requirement for using w3c recommendations was meant to stop people 
relying on proprietary extensions to provide any information. So maybe 
something like:

(Prority 1) Ensure that all content is presented and comprehensible when 
correctly rendered according to w3c recommendations for HTML 4.0, AND 
that all the foregoing guidelines have been followed with regard to 
content media (eg movies, scripts, etc) for which there is no w3c 
recommendation

(or something like that)
