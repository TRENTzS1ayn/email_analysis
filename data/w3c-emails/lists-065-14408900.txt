To whom it may concern:

I was told that the W3C has been considering changes to the new CSS2
spec that would incorporate aural stylesheets (audio rendering of
HTML content).  Can anyone point me in that direction?

I think tags that would aid in presenting content audibly (as
opposed to visually) would greatly improve access for people who are
driving but need to access web content now, or people with Palm
Pilots, or people with visual impairments.

Hope to hear from you!  Thanks.
