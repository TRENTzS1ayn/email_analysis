References and/or examples?

Is it JavaScript (the language) or its uses that are not accessible? One could argue that HTML, for example, is not accessible because it can be [ab]used to produce inaccessible documents. So can JavaScript, especially when used to create visual effects with no alternative, non-visually accessible counterpart. I'm not "defending" JavaScript here, just wanting to be aware of accessibility issues in its use.

As a programmer, I find JavaScript to be a powerful tool, for example, for client-side forms validation and assistance. Is this use necessarily inaccessible? I think if I'm sensitive to accessibility concerns in consideration, planning and design, it need not be. For example, for public Web sites, I can't (won't) require that the reader/user enable JavaScript to use the form, so part of my design and testing is to make sure the form works without JavaScript. I can suggest to the reader/user that they enable JavaScript to obtain specific advantages with that form, but I can't (won't) require that they do so.
