Hello,

there are two guidelines that relate to this topic: 

A.9 - Ensure that pages using newer W3C features (technologies) will 
transform gracefully into an accessible form if the feature is not 
supported or is turned off. (includes frames, scripts, style sheets, 
applets). 
C.1 - Only use technologies defined in a W3C specification and use them in 
an accessible manner. Where not possible, provide an accessible 
alternative pag that does. (includes PDF and other formats, using latest 
W3C specs, avoid deprecated elements, and how to create alternative pages) 

Therefore, we have said that non-W3C technologies *can* be used. Also, 
although both applets and scripts are not W3C technologies, they are 
supported by W3C language features (i.e., the APPLET, SCRIPT, and OBJECT 
elements). Personally, I think the two guidelines are not in contradiction 
and handle the issues well. 

However, if people disagree, perhaps the 2 guidelines could be combined
into one 
guideline that says, "Newer W3C technologies and non-W3C technologies need 
to transform gracefully". 

One worry is that separating "new W3C" from "non-W3C" would cause problems 
in the future. Case in point, the "behaviors" proposal that will make 
scripting/dynamic content a W3C activity. Therefore, currently it is not a 
"non-W3C" technology but in the future it will be a "new W3C" technology. 

Also, keep in mind that applet does not just refer to Java and script does 
not just refer to JavaScript - there's VBscript, PERL, or whatever else 
people are able to use.
