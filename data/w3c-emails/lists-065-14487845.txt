Chris' use of Javascript sounds like:
Using javascripts to provide optional extra functionality, which is not 
required at any level of the process, and which cannot otherwise be 
provided in a more accessible format.

As I understand it, Javascript works OK with screen readers, not at all 
with lynx and similar systems, so it's value in the context of accessible 
design is the ability to provide these 'extra' functions, like rollover 
highlights and pre-submission form validation.

Where it is used to provide, for example, an on-screen calculator, then 
it will only be partially accessible.

It is also important to notify the user that a change to some object will
occur or has occurred (there is some discussion of this in PF, with regard
to DOM) since a non-visual user may not notice this automatically. 

(This last should probably go into the guidelines somewhere, but I will 
write a seperate comment next)
