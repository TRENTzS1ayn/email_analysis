Accessibility Valet has been further enhanced!

Users of Accessibility Valet are familiar with its extensive analysis
of WCAG and Section 508 compliance, and detailed developer reports.

Accessibility Valet 1.1 adds to this a second level of reporting
suitable for Management and QA processes.    The user goes through the
warnings generated by the automatic analysis (and, optionally,
also the WCAG guidelines directly) and decides what needs to be done/
he user can, for example, override a warning and declare the guideline to
be satisfied, identify repair work to satisfy the guideline, or make an
informed decision not to conform to the guideline.  Valet will then
publish these choices in an Executive Summary report.

Full details, together with the online demonstrator and new prepared
examples, are available at <URL:http://valet.webthing.com/access/>.
