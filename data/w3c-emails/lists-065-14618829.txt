The TYPE attribute should also be used for non-HTML links too.

Expanded example:

This document is available in several formats: <A 
href="mydoc.htm">HTML version</A>, <A HREF="mydoc.rtf"
TYPE="application/rtf">Rich Text Format 
(Priamrily for Microsoft Word processors)</A>, <A HREF="mydoc.pdf"
TYPE="application/pdf">PDF-Portable Document or Acrobat format, which
requires</A> the <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/acrobat/">the acrobat
reader, which can be downloaded free for many platforms</A>.

This allows a clever user agent (of which none currently exist,
mind you) to flag selected links that are not supported or perhaps
are set to be flagged by user preferences.

Sample rendering:

This document is available in several formats: _HTML version_,
_Rich Text Format_ [Unsupported], _PDF-Portable Document or
Acrobat format which requires_ [External viewer] the _the acrobat
reader, which can be downloaded free for many platforms_.
