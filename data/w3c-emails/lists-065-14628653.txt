Hmmm. Fine idea, but I suspect that in practice it won't happen. Most
browsers use the .xyz extensions to determine type automagically anyway. 
I don't know whether this is an officially standard practise, or just a 
sensible one. But then I do know that it doesn't always work properly 
(when I first installed explorer 4 it decided that Netscape, as the 
default browser at the time, should handle .html files. Would setting 
TYPE have fixed this?), so having explicit TYPE is useful.
