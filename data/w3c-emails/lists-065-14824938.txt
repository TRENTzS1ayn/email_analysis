Thus the advantage of setting the type attribute is mainly 
in automatically retrieved objects (e.g., OBJECT) to save the 
browser time and effort to decide whether it can display the 
object or not.
In this regard I wonder why the IMG element has no type attribute.

In regular links (anchors) it maybe useful mainly as a fall back 
to encounter the possibility that the server is misconfigured 
and sending wrong MIME types. However authors should not count on 
the type attribute as most browsers do not recognize it. 

It may also save some time to the user as the browser may alert 
the user of the type when "clicking" before the document is 
retrieved. However authors should warn the users of the type in the text 
of the document to avoid surprises.
