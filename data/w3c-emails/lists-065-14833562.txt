I know I may be a "list crasher" (ie not part of the working group) but we
just got a related question from a user.

How should this guideline handle server generated code, like .cfm
files.(cold fusion). Their output is HTML. Is that all that matters? How can
format be verified, other than DOCTYPE which is not widely used.
