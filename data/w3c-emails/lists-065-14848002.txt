Yes I agree with Kynn that where possible hints which can be processed
automatically should be given.  This is in keeping with Tim Berners-Lee's
vision for the web (automating thins which can be automated -  see <URL:
http://www.w3.org/Talks/1998/0415-Evolvability/>

Note that as well as providing a solution in HTML, there has also been talk
of providing a solution in HTTP, using Transparent Content (and Feature)
Negotiation - see <URL: http://www.imc.org/ietf-medfree/>.

Since this standardisation work is taking place within IETF it's not clear
whether accessibility concerns are being addressed.  For example the
Internet Draft on "Media Features for Display, Print, and Fax" available at
<URL: http://www.imc.org/draft-ietf-conneg-media-features> would seem to be
relevant to this group.  The document begins by saying: "This work was
originally motivated by the requirements from web browsers to send the
browser's display characteristics to the web server to allow the server to
choose an appropriate representation."

An issue for the WIAI-PF group I think - sorry Al :-)
