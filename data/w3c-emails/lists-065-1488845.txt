This seems to make sense, except that I don't think you need to have two
levels. The assertor is either the  tool or the person - the fact that a tool
chooses to trust a person over itself means that it should suppress its own
result, or that it should provide both results allowing someone else to
decide the tool is smarter than the person.

The significance of reification is that it lets us say "joe says that" and
"fred says that" without running into a problem because the things they say
are contradictory (which is what would normally happen if we merged the two
statements as bare RDF).

On the other hand the new schema uses some nicer property names to make the
reification less visible and make it more obvious what is going on - the
tested, result, etc properties are less general than
subject,predicate,object, but I think that is an advantage.
