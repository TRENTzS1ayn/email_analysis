Shouldn't a exception be made for labels using the <LABEL> element?  That's
the purpose of the element, to remove the need for user agents and the
accessibility aids that run on top of them to "figure out" where the element
is.

With Internet Explorer 4.01 and Active Accessibility, if the <LABEL> element
is used, it doesn't matter what the visual appearance is - the two elements
are linked programmatically and the accessibility aid will be aware of it.

In Appendix C where it is talking about labels for form elements, it says

        15. A.12.4. For all form controls with labels, ensure that the
            label that is either:
               o [239]immediately following its control on the same line
                 (allowing more than one control/label per line).
               o or [240]on the line before the control (with only one
                 label and one control per line).


In the second list item [link 240] I would have taken this to mean
that the label is on one line, the control on the next.  That is
not what you mean.  I think that fewer people will be confused if
you just make it parallel with the first list item

               o or [240]on the same line but before the control (with 
                 only one label and one control per line).


Actually, I would have listed this as the first choice...
