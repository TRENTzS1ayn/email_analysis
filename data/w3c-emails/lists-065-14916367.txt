For blind access that is true, the LABEL element allows screen readers
identify the label of a control even if the two are spatially separated.
However, grouping them closely together helps people using magnifiers or who
have limited field of vision, and I would assume that it also helps people
with some types of cognitive impairments.

Shouldn't a exception be made for labels using the <LABEL>
element?  That's
the purpose of the element, to remove the need for user
agents and the
accessibility aids that run on top of them to "figure out"
where the element
is.

With Internet Explorer 4.01 and Active Accessibility, if the
<LABEL> element
is used, it doesn't matter what the visual appearance is -
the two elements
are linked programmatically and the accessibility aid will
be aware of it.

In Appendix C where it is talking about labels for form
elements, it says

        15. A.12.4. For all form controls with labels,
ensure that the
            label that is either:
               o [239]immediately following its control on
the same line
                 (allowing more than one control/label per
line).
               o or [240]on the line before the control
(with only one
                 label and one control per line).


In the second list item [link 240] I would have taken this
to mean
that the label is on one line, the control on the next.
That is
not what you mean.  I think that fewer people will be
confused if
you just make it parallel with the first list item

               o or [240]on the same line but before the
control (with 
                 only one label and one control per line).


Actually, I would have listed this as the first choice...
