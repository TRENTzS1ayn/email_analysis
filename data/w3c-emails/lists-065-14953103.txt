Allow me to introduce myself.  My name is Robin Krout.  I am a member of

the Governor's Advisory Board for the Telecommunications Relay in the
United States, for the state of Maryland.  While on this board, I've
realized a need to have computer technology that the deaf/illiterate,
blind, and deaf/blind can use.  My question to you is how do I go about
getting businesses involved in the funding of the research to launch
specialized services for that community?  Will you please suggest to me
organizations or businesses that may be of interest in supporting my
research and services?  You seem very knowledgeable and understanding of

the needs of these communities.  I am hearing disabled and assisted by
hearing aids, amd I am not familiar with all the specialized services
that
are available to those communities.  Any advice will help me.  Thank
you.

Robin
