Hi,

Thanks for the follow up. Sorry for not getting back to you earlier -- got lost
in the shuffle.

You asked what I thought would scare novice readers. I decided to run a small
experiment.

Assumption: if reactions to the opening section are negative, people are less
likely to read the body of the document and come to a full understanding of what
is being requested.

I sent the beginning of the new Section A (from "A. Transform Gracefully" through
"Guidelines A.1 - A.12 address these issues.") to three 'naive' readers I know
from various places. All of them are senior enough in their organizations to
influence or decide approaches taken when new web sites are built. I asked them
to look it over quickly and give me their gut reactions, including what they
thought the impact on costs would be. None of their reactions were encouraging.
This is what they said:

(Person A)   "It would triple the cost of development. Maybe more than triple."

(Person B)   "You'd have to build a whole separate auditory interface, and have a
whole additional set of controls that you could access without a mouse. You'd
have to simplify the interface a lot, you couldn't do anything complicated or use
any plug-ins. And it would more than double the cost. Just adding the auditory
interface would double the cost."

And from the most knowledgable of the three:
(Person C)   "This is naive. It is too expensive to implement. Especially number
three. It isn't possible to create a single page that satisfies number three.
Every page would need to be generated on the fly and would need to be different
for each specific browser. Testing would take forever. Maintenance and updates
would be a nightmare. If someone was given the mandate to do all this they would
just ignore it."

(FYI: 'A' & 'B' were pulling numbers from the air, but 'C' has experience to back
him up: he has implemented robust e-commerce sites that needed to run properly
with Netscape, Internet Explorer, and AOL, and says that just getting all three
of those browsers to work properly was neither cheap nor easy. As far as he's
concerned, *any* additional browser or device that needs to verifiably supported
will add significant time and cost, and since point #3 is open-ended the added
cost is basically infinite.)

Thoughts:

Points 1 and 3 sound expensive and difficult to someone who doesn't know, for
instance, that HTML text is accessible via auditory means / voice output by using
audio browsers or screen readers, or that even some standard browsers allow you
to navigate most web pages with just the TAB and ENTER keys. It was for that
reason that I had included easy-to-understand examples and/or additional
explanitory text with the first set of comments I sent in. The
examples/explainations were intended to make the wording easier to grab a hold
of, so that the problems seem less vast and more approachable.

Point 2 is difficult to understand if the context isn't already understood. The
alternative wording I asked about (in the format of 'is this what you mean?') was
intended to show one potential way to clarify the issue to new readers. I admit
that the wording was very bulky but, to me at least, it seemed more
understandable.

If lengthening the section with examples or additional explaination is too
objectionable, the wording could still be made less threatening in one simple
way.

Current wording:
   "To create documents that transform gracefully, authors should:"
This wording puts the onus entirely on the author, which makes the broad
directives in points 1-3 seem all the more scary.

If the wording was changed to:
   "Guidelines A.1 to A.12 address methods for creating documents that transform
gracefully, showing authors how they can:"
The onus is now on the document first and the author second, and therefore less
threatening.
