Thanks Paul for this information.

What this survey tells me is that we need to be *very* specific about
the one thing that we - experts of HTML accessibility - take for
granted: TEXT IS ACCESSIBLE.

Most people do not understand that information that is available in
textual form (i.e. as a string of characters) can be presented to the
user visually, aurally or in braille without additional development
cost for the author.

Of course we need to explain the idea of separating presentation from
structure/content and the need for adding textual description to
"richer" media like image, video, etc, but the number one rule must be
stated clearly: Text is King.
