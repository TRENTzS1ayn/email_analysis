Chris is right, so for the sake of completeness I looked up all the event
attributes again.  Those which I think are device-dependent, and we should
recommend not be used are: 

onMousedown, onMouseup, onMouseover, onMousemove, onMouseout, onKeydown, 
onKeyup, onKeypress, onClick, onDblclick

Those which seem to be logical events are:

onFocus, onBlur, onSelect, onChange, onSubmit, onReset, onLoad, onUnload.

It should also be possible to define something like 'onActivate' - which 
would be equivalent to onClick for a link, but I guess this belongs to 
other groups.
