Thanks for the discussion.

I need to focus back on the original scenario, which I didn't include in
the original post.  The questions I posted were asked because I was asked
how would I know if/when the pages were tested and repaired.  Independent
of where the files were stored, for example in a "fixed" directory, I
needed to leave a piece of meta data in the file itself that said the
file/page had been tested and repaired.

Many authoring tools leave a string of meta data saying which version of
the product was used to edit or convert the file.  I think this was done
initially as a marketing tool to leave vendor product names lying around
inside meta data in web files, but has also been useful in debugging tool
specific problems by knowing the possible heredity of the file.

So if the owner of the file wants to leave some indication that the file
has been tested and validated, via some tool or process, what is the best
way to specify that piece of meta data.  I agree that most owners won't
want to leave a trail to their dirty laundry (test reports), but in just
the same way others recommend visible logo's on pages, I would like to
leave a "good housekeeping seal of approval" somewhere in the file.
