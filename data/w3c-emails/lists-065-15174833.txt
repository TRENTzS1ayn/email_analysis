The following wording as been added as technique #3 to guideline C.1 - Only
use technologies defined in a W3C specification... 

When linking to resources that are not W3C technologies, indicate what
type of resource you are linking to. For example, to link to a PDF file
from an HTML document, set the "type" attribute to "application/pdf" on the
A element. [Priority&nbsp;3]
