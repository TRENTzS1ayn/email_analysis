I agree that it would be advisable to use the TYPE attribute in this case,
but the basic guideline should still recommend that non-W3C technologies
be avoided, as there will necessarily be one or more user agents that do
not support it. Needless to say, if such file formats are used, standard
alternatives need to be provided.

I also encountered a page recently which required client-side Javascript
functionality in order for any of the links to be activated. This kind of
design needs to be avoided also.
