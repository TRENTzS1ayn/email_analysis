The techniques doc says:

"To implement brief descriptions, use the "title" attribute 
In HTML 4.0, applies to almost every element 
In HTML 3.2, applies to: LINK, A 
In HTML 2.0, applies to: N/A "

This is incorrect. title applies to LINK and A 
also in HTML2.0. 
Same goes for "alt" which is very much 
available in HTML2.0 for IMG.
