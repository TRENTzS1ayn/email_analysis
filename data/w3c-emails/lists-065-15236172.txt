I altogether agree with Nir's sentiment: it is possible to write highly
accessible content, meaning that it will be displayed optimally by a range
of different software systems and output devices, which is nevertheless
poorly written, vague, incoherent, etc. The guidelines should not attempt
to prescribe appropriate writing practices but should be strictly limited
to those aspects of structure and markup which affect the compatibility of
the document with different input/output scenarios.

Moreover, judgments of stylistic appropriateness are highly dependent upon
the subject matter of the text and its intended audience, and the
guidelines should not stray into such considerations.
