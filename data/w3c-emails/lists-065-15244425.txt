Here is what I understand to be the connection between well
written headers and titles and accessibility:

A generic disconnect between the page author designing for a GUI
of 800X600 pixels or more in screen size and a user accessing a
web page through text-to-speech, Braille, or a screen magnifier
is that the author acts on the implicit assumption that the user
senses each little item (header or link text or whatever) in the
context of a full screen of cues as to what is going on.  The
user of the stated three classes of alternative interface do not
have the benefit of all this context in their browsing scenario.

Keeping track of where you are and what your options are for
where to go next can be a problem for anyone on the web.  For
people operating under the above mismatch in context display it
often hangs by a thread.  The centrality of orientation and
navigation performance is a point that T.V. Raman raised early in
the WAI process and so far as I know nobody has disproven this
principle.

Headers are an opportunity to provide signposts that stabilize
navigation within the page just as link text is critical to
preserving orientation through the step of following a hyperlink.

While the clarity in natural language of these signposts is a
quality factor for orientation and navigation for all users, it
is a quality factor that the users of "small pipe" display modes
are more sensitive to, than are the general population.

The guidelines already invest heavily in the natural language
effectiveness of link text.  Loss of orientation associated with
following a hyperlink is more common than getting lost in the
interior of a page, so this got attention first.

But Eric is probably corect in suggesting that better headers
make for fewer lost users, especially among the users of the
above three classes of user interface.

This has gotten a bit long, I will address privacy in a separate
message.
