And, by the way, I do believe we _should_ mention spell-checking.

This is another case of a general good practice, where failing to
follow the practice has more severe impacts on the text-to-speech
user than on the visual user.  Someone reading with their eyes
can usually pick out the spelling error or will in fact read
right through it without perceiving the error.  But someone
depending on text to speech will get garbage for a word with a
spelling error.  This heightened vulnerability to something that
otherwise is a minor nuisance _should be mentioned_.
