To: WAI Markup Guidelines<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>


My basic position would be that any recommendations pertaining to natural
language should at most be priority 3 suggestions. Clear examples of
difficulty that come to mind are those in which the content is in itself
complex, or in which the person who is responsible for the markup and
other technical aspects of design has no control over the text itself. For
example, the developers of a web site which provides the full text of
court decisions can presumably influence the markup, but not the content,
which is written by the Court itself.

Similarly, there is inherent complexity in documents that are devoted to
highly technical subjects, in whatever discipline they may occur. This is
what I mean by maintaining that stylistic appropriateness is context
dependent. A governmental web site intended to inform the public regarding
electoral matters, to take a somewhat different example, should present
the information in a range of different languages (assuming a reasonably
heterogeneous society) and take steps to aid comprehension by avoiding
unnecessary technicalities, using direct and succinct language, providing
a clear structure, etc.
