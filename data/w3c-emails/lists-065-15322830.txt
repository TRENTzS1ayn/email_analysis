Here is a rough heuristic:

If a table can be clearly interpreted by wrapping each TD cell
with

- the table-global legend+description
- the first TH or last TD (if no TH) found scanning 'left' 
through the current TR
- the first TH or last TD (if no TH) found scanning up
through the current column

then it is a simple table.  If one has to refer to more than one
TH in the current row, or in the current column, or a TH or other
element outside the current row, current column and table-global
parts, then that is a complex table.

Note: 'left' is in quotes because in right-to-left languages this
would be scanning to the right.  The intent is scanning the
current row in the direction toward textually-earlier cells.

Here is a better answer:

Ask the WAI-UA group what default heuristics they are putting in
the User Agent Guidelines.  If those heuristics work the table,
then it is simple.  If they don't it is complex.
