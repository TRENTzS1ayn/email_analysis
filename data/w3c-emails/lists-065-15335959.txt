Just thinking about it again, Friday afternoon in the US is saturday 
morning here - a time when I prefer not to be at work too early. So 
thursday would be my preference.

Gregg, if you can send me a phone number I might try calling it to get 
the times right - we have just gone into daylight savings - forward 1 
hour. As I understand it you have gone back one hour. We were calling at 
6 am to make 4pm Boston time (I think) so we should now be calling at 8am 
to make the same time.

Anyone else get the same answer??
