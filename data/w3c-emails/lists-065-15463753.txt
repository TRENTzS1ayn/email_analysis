I think that what realy matters is whether the page is functional 
with and without client side scripts. You can do things that are 
OK with any attribute. 

O.K.: rollovers that change appearance of links when the 
       mouse rolls on them. (as long as the links are 
       noticeable and functional without this effect)

Not OK: a link that leads to an important document but works only 
with scripts on, and gives error message "unknown/unsupporeted URL scheme"
otherwise.

We can't rule against attributes that have no substitute. First the W3C 
should come with platform independent events list, then deprecate 
the current ones.

This is what was done with deprecated markup. HTML4.0 deprecated many
things because there is a better alternative mechanism. Stylesheets, for 
example, or an alternative element (OBJECT instead of APPLET).
Frames that have many problems are not deprecated because some of their
functionality isn't replaced (yet).

Nir.
