Yep.

Well, that's only half the story.  They could publish internal data with
appropriate access restrictions, regardless of whether a URL to that
data finds its way onto a public page.

That's another approach, but I don't think it really adds much value.
It adds an accessibility bar on the client side (which systems such as
HyperNews don't), and it is only effective within a closed community
who can all use the same Annotea database.

(talking of which, I wonder whether Annotea might benefit from pinching
anything from Hyper-G to work over multiple collaborating servers?)

Indeed.  I think the main use for this within an organisation is in the
context of a QA process.  If you require every page to have a
<link rel="accessibility" type="application/rdf+xml" href="..."> -
and perhaps integrate this with a CMS, you can enforce Good Practice.
