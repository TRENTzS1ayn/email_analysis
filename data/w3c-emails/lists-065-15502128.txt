A.1 technique 7 - for OBJECT, use one of the many ways to provide 
alternative content.

I think we should be pushing the use of the content of an OBJECT element, 
as this provides content to any browser. In addition, the UA group 
currently have a guideline which says that the content of an OBJECT must 
be available to a user (whether or not the OBJECT is rendered) by some 
means. The use of TITLE, etc, as a primiary means of conveying 
alternatives requires more of the browsers, and makes life more 
complicated, since the next thing that will be required in UA is an 
algorithm for determining which things to make available how (there 
really are only a limited number of simple techniques).

A.4 techniques 2 and 3 - providing audio description of video.

I think we need to make a stronger statement here about providing a text 
equivalent (which should be a P1) and that text equivalent in audio 
format, (which should be P2) by rearranging the priorities and the order 
of the techniques.

A.10 Use accessible user interefaces for objects with their own interface

use SMIL for audio/video? (as another technique)

A.11 Input device independence

this would be where my recent barrow about event triggering goes I guess...

Section C - good design

Should the front-loading guideline refer back to the proper use of 
headers etc in section A?
