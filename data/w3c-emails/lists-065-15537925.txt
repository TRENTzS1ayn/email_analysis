One guideline that page (script) authors should follow has to do
with behavior which responds to mouse position without the user
exercising any command discretes.

These are the handlers for events including onmouseover and not
including ondblclick.

This class of behaviors should cause incremental changes to the
finish of the display and not make any change in the actual or
perceived structure and content of the document.  The should all
be expendable, in the sense that (for example) the audio
usefulness of the site is not materially degraded by omitting
them altogether.

I think that the authors should be reminded that the user may
be viewing the browser window through a screen magnifier and
not have the full window in view in their assessment of what
constitutes a small perturbation of the display.
