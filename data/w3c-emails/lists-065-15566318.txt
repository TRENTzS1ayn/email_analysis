To:"'GL - WAI Guidelines WG'"<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>


The purpose of the conference call on Thursday is to give a final look at
the guidelines before they head into recommendation status.

In particular, we are interested in looking at:
1) Any bugs or problems in the existing copy.
2) Anything which is not in the existing copy which we think needs to get
put in.
3) Anything which is not in the existing copy which we are deferring to
future discussions and future recommendation.

Please give a hard think on the guidelines and a thorough read before the
call.  We should think of this as our last chance to identify issues before
it becomes a recommendation.

Some specific items we will want to touch on as part of the call include:

-  What do we want Authors to do RE  DHTML
-  What do we want to put in the guidelines doc vs the Techniques doc.
-  What do we need to do RE DOM.  In our guidelines or to send to DOM
-  What do we send to User Agent Group RE these topics
-  

The chairs and editors.
