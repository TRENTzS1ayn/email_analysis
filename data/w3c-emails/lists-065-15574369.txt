Because the GL group appears to be nearing closure on the guidelines 
document, I wish to make another appeal that language be added that will 
clarify the scope of the document. 

If you do not intend to deal at length with readability of language, 
privacy issues, etc., then I suggest a statement such as follows:

"This document does not address a variety of special issues which may 
significantly influence the accessibility and usability of Web pages. 
Examples of such issues include: readability of language (e.g., language 
complexity, difficulty of vocabulary, etc), privacy (e.g., concerns about 
how personal information will be used), sensitivity (e.g., reactions to how 
the document refers to individuals with disabilities), legal and moral 
issues (e.g., reactions to material that is legally prohibited or contrary 
to community or personal standards). These unaddressed issues tend to 
concern how individuals process or think about Web content in contrast to 
whether that content is available to their senses, the latter being a major 
focus of the WAI page authoring guidelines."
