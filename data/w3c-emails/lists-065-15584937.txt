Eric's formulation, suitably refined, would provide an appropriate
disclaimer to accompnay the document. Perhaps reference could also be
made, in general terms, to other WAI guideline activities in order to make
clear the division of subject matter as between the various documents
which are currently being prepared. I recognise that it may not be proper
to refer to guidelines which have not yet been completed, so perhaps the
scope could be clarified by indicating that issues pertaining to the
design of user interfaces (the UA work) and authoring tools, are not
directly within the purview of the page authoring guidelines, though it is
expected that authoring tools will produce compliant code, and that user
agents will provide the facilities necessary to enable people with diverse
needs to access the content, in the strict sense of the latter term which
Eric has rightly identified.
