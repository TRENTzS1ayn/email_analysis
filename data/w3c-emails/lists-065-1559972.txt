<blockquote cite="http://valet.webthing.com/access/">
  An example of using this would be to generate a Level 2 report
  report.rdf,  and link to it from your page using <link
  rel="accessibility"  type="application/rdf+xml" href="report.rdf">.
  This tells agents such as search engines and QA tools that your page
  meets accessibility standards.
