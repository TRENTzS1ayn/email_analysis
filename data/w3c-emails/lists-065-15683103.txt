To: WAI Markup Guidelines<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>


After having revised the guideline related to the graceful degradation of
newer technologies as discussed in today's conference call, we could
change the guideline which excludes non-w3c technologies, as follows.

Authors should avoid using HTML documents which include, and depend upon,
non-w3c technologies such as scripting languages, unless alternative pages
are provided. Note: this does not preclude linking to binary data such as
image and sound files, the formats of which have not been standardised by
the W3C, so long as appropriate descriptions and transcriptions are also
offered. Techniques: (1) use server-side scripts to validate forms and
generate dynamic content, rather than relying on client-side scripting
languages.

Priority 1 for both the guideline and the technique.

Either in this or a separate guideline, provide that the user interfaces
of client-side scripts should be made directly accessible for user agents
and assistive technologies which support them. However, this is of
secondary importance in comparison with the principal recommendation,
which is to provide static pages which act as equivalents to all
client-side dynamic content.
