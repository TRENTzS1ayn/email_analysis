<<
Someone suggested that if the PAGL says not to use onMouseOver we could
figure
that intelligent web developers will ignore the guideline in valid
curcomstances. Perhaps it would be better to assume that many readers of the
guidelines will be naive on these issues, and that the guidelines should
specify how the events can be used in a positive way and when they can be
detrimental?
>>

I strongly disagree with this concept.  If the guidelines contain cautions
on things that designers will use anyway, or there is no reasonable way to
work around, then the guidelines lose credibility and will be dismissed as
not being up to date or practical.
