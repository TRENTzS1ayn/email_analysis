Hi,
This is the first of several messages reporting my initial findings of my
evaluation of the Guidelines.  I will post separate messages on separate
topics.  These reports are later than I'd hoped, but I hope there is still
time to address the issues.

Some participants have been confused when they have used particular tags
suggested by the Guidelines and then not been able to see or test the
result with their browser (usually Netscape or IE).

This occurred particularly with tags that were perceived to be 'special'
for accessibility.  For example:
LONGDESC,
TABLE summary,
ID / headers (for table cells)

I suggest that the Guidelines (techniques) include notes that point out
that particular techniques will not be 'visible' to them, but will be
available to future browsers and/or assistive technology.

Chetz
PS the tags mentioned above are the ones that were highlighted - there may
be others.
