Hi,
One participant pointed out that the Guidelines were not practicing what
they preach with regard to links.

The links in the table of contents (ToC) are all complete sentences, which
is discouraged in Guideline B4.3.

I think the type of ToC that the 19980414 version had, and the Techniques
document currently has is better, where items that an author is likely to
be looking for are listed, such as "style & structure", "images and
imagemaps".

I suggest the Guidelines ToC should be more like that of the Techniques
document.  This would also be more in keeping with the Guidelines
themselves!

Chetz
