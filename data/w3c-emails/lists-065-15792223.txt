Hi,
Several participants said they would like to see how the example code for
tables would actually be rendered, such as the examples in Techniques
section 2.5.  For a less experienced author it is difficult to visualise
the table, particularly when they are trying to implement something that is
new to them.

I think the example about senators and coffee does appear in full in the
HTML 4.0 spec, so perhaps it could be 'borrowed'.

I realise that these authors could have copied and pasted the example, but
none of them did!
