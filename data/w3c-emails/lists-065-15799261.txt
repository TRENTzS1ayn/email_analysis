Hi,
Some participants were confused because tags like OBJECT, ACCESSKEY which
are new to HTML 4.0, are recommended by the GLs but are not yet supported
by browsers (OBJECT by neither Netscape or IE, ACCESSKEY by Netscape).

It is difficult for page authors to know whether they have implemented
advice correctly because they cannot get the tag to work.  When I pointed
out the reason these participants said that this should be indicated in the
Guidelines.

I suggest that the Guidelines (techniques) should include, at least, an
indication that the page author may not be able to see the result of
implementing a technique yet.  Perhaps, at best, a list of browsers that do
support the tag (as begun in the 19980721 version).
