Wouldn't standardizing the *relationship* attribute value make more
sense?  I realize that very few browsers support rel currently, but
even fewer support the standardized skip-the-headers anchor name, so
we may as well standardize a value of the attribute intended for
precisely this purpose: expressing the relationship between ends of a
link.
