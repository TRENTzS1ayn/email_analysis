I've expressed to the UA group that a prioritized list of HTML 4.0 tags and
attributes and CSS1 and CSS2 properties that are beneficial to accessibility
be part of the User Agent Guidelines.

Little things like ACCESSKEY on anchors and correct handling of OJBECT
inner-text is what browser manufactures need to know.

Subject:results: HTML 4.0 tags

Hi,
Some participants were confused because tags like OBJECT,
ACCESSKEY which
are new to HTML 4.0, are recommended by the GLs but are not
yet supported
by browsers (OBJECT by neither Netscape or IE, ACCESSKEY by
Netscape).

It is difficult for page authors to know whether they have
implemented
advice correctly because they cannot get the tag to work.
When I pointed
out the reason these participants said that this should be
indicated in the
Guidelines.

I suggest that the Guidelines (techniques) should include,
at least, an
indication that the page author may not be able to see the
result of
implementing a technique yet.  Perhaps, at best, a list of
browsers that do
support the tag (as begun in the 19980721 version).
