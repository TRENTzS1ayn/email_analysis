Internet Explorer 4.0 and later does support ACCESSKEY, but not on anchors.

It is always difficult to indicate which kind of browsers
support
which kind of features.  Almost every features have
possibility
that they are not supported by some implementations.  We
can't list
ALL existing/emerging browsers.

I'm quite worrying that if we only list some major browsers,
people
might only care for those (only a few) major browsers.  Even
though
OBJECT might not be supported by current version of Netscape
and IE,
TV communities will DO use OBJECT (such as ATVEF).  Mobile
communities
think that ACCESSKEY is quite helpful for some mobile
devices, such as
mobile phone.  I know there are browsers for those devices
which
support ACCESSKEY.  

As Nir pointed out, browsers are not validators.  We should
concentrate on advising people to do the right thing.
