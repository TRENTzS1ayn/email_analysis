I think that usually links that have something to do together are 
already grouped in some element like P or UL or TABLE, so there is no 
need for DIV here.

The use of LINK elements should do that. They are in the HEAD 
and the user agent/user should decide where and how to show them.

If there is no particular "rel" to use, use title with the link 
description. Let:
<LINK title="Skip navigation links" href="#start-reading-here">
be your first LINK, and you are done.
