Basically I like it. I agree that validating HTML is more important than 
checking in three browsers and using Bobby, since they are not foolproof 
either, and it is not a scaleable solution. Is it better to check in 
Bobby or multiple browsers if you can only do one? (I suspect Bobby, but 
haven't use it myself for a while.)

But then I started playing. I came up with a slightly different order,
which is supposed to reflect the priority. (Except the last one.) To cover
the applets thing I have put audio/video into one category. I have left
off the rationales - if people want to know about it they should read the
guidelines. This is a quick mnemonic device, not a full solution. We
should encourage people to use it as such. 

(How big a card were you thinking of?)

So here is my stripped-down version:

1. Images need ALT to describe their function
2. Imagemaps must be client-side, with ALT for each AREA
3. Audio and Video must have text descriptions or transcripts.
4. NOFRAMES must be used to provide direct access to the content of the site.
5. Important functions performed by scripts, applets etc must have an 
accessible equivalent 
6. Tables should not be used to provide text in columns.
7. Important graphs, charts, etc must be described (eg by LONGDESC/dlink)
8. Link text should make sense on its own
9. Layout consistency should be used to facilitate navigation/orientation

10. Use valid HTML! (Check it with a validator. You should also check in 
other browsers/Bobby/etc)
