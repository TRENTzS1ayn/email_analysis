The main or working frame should always be in the top lefthand corner so
that the cursor is automatically dropped there.

Otherwise it's a pain in the neck having to hold onto the mouse just to
click it in the main frame after loading. (To allow the cursor keys to operate)

This means that 'content' frames and other navigation frames should go on
the right, not the left as customary.
