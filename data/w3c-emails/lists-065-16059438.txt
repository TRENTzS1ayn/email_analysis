May be it would be better instead of:

"5. Important functions performed by scripts, applets etc 
must have an accessible equivalent"
(Charles McCathieNevile)

something like:
5. No important information is lost when scripting
and applets are turned off.

The term  "an accessible equivalent".
sounds very fancy, but plain old HTML is just fine.
The typical reader may miss this point.
