Let's see if I understand the problem you are experiencing.  You
want to start in the main frame and cursor around in there.  Is
that true?

Have you looked at the draft guidelines for User Agents?  I believe
that there is a guideline in that document saying that the browser
should provide keyboard commands for moving from frame to frame.

Did you read the discussion of a possible "start-reading" 
bookmark?  In a framed site this should go at the head of the 
body frame with a link to it near the start of the first frame.

Would either of these remedies make the frames reasonably
workable?  The traditional roles of head, foot, left and right
margins are pretty stable in print.  I suspect there are actually
good reasons for them if we understood enough.  We have been
trying not to take away the designer's layout control if we can
avoid it.
