Concerning the techniques doc.

In 2.12.2 the example uses LABEL with 
for and id attributes where it is possible to 
simplify and include the INPUT as content 
of LABEL and forget about the for and id stuff.

Maybe it would be better to give both possibilities 
in examples.

In 2.12.3 it says you should use the for attribute. 
I can't see why. If there is one INPUT in a LABEL, 
as the HTML4.0 spec. requires explicitly,
there is no ambiguity. What's wrong with the HTML4.0 spec.?  
One should use "for" in my opinion, only when it is impossible 
to put the INPUT inside the LABEL (if they are in different table 
cells for example).

Also I didn't get the idea behind writing the control 
and its label in the same line when "for" is not used. 
I am unfamiliar with a "line" concept in HTML.
