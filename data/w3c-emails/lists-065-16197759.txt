The relevant question is not most browsers but conforming HTML4.0 browsers 
(that do not exist, ofcourse). The specification does not require that theuy
would support HTML2.0 or 3.2, but gives it as friendly advice only.

For example, HTML2.0 allows having a HR inside a PRE element.

A browser who interprets this as HTML4.0 may consider the HR to indicate 
an ommited </PRE> tag and consider all the text after the HR as being outside 
the PRE, loosing the formatting that the author intended.

HTML3.2 has XMP as legitimate markup. Authors who put html tags inside a XMP 
element get these tags to render as CDATA in HTML3.2 browsers, but this may
break an HTML4.0 browser who may interpret these tags as markup.
XMP is marked in HTML3.2 as deprecated, but all deprecated features 
in  HTML3.2 are marked with INCLUDE in the DTD.
