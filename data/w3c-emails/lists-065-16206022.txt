I see. I think that for the long run it is better to 
show that using LABEL is very simple, if you don't use tables
for layout. This way you'll get many more accessible forms 
in the long-run.

Instead of telling people: "look, if you don't use TABLEs for layout 
it is very easy to add LABELs to your forms; just wrap the control 
and its label with the LABEL tags, but if you insist using tables 
then you'll also need to write for and id", you're saying: "to write 
accessible pages you should work around what the WAI's favorite 
browser does not support."

Also the method of "place holding characters" in text 
fields ("type your name here") is not that good as it 
reduces usability. The user wastes time deleting these 
characters when filling the form. Now that we have LABEL 
we can abandon this usability reducing technique.

Nir.
