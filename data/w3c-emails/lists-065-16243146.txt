A big improvement. how about

All important functions and information must be available without scripts 
or applets.

I see "information" and "function" as two different things.

HTML itself provides no "function," that is: no active, client-side user feedback. Applications cannot be developed in HTML, solely; they require server-side (CGI, etc) or client-side (scripts, applets, etc) programming, or both. Without scripts or applets or equivalent there can be no function in a Web page, only information.

Scripts and applets can themselves be accessible or inaccessible, depending on their design and implementation.

The initial 10 Quick Tips address only static content, not active content. For that purpose, I prefer the "no important information" wording. I've seen lots of pages which render their content unusable by abusing scripts, or using scripting but providing no non-scripted <NOSCRIPT> fallback.
