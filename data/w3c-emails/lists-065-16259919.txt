You've got a point.

I think that when redundant links are available one can use alt="" for all
AREA in the map, and possibly "see links below" for the IMG.

If there are no redundant links, alt="" for the IMG and meaningful alt 
for AREAs.

Redundant links are useful for backward compatibility with HTML2.0
that does not support client side image maps.

I think both options are OK. I wouldn't make HTML2.0 compatibility a requirement
though.
