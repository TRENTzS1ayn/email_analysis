I think there has been some confusion between two distinct issues: (1)
client-side scripts, which involve a scripting language that creates
dynamic content, validates form entries, etc., and (2) client-side image
maps, which have been with us since HTML 3.2 and are widely supported in
practice.

If some user agents do not properly render the value of the ALT attribute
on an image map, then this is a problem for the user agent developer and
not for the author.
