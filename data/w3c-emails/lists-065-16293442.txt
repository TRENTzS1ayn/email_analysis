I don't know if this has gone beyond the timetable, and whether the 
super-stripped version is the one we should be discussing. Can someone 
tell us?

Anyway, let's assume that this is still worth discussing.

Chris Kreussling said in the guidelines group that the reference card 
should ignore functions, and concentrate on information presented by 
scripts. I disagree. But more importantly I would like to state that it 
is Client-side scripts which are the problem.

It is not simply a problem that they are written as accessible or
inaccessible scripts, although they can be one or the other. Part of the
problem is that there are plenty of people out there using User Agents
which do not understand Javascript, ActiveX, VBScript, etc etc. 

So my preferred point 5 (from my stripped list) is now

All important information and functionality must be available without 
requiring client-side scripts or applets.
