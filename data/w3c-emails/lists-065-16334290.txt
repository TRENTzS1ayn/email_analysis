I agree that site orientation is better.  Also, site orientation brings up
other issues.

For example, if, as a last resort, author takes the "text-only" approach,
then the site should avoid having a "text only" page link into graphics
page, even if the graphics page to which it links has itself a link to a
text only version. In other words, the user shouldn't keep getting kicked
out of the text only version and have to keep getting back in. 

Instead, there should be a self contained text only version of the SITE,
not just particular page, so that once the user is there the user stays
there until he or she explicitly chooses to leave.

For this to be practical, the text-only pages would usually have to be
automatically generated, e.g. via transformations on a common XML original.

Other things that apply to sites, not pages are

- consistent page layout across the site

- the possibility of having one master page that describes the overall look
of the site.  For example, if the pages have a tropical theme, so all
bullets are cocoanuts, all horizontal dividers are rope bridges, all
backgrounds are a pale jungle underbrush, all titles are held aloft by
chimpanzees (one on each side) etc.  that could be descibedone page instead
of having D tags or LONGDESC's all over the place redundantly describing
it.  There would just be a single link on each page pointing to the overall
style description.

There are probably lotsa other site oriented topics but I gotta get to our
4:00 cg call...
