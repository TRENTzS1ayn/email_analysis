Okay, that's good points.  How about going shorter (verses my other efforts)
and calling them:

"Web Accessibility Guidelines"

I'm not sure what benefit the word "Content" brings.

Although it's mostly about HTML&CSS today, we will update it to
include more SMIL, XML, XSL, MathML, SVG, etc. in the future, so the
question is do we want to have to change a name that we are going to
promote as some kind of brand name in the upcoming year.

I agree Page is a vague term and I'll also add Author is ambiguous, as
it refers to different roles: the designer, the user of a wysiwyg
tool, the html-by-hand author, and maybe other.

These guidelines are really about what *is* in the Web pages, so I
propose:

 Web Content Accessible Guidelines.
