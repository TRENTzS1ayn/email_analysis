What if we add this as an item in the testing section (Appendix A)?
Something along the lines of:

Use a spell checker. A person reading a page with a speech synthesizer may
not be able to decipher the synthesizer's best guess for a word with a
spelling errror.  

However, upon hearing the garbled word, a person could read the word letter
by letter and hopefully decipher the intended word.  This increases
cognitive load and time to read the page.  Spell checking is a good
practice, so including it in Testing keeps it out of the guidelines, but
points people in the direction we would like them to head.

thoughts?
