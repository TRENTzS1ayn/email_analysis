We discussed this last week and I guess it is going to come up tonight. 
As I recall we were talking about using DIV or SPAN with CLASS="nav" and 
TITLE="nav" as appropriate. Check the minutes for the telecon.

If it is possible to navigate by any element (including DIV and SPAN) 
then this should be sufficient to allow the creation of navbars that can 
be styled at will.
