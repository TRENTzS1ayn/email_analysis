Sorry, I accidently sent this only to Charles:

What I really would like to have is a navigation bar that is always
available to the user at a consistent place in each page and which highlighs
the current selection. The highlighting tells the user immediately where he
is at that site (what he selected earlier) and the navigation bar what the
other higher level topics are. This is important for orienting every user.
With blind users I think it is even more important: you can directly go and
hear the higher level topics without a need to go through every link on a site.

One problem is that we need to have memory (variable) for the current selection.

The hierarchical navigation bars need a bit more thinking about all the
details, but the idea is the same.
