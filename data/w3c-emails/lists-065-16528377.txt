Yes, you are hitting on a point where web content, prepared
according to these guidelines, is still not ideal.  But it still
needs to be as the guidelines say to work within the limitations
of HTML.

One problem is that ALT text mentioning that there are text links
at the foot of the page is just text, and there is no easy way
for the screen reader user to find the head of that list of
links.  This is related to the reasoning that says OBJECT is a
superior language capability; but OBJECT is snarled in
implementation inconsistencies from which it may never recover.

If ALT only allowed a fully-formed hyperlink, with both text
content and jump destination, you could reasonably offer
navigation to the text links as an alternative to the image map.
But it ain't like that.  So please document your MAP AREAs.

Try putting together an example with AREA=DEFAULT linking to the
text-nav panel.  That might be worth a look.

For the "image links" sub-case, the text links at the foot of the
page lacks the contextual relevance that makes hypertext great.
The image links appear somewhere in the flow of the page.  Where
they appear in the page is part of what cues the reader as to why
the reader might want to jump there.  That is why it is important
to capture the jump option in text at the point where it arises
in the flow, and not merely provide _some jump opportunity to the
same destination_ somewhere else.
