To take this in two pieces. If the nav bar is a structure with a class 
then my understanding is that one day CSS will allow us to do pretty 
clever things with it, like keep it as a header or footer to a window 
(like the little "geocities" thing that sits in the window on their 
websites) without making it a big roadblock for people who are not using 
a window.

There are several techniques already used to provide further information 
in a navigation bar which can work well. One is being able to distinguish 
visited from unvisited links (in CSS already) and another is to be able 
to make the current page stand out (usually this is done by making it a 
non-link, and relying on the visual effect, but could be done in an 
accessible way I think)

But these things strike as getting to the priority 4 part of the 
guidelines - the dreaded wish list.
