.Jon asked: 

"Is there any recommended combination of HTML 
and CSS elements in the Page Authoring Guidelines that 
should be used to create WWW site navigation bars?"

In my view it would be best to use the MAP element to 
distinguish a navigation bar rather than using an 
ad-hoc class name.

One should remember that giving special meaning 
to a class name after for two years people are using 
the class attribute for stylesheets may break existing 
pages who accidentally used the same class name for 
some other pupose.

On the other hand, MAP is always used to group links.

MAP elements are usually used to create navigation bars 
with an image, but the spec. doesn't restrict their usage to this.

MAP allows block level elements as content and if a MAP is not 
associated with any IMG or OBJECT a browser will render 
its content.
