Nir is right - MAP, by allowing block level content, can provide a navbar 
in an identifiable block-level construct which we can style at will (more 
or less).

Do User Agents which implement MAP with Block level links provide the 
Text of the links as they would the ALT text of AREAs?

This would provide backward compatibility missing with AREA as well.

Example: (there are more in the HTML 4 spec [1])


<IMG SRC="mymap.gif" USEMAP="mymap" ALT="">

Page content

<MAP NAME="mymap">
<P>Site navigation:
<A HREF="somewhere.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="0,0,30,10">Somewhere</A>
| <A HREF="elsewhere.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="30,0,60,10">Elsewhere</A>
</MAP>

(provides an imagemap at the top, and a text navbar at the bottom.)
