If the MAP is the content of an OBJECT and the image 
of the OBJECT is shown then no (alt) text is shown.

If the MAP is outside the OBJECT, and its content is 
block level elements then the content of MAP is shown
even when the image is shown and used as an image map.
The spec. says you can duplice navbars this way.
That is, put an OBJECT with usemap at the top, its content may 
be a link to the navigation bar at the bottom, and the MAP is 
written at the bottom. 

I was actually claiming that one can use MAP without 
any associated image. This is trivially supported by all 
browsers: they render the MAPs content. Those 
who (will) support image maps with block in MAP 
should render the content as well if there is no 
image associated.

For example:
<DIV>
 <MAP name="foo">
  <P><A href="some.html">some link</A> | 
        <A href="someother.html">some other link</A></P>
 </MAP>
</DIV>

I put the MAP in a DIV as MAP is inline and 
not allowed as child of BODY in HTML4.0 strict.
There are no coords or shape attributes as there 
is no image associated anyway. The MAP has a 
name because it is required by the spec., but has no
function in my imageless image-map proposal...

My point is that since there is no NAVBAR element, MAP
is the best substitute.
