Hmmm .. I can live with that.

I didn't really have any understanding of it; I just didn't feel happy
with the distinction Wendy appeared to be making.

Anyway, this thread has confirmed her other point: if we're that unclear
on what it means, then it's not really very useful.

So in effect, a heuristic test outcome becomes a target for "make" or
equivalent, aggregating other tests.  Corollary: a definition language
for heuristic tests could be expressed using Makefile rules.
