> Each MAP element may contain either one of the following:

In the review of HTML4 for ISO-HTML over the summer, we also found that
constraint of the MAP content model.

I raised this issue internally, but I didn't get much time to push it
forward.

My current thinking is that we should fix it that way:
 ((area+) | (block+, (area+)?))               

so that both AREA and regular block (e.g. A) is allowed.

But there is still the issue of backward compatibility of existing
browsers.
