The W3C is having trouble getting people to implement even all
of what is in HTML4.0.  If there is a reason to prefer one 
means of extension over another, we may find it by asking the
people who would have to implement it what is easier for them.

Where is the contradiction?  CLASS was put in HTML4.0
specifically to be an extension mechanism, to support semantics
not covered in the DTD.  This is just the tip of the iceberg.  In
XML all semantics is after the fact, except for one very abstract
inclusion tree and cross-reference via X-pointer.

Yes, anchor names that are in the language of the document could
be better.  I think that we are debating how the examples are
constructed anyway, not rigid presecriptions in guidelines.

1. Define what it should mean

2. Translate this idiomatically into the [five?] core langauges
used at the U.N.  Offer all these as examples of good anchor
names, not required.  The requirement is to make logical starting
points within the document easy destinations by the use of
A[nchor] NAMEs.  Supported by strategically defined examples like
"start-reading," "&agrave;-propos," etc.  

The growing edge would appear to be in XML appications, more than
in adding features to HTML.  We can benefit from reviewing what
works in successful XML applications like the NISO Digital Talking
Book application before drawing conclusions as to what extension
techniques offer the greatest chance of success.
