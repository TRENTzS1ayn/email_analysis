Okay, that makes sense.

If we go with that definition, then heuristic/not heuristic seems to
be orthogonal to manual/automatic; a machine can derive a result from
previous results as well as can a person.

In the example below, there are assertions about two different
testcases. The first testcase has been performed manually by a person,
and has found to be failing.

The second testcase has not been performed, but the deduction that it
too must be a fail has also been performed manually. The link to the
previous assertion is made using the earl:derivedFrom property.

Assertions which state that they are derived from the values of other
assertions are in some sense heuristic, going by Chaals'
definition. Conversely, an assertion which does not state that it is
derived from other assertions is not heuristic.

This could also give us a way to assert that a group of testcases have
passed or failed as a whole. In the example below, there are two
assertions about testcases, one which fails and one which passes (both
are evaluated manually, as before). The assertion that is made about
the group containing these two testcases indicates that it is derived
from the sense of its constituent assertions (eg. the group failure
value depends on the individual passes or fails), and that it was made
automatically.

The examples above assume the extra RDFS fragment for the schema is as
follows:

<rdf:Property rdf:about="&earl;mode">
  <rdfs:domain rdf:resource="&earl;Assertion"/>
  <rdfs:range rdf:resource="&earl;Mode"/>
</rdf:Property>

<rdfs:Class rdf:about="&earl;Mode/>

<earl:Mode rdf:about="&earl;manual"/>
<earl:Mode rdf:about="&earl;automatic"/>

<rdf:Property rdf:about="&earl;derivedFrom">
  <rdfs:domain rdf:resource="&earl;Assertion"/>
  <rdfs:range rdf:resource="&earl;Assertion"/>
</rdf:Property>

[ The mode of an assertion could alternatively be represented by
  subclassing Assertion, which is arguably more elegant - it may be
  worth discussing this. ] 

Does this do what we need?
