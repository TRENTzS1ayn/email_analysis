I don't think this is true. Some people will claim conformance to Section 508
for example. Then to test for conformance to WCAG level-A there are some
additional checkpoints (which might be broken up into testcases).

Also, people will have different top-level criteria, but may use the same
testcases (e.g. testing for WCAG and 508 there are a number of testcases that
would be re-used, and for testing WCAG itself there are some testcases that
are useful for more than one checkpoint). So I think it is important to
define a criterion as being satisfied by a number of testcases rather than
describing a particular test-case as belonging to a criterion.

The ability to do this is going to be important if we want to merge results
from multiple tools testing a single object - for example a couple of
automatic checks and some manual ones combined to generate a claim of WCAG
double-A conformance.

(This is related to my discussion of an "heuristic" testMode elsewhere on the
list).
