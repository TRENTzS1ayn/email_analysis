Does this mean that we can view a criterion can be viewed as a group
of testcases?

ie. overlapping groups of testcases

This is equivalent to the example that I gave yesterday with the
earl:derivedFrom property.

Personally speaking, I'd steer well clear of any RDF solution which
required use of the log: namespace; it's non-standard and not
particularly clearly defined.

You're breaking several things there; I'm not entirely sure what
you're trying to do.

This was the purpose of the earl:derivedFrom property that I
introduced yesterday. A sketch of a scenario to illustrate this is
given below:

T1, T2 are tests
TG1 is the group of tests which contains T1 and T2

assertion-1 says that X passes test T1
assertion-2 says that X fails test T2

assertion-3 says that X fails TG1, and that this assertion is derived
from assertion-1 and assertion-2

[X is changed so that it passes T2]

assertion-4 says that X passes test T2

assertion-5 says that X passes TG1, and that this assertion is derived
from assertion-1 and assertion-4

Similarly, I'll rework this sketch in RDF/XML on Monday if people
want.
