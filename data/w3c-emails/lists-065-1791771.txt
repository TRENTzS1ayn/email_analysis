Hi folks,

I am trying to post EARL to the annotea server http://earl.w3.org

It has been modified to require certain EARL properties to be present before
it accepts an annotation. However it is not clear to me where it requires
these - I have tried including them in an external annotation body and in the
annotation head (with the context, etc) to no avail.

It is not clear to me what should be in the body if I was going to use an
inline body. I note that in the discussion of this [1] Nadia figured out
something about what was going to be needed, and the output for MUTUAT [2]
seems to have the rights kinds of things

Anyone got any clues? Prize is tools that post EARL and retrieve it...
