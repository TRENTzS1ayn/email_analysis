Well, following a bit of a discussion
[1] I am going to try and update MUTAT [2] to make it put stuff in the
earlDB.

Jim Ley has also made IE bookmarklets [3] that let you annotate a page with
"Passed WCAG" or "Failed WCAG".

This means that we can produce some data to start working on. I think for the
moment using the server with the temporary namespace is helpful for figuring
out how to deal with the interaction - it means we can clean it into a real
EARL later, or trash it and build a production version.

Cheers

Chaals
