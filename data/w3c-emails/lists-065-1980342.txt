Thanks Bjoern for alerting me to this. The real one is

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/200305/axforms - and now I have posted
somewhat updated documentation, and a form that lets you create a new set of
test cases.

Coming soon - add/remove test cases to an existing set (for example a few
atomic things instead of a single WCAG checkpoint, or build a user agent test
suite tool...)

cheers
