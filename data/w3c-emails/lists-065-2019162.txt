Thanks for picking up on that typo.

This document has been dormant for a while and it's not currently being edited. So unless there's an update, the typo will have to remain.

Kind Regards,
Chris

  Hi,

  Very Nice, but I noticed a 'Typo' in: 
  http://www.w3.org/TR/AERT#color-contrast

  Guideline 2.2.1 - Near the End, after the formulae, but before "Suggested Message", you have the following paragraph:
  "The rage for color brightness difference is 125. The range for color difference is 500."
  I assume that the word "rage" should be "range". 
  (Both are good words, but not interchangeable!)

  I thought you'd like to know, so I'll head back to "My Groups", 
  public-wai-rd@w3.org & w3c-wai-ua@w3.org
