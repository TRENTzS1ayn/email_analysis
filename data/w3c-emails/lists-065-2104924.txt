Indeed, that's how I first interpreted it, and how Valet works in
practice.  It works well if you're happy to reference one guideline
per test case.

That is a good point, and one I've looked at, but that hasn't
yet made it into anything operational.  The simple/practical
answer is to select one guideline as most-relevant and drop
references to the others.  An inference engine can still keep
the reverse (guideline requires pass the test) dependency.

My preference is for an additional layer of abstraction.  The EARL
testcase refers to your test (whatever that may be), which in turn
references each relevant guideline.

You'll presumably let us know if/when you implement anything relevant?
