Here's what I have so far (still alpha):
http://tile-cridpath.atrc.utoronto.ca/tile/accessibilitychecker/submit.html

 Before submitting a file for evaluation, login to the system (select the
'login' link at the top of the page).

To view an EARL report of the accessibility problems:
Enter a URL for evaluation and click the 'Output EARL' radio button.

This system also records decisions (in EARL) about accessibility problems:

- Submit an URL for evaluation and click the 'Output HTML' radio button.
- Select a 'potential' problem from the list of accessibility problems
(example: Title does not describe the document)
- Click the 'make decision' button on the problem page
- Click the 'decisions in EARL' link that now appears at the top of the list
of accessibility problems

Any comments regarding the EARL output would be appreciated.

Regards,
Chris
