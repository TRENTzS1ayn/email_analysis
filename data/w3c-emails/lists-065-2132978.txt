Here is a sample assertion generated by the program:

Here's what a user decision looks like:

  <earl:Subject rdf:resource="http://www.aprompt.ca/junk1.htm" />

  <check name="Image may require a long description (LONGDESC)." />
  </earl:Testcase>
  <earl:result rdf:resource="pass" />
- <earl:assertedBy>
- <earl:Person>
  <earl:name>Chris Ridpath</earl:name>
  <earl:email rdf:resource="chris.ridpath@utoronto.ca" />
  </earl:Person>
  </earl:assertedBy>
  </earl:Assertion>

We (Wendy, Sean) should remove or modify the example code at the EARL page
to remove the
earl:testid lines.

I'm going to take a closer look at the EARL docs and brush up on my RDF
before proceeding.
