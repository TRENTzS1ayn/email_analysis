That bit isn't valid RDF. (It doesn't have any namespace associated with it)

Have a look at my examples, where I give an english and a spanish name for
each test (actually that's just so I can put them into the user interface,
but it shows how to do what you're trying to do).

You want to do something like

 <earl:testcase>
   <earl:TestCase
rdf:about="http://tile-cridpath.atrc.utoronto.ca/tile/checks.html#check48"/>
   <dc:title xml:lang="en">Image may require a long description
      (LONGDESC).</dc:title>

(Stritly speaking this isn't necessary - if you have an RDF version of your
tests at that URI then you can define the title there, and it can be
downloaded. But the other neat trick about doing it here is that I could
instead say

 <earl:testcase>
   <earl:TestCase
rdf:about="http://tile-cridpath.atrc.utoronto.ca/tile/checks.html#check48"/>
   <dc:title xml:lang="es">Quizas el im?gen necesite una descripci?n
      (longdesc)</dc:title>

And the EARL already says that I created this assertion, so I am noted as
claiming this is an accurate translation - useful for QA stuff where you have
a few people translating.)
