Hi folks,

I have started work on a basic explanation of EARL and how it works. It is
aimed at people who understand XML (or think they can learn it by example),
but does not assume people understand RDF.

So far it shows how to construct a really simple EARL statement - there needs
to be more on how to optimise for compactness, some tricky bits that aren't
all that clear yet, and probably some other things. I am sure it will need
editing, too.

Comments welcome - to this list is best.

Cheers
