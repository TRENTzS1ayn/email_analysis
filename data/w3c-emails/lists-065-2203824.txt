Very helpful!

I really need a description for 'describing the error'.

x-path is great but as soon as the document is modified all the x-path
expressions may be invalid.

We've also been using a 'fuzzy' description for the things within the
document that have been evaluated. This offers greater persistence but at a
loss of precision.

When describing an image, we use the image filename. A problem with this
approach is that all images with the same filename are treated the same. If
the author states that image flower.gif does not require a long description
then we assume that another instance of flower.gif in the same file does not
require a long description.
