Do you mean what I have called "locating the error"? I ahven't done that yet.
It's tricky... which I guess is why it is an open issue <grin/>.

I'll add some stuff, and discuss it here in parallel.

This is a question we have looked at in the development of WAINu - being able
to keep the context of an image use is important, as is being able to handle
multiple alt values. LIFT goes some way there in categorising image types -
for a spacer gif there is basically no need to track context, for others
there may be, and others might be icons, where consistent context is itself a
checkpoint requirement.
