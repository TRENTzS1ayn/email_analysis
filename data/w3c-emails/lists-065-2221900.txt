Do you mean what I have called "locating the error"? I ahven't done that
yet. It's tricky... which I guess is why it is an open issue <grin/>.

I'll add some stuff, and discuss it here in parallel.

This is a question we have looked at in the development of WAINu - being
able to keep the context of an image use is important, as is being able
to handle multiple alt values. LIFT goes some way there in categorising
image types - for a spacer gif there is basically no need to track
context, for others there may be, and others might be icons, where
consistent context is itself a checkpoint requirement.
