Actually I have a whole presentation on that - I just need to put it online
so I can link it...

Good idea.

Yep. This is interesting but I think belongs in the "advanced" stuff for the
moment. There are actually a couple of use cases which converge - tracking
information about the evaluation tools available would be easier if we had a
corresponding way of describing tools and services (similar to WSDL, but not
limited to Web Services per se, and a bit more semantically rich than "text
description of the tool"), ....

Yep. I had the same thought, and started to movein that direction already.

Thanks for the comments - keep 'em coming :-)
