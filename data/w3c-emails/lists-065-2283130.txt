Cool. Would it make sense to get Spanish schema translations added to the 
current EARL RDF schema/ontology? Where is that btw? I could do the
markup if someone else could do the words... Would that be a lot of
work? We could maybe make a little swad-e case study out of it? ("how do I 
publish a schema with multilingual translations of the terms it
defines?...").
