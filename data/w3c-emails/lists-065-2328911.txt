[Bcc'ed to EuroAccessibility technical groups]

Hi folks,

one of the issues that is going to come up for the EuroAccessibility 
Task Force on testing tools is how to check the performance of tools 
for dynamic pages - for example, can a particular piece of sooftware 
test the 4-step process of registering for a W3C meeting, or the 
process of applying for a credit card online?

Thre are lots of open questions about the best methodology to apply 
here, and particularly about how to classify the results, but I am 
wondering if anyone has a tool that can actually walk through the 
process, and how this is done.

The EuroAccessibility task force is likely to look seriously at how to 
do this in the second half of this year (at least  it is this year in 
Europe now :-) and having some idea now about any tools that are 
designed to handle this problem would be helpful.

Some preliminary thoughts:

javascript extensions to something that functions as a browser, or 
tools that have access to pprocessing back-ends, seem to me likely to 
have an easier time of this. Although in principle it is possible to 
save each page through the process and run it through a local test, it 
might not be that simple in practice to get all the scripts, styles, 
multimedia, etc.

Testing this manually (without tools) should be largely possible, but 
it is a complex job, and it would be nice to be supported by software.

cheers

Chaals
