That's probably because you grepped for my _public_ address.
nick@webthing.com is very public, and heavily spam-filtered.
The address I'm bothered about is known only to a few individuals,
and - I've just found out - appears in your logs every day:-(

Totally irrelevant.  The address appearing has nothing to do
with anything I type.  But you're logging my "local" address
every time I join #er.

I know that very well.

But I have to have an ISP so that I can connect to the net.
That's an old-fashioned modem, which is the only kind of
connection available here.  And with that comes an email address
which I can't filter before the spam travels down my modem link.
And I don't want to block it completely, because a very few people
have it and use it legitimately, and because webthing.com
forwards my legitimate mail to it for when I dialup.

I'm not blaming you: none of us realised until now what was
happening.  But if you could add a regexp to strip email
addresses when people join #er, you will cease to be a
spam-magnet.
