Hello all,

We've been asked to review the RDF Core last call working draft published 
last week.  The last call period ends on the 21st February 2003.

RDF Primer (ed Frank Manola, Eric Miller)
    http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer/
RDF Concepts and Abstract Syntax (ed Graham Klyne, Jeremy Carroll)
    http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/
RDF/XML Syntax Specification (Revised) (ed Dave Beckett)
    http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar
RDF Vocabulary Description Language 1.0: RDF Schema
    http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema
RDF Semantics (ed Pat Hayes)
    http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt/
RDF Test Cases (ed Jan Grant, Dave Beckett)
    http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-testcases

That's a lot of reading...

We ought to coordinate our review with the PFWG...I've set that in 
motion.  I anticipate we'll have a chat in the near future to go through these.

More soon,
--wendy
