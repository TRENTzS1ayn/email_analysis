Hi ERT group,

I have produced an Xform that allows people to do an evaluation of a document
against WCAG 1.0 and generate EARL according to the 1.0 spec (plus some
dublin core and and foaf for things that aren't in the schema, and in my
opinion don't need to be).

It's online at http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/200305/axforms/earlform.xml -
but at the moment it will store the result on the W3C site, if you have a
password to put it there (otherwise it won't work).

You can download the relevant parts and run them locally - there are four
files in a package at
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/200305/axforms/package.tgz

To make it work you need an Xforms-capable browser. I have been using Xsmiles
0.8 - http://www.xsmiles.org - on a macintosh and it works fine, but feedback
and bug reports are welcome. (Trying to install this system on Windows needed
java, which turned out to be a pain, so I ahven't tested it there yet).

My plans for this are to make it post the results to the EARL/Annotea server,
but I need to change a namespace setting there first.

More documentation coming soon - the form itself has a brief to-do list which
should give some idea owhat I hope it will do.

Don't forget that your effort in getting Xforms-capable will be repaid by
also being able to generate foaf/codepiction data using the materials at
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/200305/foaflang/xfoaf.tgz - see
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/200305/foaflang for some idea of how this
information can be used.

enjoy...

Charles
