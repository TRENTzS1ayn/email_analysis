- EARL RDFS to HTML Stuff

I was reading a bit of the EARL WD [1], and decided that that schema
could do with having a pretty HTML version. So I wrote a stylesheet
(as rdfs.xsl) to convert it, and it returns some nice HTML. I had to
reformat the schema first (as earl.rdf; or earl.xml with an
xml-stylesheet PI)... well, I didn't have to, but ugh--abbreviated
syntax, old RDFS namespace, and iso-8859-1? Anywho, the files are
attached to the www-archived mail.

It seems that Moxilla Firebird 0.6's XSLT engine can process the
qnames properly, but that saxon 6.2.2 can't. That was frustrating, but
if you've got Firebird or equivalent, you can just load earl.xml and
it'll work off of the PI to display the HTML.

Whilst it's true that I've done this sort of stylesheet presentation
thing for RDFS before, this one's better.

Cheers,
