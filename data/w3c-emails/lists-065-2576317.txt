Bcc'ed to WCAG so they know, moved to the ER group because it is in their
scope (or perhaps that of the AU group. I am not sure who is doing techniques
for evaluation and authoring repair at the moment...)

And yes, it would make a good technique to carry language information in user
dictionaries and be able to work across languages. Some applications, like MS
Office and Apple's mail.app allow for spellchecking to be done according to
the language of a document, which can be changed. I think Word even allows
for setting the language of a phrase in a paragraph, with appropriate markup
and spellchecking happening. I don't know if they manage to export this to
HTML markup, but ion principle it should be very easy.

cheers
