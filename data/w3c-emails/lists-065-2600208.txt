Hi all,

one of the things I am doing in my role with Fundacion Sidar is 
participating in the EuroAccessibility Consortium. They have started to 
do their technical public work, and I am a chair of one of their 
subgroups. (Anyone who is "european" can participate in the work - and 
anyone at all can send comments, although we haven't yet established a 
mailing list).

The subgroup in question is looking at a methodology for examining 
evaluation tools, and working out how to integrate them into a clearly 
defined evaluation process. Its first task is to collect a list of 
tools used by EuroAccessibility members, or widely used in general. The 
work plan I will publish shortly outlines what the group will do, but 
in outline it will collect a list of tools, produce a basic proposal 
for a methodology, and then a concrete proposal for examining a number 
of tools and how they integrate into the testing methodology being 
developed in another public subgroup.

These methodologies will be coordinated with WAI, who are after all the 
people qualified to interpret their specifications if there are 
unresolved questions.

The first draft of the list is just tools used by Sidar, and is 
included at the bottom of this mail.

I will publish shortly details of how to watch or participate in the 
subgroup's work.

cheers

Chaals
