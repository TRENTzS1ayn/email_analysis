It's hosted by WebAIM, who have updated it and maintain it. It's a nice 
tool, not least because it has a nice visual interface that doesn't 
rely on language (just seeing the icons - the alt texts are of course 
monolingual - a limmitation of HTML).

So I don't see that it is in desperate need of a home, since it is 
looking happy and cared-for where it is now.

cheers
