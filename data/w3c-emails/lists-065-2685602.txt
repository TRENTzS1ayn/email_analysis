Hi all,

The WAVE will soon provide the option of giving EARL feedback. As we continue to develop the WAVE, should we keep this feature? The rumor I have heard is that EARL will be replaced with a different reporting language. And I see little activity here. What are the future plans for this area of the WAI?
