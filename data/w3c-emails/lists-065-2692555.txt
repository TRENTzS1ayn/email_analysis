It's good to hear that WAVE will be implementing EARL.

There are no plans right now on W3C/WAI's part to replace EARL with a 
different reporting language; in fact, we have recently started discussions 
on completing EARL so that it can be more broadly used.

I'm not sure what rumor you had heard. Thanks for checking here. If you 
have further questions or can provide other information, please let us know.

We're hoping to re-start some EARL and other tools-related work in ERT WG 
shortly. Please stay tuned...

Regards,
