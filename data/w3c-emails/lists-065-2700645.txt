Someone mentioning EARL prompts me to post this ...

In the course of developing Site Valet Enterprise Edition 2.0,
I've integrated a full accessibility audit trail.  Pages will be
assessed by an automatic agent, and may (or must, according to
local policy) then be reassessed by a human.

For the AccessValet desktop tool, it is sufficient to generate
a result (Pass/Fail/Unknown/unchecked) and a separate conclusion.
But for the sitewide database and audit trail, what is required
is a single-word status to appear in query results, etc.  I'm
currently using a slightly different vocabulary, that doesn't
fit as well as (IMO) it should with EARL:

 * Pass
No problems with that one
 * Accept
An informed decision not to comply with some part of the
guidelines.
 * Review
No conclusion has been reached and the page should be reviewed.
 * Repair
The page has been reviewed and repairs have been identified.
A much more positive thing than "Fail" to say to users!

These are supported by more detailed reports equivalent to the
Executive Summary from the desktop product.  But should I be concerned
about departing from EARL vocabulary in the above?
