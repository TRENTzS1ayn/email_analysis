I'd do this differently. The idea is that you make a property called
nick:accept - it is generally a subclass of earl:fail, because the implied
result is that the checkpoint has not been met, but in your reporting you
treat it as you treat an earl:pass.

This leaves you with earl:cannotTell for your proposed Review, and earl:fail
for your proposed repair property. And declaring the schema like that means
that your results are readily interoperable with others - nick:acceptIt might
be considered fine in the reporting logic for some checkpoints.

This strikes me as similar to Hixie's desire to subclass fail according to
whether it was a recorded bug that caused the problem, or consequent on
something else, or a catastrophic failure, etc...
