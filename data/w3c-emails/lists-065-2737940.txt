The tool reports a cannotTell, mode automatic.

The person reports a pass (or fail), mode manual.

You can select based on the mode (if you generally trust people over tools)
or you can select based on a particular assertor if you have more detailed
information.

For example, my WCAG evaluating tool requires a person to test something and
make an assertion. It will soon (I hope :-) put its results onto an annotea
system, as will other automatic tests.

What to do with apparently conflicting results is a big question anyway. What
if a tool is certain about but something, but a smart person says tehy cannot
tell? Normally I know which I would trust, but knowing who said what is
important for me...

cheers
