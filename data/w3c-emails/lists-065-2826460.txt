[cross post]

while i agree that the specific error messages are tool specific and may
need to be handled separately, i disagree that the validation should be
reduced to a mere yes / no statement (which is what i understood from
your mail).

actually i believe that the errors should be bound even more tightly to
the respective checkpoints in order to be able to sort them according to
the priority. maybe more accurate conformance level claims can be
achieved this way too.

regards,
  shadi
