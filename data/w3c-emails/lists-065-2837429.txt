There are a couple of issues here. I don't have a problem with a tool that
just gives a yes/no answer, but I think it is less useful than one which can
identify the nature of a problem and whereabouts in a document the problem
occurs in an interoperable way. This is why EARL has bits to identify those
things (or at least hooks for them to attach to).

There is a problem in working out (for example) how to refer to a given error
in HTML validation - the DTD is not exactly loaded with helpful IDs for error
conditions.

This is probably an area to talk to the W3C QA activity about...

cheers
