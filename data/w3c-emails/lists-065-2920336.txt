hello,

while experimenting with different approaches to query EARL results i
looked at two implementations:

* Inkling - SquishQL based
  http://swordfish.rdfweb.org/discovery/2001/10/earl/

* Sesame - RQL based
  http://sesame.aidministrator.nl

even though Sesame seems to be more flexible (finer query granularity
possible), i ask myself if the overhead involved in such an approach is
justified as i couldn't think of any vital EARL queries that can't be
covered using SquishQL. on the other hand it may not be wise to restrict
my EARL querying application from the start.

anyway, i'm just curious to know if anyone else has experience with any
of these implementations and what your thoughts on them regarding EARL
queries are.

thanks,
  shadi
