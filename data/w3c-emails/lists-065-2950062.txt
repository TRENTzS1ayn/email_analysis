Hello Shadi,

I noticed your e-mail to w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org mentioning Sesame. As one
of the main developers of Sesame, I would be happy to answer any
questions concerning Sesame. Please send any e-mails to me directly
<mailto:arjohn.kampman@aidministrator.nl>, as I'm not on the
w3c-wai-er-ig mailing list.

Regards,

Arjohn Kampman
