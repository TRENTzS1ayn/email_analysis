Hi folks,

some weeks ago I updated the earl.w3.org annotea-based server. It should now
accept EARL that uses either the temporary/testing namespace it was developed
with, or according to the current TR spec, using the nmg-strawman namespace.
You need to have a username/password in order to post earl to the server.

An example application that does this is an Xform, at
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/200305/axforms/newEarlform.xml - very muuch
a work in progress and unlikely to work unless you have an Xforms-capable
browser. But you can look at the source code...

cheers

Chaals
