I've created a Java servlet that checks a web page for accessibility
problems and I would like it to output EARL, as well as HTML.

The program is still in the alpha stage but is progressing quickly. You can
access it from:
http://www.aprompt.ca/oac/submit.html

For testing purposes, enter the file 'http://www.aprompt.ca/junk1.htm' in
the URL field.

Select the 'Output EARL' radio button to view the EARL output.

My questions about the EARL output are:

Where do I express the line number (and x-path expression) where the error
occurred?
How do I express the guidelines that I've used in the checking?
Is my use of the 'Testcase' and 'testId' correct?

If you spot any errors or questionable use of the EARL, please let me know.

If you click the 'output HTML' radio button then you can see my
transformation of the EARL into HTML.

Chris
