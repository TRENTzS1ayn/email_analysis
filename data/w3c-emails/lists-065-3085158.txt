Hmm. The simplest approach is to say

<earl:Assertion rdf:about="#thisClaim">
  <earl:testcase rdf:resource="http;//example.com/test#def"/>
  <earl:result ...

This means that if you want to know more about the test then you have to go
look it up on the semantic Web. This isn't such a big deal - maybe I would
have been smarter to do it like this, but it is handy for me doing
Xforms-based stuff to have the info there.

Essentially it says

the Assertion #thisClaim (i.e. based on the URI of the assertion document)
has a testcase identified as http://example.com/test#def

This might or might not be a URI that really has a testcase at the end of
it, but it would be better if it was at least in some way ;-)

In my example below I have complicated life, saying

the Assertion has a testcase, that is a thing of type TestCase. Then it goes
on to describe the TestCase in question - an identifier for it, a dublin core
title, a property called wcag:priority (which was made up by me despite
lacking any authority over the URI that the namespace points to - possibly a
bad practice) and there could be other things like a spanish version of the
property.

It's a part of RDF that I have to add the extra "stripe" to be able to talk
further about it. If you use a graphic-based authoring tool or test your
files with the RDF vaidator it is pretty straightforward to get used to it.

technically testcase is a property and TestCase is a class.

cheers

more completely (but with stuff still snipped out)...
