hi charles,

what do you think of using the WCAG checkpoint for the Assertion (for
example "http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/#tech-text-equivalent") and the
tool specific test for the TestCase (for example
"http://www.some-vendor.com/tool/#testcaseXY").

some test cases could also be conducted manually (for example the test
"check if the alt-text resembles the image" located at
"http://www.some-vendor.com/manual/#testcaseXY").

my aim is to be able to collate the results of different tools but at
the same time allow the tools to have their own sets of test cases. only
if i can map an arbitrary test to a checkpoint can i accomplish this.

here is what information i could end up with:

* summarize by assertor
  X assertors conducted tests on checkpoint Y

* summarize by assertion
  X tests were conducted to evaluate checkpoint Y

does that make sense?
what do you think of this?

regards,
  shadi
