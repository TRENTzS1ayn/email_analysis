Hi,

Is there a mechanism for saying that all tests in a suite were passed, other
than the listed ones, I'm currently looking at something which might have
many of thousands of tests, of which 95% will be passed, a certain few
however won't, as long as they were tested, the passes aren't that
interesting (I'll expect them to pass) so don't want them filling up my
triple store etc.

I don't recall any mechanism for this, other than perhaps grouping
testsuites and saying that the group passed, which will reduce the number
required, but make things more complicated, and I don't think the groupings
can be sensibly designed until we have the information back on what's
failing.

Are there any options?

Jim.
