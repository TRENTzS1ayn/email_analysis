We already have checks that should cover that:

[1] text in image must be in alt text
[2] color alone should not describe image
[3] image may require a longdesc
[4] important images should not have empty alt
[5] alt text should describe link destination

Check #7 has been left as is but I have added another check for empty link
text:
[6] Anchor must have some link text
It can be in the title or the image ALT or the A body.

I've also added another check for redundant link text:
[7] large number of anchors should not have redundant link text
(This is redundant text within the same anchor.)
So what's a "large number of anchors"? I put it at 5. Does anyone have an
idea of what a reasonable number would be?
