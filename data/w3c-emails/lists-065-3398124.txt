Hi folks,

a lot of EARL evaluations record a number of Assertions at once, made 
as part of an evaluation. It is often useful to be able to make a 
general comment about the evaluation. In Hera we have enabled this by 
adding some notes about the document that includes the evaluation 
results.

<rdfs:label>Chaals' evaluation of something</rdfs:label>
<rdfs:comment>This is a pretty rough evaluation. It is really just to 
enable me to test some features of annotating an evaluation in 
EARL</rdfs:comment>
</rdf:Description>

What do people think about this approach? In particular, what are the 
implications for manipulating the content - what do we do when we are 
merging several evaluations, to be able to gather the comments 
together.

cheers

Chaals
