Well, one thing to do is to try and agree on URIs to use. For example, I have
used the URIs of the checkpoints to cover claiming each individual
checkpoint, and that is what WAINu, HERA, and Axforms all do.

If you want to declare that 2 URIs mean the same thing you should use an OWL
property:

foo:waigl owl:sameAs bar:wcag1

which relies on tools that understand a bit of OWL to make it work. If you
only want to require tools to understand RDF Schema you can go with

foo:waigl rdfs:subClass bar:wcag1 AND bar:wcag1 rdfs:subClass foo:waigl

So long as the information is available (Hera reports actually link to a
bunch of stuff. Axforms reports include a lot of information in the report)
whether a particular tool understands it or not is a problem for the tool
developer.

But having this kind of OWL stuff is probably useful. I recently wrote a
piece for the WCAG group [1] explaining how to use some other OWL stuff to
describe the fact that meeting some checkpoint was the same as meeting some
set of sub-points - for example WCAG double-A is the set of WCAG level A plus
all priority 2 checkpoints, but it applies equally for the more detailed work
people are doing.

The alternative is to make up special EARL magic which people would still
have to implement - it seems to me easier to sell the idea that implementing
this stuff is in fact doing stock-standard work for your basic parser, and
you can expect to find the right piece of basic parser off the shelf if you
look, rather than some once-off code useful only in EARL tools.
