Thanks for the helpful suggestions.

I think it may be simpler though if we could all agree on a URI that
represents the guideline. You've taken this approach with checkpoints and it
works fine. Example from Sidar's HERA:

<earl:testcase
rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/#tech-text-equivalent" />

How about using
<earl:testcase rdf:resource=http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/#a/>
to represent the WCAG 1.0 level 'A' guideline?

Chris
