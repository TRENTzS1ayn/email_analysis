hi,

currently i'm just using this hack for my prototype:


<earl:testcase
rdf:about="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/#tech-text-equivalent">
  <earl:testId
rdf:resource="http://vendor-a.org/tool/tests/#check-for-alt" />
</earl:testcase>


regards,
  shadi

Yes, we need the binding.

Can you suggest a method of binding the tool specific test to the
standard
test suite?
