That would work (so long as you promise to put it in quotes so it is valid
:-)

Alternatively (or as well) we could ask the WCAG group to provide some
identifiers which we could then use in techniques notes too. I recall trying
to do this once, but I think it might have been for Authoring Tools - there
should be something in there that makes sense as an identifier. But I can't
guarantee it... (And checking, it turns out to be a figment of my imagination
:-(

Until I could use OWL to explain the realtionship in a machine-readable way I
haven't really bothered including conformance level claims in the work I have
done (since they were not terribly relevant to the aspects that were
important to what I was doing).
