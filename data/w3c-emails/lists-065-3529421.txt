I am wondering if we can not use RDF ID for binding


I was dealing with something somewhat similar with mapping XFORMS
interactivity with an inaccessible script

I needed to bind statements that bind statements that bind variables
with  statements that bind scripts, so I am playing with saying
something like...

<rdf:description about = "form@name=form1" ub:hasNonscriptEquivalent =
"xform@model=form1">

<rdf:li ub:IncludeDataBind ="rdfID_1"> 

<rdf:li ub:IncludeDataBind ="rdfID_2"> 

</rdf:description> 

Does that make some sense?


All the best
