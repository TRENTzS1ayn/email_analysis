Fujitsu have announced their software suite for checking Web 
Accessibility, Fujitsu Accessibility Assistance - 
http://design.fujitsu.com/jp/universal/assistance/ (Naturally enough 
for a japanese company, these tools are in Japanese, and my japanese is 
not good enough to test them...

It consists of 3 applications:

ColorDoctor 1.0 simulates how letters and colors might be seen by a 
person with colour-blindness. It runs on Windows XP and requires .NET 
Framework 1.1.

ColorSelector 3.0 - chooses an appropriate pair of foreground and 
background colors and runs on Windows XP with Java 2, and on MacOS X.

WebInspector 3.0 tests whether Web pages are readable for people with 
vision impairments, including colour-blindness, and runs on Windows XP 
and MacOS X.

They are apparently freely available by online download from Fujitsu 
site.

cheers
