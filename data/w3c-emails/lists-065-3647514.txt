Charles,

I agree that supporting tests of pages that are generated on the basis 
of user-given data is important and complex.

As you will see, LIFT Machine has some capability of specifying how 
forms should be filled in and therefore testing (for accessibility) the 
resulting pages. At the moment we don't promote it a lot since its GUI 
is rudimental (you have to specify in XML which form, fields and value 
you want to use). In the future there will be a better interface.
Also, in the user's manual we say that the mechanism can be used to 
automate testing of login forms only. But the mechanism is more general 
than that.

See section 9.13 of the User's Manual of the LM.
