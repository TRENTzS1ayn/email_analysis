Hi - sorry this reply comes a couple weeks after the original. There should
be a technique that deals with link text, but I think it will be in the
Gateway techniques. There should be a placeholder for that now though it
doesn't appear to be in the current draft

Michael - Should there be something in the WCAG2 HTML techs that deals with
link text?
