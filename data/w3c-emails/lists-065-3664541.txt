Hi Charles - are you looking at the ability to test dynamic pages generated
based on form data and behind form submits? Or is there something about the
interaction of the pages and independent of the generated content of any
individual page? For the first part, I think a number of tools support it in
various ways. The way the Watchfire tools work is to scan the site, collect
forms, and allow you to fill out the form, then rescan to pick up the
resultant pages. You can provide multiple sets of form data if you need to
test multiple scenarios, and can continue the process if there is a chain of
forms as in the WAI meeting registration process. If you're looking for the
second part, I'd be interested to know what sort of functionality you're
thinking about, but am not aware of any tools that do anything around that.
Michael
