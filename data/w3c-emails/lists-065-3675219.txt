Essentially I think I am looking at this process, in the first 
instance. And yes, Watchfire sounds like the other tools described that 
handle this.

The one thing that comes up here is related to EARL - how do I describe 
the fact that I have assessed "the login process for a website"? I 
presume it isn't that tricky, but requires a special RDF vocabulary 
which can talk about a process which includes multiple pages that each 
have to meet a set of criteria. Because if any one of the pages fails, 
then the process will fail. And quite often the processes, or user 
paths, are what is important - I think this is used more formally in 
usability testing, but it strikes me as a different way of explaining 
something rather than a fundamental difference in what people do.

I'll think about it, because it seems an interesting way to extend EARL 
data. It also points up the strength of having EARL as RDF - it should 
be relatively easy to do in a way that doesn't require rebuilding lots 
of tools...

Cheers
