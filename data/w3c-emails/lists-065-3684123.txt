i'm not sure if EARL is the right place for this type of stuff. it seems
to me to be more of a tool feature to be able to group sets of pages
together and give an overall claim. this can also be useful to evaluate
whole trails such as a registration process, a tutorial or just a bunch
of related pages.

regards,
