Greetings,

I'm posting you to ask that you take the time to join two of the GREATEST FORUMS IN THE HISTORY OF CYBERSPACE!!

The first list is an information and discussion list called "

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/TheBigPicture2003/?yguid=132698554 " We are a

little over 2,790 strong now and growing rapidly daily.

Our focus there is discussing the GREAT issues in life that confuse and perplex most human beings. We give them answers on how to see the BIG PICTURE in life and live a much more richer and fulfilling life style.

We are looking for things that we can do to make sure that our mental
health and self esteem remains high while we struggle to clear the cobwebs and misprogramming from our minds. and change this most unequitable system. We also promote networking between honest, ethical, law abiding business people.

The second list you should peruse is named :

Please pass the word around about these highly informative lists. Everyone is
welcome to join.

Thank you very much for taking the time to look over this information. I
look forward to getting to know you on the above lists.
