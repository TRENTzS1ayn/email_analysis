Hi all,

Mathieu Chouteau (Bcc'ed on the message) is working on an extension to model
tests done by the WAINu tool in RDF. This is related to the work that Chris
Ridpath is doing - http://aprompt.snow.utoronto.ca/oac/ - with the idea that
a new test can be described and the tool will run it, and generate an EARL
result for it.

From this we expect to model repair patterns in a similar way - so that we
may be able to repair problems but not be able to identify them with an
automatic test, or vice versa.

This is work in progress, but I hope that a preliminary draft of the RDF will
be available in the next few days. Expect it to be in french, and to be
pretty similar to Chris' stuff, but if people are interested I'll extend the
schema to give english labels for everything too.

One thing we haven't really done is thought about trying to write up all the
tests - we expect to do things like use tests in Chris' stuff by XSLT-type
conversion, and similarly for tests described by the EuroAccessibility task
force 3 - http://www.euroaccessibility.org/tf3.php - perhaps with some manual
post-processing.

cheers

Chaals
