This is a good approach, but in many cases you can simplify it by generating
more types of xpath.

for example, "html//img[@src='filename']" is one possibility. Matching an img
src attribute to a particular longdesc attribute is another self-contained
trick.

When an element has an id attribute (or you have access to the page and can
give it one) you can use that pretty easily.

Jim Ley and Nick Kew did some work on fuzzy pointers, based on different ways
of describing the content by taking a hash of certain features as an
identifier - so that you can change the content, but not the element types,
or vice versa...

I think extending the annotea context approach, so it doesn't have to have an
xpointer value but could refer to a piece of RDF, is the best approach - in
its simple form using the xpointer is straightforward, and there is no
restriction on adding new types of pointer, except maintaining
interoperability. (This is already an issue - different tools have different
approaches today)
