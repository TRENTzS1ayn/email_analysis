Hi,

I don't think confidence is a particularly accurate measure. In some cases we
are saying "cannotTell" but adding a suspicion, in some cases we are almost
certain (some people seem always to be certain :-).

I have no objection to people using a confidence scale, but I suspect that we
should look at the use cases and whether we  can say something else more
useful.

(See also my recent email about the bug in my intro re using rdf:resource
when it should be rdf:type or something even more complex...)

Cheers

Chaals
