Hi Chris,

Shadi and I talked about this a bit yesterday.

The conclusion I think we came to was that the tool should generate results
for the individual tests that it can do, and for the rest (or for any
aggregate) it should produce a result of "cannotTell" or "notTested" as
appropriate.

The problem is that it is a bit dubious to say "well, we don't imagine you'd
do anything but what we would do, so we'll assume problems are unlikely" in
individual use cases. If somebody does do something unusual then their
results, while admitteedly divergent from the statistical average, become
entirely unreliable. And we have no way of knowing if that is the case, which
calls into question any individual result.

The model we discussed (it isn't new - it was discussed, for example, in
Bristol in 2002) was based on how to use the "heuristic" mode. If you have a
bunch of individual results, you should be able to say that you have derived
a new result, according to a rule. For example, there are several different
sets of tests around for conformance to WCAG 1.1 - some are proprietary, some
are open, some have common features and others may not.

This is essentially what it takes to generate a result like WCAG double-A
conformance anyway, especially if you want to merge results from different
sources.

There was also some discussion about how the model should work - the schema
that was published is invalid, but I think enough of it can be understood to
make it work. As I noted recently there is a bug in my intro to EARL stuff -
I hope to fix that later today. It has to do with the schema being more
complex than it needs to as far as I can tell.

Cheers

Chaals
