If the high confidence tells that a checkpoint was tested both with 
automatic test tools as well as by a human I would put that information to 
the description of the test case.

So we could have "partialtest1" and "partialtest2" for some automatic 
testing of checkpoint 1.1. In addition we could have a description of a 
combination test "trustedtest1" that refers to both automatic partial tests 
as well as the human test.

Separately, we could express trust for these partial and combination tests 
maybe only in cases when it was done by a trusted group of persons and not 
too long ago etc. This trust varies according to the individuals.

Some related things we have been experimenting with Annotea:
Nobu did some trust experimentations with Annotea shared bookmarks, where 
trusted people's bookmarks were used to change the order of the search 
results (will link some slides from 
http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/User/Papers.html after I get OK from Nobu).

Also Dom did some experimentations with marking messages as spam with spam 
annotations http://www.w3.org/2003/Talks/2003/Spamdemo/Overview.html. 
Similarly EARL Assertions or specific tests could be annotated (or 
bookmarked) as trustworthy or unreliable.
