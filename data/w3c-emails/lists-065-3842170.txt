hi marja,

very interesting. i had similar thoughts but on trusting tools rather
than individuals. i thought, maybe the confidence level might be set to
be proportional to a benchmarking value of the tool against a test
suite. of course all that raises questions on how to construct the test
suite, how to benchmark and how to derive a confidence value from there
but that is off the point right now.

bottom line is that there might be some sort of algorithm to determine
the confidence level but essential values for this calculation would
probably need to come from an external source outside the tool. so who
finally sets the confidence level for an assertion?

regards,
  shadi

If the high confidence tells that a checkpoint was tested both with 
automatic test tools as well as by a human I would put that information
to 
the description of the test case.

So we could have "partialtest1" and "partialtest2" for some automatic 
testing of checkpoint 1.1. In addition we could have a description of a 
combination test "trustedtest1" that refers to both automatic partial
tests 
as well as the human test.

Separately, we could express trust for these partial and combination
tests 
maybe only in cases when it was done by a trusted group of persons and
not 
too long ago etc. This trust varies according to the individuals.

Some related things we have been experimenting with Annotea:
Nobu did some trust experimentations with Annotea shared bookmarks,
where 
trusted people's bookmarks were used to change the order of the search 
results (will link some slides from 
http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/User/Papers.html after I get OK from
Nobu).

Also Dom did some experimentations with marking messages as spam with
spam 
annotations http://www.w3.org/2003/Talks/2003/Spamdemo/Overview.html. 
Similarly EARL Assertions or specific tests could be annotated (or 
bookmarked) as trustworthy or unreliable.

Marja
