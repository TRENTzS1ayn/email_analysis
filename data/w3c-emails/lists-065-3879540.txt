Right. In most cases you either know or you don't, for things like
accessibility.

There are cases where you might want to express confidence. For example, in
reviewing papers I have often used a system that asked me to select one of a
range of subclasses of Pass or Fail ("must have, strong accept, weak accept,
don't care" or "weak reject, strong reject") and to express a confidence
rating on my evaluation.  Similarly in testing things in the physical world
there is often a confidence (or tolerance) measure applied.

But I don't think these cases are the same as getting a tool to use
confidence because the developer thinks it is "pretty likely" that a certain
result indicates a problem, since that takes us down a path of interpretation
that I would prefer we leave to the reader of the results.

This work of Nobu's is very interesting. It is the reason why we ask for an
identifier for the assertor - and applying it to EARL is something that has
lots of obvious application. I hope permission to publish his stuff comes
quickly. (Plus, the slides are nice and clear).

I think the bookmark model (we are talking about the annotea RDF bookmark
schema work - http://www.w3.org/2003/07/Annotea/BookmarkSchema-20030707
explains more) is better than the annotea model, since different people are
going to have different trust profiles - although there is value in being
able to share these around (mediated through the same trust mechanism?)
a bit like GPG/PGP.
