Hi folks,

for those who read french, Mathieu's work is in the links from
http://www.mathieu.chouteau.name/rainbow/wainu.html (wainotu is the previous
version of the tool that included the earl generation and using annotea to
stock results so they could be shared, queried, and so on).

If people want translations of particular things, please let me know...
(english and spanish I can manage, italian mostly, but finnish will be a
stretch for me :-)

Please not that wainu still doesn't have a final home. One day it will get a
proper URI that won't change and will always have the latest verion. But not
yet. (Likewise, yes, the page is horrible HTML, from a horrible template. It
was the page or the work it represents as first priority, but both will get
better).

cheers

Chaals
