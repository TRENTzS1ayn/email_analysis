Hi Shadi,

I think this external trust stuff belongs outside EARL itself - it is a much
more general use case in RDF (as Nobu demonstrated). I think there's a case
to be made for having a confidence property in EARL, but I am not yet sure
what makes sense as a range for that property. I certainly think that such a
property in EARL should be used (when relevant) by whoever makes the
assertion.

cheers
