Dear ERT WG Participants:

Please review the following draft charter for the ERT WG, and comment to 
the list as requested below.

Note that due to updates in the W3C Process Document, a milestones section 
is now required.

Also, the charter is written with the possibility, but not the assurance, 
that EARL 1.0 would be Recommendation-track. If the group thinks that this 
is not a likely option, we could remove these references in the draft 
charter; if Rec-track work became more of an option once the group was 
underway, the group could then request an amended charter.

The draft is available at:
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/charter3.html

1. Okay as is
2. Okay, but recommend the following changes (please specify)
3. Okay only with the following changes (please specify)

Thank you,

- Judy
