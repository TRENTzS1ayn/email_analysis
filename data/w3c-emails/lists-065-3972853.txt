Nice to see that the ER group is getting started again.

I agree with everything execpt that the AERT should not be part of the 
deliverables. The standard set of accessibility checks [1] are a better way of 
describing the same thing and should be used instead. These could be made part 
of the ER group.

We should also increase the scope of the group to help coordinate the world 
wide development of ER tools and to promote the sharing of information. A 
deliverable would be to create a list of all ER tools worldwide.

Putting EARL on the recommendation track is a good thing and we can easily fix 
the few problems it has within the timeline in the charter.
