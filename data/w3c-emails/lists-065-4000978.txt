As such things go, it seems OK but I would like to see the "goal/mission" 
to be more towards getting a Web Service facility from the process rather 
than a "recommendation", i.e. we should be moving towards a validator/fixer 
like Tidy instead of guideline type document.

Less discussion, more coding so that it gets to be at least as usable as Bobby.
