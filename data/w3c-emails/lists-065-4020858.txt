Hi William,

Thank you very much for sharing your comments! Could you please clarify
a little more what you mean, I'm not sure I understood that very well.

Thanks,
  Shadi

As such things go, it seems OK but I would like to see the
"goal/mission" 
to be more towards getting a Web Service facility from the process
rather 
than a "recommendation", i.e. we should be moving towards a
validator/fixer 
like Tidy instead of guideline type document.

Less discussion, more coding so that it gets to be at least as usable as
Bobby.
