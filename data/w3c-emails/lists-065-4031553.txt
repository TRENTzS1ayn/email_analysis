My 2 shekel...


The mission of the Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group (ERT WG) is
to develop techniques and resources 

- this is a great mission, the scoop is more practical but less great...
Perhaps we could brainstorm as to what is needed to fulfill this
mission, before we bend to practical considerations..

Will idea: a w3c wcag validate 
My dream: a place to develop techniques for WCAG (Wcag documents but
does not develop techniques) specifically today I think we need a forum
to develop an ontology for WCAG repair. We have SWAP. And the work of
the WAACI, but lets see what missing and what can be done. That would
then feed into the RDF techniques document. 

By the way, Something that I am yet to find in any WAI charter is  a
place to define the problem, and brainstorm and design a solution.
IE
A place to fully document, specify and research what are the access
related  problems for as many user profiles as possible.
A place to fully document and research how people with disabilities
access the web content.
Including: What design techniques can potential help, and what design
techniques can potential hinder different groups.

PF (or someone) could then develop strategies to ensure mark up can
support solutions, and from there WCAG could  effectively do it's job of
creating guidelines.


All the best
