It seems to be the same part of it that has been played by Josh Krieger's 
Bobby and Len Kasday's WAVE, etc. Of course, it doesn't "repair" or make 
indexed claims (such as metadata concerning accessibility features/levels) 
- and without an interactive-with-"author" component such programs never will.

My point centers on doing this in a consortial setting so that the people 
who do these things with stuff that is likely to get widespread inclusion 
in widely-used products are able to suffer/benefit from wide input that is 
without the biases of commerce/academia/author-ego.

Although I am still partly of the opinion that much good stuff in this vein 
gets done by (mostly) individuals working (mostly) alone, such as Josh, 
Len, Dave Raggett have demonstrated, there is a part of me that still hopes 
for a form of collaboration that can actually produce something that will 
attack this in other ways than merely writing lists of 
guidelines/checkpoints/criteria/techniques/examples. The latter process 
should be of little interest in my opinion. Sorry for the diversional 
answer to the query about the charter for YAWG.
