Lisa,

Thanks for your comments and questions. My replies...

I can't recall any exceptions to this rule. ALT can be null or spaces but it
has to be there.

Not always. This is a potential problem. It's perfectly OK to have large
images with null ALT but in some cases it's wrong. This may be a useful
check for programs, or people, that insert empty placeholder ALT text.

There's an important distinction between these 2 checks. The first check is
for a known problem. The second check is a potential problem and requires
human intervention to figure out it there's really something amiss.

Ideally, all the checks would work perfectly and there would be no potential
problems. Currently, more than half of the checks are for potential
problems. Human intervention is still required but at least you're pointed
in the right direction.

The checks are better if they can detect with certainty the problem. If we
add more "maybes" then it means the checks will get less use. People will
just ignore them.

This is a check for a potential problem. Likely the image does not require a
LONGDESC but you have to check for it.

I'm thinking that this check would be better if there was a size
restriction. If we keep asking people if their spacer gifs and bullets
require a longdesc then the check will be ignored.

How do we determine if the relationship between frames is complex? I've
guessed that this occurs when there are 3 or more frames. Can anyone provide
a clearer definition of frame complexity? Or, when does a frameset require a
longdesc?
