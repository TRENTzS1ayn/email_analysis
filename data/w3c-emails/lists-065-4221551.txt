hi lisa,

i would be very interested in reading these test cases but i think you
know about W3C's patent policy (<http://www.w3.org/2001/08/16-PP-FAQ>).

if you are willing to share these test cases under these terms then i
would be happy to have a look at them.

regards,
  shadi

Subject: test cases from UB Access



I am sending Chris some of our files of test cases from UB Access.
I got the OK from our CEO to use it to help build test cases but not to
post it directly on the web. 
So if anyone else wants copies please let me know and I will send them
to you directly.

If we do use these test case, can there be a note of thanks /
recognition to UB?

I am not receiving ER emails so if people can cc me that would also
help.

Be well,
Lisa
