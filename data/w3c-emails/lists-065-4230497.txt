I think anyone who tries to patent test cases is a bit of an idiot

if you are willing to share these test cases under these terms then i
would be happy to have a look at them.

Subject: test cases from UB Access



I am sending Chris some of our files of test cases from UB Access. I got
the OK from our CEO to use it to help build test cases but not to post
it directly on the web. 
So if anyone else wants copies please let me know and I will send them
to you directly.

If we do use these test case, can there be a note of thanks /
recognition to UB?

I am not receiving ER emails so if people can cc me that would also
help.

Be well,
Lisa
