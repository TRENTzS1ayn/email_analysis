hi all,

I have a few questions about the anchor tag that arose from reading Chris' post. 

Why is an empty anchor tag considered an error? Is it because it is syntactically incorrect, or is it because some user agents do not use them correctly? 

Please include authoritative documentation in answering these questions, if possible. 

Thanks
