To clarify, this should be an empty anchor that contains an href attribute.

<a href="http://www.boston.com"></a> is valid, and in some cases will be
understandable to a screen reader user (as much so as <a
href="http://www.boston.com">http://www.boston.com</a> is).  However, this
won't be understandable for many URIs, such as what you see on a database
generated site, nor will they be accessible to sighted users, or easy to
locate for keyboard users.
