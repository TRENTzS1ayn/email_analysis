When an IMG is used as an anchor, you've got to have a text equivalent. But
what's the best way to implement the text equivalent?

Within the anchor:
<a href="cats.html"><img src="cat.jpg" alt=""/>cats</a>

Alt text:
<a title="cats" href="cats.html"><img src="cat.jpg" alt="cats"/></a>

Title on anchor:
<a title="cats" href="cats.html"><img src="cat.jpg" alt=""/></a>

Title on IMG:
<a href="cats.html"><img src="cat.jpg" alt="" title="cats" /></a>

Using all 4:
<a title="cats" href="cats.html"><img src="cat.jpg" alt="cats" title="cats"
/>cats</a>

I tried this on Jaws 4.5 and it read the text fine no matter where it was.

When the text was on all 4 it only read the text twice.

I propose that there must be at least one place for the text. Doesn't matter
where and it can be on multiple places. Yes, it may be read more than once
if it occurs multiple times but it gives more flexability.
