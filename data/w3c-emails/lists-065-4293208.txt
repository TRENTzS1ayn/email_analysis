Thanks for the update. Sounds like this requirement should appear in the
next draft.

This has got me thinking that check #7 [1] is not quite right. What we
really want is simply that an anchor must contain some text. An image used
in an anchor can have empty ALT text as long as there is a text equivalent
somewhere (ALT, TITLE or link text).

The different placements of text have different meaning, semantically and in
terms of specification purpose. But does this make much of a practical
difference to the user? If link text is present, do we need another check to
make sure it's put in the proper place?
