Hello everybody (emails attached)

I'd like to organize a first conference call for this group to
talk about individual activities and a workplan to bring that together.

I'm proposing next Friday Oct 16 at 10am-11am Boston time.

Please tell me if that's OK and whether or not you'll be there.
(phone numbers and more detailed agenda will come later)

I have also updated the group's home page at
   http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/WG

I would also like to invite some of the authors of tools mentioned at 
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/existingtools.html
that have not yet registered to this list and would appreciate your
comments as to who/what tools is more important (in your view) to
bring in.
