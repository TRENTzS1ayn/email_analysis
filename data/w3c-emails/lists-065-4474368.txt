Let's negotiate a shared context for theoretical discussion.

Here are some buzz-phrases.  Give me one-sentence definitions
for those you feel you either know or can guess what you think
I would mean:

The specification of the future web is a web of ontologies.

A method is:
- an action opportunity
- [an abstraction of] a class of transactions

partial compilation

relational programming

multi-level partial understanding

fuzzy logic

negotiation

market models of multi-agent transactions

behavior as stable abstractions in trace space

hybrid control

polyclinic graph-reduction capability (hint: marry partial
compilation and relational programming and you get this.
Answers the question "Is there partial compilation after Lisp?)

If none of these click, answer with a counter list of
topics for me to try to relate to.
