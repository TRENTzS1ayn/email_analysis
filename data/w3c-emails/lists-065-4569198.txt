Brian,

Re technique 1.1.B (LONGDESC use):
I checked over the WAI Page Authoring Guidelines and they suggest, in their
techniques, using a 'd' link as well as the LONGDESC. Current versions of
Netscape & IE do not support the LONGDESC so, until they do support it, we
should ask the author to put in a 'd' link for complex images. The 'd' links
are more messy for the page layout then the LONGDESC but it looks like, for
now, they will have to remain in use.

I'll update the ERT document today with this new info.

Re technique 4.3.A (LANG attribute):
I think that we'll have to concentrate on HTML for this version of repair
tools and ignore XML. If we start dealing with XML now, we'll never finish
on the HTML.

Chris
