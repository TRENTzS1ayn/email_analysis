For longdesc, there is the valid case where the image is complex,
there's no longdesc attribute, but the "longdesc" is inline, that is,
described in html markup close to the image (e.g. "Figure 1 presents
our new organization chart with Greg on top, Daniel at the bottom,
etc".)

A (somewhat costly) repair technique for guessing the primary LANG is
the use of dictionaries of common and exclusive words in common
languages. E.g. is you find "a, the, you, for, is, of, and" then it's
engligh, if you find "le, du, la, a, se, pour, aux, des, ne" then it's 
french, etc.
