As part of our effort to provide technical assistance to federal
agencies, GSA has developed the following tool which provides guidance
to several of the evaluation and repair tools.   We would welcome
comments on the tool, preferably through the "webmaster" link that will
be at the bottom of the page (second to last link on the page, just
before the "disclaimer" link) that gets generated when you fill out the
form at the URL provided below.   This will send a message to me with a
predefined subject, based on field values.

This tool is being announced today through a memo to agency CIOs, so any
comments you could send today would be helpful.   The official "release
date" will be Monday, and I'll try to incorporate as many of your
suggestions as possible by then, or in Version 3.1 which will be
completed by May 24.

Supporting Analysis of Intranet Pages

     An idea I've proposed to some colleagues here is asking
     whether we could create a separate domain with the sole
     purpose of housing 508 analysis tool servers such as Bobby.
     The idea is that government agencies could establish a limited
     trust relationship with this domain that would allow Intranet
     pages to be evaluated by this government-hosted servers.
     Does this approach seem feasible from your perspective?  What
     would be the server specifications for establishing such an
     environment?

Accessing the Check Your Page tool

     For today:

     This will be available through a "Tools" link on the new
