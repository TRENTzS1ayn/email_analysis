Dear WAI ER WG,

Further to my recent correspondance with Len, here is my formal application
to join the WAI Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group as an Invited

Further to the Area of Interest section in my application to join the WL WG

I wish to help in the following ways:

amount of time working on the WG).
