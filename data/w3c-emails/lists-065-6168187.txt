From: Chuck Letourneau

As the lesser-known of your co-chairs, I thought I ought to introduce
myself to you with a short biography.

After an education in geology, and early careers in environmental
geochemistry and resource geophysics, I became a federal public servant
with Environment Canada's Systems and Informatics Directorate in 1984.  I
became a specialist in personal computer hardware and software support at a
time when PCs were just becoming popular in the department.  From 1988 to
1992 I was also involved in planning and promoting the strategic use of
artificial intelligence and expert system techniques in departmental
systems.  

When the Adaptive Computer Technology (ACT) Centre pilot project began in
1990 to provide technology, training and support to employees with
disabilities, I joined the team as the technology specialist.  In April
1993 I became the Chief of the ACT Centre.  In 1995, I became interested in
the World Wide Web and saw both the opportunities and barriers it would
present to my clients.  I began developing my own spin on Web-page design
guidelines and soon added my efforts to the work of the Trace Center and
COCA on the Web.  Since I created the guide while employed by the federal
government, it was (and is) available in both official languages: English
and French.  At the same time, some colleagues and I lobbied successfully
to include accessible markup guidelines in the official government Internet
style guide prepared by the Treasury Board of Canada.  

In 1996, I left the federal government to start a consulting business,
specializing in accessible Web-page design and other issues relating to
assistive technology and accommodation.  Some major projects include the
formation of the Assistive Devices Industry Association of Canada; the
creation of a high-level government, industry and community working group
on access to the Information Highway in Canada; and participation in the WAI.

I trust we will be able to work together to further the goals of the WAI
and I believe that we can make a product to be proud of.

Regards,
Chuck
