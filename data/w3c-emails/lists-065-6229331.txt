To:"'GL - WAI Guidelines WG'"<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>

Is anyone out there?

We have just a week to clean up these guidelines before we go to Austin. 
 If you are reviewing them and not done yet.. please send any comments you 
have as you go.  If you haven't looked at them yet. Please do.  As soon as 
possible.    We don't want to do cleanup in the meeting if we can do it up 
front.

Please look them over soonest.

They are at http://trace.wisc.edu/docs/html_guidelines/htmlgide.htm


Thanks
