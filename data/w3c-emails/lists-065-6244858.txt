I agree completely with Al's comments. For the present, if item numbers
are desired, the best solution is to take advantage of the OL element. CSS
numbering should allow the user's default style sheet to number UL
elements automatically if desired.

CSS also allows audio cues to be associated with list items (LI elements),
thus overcoming any difficulties that readers may experience in
identifying the beginning of each item. Of course, authors need to use the
correct markup, and it is the purpose of the guidelines to encourage them
to do so.
