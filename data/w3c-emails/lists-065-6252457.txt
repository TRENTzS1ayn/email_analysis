I asked Neal Ewers here at trace to try this out with different screen 
readers.

Here are his results.

Bullet test
GENERAL COMMENTS
It would appear that the synthesizer a person is using is more important 
here than is the screen reader.  With the screen reader, you can turn on 
and off various levels of punctuation, but the pause that is placed after 
the punctuation seems largely dependent on the synthesizer in use at the 
time.
I have tried the test page with the Dectalk Express, the Accent SA, and the 
softvoice synthesizers.  The screen readers I have used are JFW for 
Windows, Winvision from Artic Systems, and Window-eyes from GwMicro.  I 
have used Ms Internet Explorer 3.0, Netscape 3.0 and 4.0 and PwWebspeak 
1.4.  Here are the results.
INTERNET EXPLORER 3.0
(Note.  I have to get the font size up to 16 point before the image is read 
by the screen reader on the same line as the text.  When it is smaller and 
when I am reading with the mouse pointer by line, the screen reader will 
say image on one line and speak the text on the next line.  After I have 
done this, and I suspect few screen reader users will do this, I get the 
following results.
1.Jfw with Dectalk
* Spaces after the image do not make a difference.
* period is longest pause, then comma.  Colon does not pause. * Numbered 
list does not make a difference.

2.JFW with Accent sa
* space does not make a difference.
* Pause after colon and period is quite long.  Pause after comma is about 
half as long as colon and period.
* Numbered list does not make a difference.

3.Winvision with Accent SA.
* same as JFW with Accent SA

4.Winvision with Dectalk.
* Same as JFW with Dectalk.

5.Window-eyes with Accent SA
* same as JFW with Accent SA

6.Window-eyes with Dectalk.
* Same as JFW with Dectalk.

WEBSPEAK 1.4 with SoftVoice
* The word "image" is spoken in place of the graphic.  So the line reads 
"image item text."
* Colon pauses the longest, then comma, then period which does not pause at 
all.
* Numbers at the beginning of the text do not make any difference except 
that the period before the number causes the "period-to be pronounced as 
"point" as in "image point 1."

NETSCAPE 3.0 AND 4.0
* Tests were inconclusive.  I had a hard time here.  No matter how big I 
made the font, (up to 16 point) when I read with the mouse pointer (line by 
line) the screen reader read the image on one line and the text on the next 
line.  When I allowed the screen reader to read the entire screen, the 
pauses I found after various punctuation were the same as with Internet 
Explorer (in other words, they were synthesizer dependent and stayed the 
same from one screen reader to another).
