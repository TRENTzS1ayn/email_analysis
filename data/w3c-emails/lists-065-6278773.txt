        Reply to:   RE>standard symbols

For captioning, years ago, The Caption Center designed the CC-in-a-TV symbol, which has pretty much become the standard method of indicating closed captioning.  It is available for free from The Caption Center, with no restrictions.  Contact Mary Watkins at mary_watkins@wgbh.org or 617 492-9225 for info on getting a copy.  This symbol should not be confused with the TV-with-a-tail symbol, which is proprietary to the National Captioning Institute.

For description, there is no standard symbol at this time.  Also, the movement is towards using the words "video description" when describing movies (on tape, the web or in the theater) and "audio description" when describing live events, like plays or opera.

I was recently asked


Are there any standardized/internationalized icons/glyphs for representing 
closed captioning for video? Audio? What should the text associated with 
this glyph(s) say?

Sounds like we should have this in our guidelines.  Maybe also a topic for 
RC group.
