Some initial comments:

1.  Not much is made of the fact that blind people and others cannot use a
mouse.  I found the requirement for keyboard  alternatives to mouse actions
listed once and it was way down in the document.  I think this is an important
item and we'll want to emphasize it more.

2. Some authors don't know what a "user agent" is as in the heading
"Recommendation for user agent (browser) developers".  I would like to see us
"browser developers" and explain that it includes all user agents.  I'm trying
to de-geek the guidelines.

3. Some places we say "alternative" text (or page) and others we say "alternate"
 text (or page).  I don't know that there's a big difference, but we should
choose one and stick with it. I like alternate over alternative.

More grammar comments will come in a separate post.
