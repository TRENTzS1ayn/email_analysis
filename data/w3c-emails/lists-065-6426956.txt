I'll comment on the guidelines for authors (content itself) in
a separate message. Just its form/presentation in this message. 

I think the beginning section

  Rating System
    [required]
    [recommended]
  Classification System
    [interim]
    [new]

should be reorganized as

  Rating System 
    importance
      [required]
      [recommended]
    timing
      [interim]
      [new]

I see the Master guidelines as more of a final assemblage than
anything else (I agree it can also serve as a way to track related
guidelines in markup/browser/authoring area).

I like the use of <span> to mark up required and recommended markers
(add colors, etc). I'd suggest to do more: mark [Interim] and [new]
the same way and move them up on the line right after
[required/recommended], they are hard to find otherwise.

BTW, I really like the terms interim and new, good choice.

In addition to <SPAN>, it would be really good if we'd use <DIV> to
mark-up the section themselves (as being required, new etc). This way
one could just use CSS display:none or some grey foreground font to
select a particular "view" of the document.

Yes, CSS printing is not there yet.

Actually, I think it's OK if we call them the W3C/WAI working draft
guidelines (since that's what they are) and if we move them to
www.w3.org/WAI/GL/Version1.html or something similar.

Regarding version, is there any reason why it's still version 8 ?
