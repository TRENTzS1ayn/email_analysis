The point of this recommendation is that table markup which does not
really represent a table, and which would not be read correctly if
rendered in speech as a table, should not be used to control visual
layout. This can be a long term recommendation, but it is important that
authors move toward style sheets as quickly as possible. I recognise
Daniel's point that CSS positioning has not been fully implemented yet,
but surely it will be available next year.

It is therefore desirable to distinguish those instances in which the
employment of table markup can be regarded as genuine from those in which
it can not.
