ASG:: Enforcing some "meaning" or "intention" for HTML structures
such as TABLE that is narrower than the range of useful things
that the structure can and will do for you will likely be futile.

HTML is a win because it is so natural.  The rule of natural
language is "Whatever works."  This is short for the orthodox
sentence "Whatever works, goes."  The syntactically unorthodox
form is frequently used because it is usually understood.

Occam's razor applies to languages and media.  The fewer rules
one has to follow to get one's point across, the more desirable
the language or medium.
