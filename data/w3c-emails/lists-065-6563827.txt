I'll introduce my comments with ASG:: 

to follow up on what Chuck Letourneau said:

ASG:: What I recall hearing in Austin was that the GL group was
asked to prepare a draft "site map" for the integrated
resource that multiple groups were eventually going to maintain.

I think that there is reason to question whether "one master
integrated document" is the best model for how it all goes
together, and that a draft "site map" was the requested next
step in exploring this issue.

Does the GL group want to take a crack at a site map for "the
guidelines knowledge resource" as it would exist under continuing
maintenance in service to a continuing EO effort, or do y'all
want somebody else to draft something?

PS:
Pedantic notes on mapping workflow into email:

This is going To: the CG list because the primary topic of this
message is coordinating the work of different groups.

It has a Cc: to the GL list because I am responding to mail that
has been delivered to all of you and because for your information
this may eventually affect the scope or structure of the
deliverable you are working on.

It as an (ATTN: Cl & Gv) in the To: line because that's actually
who I am asking to respond (not just anybody on CG), and I don't
want to litter Chuck and Gregg's inboxes with more than two
copies of the message...
