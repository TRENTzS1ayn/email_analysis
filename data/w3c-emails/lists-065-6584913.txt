To: HTML Guidelines Working Group<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>


A further suggestion: extend the scope of the GL group by defining its
purposes as follows:

(1) To create and update the WAI HTML markup guidelines.

(2) To integrate these guidelines with those produced by AU and UI.

(3) To construct and maintain the WAI guidelines and accessibility web
pages (these comprise the unified site which Al and Gregg have mentioned).

GL would thus act not only as the working group responsible for the
all-important HTML guidelines, but would also be charged with the task of
unifying the various WAI guidelines and furnishing, where practicable,
examples of appropriate web authoring practice. GL would also maintain the
unified WAI guidelines web site as mentioned above.

GL should also reflect, in its guidelines, any scheme for classifying web
sites in relation to accessibility which is developed by the RC group.
