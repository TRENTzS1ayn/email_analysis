To: HTML Guidelines Working Group<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>


Now that HTML 4.0 has become a W3C recommendation
(http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-HTML40/), it is time to update the guidelines
accordingly, in the following respects:

1. Modify the guidelines as required to take into account those aspects of
HTML 4.0 which were changed following the release of the proposed
recommendation on 7 November.

2. This group should also consider whether it would be desirable to link
each section of the detailed page author guidelines to the corresponding
section of the HTML 4.0 recommendation, and similarly whether, as in the
HTML 4.0 specification itself, every element or attribute mentioned in the
guidelines should be linked to its associated definition in the
specification.
