Can't find anything on background patterns in the checklist or author
guidelines.  It's in the master document, although perhaps it needs more
detail, for instance explaining what makes for a distracting background &
what doesn't (i.e., are we recommending never use any background patterns
ever?  I don't think so, but would help to have something more explicit).
