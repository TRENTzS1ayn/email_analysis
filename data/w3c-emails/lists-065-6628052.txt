Linking from one document to the internals of another is an
interesting topic by itself.

It sort of has the effet to "freeze" the version of the target
document the source document points to (we'd need indirect link, which
I've seen proposed a while ago, to better manage that)

The question we need to ask is whether or not we want to have a
version of the guidelines that's specific to the HTML4 spec.
