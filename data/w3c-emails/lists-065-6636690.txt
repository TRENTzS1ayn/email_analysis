JW:: The structure of the guidelines has already been designed to parallel
that of the HTML 4.0 spec, so in that sense the two are already in a close
relationship. What I am thinking is that a reader of the guidelines who is
also in the process of learning HTML may appreciate being reminded, by
following links provided in the HTML page authoring guidelines, of crucial
element and attribute definitions, examples of usage, etc., which are
given in the HTML 4.0 spec.
