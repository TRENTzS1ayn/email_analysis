A quick clarification regarding terminology and this thread:

There are three related documents containing varying levels of detail:

The Master document (which is the giant reference guide) does follow the
format of the HTML 4.0 specification.

The Page Author Check List and the Page Author Guidelines are designed to
be "more friendly" and as such, do not necessarily follow the structure of
either the Master document or the HTML 4.0 spec.

I think the issue of how or if the Checklists, Guidelines and Master
Document can be linked to the HTML 4.0 specification is a matter for either
the Interest Group or the Coordination Group (or both) at the moment.
