The point of the original post that started this discussion was that
accessibility should target *everyone* - and for sighted users with a
text browser, there should be a visual cue akin to that of a
horizontal rule.  "Section divider" simply doesn't provide the same
visual impact that "----------------------------" does.  Even a short
line, with a description, like "---- section divider" would be better
then a text- only alt attribute.
