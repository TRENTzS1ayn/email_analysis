The other problem for the person using a screen reader is that there is no
indication where the ascii art begins.  Therefore if this method is used,
someone would hear all of the dashes and words and then the description.
If this were an image it would be clear (image, caption, d-link). Perhaps
if the caption was first, then the ascii art followed by some sort of "end
figure" text, perhaps the "d" link, it might make it less confusing.
