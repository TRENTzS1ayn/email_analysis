Hi,
 Just noticed you linked to my site on accessibility guidelines from
http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-0203
Thanks! One thing though, you linked to:
 http://www.anybrowser.org/campaign/abdesign.html

The page has moved to:
 http://www.anybrowser.org/campaign/abdesign.shtml

Could you fix the link? Thanks so much!
