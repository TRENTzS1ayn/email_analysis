In regards to: 10.2. Explicitly associate labels with their control.

It is problematic to require people to associate LABELs with
<INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT> buttons and BUTTONs primarily because these
controls often have no text to associate with them. Should
we be requiring empty LABELs or none at all?

There is also the sly <INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN> which shouldn't
be required to have a LABEL associated with it.
