Do you think that if a control does not have a label that an author might
create one to satisfy the recommendation?  If so, we might want to include
a submit button with out a label in the example and follow it with a
statement along the lines of:

  This guideline does not apply to controls that do not have labels such as
submit buttons and hidden controls.
(or in the positive:  This guideline only applies to controls that have
labels and not to controls such as submit buttons and hidden controls).

However, since we don't require every control to have a label, it might not
be a problem.   it's perfectly clear to me <smile>

thoughts?
