By labels do you mean the <label> tag?  Buttons by definition have labels,
the text inside of them.  TYPE=IMAGE buttons can have ALT text.

Do you think that if a control does not have a label that an
author might
create one to satisfy the recommendation?  If so, we might
want to include
a submit button with out a label in the example and follow
it with a
statement along the lines of:

  This guideline does not apply to controls that do not have
labels such as
submit buttons and hidden controls.
(or in the positive:  This guideline only applies to
controls that have
labels and not to controls such as submit buttons and hidden
controls).

However, since we don't require every control to have a
label, it might not
be a problem.   it's perfectly clear to me <smile>

thoughts?
