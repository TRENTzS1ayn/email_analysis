Hi, 

At this point in my career I can make pages work in Internet Explorer and
Netscape Navigator. You sugges testing pages in many browsers. I have surfed
the web for a utility which will let me do that. I can't find it.

the list is way too long and way too complicated. You are putting too much off
on the authors. Get the manufacturers together to stick to one set of rules,
not authors. You suggest style sheets instead of tags such as  , etc. I have
tried to use them but Netscape displays gray instead of the colors I pick. 

So nothing is standard. Get the act together and get the manufacturers to
agree to one standard. by the time you catch up with Netscape and Internet
Explorer, they are way ahead again.

DON'T FORCE AUTHORS TO DO ALL THE WORK. FORCE BROWSERS TO ACCEPT ANYTHING WE
PUT OUT. ADOPT A STANDARD BROWSER.

DON'T PUT IT ALL OFF ON AUTHORS.
