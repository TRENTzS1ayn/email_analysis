A browser that exposes DOM or a browser that can understand this PRE
class trick.

OK, so let's have two recommendations:

 for inline graphics done using plain text (using PRE for example), 
   - [Interim] make sure you announce the beginning and the end of
   graphic portion using a text "marker" understandable by the user
   reading the page, so that she or he can skip this portion.
   - [New] use PRE and class=graphics
 In both cases, include a long description link for the graphic.

One way to do the interim job while keeping the original look is to
use CSS display=none on some marked SPAN:

<SPAN class=ascii-art-marker>Ascii-art (ending with Figure caption)</SPAN>
<PRE class=graphic>  
   audio
|----------|
   video
|----....------|
</PRE>
