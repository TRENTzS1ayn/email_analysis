DD:: I need to read it again in the plane to WWW7 but a quick comment is
that I think we should specify a way to do class=deco today, so that
it's up to the reader/browser to decide. Without running much risk, we
can give some hints of what is decoration vs what is not.

DD:: I think "XYZ Logo" is the function of the graphic: it's the logo
of the XYZ company, that's its job. The description could be something
like "A multicolored apple", or "A circle of 12 stars", which probably
belongs into the long description file if it's more than 5 words (like
"part of piano keyboard surrounded by a couple of notes and a G clef")


More later.
