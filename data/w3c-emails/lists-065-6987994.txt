I would.

I would say: there is the company logo on the left corner (do you want
me to describe it?), then it says "Welcome to XYZ", etc.

So that later, on, if I refer to "the page with the company logo on
it", then it would make sense.

It's just information, and I don't see why I would not give it away.
