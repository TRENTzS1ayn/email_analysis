Can I briefly suggest that half the problems related to the ALT-text
discussions are simply based on user knowledge we don't know or are unsure
of? Discussions like this tend to be very subjective in nature....and while
I appreciate that it's critical for the WG to "get it right", I don't think
it's possible until you implement user interface testing into the WAI
process to help you truly determine what a blind or text-client user will
need/want. Please note that I've used "client" since it's clear that we're
dealing with multiple client interfaces -- not just PC-type or voice-based
browsers.

Regards,

Mike
