Hi All,

Later tonight we will be posting a new version of the guidelines.
This is not a new public version but a new version for review by this
working group.   We have tried to capture some of the key aspects of
the feedback we have been getting, particularly where we thought we
saw consensus.   Where we didn't we tried to remove the part under
debate and keep the part we all agreed on.

Next week the HTML Writers Guild will be looking at the guidelines and
evaluating them by trying to use them in their work.  SOOOOOO please
everyone give these a good look over as soon as you possibly can and
get comments back to us so we can fix up any problems in the
guidelines or in our recent edits.

Have a good weekend.  Happy reading.

Well post the URL to this list as soon as we have it up on the server
and can confirm the link works.
