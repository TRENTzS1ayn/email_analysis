Each region of a client side map must conform to one of the shapes
supported by the SHAPE attribute defined in the HTML 4.0 specification. If
a more complex map is to be created, in which the regions are irregular in
shape, then the author has no choice but to opt for a server side map.
Hence it is necessary for the guidelines to provide an alternative
solution which can be applied whenever this contingency arises.
