There is an apparent inconsistency between the guidelines concerned with
image maps. One can not both require that client-side maps be used, and
then provide an alternative in the event that server-side maps are needed.
By definition, the "required" classification in this context would
preclude the use of server-side maps altogether. Perhaps an alternative
would be: (1) Required: either make the image map accessible or provide a
textual alternative. Recommended: use client-side maps. Required: if
server-side maps must be used ...

Also, the document as a whole needs to be proofread and edited for grammar
and style. It contains a number of obvious errors which have probably
resulted from the many rounds of revision which the text has undergone.
I know from personal experience that elementary mistakes can easily arise
during the editing of a document and that careful proofreading is the best
means of identifying them.
