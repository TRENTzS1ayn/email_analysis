I.e one of RECT, CIRCLE, POLY or DEFAULT

You have me at a loss now.  I wasn't aware that typical server-side
maps supported any other shapes.  The CERN server supports circle,
rectangle and polygon: NCSA and Apache support rect, poly, circle and
point.  While "point" may offer additional convenience, I think it can
be adequately simulated for a client side map by using the available
shapes.

Or were you thinking of some kind of custom script, instead of the
server's own imagemapping program?

Yes, I wasn't offering any objection at all to that as a principle (I
was a bit concerned about the self-contradictory way in which the
guidelines set it down, but that has already been discussed in the
last few days). The point of my question was not to object to the
principle, but rather to learn more about what kind of situations the
drafters had in mind as ones where a server-side map "must be used".
