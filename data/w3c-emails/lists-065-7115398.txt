Thanks everyone.

We have received over 50 comments and suggestions since Friday and
have incorporated all of them into the guidelines. (whew says Wendy).

Thanks also for providing suggested alternate wordings.  THAT IS
REALLY HELPFUL and is the only reason we have been able to get
everything in.

The postings were to GL so you are aware of them except for a whole
slew of grammatical and other fixes from our co-editor Ian Jacobs.

The result will be posted a bit later tonight as soon as we can get
all the i's dotted and the t's crossed.   When it is done it will be
at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-0413.html

In some cases we received multiple suggestions for the same issue.  In
some cases, comments caused us to try to restructure things.    So be
sure to give it a look and see if we captured all your thoughts and
answered your issues.   We think we covered everything this time  -
but...... if we missed something or you find other issues, be sure to
drop us a line.

Looking forward to your comments.


Gregg, Wendy and Ian
