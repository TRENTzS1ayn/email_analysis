Section 3.2 requires alternative text for each applet and suggests using
the ALT attribute.  There is no point to the ALT attribute on APPLET; it
should not be used since markup-rich alternate content can be provided as
the content of the APPLET element.  The example's ALT text would be better
suited as a TITLE attribute value.  As well, decorative applets and objects
may not require alternative content, just as some IMG elements should use
ALT="".

I agree that ALT and the markup inside of APPLET need to be better defined.
Also for OBJECT as well.  I though that it was okay to say that the markup
was sufficient, but is it?  Wendy's testing of the <OBJECT> tag had dismal
results for accessibility.  What should a browser do when it recognizes the
tag, but is not displaying the applet or object because of (a) user choice
or (b) the operation failed?  

Should the browser display the ALT attribute or the markup in-between?  More
importantly, what should authors do?

For example, O'Reilly's "HTML: The Definitive Guide" 2nd Edition has this to
say about the matter:

Page 400, Section 13.1.5.11 Supporting incompatible browsers

Since some browsers may not support applets or the <applet> tag, sometimes
you may need to tell readers what they are missing.  You do this by
including HTML body content between the <applet> and </applet> tags.
...
Remember that this contained text is different from the text supplied by the
alt attribute of the <applet> tag.  The ALT text is displayed by browsers
that support the <applet> tag but cannot execute or display the specified
applet.  The contained text is displayed by browsers that do not support the
<applet> tag at all.  In order to accommodate both classes of browsers, the
considerate author supplies both for each <applet> tag.

<applet code=clockclass alt="[ Clock applet not available ]">
<param name=style value=analog>
If your browser were capable of handling applets, you'd see a nifty analog
clock right here!
</applet>
