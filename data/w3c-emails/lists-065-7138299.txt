LQ::  This is silly.  The result is that newer browsers provide less
capable replacements for APPLETs since they move from giving rich markup
alternatives (the content of the APPLET) to plain text alternatives (the
ALT attribute) when they add support for the APPLET element.  APPLET allows
replacements with full markup; let's not throw that away because somebody
made a mistake and added an ALT attribute to APPLET.  (There's a reason why
OBJECT doesn't have an ALT attribute.)

I don't see a need to have different alternate content depending on whether
the browser supports the APPLET element or not.  Either way, the user will
not see the APPLET.  Besides, the guidelines clearly don't care about
pre-HTML 3.2 browsers, so we can probably assume APPLET support for the
sake of the guidelines.

By the way, the April 13th draft mentions in numerous places that the ALT
attribute is required for APPLET.  This is not the case in any version of
HTML.
