I don't disagree with any of your points.  I'm trying to get guidance on how
Internet Explorer should be representing <OBJECT> and <APPLET> when it
encounters them but for some reason isn't going to display them.  Do we
always display the markup or just display the ALT (if available)?  I agree
that we should display the markup, but if web masters are following the
recommendation of O'Reilly book (and possibly others), then their efforts
will be lost.  What about the down-level browser case?

Since <APPLET> does have an ALT attribute, but <OBJECT> does not, the W3C is
sending mixed signals and that needs to be corrected.

My point in bringing this up is that this is a complex problem, requiring
changes to (a) the guidelines, (b) HTML and (c) user agents.

LQ::  This is silly.  The result is that newer browsers provide less
capable replacements for APPLETs since they move from giving rich markup
alternatives (the content of the APPLET) to plain text alternatives (the
ALT attribute) when they add support for the APPLET element.  APPLET allows
replacements with full markup; let's not throw that away because somebody
made a mistake and added an ALT attribute to APPLET.  (There's a reason why
OBJECT doesn't have an ALT attribute.)

I don't see a need to have different alternate content depending on whether
the browser supports the APPLET element or not.  Either way, the user will
not see the APPLET.  Besides, the guidelines clearly don't care about
pre-HTML 3.2 browsers, so we can probably assume APPLET support for the
sake of the guidelines.

By the way, the April 13th draft mentions in numerous places that the ALT
attribute is required for APPLET.  This is not the case in any version of
HTML.
