The current GL draft says that the earlier example is not acceptable.
Section 8.2 [1] requires that authors "Associate labels with their controls
explicitly. [New] The 'for' attribute of the LABEL element allows explicit
association."  Since there is nothing wrong with implicit association of
labels, I would suggest the following change:

Associate labels with their form controls. [New] The LABEL element allows
authors to associate a form control with its label.
