Please do not commit to one way or another yet - there are apparently a lot
of issues with implicit labels.  Internet Explorer 4.01 doesn't support
ACCESSKEY attribute on a implicitly bounded control.

That is:

<LABEL ACCESSKEY=N>Name:<INPUT TYPE=TEXT></LABEL> does not work.

However:

<LABEL FOR=name1 ACCESSKEY=N>Name:<INPUT TYPE=TEXT ID=name1></LABEL> does
work.

It's apparently very difficult to make the implicit case work because of
nesting and bad HTML issues.  I'm working on getting a better answer from
the developers.  I'm also concerned because the implicit way may not make
the label available to the input control element.  This affects DOM/DHTML
and Active Accessibility greatly.

I bring this up because if IE can never support the implicit case, then that
might affect the recommendations one way or another.

Per today's comments and existing examples in html 4.0,  here is the
proposed
new content for recommendation 8.2:

[Required]
  Associate labels with their form controls.
Labels can either be associated explicitly, using the "for" attribute,
or implicitly, by nesting the control element within the content of the
LABEL element.

[New] The "for" attribute of the LABEL element allows explicit
association. For example:
<FORM action="http://somesite.com/adduser" method="post">
  <FIELDSET>
    <LEGEND>Personal information</LEGEND>
    <LABEL for="firstname">First name:</LABEL>
    <INPUT type="text" id="firstname" tabindex="1">
    <LABEL for="lastname">Last name:</LABEL>
    <INPUT type="text" id="lastname" tabindex="2">
    ...more personal information...
  </FIELDSET>
  <FIELDSET>
    <LEGEND>Medical History</LEGEND>
    ...medical history information...
  </FIELDSET>
</FORM>

[New] Nest the control element within the content of the LABEL element
for implicit association. For example:
<FORM action="http://somesite.com/adduser" method="post">
  <LABEL>
    First Name
    <INPUT type="text" name="firstname">
  </LABEL>
  <LABEL>
    <INPUT type="text" name="lastname">
    Last Name
  </LABEL>
</FORM>
