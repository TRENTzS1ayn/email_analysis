Hello,

"Today's" version of the guidelines is at 

http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-0414.html
Although we did not have much traffic on the listserv today, we are posting
another version to show how the proposed changes will read in context.


Major changes:

1.  We removed the word "explicitly" from the recommendation "Associate
labels with their form controls."  We provide one example of how to do
this, which shows an explicit association.  Until we know that IE will
support implicit association (per Chuck's e-mail) we will leave out the
example for it.

2.  The first recommendation in section 3 (APPLETs and SCRIPTs) now says, "
Provide alternative presentations of content for each script and applet
that conveys information."  It used to say "conveys *important*
information."  The word "important" was dropped because we want to direct
people to use the content of the APPLET element rather than the "alt"
attribute.  

3.  Because of the change to the first item in section 3, the rating for
the recommendation about alternative text for APPLETs was changed from
"Required" to "Recommended."  We included a note that points back to the
first item as the recommended method for providing alternative text for an
APPLET since it is backwards compatible.

4.  Several minor grammatical and syntactical changes were also made.
