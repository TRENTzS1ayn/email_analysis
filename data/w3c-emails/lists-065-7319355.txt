I think it may be appropriate to extend 
appendix B to "how to insert images and 
 provide a text alternative". This is because 
images can be inserted in different ways: IMG, OBJECT,
and stylesheets, and the choice is not trivial.

I propose as a very first draft:

* Navigation bars.

1. Attempt to use separate images for links rather than image maps.
2. the alt of an IMG serving as a link, the content of an OBJECT, 
or the alt of AREA should be 
as if you were writing a text navigation bar.

* decorative images:

1. If possible, use stylesheets. background properties
in CSS allow to place an image without tiling it. This may be used for 
inserting a decorative image that appears on all pages of a website 
in some corner.

2. If stylesheets cannot be used, use IMG with a null alt text.

* list item bullets of unordered lists:
1. 
Markup the bullet list with UL and LI.
Use the list-style property in CSS. you may insert different bullets
in a list by using classes.

2. "deprecated" method:
  markup the list as a definition list DL and the items as DD. use IMG to insert the 
graphical bullet. use alt="Item:"
Note: This method may not render optimally in all media. E.g., a self voicing 
browser may generate the statement "item description" before each 
item, in addition to speaking the alt text.
To avoid this kind of problems use method 1 above.

* horizontal rules:
1.Use the HR element. Use background properties of CSS. Provide text with 
the title attribute of the HR.

2. Use OBJECT with HR as its content:
 <OBJECT data="rule.gif" type="image/gif"><HR title="End of example"></OBJECT>

3. "deprecated" method: Use: IMG. write alt text in the same way you would have 
written a title for HR.

Note: current browsers may have some bugs with 1 and 2 above, but these 
methods are preferable for the long run, since the rule is 
markuped correctly with HR.

* Images that convey important and vital info.
If the site consists mainly of images, e.g., a photograph collection,
use IMG with alt for short description and longdesc for a full description.

If it is an ocasional image such as a chart, you may do as above 
or use OBJECT with the content as the full description. In this case short 
description is not needed (or use title ?). 


* Large first letters in a paragraph etc.: 
1. Use style sheets.
2. Deprecated: use IMG with the letter being the alt text. 

* creating white space:
1.Use stylesheets whenever possible. 
2. Deprecated method: 
Use spacer images. Use IMG with null alt, alt="" or alt="&nbsp;", 
depending whether extra space is needed when rendered without images.
However, *never* break a word with spaces or spacer images, 
here styleshetts are required.

Note:  I think that the HTML4.0 spec recommends not to use 
empty alt, i.e. alt=" ".
In http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#h-6.2 we find:

"User agents may ignore leading and trailing white space
 in CDATA attribute values (e.g., "???myval???" may be 
 interpreted as "myval"). Authors should not declare 
 attribute values with leading or trailing white space."
