ASG::

I have difficulty understanding the "required" rating of these
three.

The first one is too broad to be all required.  Suppose someone
uses HTML 3.0 <UL PLAIN>.  Who is going to find that page
inaccessible as a result?  Yes, we want to _recommend_ that
people use the W3C Recommendation for HTML.  But it is hard to
defend the choice of HTML 4 specifically as a make-or-break
threshold.

Having headers skip levels, or building a single element list, is
not necessarily improper, at least as I see it.  Calling this
improper is taking a somewhat narrow view of document structure.
Rating these rules as "required" says that if these rules are
broken, somebody's ability to access the page _will be broken_.
Can we really make that argument in this case?
