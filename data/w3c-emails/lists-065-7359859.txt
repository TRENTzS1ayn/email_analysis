Is it possible to make rule 2 unnecessary by satisfying rule 3?

Rule 6 sounds like another exception.  Videos that are "a drop
cap doing the macarena" and function as punctuation within the
overall story line can get by with terse, static text
replacements, perhaps.  One has to apply some "grain of salt" to
these rules similar to how one tests to see if a long description
is really required for a graphic or image.

Authors may be confused as to what they really need to do by the
way this is presently broken down.
