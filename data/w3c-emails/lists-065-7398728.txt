3.1. Provide alternative text for each script.

Couple of points here from some of the Bobby feedback
we're getting:

1. Many scripts do things like "mouseover" handling and
really have no need for a NOSCRIPT section. In this case
we should make mention of including an empty NOSCRIPT.
I think this is preferable to not including a NOSCRIPT
under some occasions just as ALT="" is a way to include
empty image alternative text.

2. The guideline does not apply to scripts which are
specified in the HEAD section of an HTML document. Such
alternative content will never be displayed and as such
has no purpose.
