Note that the April 14 draft has the following instead:

3.1. Provide alternative presentations of content for each script and
applet that conveys information.

I would say that most scripts have no need for a NOSCRIPT element.
NOSCRIPT can only be useful with scripts that generate content; most
scripts provide dynamic interactivity (changing images, validating forms,
and so on) without creating content.  The April 14 draft seems to recognize
and account for this.

ALT="" is a hack to avoid Lynx's "[INLINE]", but it's a necessary hack
because so many unaware authors avoid using ALT when it's needed.  (And of
course ALT is now required in HTML 4.0.)  I'd like to avoid the same
problem with NOSCRIPT; the element is rarely needed (unlike ALT), so I
think we should trust authors to use it where necessary.

Note also that SCRIPT is an inline element while NOSCRIPT is block-level.
This means that NOSCRIPT cannot always be used with a SCRIPT element.  (If
Netscape had decided on <SCRIPT>...<ALT>Alternate content</ALT></SCRIPT>,
this and many other problems would be solved.)
