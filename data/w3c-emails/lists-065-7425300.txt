I'd say Interim are always recommended, and can't be required.

That's one way of looking at TABLE accessibility: if you ignore the
TABLE tags, and just present the content in the order it appears in
the markup, does it make sense ? The w3.org home page uses a TABLE for
presentation, and at some point, I know our webmaster reorganized the
cells so that the logical reading order would be fine using lynx
(which just ignore the table markup and use the content).

So they are Interim, since in the future, UA should be able to
comprehend them.

Interim/Recommended is fine.
