I am not sure adding the D-Link to an image with a LONGDESC will be
accepted by designers.  When this was brought up before it was shot down as
being unacceptable to WWW authors who would not like to see D on or around
their images.  I think that LONGDESCs should be more like ALT text.  A user
setable option would turn long descriptions on and it would appear as
inserted HTML in the document.

Using the DOM the assistive technology could always automatically access
the LONGDESC and do what ever the assistive technology vendor wants to do
with it.
