JRG: Right, but the description information in the BODY of the URL could be
inserted into the document.  Just like the data in an image file URL is
formed into a picture and inserted into the document.

JRG: In some cases, like especially learning disabilities, I think having
the image and the LONGDESC information on one page is desirable.  If the
only way to access LONGDESC information was to open a new document, there
would be less integration of the information.

JRG: I don't think this should be too much of a problem.  HTML is suppose
to be display independent (grin) and if somebody turns on a feature to
access long description information, they will be expecting some type of
accessibility problem.

JRG: My main concern, as stated before, having the LONGDESC information and
the original IMAGE displayed simultaneously is useful to some people with
learning disabilities and TBI's.  The D-Link solution provides a level of
backward compatibility which is good for incouraging the inclusion of
D-Links now.  In reality the LONGDESC will probably be used in situations
where the author is less concerned about visual formatting and so the
display of the D-Link will not be visually disruptive. For example images
used in highly formatted menus only need ALT text to convey the links, but
a graph of information that could benefit froma LONGDESC is probably not
going to be part of a high formatted structure.

Do we need to have two ways (or other ways) of rendering LONGDESC
information. 
1. Put in a D-Link if the user selects a browser option that they want to
view LONGDESC information.
2. Insert LONGDESC information into the current document so that the
LONGDESC information could be viewed simultaneously with the image it
describes.

What do people think?
