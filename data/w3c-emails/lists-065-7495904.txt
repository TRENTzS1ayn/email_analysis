How about a guideline in the first section, Style and Structure that 
incorporates the last guideline of the Images and Image map section that
currently reads:

Recommended
  Avoid ASCII art. Replace it with an image and alternative text.
Common typographic characters or constructions to be avoided are emoticons
and arrows consisting of dashes and greater than signs (e.g., -->), etc. 

to say something like, 

Recommended
  Avoid ASCII art and non-letter characters within words. 
*  Replace ASCII art with an image and alternative text. 
* Replace common typographic characters or constructionswith appropriate
language.  For example,  <wink> for the emoticon ;-), "therefore" for
arrows consisting of dashes and greater than signs (e.g., -->), and "great"
for "gr8." 
* Remove spaces within titles (e.g., O U R  C A F E);  use style sheets to
control letter spacing.

This is recommended because the current recommendation regarding ASCII art
is recommended.
Should the rating be reevaluated if we include new information?  Do these
things make a page unusable
for a person with a disability?  Is it appropriate to lump all of these
together or should they be separate guidelines?
