There are valid (HTML and CSS -wise) methods of producing 
blinking and scrolling text that the guidelines 
do not refer to their accessibility features:

1. Using animated GIF images.
Seems accessible to non visual media as the alt 
text is static. 

2. Using CSS with the property 
 {text-decoration: blink}

Seems accessible, assuming that users of 
screen readers do not use the stylesheet defined for screen
medium, but the one for aural (if available).
