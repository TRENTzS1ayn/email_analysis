Reference number 6 in the WAI authoring 
guidelines "Any browser table" is somewhat 
misleading.

It recommends to use invalid structure
in order to achieve backward compatibility
with non-table browsers.

The article does not note that the structure is invalid,
and  claims that the method works for all browsers. 

In my view browsers are expected to be 
more sensitive to structural problems with 
the implementation of stylesheets and XML.

On the other hand, article number 29 (Flavell) also discusses
invalid markup, but has the appropriate warnings
and thus is not misleading in any way.
