To: WAI Markup Guidelines<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>


The guidelines should definitely not recommend the use of NBSP or any
other non-standard technique for achieving particular visual effects in
user agents that have inadequate support for HTML table markup. It is the
responsibility of the user agent to provide proper support for HTML
constructs, not that of the author to compensate for the idiosyncrasies of
implementations that fail to meet the standards set forth in W3C
recommendations.

By all means, include a recommendation in the WAI user agent guidelines
regarding the support that should be provided for tables, but the page
author guidelines should not be misused as a vehicle for overcoming the
shortcomings of browsers that fail to support standard markup conventions,
such as tables, which have been included in HTML for some time.
