In response to Wendy's question, I think the suggestions referring to
ASCII art can be given as a single guideline; the avoidance of spaces and
non-alphanumeric characters within words deserves the status of a separate
guideline. It should be categorised as "recommended", given the strict
definition of "required" which is in place.
