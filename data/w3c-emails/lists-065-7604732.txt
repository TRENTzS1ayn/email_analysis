The markup used to move the user from 
page to page against his will is actually valid.

It it done by the META element with  http-equiv="refresh"
and the content attribute defines a delay time and a URL.

The syntax is valid, but the spec. does not require User agents to support
it, and if they do it doesn't tell how. (it is mentioned in the chapter 
about HEAD and meta data.)

Its a good idea to discourage authors from using it. It is terribly anoying
and confusing even for a sighted user, not to mention a user of non visual
medium.

The guidelines may propose to authors to use server redirect 
if needed, or to write a regular link referring to the new URL.

Since many authors have unfortuntely pages that are _blank_ 
beyond the "refresh" itself, browsers will continue to support it.
Browser guidelines may recommend to allow the user to disable the feature
altogether (like in Opera) or to configure the browser to display it as a 
normal link (even better, to avoid a blank page).
