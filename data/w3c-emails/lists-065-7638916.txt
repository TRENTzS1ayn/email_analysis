In answer to Gregg's question, I believe the timed change of pages is
supposed to happen whenever a document bearing this markup is loaded. Do
today's browsers offer a means of deactivating this feature? If not, then
I would suggest (1) that the page authoring guidelines discourage its use; 
and (2) that the issue be drawn to the attention of the user agent
guidelines group.
