Responding to Charles Oppermann's comment, the feature here being
considered does not actually refresh the page. It moves the reader from
one page to another. In relation more generally to refreshing, the user
agent should provide an option to freeze any changes so that the text can
be read without the confusion that may be created by dynamic
modifications.
