Nir:
Some browsers (e.g. Netscape) that support the refresh feature
do exactly as you say. If you are refreshed from page A to be
with 2 seconds delay, in order to move back from B to the page 
_before_ A the user has to hit the back key 
twice very quickly as otherwise he'll be refreshed again to page B.
In netscape the user can't read page A for more than 2 seconds.

Other browsers (e.g., Opera in "refresh enable mode") will bring the user 
from page B directly to the page before A, if the user hits the back key
once.
So the user can't return to page A altogether. (at least in no evident way)

Both implementations have their disadvantages. So there is room for 
browser guidelines here.
