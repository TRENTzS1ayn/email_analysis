Here is a good example of something we discussed during the
LA meeting-- namely, sites refusing access unless you had 
specific browser features.

CNN now provides live realaudio coverage 
--a good example of something you can hear --rather than
see!

However, their interface is javascript based, and they
refuse to let you in if you dont have a JavaScript enabled
browser.
What's worse, going there with a Javascript enabled browser
wont do you too much good either if you're blind.
