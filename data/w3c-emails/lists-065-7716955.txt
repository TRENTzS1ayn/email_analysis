[Required]
If an author chooses to use PRE and Ascii Art instead of more
expensive (size) image file in graphic format, it is required to
  - provide an indication of the beginning and the end the inline graphic
    [Interim] for screen reader users, make sure you announce the
        beginning and the end of graphic portion using a text "marker"
        understandable by the user reading the page, so that she or he
        can skip this portion. 
    [New] for markup aware browser, use <PRE class=graphics> (and </PRE>
        will end the graphic normally)
  - attach both a short description (figure caption) and, if the
    graphic presents important information, a long description using a
    class d-link Anchor.

One way to do the interim job while keeping the original look is to
use CSS display=none on some marked SPAN:

in STYLE section at the beginning of the HTML:

  .ascii-art-marker { display:none }

then

<SPAN class=ascii-art-marker>Ascii-art (ending with Figure caption)</SPAN>
<PRE class=graphic>
