Another approach would be to update the log of changes, although this
would involve more work for the editors, who are already very busy.
Perhaps a compromise would be, when announcing new draft of the
guidelines, to include in the message sent to the list an indication of
the major changes which have been made since the previous version. These
could perhaps also be included in the changes log. Minor corrections would
not need to be noted in this way.
