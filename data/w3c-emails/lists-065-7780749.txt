Before each release of a CSS2 (or HTML4) specification, I:

a) Compile a list of changes since the previous version by
   reviewing the CVS logs. Not all the information in the CVS
   logs is appropriate for distribution (e.g., it's boring or
editorial),
   so some filtering by the editors is useful.

b) Attach the list of changes to the announcement of the release of
   the spec. 

What I should do, but don't is make each list of changes available
from the Working Group's home page (or some other suitable location).
People have to hunt through mail archives to find the changes, which
they shouldn't have to do.

I would rather keep the list of changes between drafts separate
from the document than including them in an appendix, for example.
