I like Ian's approach to the problem. There are already two changes logs
associated with the GL home page, one of which provides a detailed list,
whereas the other is more of a summary. It these logs can be maintained,
then it should be relatively easy to prepare a brief statement of changes
that could be distributed via the list with each release of the document.
