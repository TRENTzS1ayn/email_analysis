There is another feature to toss in - the LONGDESC or D-link.

In order to provide for good accessibility it is necessary to take 
account of what browsers (user agents) are in use, as well as what we 
hope will happen.

LONGDESC, and I think TITLE, are relatively new. ALT, and the various 
methods of including a D-link, are available in almost everything.

Therefore it seems that ALT and D-links should be used in combination to 
provide both the functional information service Liam is describing and 
the 'thickly described' pages asked for by others (I would be one of 
those others)

The additional use of TITLE for a bit more information, which can be 
requested, LONGDESC as a future-proofing strategy to improve the 
aesthetics of d-linking, and ultimately OBJECT, provides us with further 
tools to enhance this seemingly dichotomous goal.
