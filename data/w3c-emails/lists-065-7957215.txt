Hello,

Yes, our site should be considered a role model.

We are currently working on a new version of the guidelines and we just ran
it through both versions of Bobby.  Here are the results:

We have corrected three of the four accessibility errors detected by Bobby
2.01.  The error we have not corrected is associating Labels with Form
Controls.  This recommendation has  been changed in our latest version of
the guidelines and the Bobby folks are waiting until a stable version of
the guidelines exist before updating Bobby.  We hope to pass it then.

We receive four stars from Bobby 2.0.  There are many errors that come from
our use of new HTML 4.0 attributes and elements. These [elements and
attributes] will be ignored by older browsers and have no detrimental
effect on the usability or accessibility.

The final version of the document will also validate against the strict
HTML 4.0 DTD.

Expect to see this new release in the next few weeks.

Thanks for keeping us on our toes,
The Editors
