Nir,

Thank you for your suggestions for Section B.

Your first message discusses bullets ("Lists examples in Section B").
We hope you had a chance to check out our test page and find the results
interesting (we did! <smile>).  The section on bullets has been reworked to
closely follow what you suggested.

Your second message contains a lot of information ("More on appendix B").
At this time, we think it is too soon to strongly advocate the use of
OBJECT and style sheets for positioning.  As far as we can tell, neither
MSIE 4.x nor NSC4.x support OBJECT (see
http://trace.ie.wisc.edu/kaboodle/html/tests/objecttest.html ).  While the
first two OBJECTS refer to image map gifs that don't exist, the third
OBJECT tries to insert a simple gif (a blue bullet) that does exist.   We
get the alternative text content on both platforms.  Also,  The Style
Sheets Reference Guide lists very few positioning properties in their
"safe" list ( http://www.webreview.com/guides/style/safegrid.html ) 

We think once the support exists, we will be able to merge appendix B back
into the rest of the document - as we more strongly urge people to use
OBJECT and style sheets. 

However, we incorporated several statements you had written that patched up
holes, such as horizontal rules and drop caps.

Thanks,
The Editors
