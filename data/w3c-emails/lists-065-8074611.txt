I think you might want to take a look at RFC1980 (Aug 1996), where
this type of client side image map was officially launched.

There you would find the ALT attribute documented (though admittedly
it was declared to be optional in that RFC).  So, I would say that
AREA has had an ALT attribute as long as it has officially existed.
