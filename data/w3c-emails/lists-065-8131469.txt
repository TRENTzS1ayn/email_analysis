In regards to your comment about recommending obsolete solutions. 
This is not what I'm advocating. I am advocating creating a database 
of individual guidelines marked with extra information regarding the
browsers and assistive technologies for which they are relevant. These
guidelines can then be compiled by a simple program into a different
collections that suit our varying needs. One compilation could
be what we we now consider the WAI authoring working draft, but
another collection would be the WAI working draft plus those
guidelines that are necessary for making pages accessible on
current versions of IE 4.0, Netscape 4.0, and the major screen
readers. Such an approach provides a definitive notion of
accessibility that takes into account the past, present, and future
of the guidelines while denying the idea of a single measure of
accessibility.
