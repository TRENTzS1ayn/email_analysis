Josh's suggested data base might be useful under some circumstances,
though it should not be part of the guidelines proper and would require
constant updating. I do not think there is need for pessimism at this
stage concerning the proper implementation of HTML 4.0 and CSS, since
by supporting these standards, W3C member organisations have made a
committed to complying with them. Furthermore, the motivation for doing so
will be increased by the normative value of the WAI user agent guidelines.
This kind of discussion would be more appropriate for the IG list,
however.
