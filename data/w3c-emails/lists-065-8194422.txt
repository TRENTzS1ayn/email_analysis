I recently moved cross-country, changed jobs, got a new house, etc - so
please forgive me if this came up already.  I'm trying to jump back into
the thick of things as life is settled back out again.

What is wrong with the RFC style terms?  They've been in use for years and
seem very clear to me:
MUST
SHOULD
MAY
SHOULD NOT
MUST NOT

MUST - you have to do it.
SHOULD - it is strongly recommend that these be done.
MAY - these items may or may not be done, not considered very important.
SHOULD NOT - it is strongly recommended that these NOT be done.
MUST NOT - you CANNOT do these.

If you meet all MUST and MUST NOTs you are 'conditionally compliant'.
If you meet all MUST, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, and MUST NOTs you are 'fully
compliant'.

Frankly to me, paramount is wishy-washy.  No where need the impact as
'required'. or 'must'.  As A developer it wouldn't mean much to me.
