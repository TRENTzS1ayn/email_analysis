Further to Josh's comment, why should the textual alternative be included
in the TITLE attribute of OBJECT? If I remember the HTML 4.0 specification
correctly, an empty OBJECT element (one that contains no content) is not
permitted. Thus, the guideline should state that the alternative text
belongs in the content of OBJECT, and that authors may wish to include a
brief label for the resource in the TITLE attribute. Some user agents may
simply present the title, and leave it to the user's discretion to decide
whether to read the more detailed text which is included in the content of
OBJECT.
