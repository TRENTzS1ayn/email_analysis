LQ::  It shouldn't.  The TITLE gives a title for the OBJECT, just as TITLE
does with any other element.  Alternative text is not a title.

LQ::  OBJECT can have no content, as in the following example:

<OBJECT DATA="fluff.gif" TITLE="Pure, unadulterated fluff">
</OBJECT>

A content-free OBJECT would be appropriate when embedding a purely
decorative object--there is no alternative content because the object is
not content.

LQ::  Agreed.
