Java is not the major issue with moving or blinking objects - it's with
<MARQUEE> and <BLINK> tags.

On the Java side - screen readers running Active Accessibility already have
object model access to <MARQUEE> and <BLINK> and to Java applets running
with Microsoft's Virtual Machine.  Current screen readers like Window-Eyes
2.1 and WinVision 97, to name a few,  already take advantage of this.

This should be an INTERIM guideline as hopefully at some not too
distant time in the future ATs will be able to interrogate 
Java applets and a browser's document object model.

Like the comment regarding the MARQUEE element, the IE 3.0/4.0 
element BGSOUND is not a supported element in HTML 4.0. This should
be mentioned.
