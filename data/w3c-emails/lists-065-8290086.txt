> 1.8. Avoid the use of deprecated presentation elements and attributes (as well as B and I).
>      Authors should use style sheets instead of presentation elements (TT, and FONT) and attributes ("align" and "background") that control visual
>      presentation. Authors are encouraged to use elements (such as STRONG, EM, H1, H2, ABBR, etc.) that add structure to documents.   Documents
>      that use style sheets for presentation allow users to adjust the look of the document (e.g., larger print, color contrast, etc.) through personal style
>      sheets or browser settings. 

First, the HTML 4.0 elements that have been deprecated should be listed.
They are:
APPLET, BASEFONT, CENTER, DIR, FONT, ISINDEX, MENU, S, STRIKE, and U.

Second, this guideline as a whole should be a little softer. It suggests
that deprecated 
presentation elements should be avoided entirely. A safer bet might be
to use deprecated
elements along with newer style-sheet based approaches in order to
maintain backward
compatability while still providing for the future.

Third, the suggestion to avoid using the ALIGN and BACKGROUND attributes
is also a little
extreme and similar in spirit to the second point above. If some version
of this point
gets included, the list of affected elements should also be mentioned.
