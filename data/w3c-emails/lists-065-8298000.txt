Hello,

During the WAI UA teleconf today, Daniel Dardailler and I 
came up with an appealing solution to the problem of
labeling D-links so that UAs could identify them with
some assurance of success.

The (HTML) solution involves the "rel" attribute, which
is defined for the A and LINK elements. The "rel" attribute
(see section 6.12 "Link types" of [1]) describes the "type"
of a link. The HTML specification gives a list of currently
used values for this attribute (e.g., "stylesheet", "next", 
"index", etc.) and describes their intended meanings. 
The list given in [1] was designed to be extensible,
and the WAI page authoring guidelines [2]
seems like a great place to add the value "dlink" (or
"description")

 - Ian
