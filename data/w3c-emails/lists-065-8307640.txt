I see a certain problem with using rel to identify D-links.

The rel attribute in A and LINK defines a relation between the 
document and the linked document. thus rel="description" would mean
that the linked resource is a descrption of the document, and not 
of any particular image or object.

longdesc is the modern D-link, look no further. 
Its only disadvantage is that it is not supported yet, 
but so is rel="description".
