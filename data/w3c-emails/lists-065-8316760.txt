I disagree with Josh's suggestion. The guidelines should remain consistent
with the HTML 4.0 specification, and with other W3C documents, by
discouraging all use of deprecated HTML features in favour of style
sheets, thereby emphasizing their transitional nature. After all, these
guidelines will be used as the basis of authoring tool design as well as
providing best practice recommendations for the designers of HTML
documents. However, the guideline which suggests the avoidance of
deprecated HTML features should be recommended, as it is not strictly
required for accessibility.
