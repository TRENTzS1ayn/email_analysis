The support for rel (or class) and longdesc go together, it's not
about replacing one with the other.

rel=description, or class=description, are meant to provide UA a way
to formally identify a dlink as such, so that when both a longdesc and 
a dlink A are provided by the author, the UA can get rid of one of
them.
