There is still the problem that the UA cannot tell 
to which image the link refers to. Assume you have two 
D-links in your document and five images. What does the UA do 
with that? How does it know to which images the links refer to?

The only usage that I can see is to have an option for the user to set
"hide D-links" or "show D-links", but then it can be done with longdesc.

The UA cannot decide on its own image by image whether to get rid of 
one of them (longdesc or D-link) since it wouldn't know which D-link is 
related to which image.

Authors should not use both longdesc and D-link simultaneosly.
