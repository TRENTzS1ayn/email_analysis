Josh,

I have updated the scripts that we use to generate the document
to insert anchors for each guideline. Unfortunately, the script
does not number the anchors the same way the guidelines are
numbered (e.g., 3.7.1). Perhaps that would be an improvement
(although difficult, based on our current scripts). 

When the next draft is published, let me know what you think.
