misuses four presentation elements for the purpose of structure.  By using
presentation elements exclusively, the example fails to communicate the
importance of "Heading" to non-visual browsers while impeding navigation
since one cannot generate a summary of headings in the document.
Structurally, the preceding example could be marked up as follows:

<H1>Heading</H1>

along with a style sheet to give the presentation suggestions:

H1 {
  text-align: center;
  font-size: x-large;
  color: red;
  background: transparent;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-style: italic
}

There's a lot of debate on whether the HR element is presentational or
structural.  I view it as a presentation element that should not be
depended upon to communicate structural information.  Use of DIV or an
appropriate heading element (H1, H2, ...) can communicate the structural
intention (section divider) that authors often have when using HR.
