To me, the real question is "As author, am I trying to impart a particular
look and feel, or am I trying to structure my HTML-based documents?"  If
look and feel, use presentation elements like <B>, or better yet, use
CSS-equivalents.  If structure, use the appropriate structure tags.

CSS allows you to have the best of both worlds, applying a particular look
to your structural elements.  This is what Liam pointed out below.

To me, a structure element defines something about the document.  In short,
don't use <H6> just because the browser makes the text really small - use it
because you've used <H1> through <H5> and need another level of separation.
If you want small text, use the appropriate presentation tags/CSS
attributes.

misuses four presentation elements for the purpose of
structure.  By using
presentation elements exclusively, the example fails to
communicate the
importance of "Heading" to non-visual browsers while
impeding navigation
since one cannot generate a summary of headings in the
document.
Structurally, the preceding example could be marked up as
follows:

<H1>Heading</H1>

along with a style sheet to give the presentation
suggestions:

H1 {
  text-align: center;
  font-size: x-large;
  color: red;
  background: transparent;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-style: italic
}

There's a lot of debate on whether the HR element is
presentational or
structural.  I view it as a presentation element that should
not be
depended upon to communicate structural information.  Use of
DIV or an
appropriate heading element (H1, H2, ...) can communicate
the structural
intention (section divider) that authors often have when
using HR.
