With respect, I think you are confusing two different issues.
Both are "structures" in their respective ways: "misused" seems to
me to be over-stating the case against one of them.

For "convey the meaning of content" one might reasonably say "mark-up
the structure of the content", which is what is meant when one talks
about structural v. presentational elements in HTML.

Well, that's the structure of the HTML syntax, not the structure of
the information that's being marked-up.  Two very different things.

Then you go on to say:

I think this is a subtle detail, and there are other priorities than
spending much time on it, but I'm inclined to LQ's view on this.  The
DIV container seems a more appropriate way of denoting logical
sections of a document at a level higher than the paragraph; the HR
certainly may be used but, like the BR at a lower level, it only marks
a point in the document, rather than clearly indicating a structure.

I'm not saying "don't use HR" - how could I, I use it myself.  But if
you're intending to mark up a structure, then I'd suggest using a DIV
for that.

best regards
