Users will know the meaning of class name the same way they know the
meaning of 'none' in display:none: because W3C/WAI specifies it.

Yes, a typical conflict issue with public interfaces, no definitive
solution besides running central registry, which is not going to
happen at that point. One way to help is to add a prefix, ala
class='wai-dlink'.

There is a way, but I'm not sure we need this complexity: adding a
unique ID for the image and a variant of that for the D anchor.

<IMG SRC=foo.gif ALT=foo ID=img001 LONGDESC=foo.htm>
 <A HREF=foo.htm CLASS=wai-dlink ID=img001-dlink>D</A>

But I think given the fact that most D links will be "close" to their
image, and the fact that they already share the same hyperlink target
(in the LONGDESC and the HREF), that should be enough for a UA to
identify one.
