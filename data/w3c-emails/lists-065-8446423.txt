I agree that "structure" is used in two different meanings.

Thus, I should have said "somewhat confusing" rather 
than "misused".

It seems that when one talks on HTML, it would be less confusing 
if the word structure is used only as "document structure" in the 
SGML sense. The other meaning---"information structure"---may be 
conveyed with other words to reduce confusion.  

It seems to me that "information structure" 
does not cover the wide usage of the term "structural elements".
 
Using the term "structural element" for document division (DIV)
makes much more sense to me than using it for elements like CITE 
and EM whose content has a special meaning but no special structure.

In other words sections and subsections form an information 
hierarchy. 

CITE in a P or I in a P do not create an information 
hierarchy. They create a structure only in the document tree.
