David's remark quoted below raises the following fine point
of HTML usage.

As I understand it, it is more speech-friendly to say

<fragment option=A>
If you have technical difficulties, 
<A href="mailto:webmaster@this.site">send mail to the WebMaster</A>
at &lt;webmaster@this.site&gt;.
</fragment>

than the now-common practice of

<fragment option=B>
If you have technical difficulties, send
mail to the WebMaster
at <A href="mailto:webmaster@this.site">&lt;webmaster@this.site&gt;</A>.
</fragment>


I have had difficulty communicating this to people at times, so I
wanted to latch onto David's comment as evidence.

Maybe if we could sneak this idea in by the examples we use...

Using netscape with a screenreader (JFW), I found that when adreesing
the first url below that the links containing urls as text were not
descriptive when tabbing from link to link.  I like the explanations.  I
will investigate the tool.
Thanks!
