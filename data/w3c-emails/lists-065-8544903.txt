This is the strongest reason to use rel. The HTML 4.0 spec leaves
open the possibility to use any value, but a value is only interesting
when widely recognized. What's the best way to gain wide acceptance?
Bring the UA developers around the table and produce a W3C
Recommendation
that says "The value "dlink" means description link". 

What better way to expand the repertory of rel values?
