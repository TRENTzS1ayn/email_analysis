GL members

We would like to set up a conf call on a restructuring of the GL
guidelines.  In particular we are interested in discussing some
of the knottier issues around usability, use as an eval tool,
legacy guidelines vs future guidelines etc.

We have a limited number of phone in lines but would like to
include all who would like to participate actively in the
discussion.   We will be posting information to the GL list
before the call to get discussion going...  and then again after
the call to summarize the results.

The times we have available for the call are:

(all are Eastern Daylight Time)
[16:00 - 17:30, Wednesday, June 10, 1998]
[16:00 - 17:30, Thursday, June 11, 1998]
[16:00 - 17:30, Monday, June 15, 1998]  (though this last one may
not be possible)


These have been chosen to maximize the possibility of
participation by our overseas members.

Will those who are interested in participating please drop a note
to GV@trace.wisc.edu  letting me know the times you can make it.
I will follow up with contact information.   Please let us know
soonest so we can reserve the lines on the phone bridge.

Thanks much.
