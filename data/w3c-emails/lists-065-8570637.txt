Temporarily Able-Bodied (TAB)
The term Temporarily Able-Bodied (TAB) indicates that many people will
become disabled, either temporarily or permanently, at some point in their
lives.  A disability can be the result of injury, illness, age, or
circumstance.  Instances of temporary disabilities (not caused by injury or
illness) include:  working in a noisy environment, working in environments
where noise is not tolerated (e.g., libraries, work cubicles, and at home
when children are sleeping),  and instances when hands and eyes are busy
(e.g., driving a car).
