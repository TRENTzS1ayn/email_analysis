I was thinking about people who break their arm and can only typing or
point with one hand for a while.  Basically people who due to injury or
illness temporarily lose some capability, but may regain capability in the
future.  Your descriptions are also valid.  

I think what you wrote is pretty goos, maybe just add an example of a
broken arm.
Thanks,
Jon
