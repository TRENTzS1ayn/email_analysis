I am not sure we want to use the exact term "tab" in the doc. Although the
concept is correct, I see it as a pejoritive term used by us when talking
among ourselves.

something like this?

Temporarily Able-Bodied (TAB)
The term Temporarily Able-Bodied (TAB) indicates that many people will
become disabled, either temporarily or permanently, at some point in their
lives.  A disability can be the result of injury, illness, age, or
circumstance.  Instances of temporary disabilities (not caused by injury or
illness) include:  working in a noisy environment, working in environments
where noise is not tolerated (e.g., libraries, work cubicles, and at home
when children are sleeping),  and instances when hands and eyes are busy
(e.g., driving a car).
