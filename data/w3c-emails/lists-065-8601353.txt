I strongly agree with David.  The derivation & common usage of "TAB" is
generally regarded as pejorative and would be out of place in this
guidelines document.

The concept can much more affirmatively be expressed here by discussing the
concept of "Universal Design" -- design for the full range of functional
variation, be it disability-related or situational, also ensuring
compatibility with existing assistive technologies.
