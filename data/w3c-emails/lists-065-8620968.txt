I'm sorry if I used a wrong word (TAB) in my suggestion. I misunderstood it. The idea really was to talk in the document how many of the things that help disabled are also in many times beneficial to everybody in different usage environments. The goal was to give as much motivation to designers as possible to use these guidelines. So talking about universal design and explaining it in this way is just fine.

I agree with Judy. In the first place, I have never heard of TABs, and I
suspect that a high proportion of the world's literate population would be
in the same situation. Secondly, the guidelines would be better without
yet another, potentially confusing acronym. Finally, the concept of
"universal design", which can be easily explained, seems to encompass all
of the general principles and policy considerations which motivate this
group's work.
