I will shortly be posting the first of three docs we will sending
to the list to kick off discussions

The three are

1)  needs/uses and objectives of the guidelines
2)  problems
3)  ideas

The third one will actually be the first of a series which we
hope many people will post.

If you post a new idea for improving the guideline approach give
it a new name   (e.g.   IDEA - COMBINE ITEMS)
or some such so that we can follow different threads better.


Thanks much

Gregg
