It seems to me clear that rel is better than the class for a new standard. 

But as a new standard in this case we already have LONGDESC - the value of
dlinks is that they can be implemented for current browsers. When we all
have HTML4/CSS2 compliant browsers, nobody will need dlinks anyway. 

So while we are trying to write guidelines for people to provide the 
capactiy of an HTML4 browser to the current generation, and the 
guideline is effectively 'deprecated' in favour of LONGDESC already, 
it seems to me that people who want to provide invisible accessibility 
might as well use a class.
