For those who dont have excell 7 - I have enclosed herein an HTML
version of the table.

It is a somewhat strange table but i dont have any authoring
tools here on my laptop at home so this is an excel table pasted
into Word and then saved as HTML.  But you should be able to see
it with a browser.

If not, then there is always the unwrapped text version in the
last message.
