I think the idea of creating guidelines for Netscape 3.0 <EM>OR</EM> 
Opera 3.2 or something else is a bit antithetical to the whole WAI.

But the idea ofd a set of guidelines which can be dynamically interpreted 
is not a bad thing- especially for AT - for example it should be an AT 
thing not to have a BLINK or MARQUEE option available. In fact if UA's 
also failed to recognise the element then it would not be a problem any 
more.
