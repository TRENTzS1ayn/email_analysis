Nir is right about support for multiple languages. I recall being told 
things like LINK REL="alternate" LANG="XX" was how to specify full 
alternate pages, but I don't know whether it really works - when I tried 
it I couldn't win.

the Internationalisation thing ought to have a tie-in to WAI issues, 
perhaps particularly though the EO group as well as being included in the 
guidelines. But I have found ti difficult to make things work, and being 
an English speaker I have not often needed to - it seems simpler usually 
to exercise my rusty languages than my browser.
