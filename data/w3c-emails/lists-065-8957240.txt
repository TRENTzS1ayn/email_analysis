On several occasions I have mentioned, in this forum, the need for
multilingual texts to be marked up appropriately with the LANG attribute.
Unfortunately, this suggestion has not yet been included in the
guidelines, and I fail to understand why. It is essential for both braille
translation software and speech synthesizers that the language always be
clearly identified.
