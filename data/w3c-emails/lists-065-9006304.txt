Alan explained that the browser needed to send a message about languages 
to the server, which could then send the right language back to the browser.

As I understand it, the server needs to be configured to do this.

My problem is that a lot of stuff I do is on CD-ROM - it relies on the 
browser directly following the LINK. this works for stylesheets, and it 
would be good if it worked for alternate languages as well, so maybe it 
is a UA issue.

That would remove the problem for a user that they have to rely on an 
appropriate server set-up, as well as the problem with working on local 
files rather than http: web-sourced stuff.
