By now you should have received notice from Wendy Chisholm that the revised
Guideline Grouping Table has been posted and is available for review.  This
will be the primary topic of discussion during the conference call which
runs from 4:00 - 5:30  PM Eastern time tomorrow (Wednesday - except in
Australia and Japan where it is Thursday morning).  Gregg and Wendy have
done a lot of work on the table since last week's meeting and have
incorporated a number of the ideas that were suggested at that time.

We look forward to your participation.

Regards,
Chuck, Gregg and Wendy
