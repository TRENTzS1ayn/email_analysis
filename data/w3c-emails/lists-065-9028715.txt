I have a few suggestions about the latest idea. I have summarised 
excessively, since I think the rationales have been discussed fairly 
thoroughly. I don't think I have made major changes, but I have changed 
priorities a bit. The following summary is in order of priority.

Charles McCathieNevile

a page Must
1  use correct HTML / XML
(and should use CSS)

2 Ensure that all non-text information degrades gracefully to provide a
textual equivalent 
Relevant techniques include ALT, APPLET, D-links,
LONGDESC, NOFRAMES (and navigation design), NOSCRIPT, OBJECT, SMIL, 
TABLE, alternative version, email link / phone number / etc

A page almost must not use ASCII art, Frames with SRC="an.image.jpg", server-sided Imagemaps, 
table-based positioning. (BLINK/MARQUEE covered by 1 above)

A page SHOULD
A) use TITLES, ABBR, ACRONYM, LANG, TH, etc where appropriate
B) use comprehensible phrases rather than click-here
C) use contrasting colours

A stylesheet should use relative sizes and positioning where possible

Where Scripts, Applets, etc are required, see http://x.y.z for how to 
ensure that they are as accessible as possible
