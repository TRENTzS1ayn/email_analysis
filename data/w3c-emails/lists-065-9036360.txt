One of my goals in writing this tool was to try and
begin viewing the guidelines as something more than a flat
HTML file. There can be a great deal of data stored in
each guideline that can help us to harness our work in
creative ways. Maybe the interface I wrote obscures this. 
If so, I apologize.

In the limiting case, by choosing "HTML 4.0" and "All ATs" the
example would generate the current guidelines minus all interim issues.
So in fact, if we so desired, we could generated a static document
from a more general purpose mechanism for use as the formal WAI
recommendation while still keeping very specific information
about the ways in which each guideline is relevant.

What if a person wants to see all the guidelines that
are relevant to a hearing impaired audience first, or
have the guidelines alternatively ranked based on how easy
it is to fix them. All of these are needs which we currently
have and unless we try and conceive of the guidelines as
more than a flat document, I think we will
have a hard time meeting our more fundamental goal of
providing useful accessibility information to the
varying needs of different authors.
