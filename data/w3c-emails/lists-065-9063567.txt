That's a trivial example of how language affects the sighted, but it's
more important in other aspects, notably the display of Asian
ideographs.  In Unicode, the same code points, or numbers, are used
for the "Han unification" ideographs, regardless of whether the
character is Chinese, Japanese, or Korean.  The language is necessary
in order to display the correct picture.

So this is definitely an accessibility issue, but is by no means
restricted in its importance to access.  It's yet another curb cut.
