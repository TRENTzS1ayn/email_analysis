I, for one, am very impressed with the revised Guideline Grouping Table.   I
think you and Gregg have done a great job of synthesizing the comments of many
people and reducing the previously overwhelming and complicated presentations
to a useful tool.

I think the table can be easily translated into both Web-based and printable
products that will meet the needs of most (if not all) potential users that
the
group has identified. 

I am sure that some well focused discussions can resolve the challenges of
orphaned or contentious guidelines and techniques.

Regards,
Chuck Letourneau
