Hello,

I thought (briefly) about where ascii art falls in the guideline
tables. It occurs to me that saying "Separate Content from Presentation"
is at least cute and possibly interesting as a guideline.

So for example:

- You shouldn't &nbsp; to align columns (use markup and style sheets)
- You shouldn't use ascii art for images or lines (use real images)
- You shouldn't put spaces between letters to spread them out. (use
style sheets).

  - Ian
