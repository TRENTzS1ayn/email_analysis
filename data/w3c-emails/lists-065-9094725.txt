I am trying to understand more about how to use the SCOPE
and HEADERS attribute for labeling table cells. The
examples at the end of the authoring guidelines are for
very simple tables and I wonder about how these would
really apply to many of today's tables that are used
for layout. Is it even appropriate to use these attributes
for layout based pages considering this is against the ethos
of the working guidelines? I have to admit, I'm finding
these attributes confusing. 

In particular, I don't understand how to do labeling
when using: 1) nested tables, 2) column and/or row groups.
And I don't have a clear idea when I would really want
to use the HEADERS, the SCOPE, or the more general AXIS.
In many ways, the AXIS attribute seems less about
accessibility, and more about alternative views
of the data.

I'm wondering if anyone has prepared a more comprehensive
set of examples using these attributes, or if anyone has
implemented a simple text-based table browser that is designed
to help work with these issues.
