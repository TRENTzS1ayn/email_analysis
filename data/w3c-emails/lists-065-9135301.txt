My personal experience has been that there is a number of web-based forms
which I need to use often. It is slow and tedious to have to move the
cursor to each item in such a form. I would much prefer to be able to use
access keys as a means of quickly selecting the desired fields. Since I
use the same forms repeatedly, it would not take long to learn which keys
were associated with the various controls. The result would be a much
quicker and more satisfying approach to form completion tasks.

It has been my observation, from using both braille displays and speech
synthesizers to access computers, that it is usually desirable to reduce
as far as possible the amount of time which is spent reading menu items
and lists of options, especially in applications with which one is
familiar. An interface which requires the user to navigate through a list
of items and select one or more of them, is very easy to work with at
first, but quickly becomes frustrating as one's knowledge and experience
with the software develops. This is the primary reason why access keys are
so important for those who are relying on braille or speech output.
