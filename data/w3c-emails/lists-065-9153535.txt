A summary of my ideas. These refer to the proposal which was discussed at 
the last teleconference, at 
http://trace.ie.wisc.edu/wai/guidelinestxt.htm (text version) or 
http://trace.ie.wisc.edu/wai/guidelines.htm (tables version). (Some of 
this is just thinking out loud. In general the guidleines seem to be 
moving in a very positive direction)

Have the linearised version as the standard version, and include a table 
of contents.

Have the top-level headers numbered, and the second-level identified by 
letter, e.g. 2 b or 5 c - this makes life easier when trying to identify 
a section under discussion. In particular, don't use Roman numerals.

Create several new sections: 0 (the so-called section J) which requires 
adherence to a published DTD - HTML, XML, CSS, etc, and recommends 
seperation of form/content

From the General Recommendations section, make Items 2 and 3 (providing 
alternative methods of obtaining information, such as email, phone 
number, etc, a single section. Alternatively, make them techniques under 
current sections 1 and 2 - making information, and interactive components 
independent of hardware. Question on this: how does accesskey work with 
non-keyboard based browsers?

Section 1 item 5 - frames with SRC=image have no metadata available, 
belongs in section 3 - Complex constructions need metadata

In Section 3 there is a note about how complex a framset needs to be to 
have metadata. I think if there are two frames there should be an 
appropriate amount of information for both...

Section 4 part 1 - objects should fail gracefully is really a guiding 
principal, except we wasnt to make it clear that simply failing 
gracefully does not provide accessibility to the information they contain.

Perhaps the section 4 - general, is the place for recommending link 
phrases rather than click me, and I would also include recommending 
against absolute font sizes and absolute positioning. The two are related 
as layout techniques.

ASCII art: what about recommending the following:
<STYLE TYPE="text/css">
<!--
@media screen { .ascii-alt { display: none } }
@media aural  { .ascii-art { volume: 0 } }
-->
</STLYE>
<P CLASS="ascii-art"><PRE>
 X X  X X  X X
  X    X    X
 X X  X X  X X
</PRE></P>
<P CLASS="ascii-alt">Big kisses</P>

(How does that work for you, Jason. In case it doesn't, there are three 
large X shapes, each made up of 5 "X"s laid out as ASCII art.

Those are all the thoughts I can remember
