I would add that users of Windows and some other operating systems are used
to finding access keys on nearly all dialogs and forms. Keyboard-centric
users find they save time and effort, and this is even more important for
users who have difficulty typing. We consider it a critical goal that
applications and forms written in HTML be no less accessible than those
written with other technologies.

Another suggestion might be that UA provide an option to visually indicate
the access key for any element, such as by appending a constructed string to
the end of the label or even inserting a textual label where there was none.
This would certainly alter the presentation and layout of the page, but no
worse than the ability to force all ALT= text to be displayed in place of
images regardless of the image's size.

The Microsoft Enable web site uses ACCESSKEY=Q to get to the
QuickLink list
box of choices.  A experienced user of the site can go in, press
ALT+Q,
arrow to the correct link and press Enter to get to it.  If using
Tab
navigation, they would have to wade through a long series of links.


Large forms will have difficulty with assigning unique identifiers.
ACCESSKEY comes in handy for HTML dialogs and smaller forms.  I
would say
that if your form is so large that you cannot come up with unique
ACCESSKEY's, then it's a usability problem and suggestion that the
page be
broken up.

> 8.9. Furnish keyboard shortcuts for form elements

This guideline's example places the ACCESSKEY attribute on the
LABEL associated with the form control. 

1. If this is the preferred method of doing this sort of 
thing, then why do all the form controls have ACCESSKEY 
attributes themselves?

2. <BUTTON> and <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON> don't have
labels associated with them and the ACCESSKEY should
be directly specified on these controls. 

3. I don't quite understand why we even have access keys
for forms at all. It seems to me that for any practical
web-based form it isn't really usefull not to mention
kind of crazy if the keys change on every web page.
On some forms, because of their size, using accesskeys
would be impossible. Does someone have a comprehensive 
vision of how this is supposed to be used?
