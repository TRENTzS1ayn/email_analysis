The stylesheet proposal for ASCII art of Charles McCathieNevile
has the problem that it relies on support for style sheets.
A user that does not use the authors stylesheet will get 
the ascii-art.

When someone thinks how to do something, always write the HTML 
under the assumption that there is no stylesheet.
Stylesheets only _improve_ presentation.

The only accessible way to include ascii art 
is to make it optional. (e.g., give a link indicating 
that the linked resource contains ascii art.)

(Also PRE cannot be included in a P, but this can be fixed)
