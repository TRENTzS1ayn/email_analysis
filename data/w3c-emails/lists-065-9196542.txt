The access key is especially needed when using 
browsers like IE that are broken with respect 
to what "next link" as per the tab key means--
for instance you can search through a page in IE, and then
hit tab,
and you will find that you wont necessarily jump to the link
closest to where you stoped searching.


you get better behavior purely because emacs does the right
thing with incremental search.On real browsers like Emacs/W3
