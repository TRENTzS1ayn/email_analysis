Hello,

We have incorporated the ideas from last week's conference call into the
latest document.  The latest table is at:

http://trace.ie.wisc.edu/wai/19980624.htm
The latest linear version is at:

http://trace.ie.wisc.edu/wai/19980624txt.htm

Notice that we have collapsed the table even further.  We are down to 21
items!!  

big changes:
1.  We filled in the rest of the rationales.
2.  The techniques are more descriptive and "english-like" (i.e. hopefully
less cryptic).
3.  Things that have been collapsed into other guidelines/techniques are
noted at the end.
4.  There is one place where the techniques have been split into two
groups, each with a different rating.  This might be a problem because it
applies the rating to the technique (whereas other places we apply the
rating to the guideline).  However, most other places the rating applies to
techniques and guidelines.
5.  After all of the discussion about the wording of A, we changed it again
since the way we had it read that "all information must have an alternative
representation" which is not correct.
6.  We've added lots of links in the doc, note that none of them work -
they're all just place-holders (except in the linear version - the table of
contents is fully functioning).
7.  We are using the rating scheme of the UA group.

The first draft of the techniques document is underway.

Have fun.  We look forward to comments.
