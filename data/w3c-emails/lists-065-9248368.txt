This is where you would find it...   but please don't use that
version except as reference for work on the new one.   We will be
posting a new draft to GL and it should be the one you are
looking at for comments, eval etc.

Thanks much

Gregg

Hello,

I have added a link to the text only version off of the GL home
page.
Directly, you can find the text-only version at
