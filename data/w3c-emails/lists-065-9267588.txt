(Maybe just some more pedantry)

This is not very systematic.

B 2 Use elements appropriately:
Suggestion:
As well as saying don't use H1 for large Bold text, we should tell people 
not to use B or even STRONG when what they mean is H1, H2 etc. 
Unfortunately this is still a <STRONG>very</STRONG> common technique.


C 1 Ensure that pages fail gracefully, technique 3, How Style Sheets Fail 
Gracefully 
Suggestion:
Style Sheets, properly written, fail gracefully almost automatically. 
About the only problems I can see are absolute sizing/positioning, which 
takes no account of visual UAs with small display area (or large display 
area)

D 2 Provide titles for various Objects.
Suggestion:
we include titles for links.

D 5 For complex tables, provide summaries etc
Suggestion:
We should offer some guidance as to what is a complex table. This is a 
bit of a can of worms. As with my comments on frames, I think most tables 
can be grouped in this category.
Suggestion:
Recommend tables not be nested inside each other. I don't know if this 
belongs here, in a general recommendations, a list of don'ts or somewhere 
else.

E 1. Create link phrases etc
Suggested:
Users who access a page aurally (for example users with blindness etc)
Rationale:
The list doesn't cover all users, and probably never will. If we are 
going to use example users, we should point out the breadth of audiences 
who are disadvantaged, including those with poor infrastructure, those 
with poor equipment, those with blindness, deafness, etc.
(This applies in a couple of other places, most notably to do with alt 
text and equivalents)

That's about all I can find to pick on, and the rest seems to keep 
improving. Keep up the good work.
