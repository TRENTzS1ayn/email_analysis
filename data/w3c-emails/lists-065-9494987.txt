Al::
As I read these two snippets, they say different things.  So the
second doesn't explain what the first meant.

Al:: 
The way I read that injunction it says that the anchor, the
sensitive text, should appear at or near the start of the text
content of the LI element.

By the way, this is a mixed blessing.  It is good for Braille
users and users of screen enlargers.  Sighted people like it
because the array of clickables falls in a neat, easily mouseable
stack on the screen.  But on the whole it has a negative effect
in speech, where it is better to reverse this and put the action
opportunity at the end of the explanation.  Gregory Rosmaita has
beat me up over this one regarding some pages we discussed.

But of course, that has been overtaken by events as far as the
current draft is concerned.

The current text sounds like the standard advice to start
paragraphs with topic sentences and sections with topic
paragraphs.  Good advice which can become critical under the
stress of adverse access conditions.
