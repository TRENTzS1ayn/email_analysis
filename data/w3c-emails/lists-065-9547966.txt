To: HTML Guidelines Working Group<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>


Section 9.1 of the HTML 4.0 specification is also relevant here, in as
much as it states that authors can not rely on user agents to render space
immediately following a start tag. Thus, even if guidelines recommended
insertion of a space after the IMG element, it might not be rendered by
some user agents. I think this issue should be sent (1) to the lynx
developers; and (2) to the UI guidelines working group. I would also like
to know whether any other user agents, for example the text-based browser
used under Emacs, have the same problem. If so, then their developers
should be alerted.
