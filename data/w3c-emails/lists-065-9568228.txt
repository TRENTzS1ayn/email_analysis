I tried creating an HTML document of my own that would reproduce the
problem, but with no success. A page with respect to which the problem
occurs is at http://www.vicnet.net.au/websites/

Perhaps those who have access to several different browsers could
investigate and report their findings. I still think this will turn out to
be a user interface issue, probably specific to lynx, in which case it
does not belong in the markup guidelines.
