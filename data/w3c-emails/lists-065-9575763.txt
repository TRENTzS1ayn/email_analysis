It's a really a presentation issue, best dealt with CSS and/or browser
presentation setting.

Logically, my markup is:

<IMG src=foo alt=foo>Text

In my page author CSS, I can add a margin between the foo image and Text.

Lynx, since it doesn't understand CSS, should offer a way for the user
to speficy a custom margin (e.g. a space).

So I'm not recommanding that browser automatically add it.
