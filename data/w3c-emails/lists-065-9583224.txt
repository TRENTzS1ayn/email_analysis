When I used LYNX v2.6 I got the following:

ArrowCommunity Groups
ArrowUser's Homepages
ArrowCommercial Web Sites
ArrowVirtual Domains
ArrowStorage Space
ArrowOn-line Databases
ArrowSearching Your Site   

The word "Arrow" was lined right up against the link text "Community Groups"
in the first example.

The HTML source was:
<a href="#community"><img width=13 height=8 src="/vicnet/arrow.gif" border=0
alt="Arrow"><b>Community</b> Groups</a><br>

On my own web site, http://nwlink.com/~chuckop/ I have this HTML:

<h1><img src="3dnew.gif" width="68" height="68" alt="What's New Logo"
align="middle">What's New</h1>

LYNX displays this as:

What's New Logo What's New

Note the space between the ALT text and regular text.  Maybe this has
something to do with the <b> tag in the first example?

I tried creating an HTML document of my own that would reproduce the
problem, but with no success. A page with respect to which the problem
occurs is at http://www.vicnet.net.au/websites/

Perhaps those who have access to several different browsers could
investigate and report their findings. I still think this will turn out to
be a user interface issue, probably specific to lynx, in which case it
does not belong in the markup guidelines.
