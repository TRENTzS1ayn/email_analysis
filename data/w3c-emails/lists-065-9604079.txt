The new year has arrived, and we celebrate that with the arrival of our
first deadline.  To make the most of some upcoming opportunities, the IPO
has asked us if we can produce a good draft of the Page Author guidelines
before the end of January.  Your co-chairs and co-editors (Chuck and Gregg,
and Gregg and Wendy, respectively) believe that, with everyone's help and
cooperation, we can meet that goal.

First of all, we are starting from the excellent base of the Checklist for
Page Authors, the Guidelines for Page Authors, and the Central Reference
Document for Web Accessibility.  The latest versions (dated January 20) are
available for review at the WAI site ( http://www.w3.org/GL/htmlgide.htm ).
 As well, we have posted a "Change Log" which details the many changes that
have been made to the documents, at your suggestions, over the past weeks.
The Change Log also lists outstanding issues for which we, the working
group, need to find solutions.  Please review this document.

We propose to begin discussions by starting focused threads from the Change
Log.  For some issues, we may post special Web pages showing examples or
summaries of previous discussions.  This should allow us to move quickly
through issues that have been discussed previously, but not resolved.

I have some suggestions for the upcoming discussions that may help us
reduce confusion and stay on track.

1.  Please keep your message to the specific topic being addressed in the
title of the thread.  Don't double up.  If you want to branch off, please
start a new, clearly titled thread.

2.  If you are referring to text or examples in a particular document,
please clearly refer to the document in question by its name: "the
Checklist", "the Guideline", "the Central Reference", "the Change Log", etc
and its date (if possible).

Finally, we are looking forward to your participation in this endeavour.

Sincerely,
Chuck Letourneau, Chair
Gregg Vanderheiden, Co-Chair and Editor
Wendy Chisholm, Editor
