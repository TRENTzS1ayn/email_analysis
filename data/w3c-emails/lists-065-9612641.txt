Some important content produces have asked Microsoft to remove the display
of ALT text while a page loads, saying that it clutters the visual
presentation of the screen.  They argue that the ALT text should only be
shown if the loading of images is turned off.  So far we have resisted 
doing
this.

GV::  You should (and probably already do) point out that it allows people 
with slow connections to read the links and use them instead of having to 
wait for the graphics to download before they can use the page.  (or are 
they afraid you wont see their banner ads)
