That's obvious, but the folks at http://www.idsoftware.com don't care about
slow connections because most folks are playing multiplayer Quake.

Slow connections, while a valid reason in the past, just aren't much of a
factor any more.

Some important content produces have asked Microsoft to remove the display
of ALT text while a page loads, saying that it clutters the visual

doing
this.

GV::  You should (and probably already do) point out that it allows people 
with slow connections to read the links and use them instead of having to 
wait for the graphics to download before they can use the page.  (or are 
they afraid you wont see their banner ads)
