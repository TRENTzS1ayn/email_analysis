I have just visited the GL page, following the recent announcement of the
updated guidelines, and noticed the following:

1. The GL home page has not been updated to provide links to the January
98 version of the various documents. This should be done so that a member
of the public who visits the GL page will be able to read the latest
drafts. In this respect it is noteworthy that the WAI home page, which is
publicly accessible, provides a link to the GL work area.

2. The January 98 documents still claim to be version 8 of the Trace
Centre guidelines. As Daniel pointed out late last year, the introductory
paragraphs should be changed to reflect the status of the documents as WAI
working drafts. In the acknowledgments, it should, however, be clearly
stated that this document is based on the Trace Centre's unified
accessibility guidelines, in order that the invaluable and continuing
contribution of the Trace Centre to their development be fully recognised.
