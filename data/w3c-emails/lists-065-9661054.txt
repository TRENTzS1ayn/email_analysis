As far as version is concerned, I think we need to target a version
1.0 for the Recommendation itself.

Working Draft are usually referenced by their release date, the
version doesn't change.
    
For the version released today, the ID should be 
WD-WAI-PAG-980123

For the upcoming Public Working Draft, I suggest a full title and an
ID as follow (supposing it's released on Jan 31st).

WD-WAI-PAG-980131

Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)
Page Author Guidelines - version 1.0
W3C Working Draft 31-Jan-1998

It should eventually resides in
   http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-WAI-PAG-980131

and later on in:
  http://www.w3.org/TR/PR-WAI-PAG1  (Proposed Recommendation)
and
  http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-WAI-PAG1 (Recommendation)


(Same thing with WAI-PACL for the check list)
