I'm not sure why these guidelines are called "Page Author"
guidelines instead of "HTML Author" guidelines. While
some of the guidelines might be useful for XML
or other languages, most are specific to HTML and the
term "page" doesn't capture that sufficiently.
For that reason, during my edits, I changed the
title to "HTML Author Guidelines".

(If this is an old topic, forgive me.)
