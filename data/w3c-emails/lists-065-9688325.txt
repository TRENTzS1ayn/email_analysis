HTML was not deemed ideal because it's also about CSS, XML as you say,
but overall, maybe we better call a cat a cat (is that an english
proverb as well ?) and I agree we can use the name HTML which has a
better marketing appeal.

HTML Authoring Guidelines sounds better, so that it's not confused
with guidelines for HTML designers (that is, the HTML WG). Too
far-fetched maybe ?
