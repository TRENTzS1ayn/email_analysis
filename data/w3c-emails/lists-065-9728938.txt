Hi --

If you pulled the document before 7:30 pm EST Friday January 23, please
pull it again, we needed to tweak a few links & intro.  Please just refresh
your local copy.  You can find it off of http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL

A reminder about the status of the document: this is a "_draft_ working
draft", please send your comments to w3c-wai-gl@w3.org, and it will still
be open for comment after it's an "official" working draft.

And thank you, WAI Mark-up Guidelines Working Group, and Gregg & Chuck &
Ian, for all the work on this.

Happy reading.

- Judy
