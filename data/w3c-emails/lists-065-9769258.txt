I personnally never saw a big advantage in that approach. The HTML
spec is rarely something people read from begining to end, so very few
people know its order. I actually read the HTML spec that way, but I
probably remember the chapter ordering because of the HAG document,
not the other way around.

Of course, this doesn't preclude linking from the HAG to the HTML
spec, but keeping them in synch isn't really helping here.

We need more "user" (author that is) review to decide.

I like it. How important this is will depend on how we define XML
accessibility wrt HTML.

In any case, I would keep the current organization unchanged for this
coming public draft, and revisit the issue later.
