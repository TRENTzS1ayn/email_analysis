I highly agree with this.  There are a lot of "accessibility" people adding
everything into the mix but there are little to no one talking about the
cost of actually implementing these recommendations.

I assume the HTML WG has large content producers advise the group.  The HTML
Guidelines group should have the same.

We need a sounding board for the viability of these recommendations and buy
in from the authoring community.

We need more "user" (author that is) review to decide.
