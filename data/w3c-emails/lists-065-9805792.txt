Some comments are attached below arising from our webmaster.
The theme of his message is that as well as the guidelines
saying
'what' needs doing, it would be helpful if advice were given on
'how'
an accessible site can be developed (or an inaccessible site 
updated to improve accessibility). This appears to be a
worthwhile
addition.

> 1 - It should emphasis that you CAN have a webpage that is accessable

> When producing a page there are many ways you can highlight
> information, for example using the OBJECT tag. If the accessable
> browser could read object tags then you can store information in cells
> or even "mark" cells in tables, the browser can then get a good idea
> of how the table is layed out and display it row by row or column by
> column depending on your data.

> <TABLE><TR><TD><OBJECT type = "r1c1a">Bob</OBJECT></TD><TD><OBJECT
> type = "r1c2b">Mark</OBJECT></TD></TR></TABLE> -

> Would display :

> Bob.
> 
> Mark. 
> 
> Not :
> 
> Bob  Mark.

a) They see it as a too small of a target audence to
worry about and 
b) There would be allot of duplication thus meaning more
work/money so they won't take it up.

> 2 - The guidelines are very "do A and B" but don't give you "do A and
> B by prosses C". I agree with every tag that is included but with no
> EXAMPLE methods of quick,simple or easy replacements then it is just
> another guide to writing accessable HTML on a webmasters selve. To
> remedy this I would suggest a new section entitled "Prosesses to
> implement accessability changes to an existing website", within the
> section I would place existing solutions to improve websites.

E.g.

> (sub heading) PERL

> The use of script languages are ideal, the examples in this section
> are produced using PERL. 
> 
> AUTOCHAN.PL
> AUTHOR: X
> 
> This will take a user specified directory read all the files and
> update the HTML within the files. It will only do this for HTM, HTML
> extensions.

> PERL SCRIPT.....
