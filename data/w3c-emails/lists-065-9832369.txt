To: HTML Guidelines Working Group<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>


A structure which divides the guidelines into sections according to
the relevant features of HTML would presumably make it easier for an
author to locate the appropriate parts of the document as required. This
purpose is achieved by the current parallel with the HTML specification.
Perhaps the checklist could be organised differently, for example by
grouping problems and solutions in order of their frequency of occurrence,
with the most common problems listed first. This strategy assumes that it
is possible to make such an estimate. Of course, one could always write
two or three index documents which group the guidelines in different ways.
