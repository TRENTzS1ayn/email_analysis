I think using HTML's CODE element inside the PRE element would be better 
than reliance on classes in this case since CODE gives the structural 
information to all early browsers.  Authors could use the CLASS attribute 
on CODE to indicate the kind of code, e.g., class="HTML" or class="Java".  
Speech browsers could then process common kinds of code more 
appropriately.
