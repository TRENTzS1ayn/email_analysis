Hi,

we are starting several threads to discuss the comments we have received
this week on the latest  (draft) working draft.  We want to come to closure
on these issues by Friday if we can to coincide with some other W3c stuff.  

upcoming topics:
changes in ratings and classification
technical errors or omissions
content additions
content corrections
Presentation and organization

thanks,
Chuck, Gregg, Wendy
