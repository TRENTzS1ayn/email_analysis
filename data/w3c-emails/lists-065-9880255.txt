Content Additions

Issue 1

Discussion: A "tips and tricks" note could be added to the discussion of
ALT text to assist authors in deciding what to write as a label or
description of the image. Perhaps a good test would be as follows: if you
were reading the document aloud over the telephone, what would you say upon
encountering this image to make the page comprehensible to the listener?
Aim for a functional and contextualized label or description rather than a
visual description. This suggestion is based on a comment made by Al Gilman
a number of months ago.

Action: No action taken at this time pending further discussion on
alt-text.

Issue 2

Discussion: "Good Web Site Design Practices" is very close to the name of
an existing document, "Good Site Design Practices," by Tobias C. Brown et
al, started in November, 1997, and posted regularly to
comp.infosystems.www.authoring.site-design. The two documents seem to
compliment each other. Maybe you would be interested in adding authoring
tips to spell check, copyright, and promote a site correctly. You can find
the history of this document at Deja News, on Usenet now in the
aforementioned group.

Action: Yes, a great document.  The suggestion and a few of the links
relating to validation and lynx type services were incorporated.  Have
included this in the reference section of the central document.

Issue 3

Discussion: "Status of this document" section. unfinished sentence: The
goal of the WAI-GL group is to ... I think it should point to the charter.

Action: The sentence now reads, "The goal of the WAI-GL group is discussed
in our charter." with "charter" acting as a link to the charter.

Issue 4

Discussion: Section 3. Applets and Scripts Say upfront that APPLET is
deprecated.

Action: Added a note.

Issue 5

Discussion: 

Comment 1:  Need more examples for AUDIO/VIDEO.  I understand this could go
in the Central Reference but as is, it is inconsistent with other section,
such as image, form, which are full of example. Either they all get
examples, or none of them do. I'm for putting at least a short example in
all sections (It's nice that they are all marked with a class=example, and
<CODE>) 

Question:  Do you want examples of transcripts or how to link to the
transcripts?  Most of these guidelines discuss creating separate documents
and would be hard to create HTML specific examples for.

Action: No action taken at this time.  Pending further discussion.

Issue 6

Discussion: 

Comment 1:  For the TABLE example appendix, I'd move it to the Central Ref
and keep a shorter version inline (no appendix here in other words, besides
the checklist)

Comment 2:  I think the examples are very important to keep within the
guidelines.  Particularly those that show the new HTML elements. 

Action: No action taken at this time pending further  discussion.

Issue 7

Discussion: 

Comment 1:  We need to talk about list that use image as bullet here, as it
is one of the most recurrent abuse of HTML structuring. I'm reposting my
examples:
First, the image is purely decorative and can be expressed solely in CSS. 
UL { list-style: url(button.png) }
<UL>
<LI> Audrey
<LI> Laurie
<LI> Alice
</UL>
Second, the image conveys some information and has to appear in the markup,
not in the style (and the default style list visual is turned off so that
you don't get double bullet) 
UL { list-style: none }
<UL>
<LI> <IMG SRC=browneye.png ALT="bullet. brown eye drawing"> Audrey
<LI> <IMG SRC=greeneye.png ALT="bullet. green eye drawing">Laurie
<LI> <IMG SRC=blueeye.png ALT="bullet. blue eye drawing">Alice
</UL>


Action: It is hard to include this in the recommendations without
consensus on what the alt-text of bullet items should be.  We are at the
tail-end of the process of gathering all of the discussion points
associated with alt-text.  A whole section is devoted to this topic.  We
agree something needs to be said, but resolution and consensus should be
reached first. No action taken at this time pending further discussion.

Issue 8

Discussion: 

Comment 1:  Section 12 Recommendation 3. Offer navigation bars for easy
access to the navigation structure.    Apparently, pages that starts with a
navbar are bad for sequential reading (speech in particular) as they force
the listener to listen to the same navbar over and over again.  I think we
need to be a little more specific and I suggest we propose a authoring
guidelines to "classify" navbar, using the HTML class attribute applied to
the element used (frame, image map) or a DIV if there is no navbar element
per se:
<div class=navbar>
<A HREF=foo>Search</A> | <A HREF=bar> Home </A>
</div>
This way a browser can move it down the page or offer it as an option on
demand.

Comment 2:  Should we wait to recommend this until the UI group has created
a guideline for the browser side of things?  

Action: No action at this time pending further discussion.

Issue 9

Discussion: 

Comment 1:  The theme of his message is that as well as the guidelines
saying  'what' needs doing, it would be helpful if advice were given on
'how' an accessible site can be developed (or an inaccessible site  updated
to improve accessibility).

Comment 2:  Great suggestion.  The case studies that we intend to create
for problem issues would satisfy this request.  However, a test page that
uses all of the guidelines would be an interesting thing to attach to the
guidelines.  (I hope it is possible ;-)

Action: No action taken at this time pending further discussion and work.

Issue 10

Discussion: Sections 5 and 7 testing tips:  To get a better understanding
of what a screen reader would present to a user, do not load the images on
a page when viewing with a graphical browser or use a text-based browser
such as Lynx.  
Another method, to predict how a screen reader will interpret your page, is
to save it as a text-only file then open it with a word processing program.
This function is available in the "File" menu in most browsers.
The [New] testing tip should point to lynxit URL service. Provide a link to
a lynx-it kind of page. 

Action: Links to these types of services were added.

Issue 11

Discussion: Should add a blurb at the beginning saying HTML4 has lots of
new stuff for FORM. (thanks to T.V).  

Action: Added several new recommendations in the forms section.  Still need
a blurb?
