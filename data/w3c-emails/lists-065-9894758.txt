Issue 1

Discussion: "Comments" section.  I don't like the sentence that says: "We
cannot guarantee a personal response but we will try when it is
appropriate."   Basically, this means: we can ignore your comment/request
if we want, and that's not acceptable. We need to point people to an
up-to-date "issue list" document where *all* the issues raised are stored
together with their status (need more discussion, ok to be incorporated, no
for this and this reason, etc) and their origination (author, date, pointer
to message/thread).

Action: The sentence was deleted.  A document has been created in response
to your request, from which this is excerpted.

Issue 2

Discussion: Comment1:  Section 2 Recommendation 5. We should also add
"descriptive link title", or "description anchor title" to disambiguate
with the IMG title.(the example is clear, but it's dropped from the
checklist for instance)
Comment2:   this might make the guideline confusing. The checklist
is to remind them. The guidelines includes the example if there is confusion.
Do you see it as a big problem?

Action: no action taken at this time pending further discussion.

Issue 3

Discussion: Section 12 Recommendation 12.  Test the site with at least: a
text only browser (such as Lynx)  a self-voicing browser (such as
PWWebspeak)  I think requiring lynx is OK (given web ready lynx-it service)
but self voicing is unrealistic.  

Action: Created a new bullet that says, "It may also be helpful to test
your site with a self-voicing browser (such as PWWebspeak)."

Issue 4

Discussion: We should probably advise people to use the OBJECT element and
not APPLET.

Action:  Note added to recommendation concerning APPLET element that says
it has been deprecated.
