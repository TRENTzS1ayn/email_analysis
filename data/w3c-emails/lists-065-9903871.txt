Issue 1

Discussion:

Comment 1:  "8pt" used in the style sheet for [Recommended] and [Required]
is almost illegible on a Macintosh. The CSS specification says, "Absolute
length units are only useful when the physical properties of the output
medium are known." [1] Please use a relative size like 'small', and read
the conclusions in my short paper on font-size in CSS (they will tell you
x-small and xx-small are unusable as are sizes under 82-75%). [2]
Incidentally, at small sizes, Helvetica is one of the least readable fonts
on a Macintosh. Maybe not specifying font-family would help, too.
snippet in question
-------------------
span.rec {
font-family : Helvetica;
font-size : 8pt;
^^^
Efforts to improve accessibility might include efforts to improve
readability for sighted Web users as well [3]. I have no formal
qualifications beyond a degree in Studio Art, but if I can be of
assistance, please let me know.

Action: Excellent comments.  Changed to 9pt default font.  More when we   
test to see which approach will work best.   Also, use of style sheets will 
be remedied
next version of the guidelines.

Issue 2

Discussion: Tips and tricks Section.  I'm not sure a separate section is a
good choice (rather than trying to integrate its content in the main 
document)

Action: Content has been integrated back with other sections, except for
the alternative page recommendation.  This stands alone in the newly titled
section, "If all else fails..."

Issue 3

Discussion:

Comment 1:  "If all else fails" section.    I think the recommendation for
an alternative page should go right before the section on alternate text
linkage (use of LINK)

Comment 2:  At the meeting in Austin we discussed what to do with this
recommendation.  Many felt that it should be at the end of the page so that
people wouldn't fall back on it before reading the rest of the document.

Action: Item left at end per Austin discussion.
