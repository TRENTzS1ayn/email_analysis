As outcome of my meeting with Sally Khudairi on guidelines naming, please
consider this recommendation for full set:

(For those new to this thread, we are trying to map out all the WAI
Guidelines names in advance, as our first working draft gets close to going
public)

  WAI Accessibility Guidelines: Browsers

  WAI Accessibility Guidelines: Authoring Tools

  WAI Accessibility Guidelines: Page Authoring

  WAI Accessibility Guidelines: Users [if we do that set]

  WAI Accessibility Guidelines: Master Reference Document

The document spec codes then become:

  WAI-BROWSER
  WAI-AUTHTOOLS
  WAI-PAGEAUTH
  WAI-USERS
  WAI-MASTERREF

And they all get a "W3C Working Draft" or "W3C Proposed Recommendation" or
"W3C Recommendation" depending on their status.  They are official W3C
documents, so they get that visibility right off.

The idea is that: 
-the W3C already will have enough "brand recognition"; 
-it _is_ important on these to identify with WAI; 
-they all need to have "accessibility" in the title; 
-HTML or even Hypertext are unnecessary if we can keep names basic, like
page authoring, etc.
-these names are straightforward enough to minimize guesswork & confusion
(in theory, at least).  Now you tell me what you think:)

Your thoughts?

- Judy
