DD:: REQUIRED in this context re-enforces the idea that IMG in A with
no desc are twice as bad as simple IMG with no desc.

If we get this message out somewhere else, that's OK with me.

We also need to have the discussion on usage of ALT/TITLE/etc before
closing on this one.

DD:: my original comment was just to take out the table line in this
section, not to change the whole Style section rating.

But we discussed that a little on the list and my last batch of
comments didn't ask for any change.

So we can keep it (the table line) in the Style REQUIRED set as far as
I'm concerned, as long as we change the TABLE section itself (which
you are doing).

DD:: See my above note: SS stays REQUIRED.

DD:: HTML4 specs:
 "In addition, the FRAMESET section can contain a NOFRAMES
 element to provide alternate content for user agents that do not
 support frames or are configured not to display frames."

So this is an interim thing.

DD:: You said it yourself: "Currently...."

DD:: I guess my point is that the tips should be rated as well wrt timing.

DD:: But isn't it the case that people are having problem in the
interim only ? because their tools are not good enough to use the form
as is.

To me, this is about changing the content of the information, which is
something I'm opposed to: the source should be the same for everybody,
it just needs to be accessible to all media.
