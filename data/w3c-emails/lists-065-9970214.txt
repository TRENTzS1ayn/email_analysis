Font sizes specified in points should be avoided.  If a poor-sighted user 
views the page with his 24pt default font, the 9pt font will be unreadable 
to him.  When I view the page with my 14pt default font, the 9pt font 
looks out of place.  We should specify the font size in percentages if at 
all.  This may be worth mentioning in the guidelines.

Another problem for sighted users is the use of things like <BODY 
BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">.  While this is common on the Web, I think it 
represents an accessibility problem.  If the user's text and link colours 
are too different from typical browser defaults, the page may be 
unreadable.  As an example, consider a user who has configured her browser 
to use white text on a black background; this user will see white on white 
unless she overrides all author colours, which shouldn't be necessary (but 
is on today's Web).  Recommendation:  If one of the BGCOLOR, TEXT, LINK, 
VLINK, or ALINK attributes is given, then all should be specified.  The 
BACKGROUND attribute should also be accompanied by the other BODY colour 
attributes.
