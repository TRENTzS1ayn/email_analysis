The guidelines may be shortened to say ' use alt="" '

The discussion in the spec. about CDATA attribute values 
implies that browsers MAY treat alt=" " as alt="" and that 
authors SHOULD write alt="". 

There is no particular advantage confusing readers
of authoring guidlines with these kind of subtlties of 
the spec. 

We better first make sure that they can tell inline and 
block level elements apart.
