The HTML specification does not distinguish between authors
and stylesheets as the originators of class definitions.

I doubt this.  What is the incidence on the web today of
CLASS=<anything> much less CLASS="nav"?

The proposal to reserve the "nav" value of CLASS for objects
which are navigation aids does not include with it any 
default value of the ACSS 'speak' property.  It is simply
an attempt to get a consistent spelling adopted for this
common page-structure notion.

And your "exactly the same" is only looking at the formalities
which capture a minority of what is really going on.  We should
look at what those structures are useful for, and actually used
for, before seeing if this default is comparable to that default
or not in its advisability.

Yes, I can see that there would be some actual damage to
incumbent uses of tokens for which we suggest a community 
semantic.

In HTML4 and CSS2 the W3C made it clear that authors must write
documents in the knowledge that their styling can be overridden
by a user stylesheet.  The WAI should be making it clear that
authors should use community-based classes that will be already
understood and handled in user stylesheets.  Not making up new
tokens where something close enough is already recognized by the
community.

Capricious or merely idiosyncratic use of classes is one of the
major failure modes of the HTML+CSS architecture as an accessible
technology.

It makes more sense to deprecate using CLASS="nav" for poems
than to deprecate <I> and <B>, and the W3C has already taken
that step.

If you can show me three different authors who have used 
CLASS="nav" for something radically different from a navigation
aid, we can look for a different token.  Actually, if we had
the muscle we should search the web with a thesaurus in hand
and find out if anyone has already started using a CLASS mark
for any semantic like this and jump on the bandwagon.  Just
formally endorse the best token in use today.
