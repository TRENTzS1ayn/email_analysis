To:"'GL - WAI Guidelines WG'"<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>




We will be releasing a new version of the guidelines this afternoon.  This
is a heads up, especially for those who will be participating in the
teleconference call tomorrow.

There are a number of changes and re-organizations that have been made to
incorporate issues and ideas that have been raised or proposed on the list
and phone calls.

In the process, the guidelines have moved from three sections to two
sections.  Section A, containing 14 guidelines, covers the concept of
transforming gracefully to account for different users and technologies.
Section B, which contains three guidelines, covers orientation, navigation,
and comprehension.

Under comprehension we have added techniques to help address language level
and improving the usability of the site to individuals with cognitive
disabilities.

A complete change log will also be released along with the guidelines (or
shortly thereafter).  Give it a read and comment back to the list with your
thoughts.

  Please remember that we are getting very close to release.  We are trying
to incorporate all of the ideas and input that we possibly can.  Take a
careful look at the latest version and if you have comments, we look forward
to hearing from you on the list or on the conference call.

Thanks much for all of your efforts especially here at the end.  We
appreciate people taking the time to read these revisions on short turn
around as we head into the final round up.
