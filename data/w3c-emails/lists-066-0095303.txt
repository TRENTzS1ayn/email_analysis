Dear Gregg,

I am in the process of recruiting 100 physically challenged adults, who use
assistive technology, to participate in on-line focus groups to study
Internet accessibility at 4 specific Federal Government Websites. 

These focus groups will be conducted on the Internet. Each of these focus
groups will last for about one hour. The on-line focus groups are intended
to obtain information about the usability of the sites for individuals with
disabilities. Each of the participants will be paid a stipend of $50 for
their help with this project. 

To participate in a group, an individual _must_ use assistive technology to
access the Internet.  This is not limited to visual impairments, but
includes any adaptive computer device or program necessary for the
individual to use the computer and access the Internet.

If you, or any one you know, are interested in participating in one of
these Internet focus groups please contact me and I will send you the
complete info, and sign you/them up for a group.

This is an unique opportunity to give feedback on internet accessibility to
a Federal Agency that WANTS to hear it!


Kathy
