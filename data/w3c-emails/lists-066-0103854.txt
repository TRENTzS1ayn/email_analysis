I'm not sure exactly which item you are referring to but this language is
generally used where it is likely that the guidelines will look unreasonable
otherwise.  It is to assure users that it is understood that this guideline
will not always make sense or be possible.

Subject:"Whenever possible"

The techniques doc  uses in some cases terms like
"whenever possible" or "if possible". It seems
redundent, as clearly authors are not expected to
do the impossible in other cases, now do they?
