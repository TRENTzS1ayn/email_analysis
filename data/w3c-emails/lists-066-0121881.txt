Currently there are two alternative techniques which have been proposed as
long-term solutions:

1. Clusters of navigational links can be identified by using CLASS="nav"
on a container element, inserting DIV as a container if necessary.

2. Alternatively, MAP can be used to enclose the navigational links: <map>
<p> [links] </map> without any corresponding image and with no need forany
AREA elements.

Given the uncertain backward compatibility of (2) and Al's persuasive
argument that it is entirely consistent with the HTML 4.0 specification
and the existence of users' style sheets to establish widespread
conventions for associating particular semantics with CLASS values, I
would opt for solution (1) as originally proposed.

Both of these solutions are compatible with the preferred short term
strategy of including at the start of the navigation cluster a link to the
block of text which immediately follows it, for example, the next heading
or paragraph.
