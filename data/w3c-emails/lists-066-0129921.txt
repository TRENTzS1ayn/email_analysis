How about adding something about an implicate language in the absence of
the Lang = ?? clause. If I am connected to an .es site, I would expect that
the site would be in Spanish not English so only English pages would NEED
to have the Lang clause.

You also missed a third reason for using the Lang clause - to allow the
Browser to select from multiple copies of the same data based on the
language (MIME MULT/ALTERNATE).
