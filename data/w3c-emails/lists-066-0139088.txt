I appreciate the rationale motivating this proposal. The only disadvantage
is that it makes the relative importance of each of the principles
enunciated in the guidelines explicitly dependent on that part of the
document which is most subject to change, namely the techniques. As Gregg
recognises, this is the case already, since the priority assigned to each
guideline is determined by the highest priority level among its associated
techniques.

It would be helpful to find a means of expressing the relative priorities
of the stable principles of universal design which the guidelines
themselves are supposed to embody.

No solutions come to mind, however.
