The word "Document" implies a document.  So are the guidelines limited to
just documents or do they include HTML applications?  At the present, there
isn't much attention applied to HTML applications, so maybe the term makes
sense for this release.

We are using the term document in the UA guidelines.  So maybe something
like.

WWW Document Universal Design Guidelines

The guidelines maybe should be called "Universal" since they also promote
the exclusive use of W3C standards and authoring practices that related to
the orginal intended purpose of elements.
