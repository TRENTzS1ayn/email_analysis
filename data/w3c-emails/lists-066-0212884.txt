The "whenever possible" qualification should already be conveyed in the
priority assigned to the technique, and is redundant in the text.
Moreover, even the guideline which advises authors to avoid deprecated
elements and attributes, is unnecessarily impeded by the "whenever
possible" proviso. It is in principle always possible to avoid deprecated
features of HTML, just as it is always possible to avoid non-standard
proprietary extensions. These guidelines should not be qualified in any
way, except by their designation as "priority 2" recommendations.
