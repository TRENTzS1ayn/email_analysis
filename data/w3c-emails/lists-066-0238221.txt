I think the problem was that people might suggest "That's impossible. 
Therefore these guidelines are not internally consistent. Therefore they 
are rubbish. Therefore I will continue to leave ALT text and NOFRAMES out 
of my website." (Or some like-minded piece of drivel)

I am not sure that this is such a likely scenario, except among those 
looking for a rationalisation to explain their failure to make an 
attempt. Those people will probably find another one.

Another part of the story is time-dependent. C.1 says "Where possible use 
a W3C technology..."

At the moment there is no W3C recommendation on images, although that may 
change soon. Likewise scripting languages, and lots of other goodies. So 
having the 'where possible' clause does allow the guidelines to be 
interpreted in light of the state of the art at the time of 
interpretation, rather than at the time of compilation..

So I am happy for it to be there, judiciously used. It seems much better 
than 'for the moment' or 'until such time as' which we had at one stage for 
some things.
