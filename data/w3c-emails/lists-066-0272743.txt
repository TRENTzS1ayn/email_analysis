I think the guidelines need to be edited for style, grammar and
readability. Cumbersome phrases such as occur in guideline B1 ("navigation
information and [...] presentations of information") should be avoided.
Suitable synonyms could be substituted for words such as "information"
provided that the meaning remains clear in the given context. Expressions
such as "making useful to all users" strike me as stylistically
objectionable: one could say "accessible", "intelligible", "convenient",
"navigable", "understandable", etc., with an appropriate term in each
context.

I am sure that, once the substantive issues have been finalised, the
editors will turn their rigorous intellectual skills to questions of
grammar and style, but it would be irresponsible of me at this stage not
to mention these aspects of the guidelines, which are integral to
effective communication. I think that style and vocabulary are significant
issues in the current draft. Technical terminology has been used
appropriately, but a more liberal choice of synonyms and careful attention
to expression would improve the text immeasurably.
