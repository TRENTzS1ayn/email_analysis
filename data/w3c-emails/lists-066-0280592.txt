I'm not sure if I agree or not.

Maybe the problem should be re-expressed into marking up the Character 
set. I can read a bit of Japanese and Greek, but if the character set is 
not marked, and the language is not marked, then I simply have to guess 
at all the character sets I can think of. Then if I make a lucky guess, I 
have to work out a font.

This is from the perspective of a sighted user. I can recognise whether I 
am dealing with Chinese, Japanese, Korean, or Thai at a glance. (Although 
I may get Thai confused with Khmer, or other languages close by).

With a hint from the origin of the document, it gets a little easier. But 
for me it seems that to compund that problem with one of lack of Language 
markup and ask a braille translator or speech synthesis system to make 
any sense at all is ridiculous.

If it would help anyone, I will make up some pages in a few different 
languages (chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, French, German, 
Russian) and post them with no markup so people can try them out.
