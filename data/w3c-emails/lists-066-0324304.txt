Exactly.  And Unicode 3.0 is even trying to include language tags by

Yes, there is a "Content-Language" HTTP response header.  For example,
<http://www.w3.org/Press/1998/DOM-REC> is provided in 6 languages,
namely, Dutch, English, French, German, Japanese and Swedish.
We're adding appropriate Content-Language header in addition to
charset parameter of Contnt-Type header.
