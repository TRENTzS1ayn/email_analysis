For those who haven't looked at the SNOW site, I have copied a
Lynx dump below.

Greg,

I am delighted that you wrote.  The SNOW site is such a marvelous
resource that it is a strong candidate to be on our hit list of
highly-publicized good sites.  But there is this problem with the
barrage of links at the head, as you have said.

I agree that the image and text links done the way it is on
<http://snow.utoronto.ca/index.html> at present amounts to
overkill.  On the other hand, even the text links alone are not
really a good idea at this position in the reading flow.

This issue was covered pretty well in a discussion thread
that took place on the interest group list.  Pardon the indirection,
but if you go to 
<http://www.access.digex.net/~asgilman/lynx/bookmarks/toplinks.html> 
you will find links to both the discussion thread on WAI-IG
list and the ACB site where the hyperlink remedy is used.

The general idea is that you should make it easier for the
visitor browsing in audio to get to the prose on this page.

Al

   sharing curriculum material via the SNOW site, an upload/download
   feature is available in the [20]Shared Curriculum section of the site.
