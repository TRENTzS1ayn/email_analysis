Thanks for the constructive comments Al. I am always looking for ways to improve our
site for those using adaptive technologies. The "barage" of links at the top of the
page has been a concern, especially on the index page. On other pages the navigation
bar does take away from the flow of information on the page, but the informed
adaptive technology user will quickly realize that there are consistently 10
navigation links at the top of every page (except the index page) and can quickly
tab past the first portion of  a page.  The bottom also contains a set of links
which serve a different purpose, allowing visitors to view the site through an
alternative navigation structure. On thinking about this, I 'll add a D-link at the
beginning of the index page which describes the consistency of structure throughout
the site and within pages.

I think a trade off must be made between functionality and ease of navigation, and
redundancy interfering with comprehension for those listening to a page. As long as
this redundancy is minimized by eliminating duplicate information, that is using
either ALT text or text links but not both, and is consistent across pages,
interference should not be a problem since adaptive technology users will quickly
realize the first 10 links at the top of everypage can be ignored.

I'll read through the top links thread.
