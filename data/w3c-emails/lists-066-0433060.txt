Hmmm. The problem is that the guidelines are not based on 'today', but on 
what is going to remain true for a while. If OBJECT were more common than 
IMG, your argument would be reversed. So the appraoch in the guidelines 
is 'What things are going to make life impossible for users?' 'ALT text 
on IMG, content for OBJECT, transcripts/captions for audio and video'. 
So all of those things are priority one. The things that are really 
horrible, but not insoluble, are priority two. And things that are nice 
things to do, but won't make life really difficult for people if they are 
ignored, are priority three. It's a rough system, but it is meant to be 
robust and stable, which I think it is.

I think that it can be applied to the texhniques, on the basis that the 
guidelines are all important to be followed, as per the Rationale thta 
Gregg originally published. The number of techniques which are relevant, 
and their priority, in a given case, is probably a good rough guide to 
how important the guideline is in a given case.

(I haven't been sold on this yet. But I have put the money aside from the 
weekly budget, and I'm trying to think of where it would be best.)
