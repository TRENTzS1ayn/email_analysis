Well, maybe. But most documents have a variety of character sets - 
ISO-8859-1, or Shift-JIS, or Windows-1252, or ISO-8859-5, or EUC-2022-KR 
or whatever. Having these marked up would be helpful, but is not 
necessarily sufficient to guess the language.

(what I said above...)

Agreed. But it can be a hint, ad is important information. More below...

No, that's not my big complaint here (although it is in the User Agent 
group). My big complaint is that most authors do not have the ability to 
set up how their server deals with language negotiation, but they do have 
the ability through a combination of META HTTP-EQUIV elements (I have 
written on this topic here a couple of months ago) and LANG="xx" 
statements, to make it explicit in their pages. It is important that it 
be explicit, and either we try changing the way ISPs work (which seems 
unlikely and not the most efficient place to deal with it anyway - 
authors know better what language they write) or we change the way 
authors write, by asking them to mark up their language explicitly.
