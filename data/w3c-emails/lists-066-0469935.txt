I think Alan has it, but for PF reasons I want to try the
following recapitulation on y'all.

To meet the needs of universal access, text needs to be fit for
use with Braille and Text-to-Speech transliteration technologies.
These technologies require that the character representation and
language identification be rock-solid in order for them to
function successfully.

Therefore Universally Accessible documents must strictly adhere
to the internationalization discipline as set out in HTML4.0 and
identify the language of each document and sub-segments of the
text which are not in the base language of the document.

The actual impact of failing to follow this practice of course
depends on the language mix involved and the likelihood that
a given reader will assume or guess correctly the language and
encoding of the document.
