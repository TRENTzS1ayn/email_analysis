Comments interspersed. Look for CMcCN:: or AJF:: Basically I am agreeing 
with things.

CMcCN::
Yes. It seems sad, but my experience is that it's true and becoming more 
so. I tend to use META HTTP-EQUIV pretty often. In an ideal world this 
wouldn't happen. But when I'm writing pages for people to give to someone 
else to put on their ISPs (unknown flavour of) server it's better to be 
safer.

CMcCN::
I agree that they are important to accessibility. I think the reasons 
have been explained pretty well recently. So it's nice to see the topic 
being taken up.
