I agreed with most of what you say, but I wonder if this is bound to
Universal Design/Accessibility, or just to CSS good design guidelines,
which is related, I understand, but is getting a little far fetched in
terms of what we're asking author to do.

Better wording:

"Instead of using DIV and SPAN elements to add style, try subclassing
existing HTML elements though the CLASS attribute. For example, if you
want to stronly emphasize a text, use the EM element with CLASS set to
(say) "extra" instead of using SPAN."
