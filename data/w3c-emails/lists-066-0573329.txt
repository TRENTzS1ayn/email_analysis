I'm unhappy with both of these formulations, sorry.  They're expressed
negatively, and it's better to start with a positive statement of what
is being aimed at, IMHO.

I'd want something like (but it still needs work):

"Give priority to expressing the structure of your content by means of
an appropriate HTML tag.  Enhance these, where appropriate, with a
CLASS attribute and stylesheet suggestion(s).  Only resort to DIV or
SPAN when HTML has no more-appropriate tag." 

(and then your example, by all means).

hope that was useful
