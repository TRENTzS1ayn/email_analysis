There is a page now at 
http://saltimbocca.srl.rmit.edu.au/wai/uaelements.htm which lists the 
elements of HTML and what User Agents need to implement, along with some 
attributes and CSS features. Please send comments and excuse the buggy 
nature of the page - life here has been a little more hectic than I 
anticipated. And please copy all flames, congratulations, and 
comprehensive constructive criticism to the list. I will leave the page 
alone for an hour or two at least (it is now 8.30 Eastern US time I 
think) as I will leave it for a bit before the telecon.
