Layer has a certain functionality not available with 
HTML / CSS which is to call an external bit of HTML 
and make it a part of the same document. Communicator 
supports some CSS extention (url-import) that does the same.

Actually netscapes guide on layers shows how to do the 
same with CSS and admits that url-import is an experimental 
extention.

EMBED should be deprecated in favor of OBJECT, but EMBED 
is currently much more widely supported than OBJECT.

So it seems the guidelines would benefit from not disscussing those.

On the other hand I would talk much more on CSS and 
IFRAME in the section on frames, as these may replace a 
great deal of the functions of the notorious FRAMESET FRAME 
alternative.
