I must admit that Jason is right. 

I thought that <LAYER src> is more like an "include", 
that is intgrating a fragment rather than treating it like a 
separate embedded document, but checking the documentation 
and running a little test it seems quite the same thing 
as OBJECT. (with the exception that LAYER is better 
supported by communicator)
