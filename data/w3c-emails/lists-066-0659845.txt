This is supported in standard HTML by OBJECT.

I found, to my pleasant surprise, that it actually worked in MSIE
(I was using 5b2) when I inserted an HTML document encoded in one
charset (koi8-r, say) into an HTML document encoded in a different
charset (iso-8859-1, say).

One aspect that I find to be a shortcoming is that one must define
a height and width for the OBJECT, otherwise MSIE does not display it
(or displays it at zero size, maybe - well, the perceived effect is
the same).

Having said that it works, I have to admit that I have no especial
insights into the accessibility implications of using it.

best regards
