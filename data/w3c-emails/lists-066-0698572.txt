Layer seems a simple one to dispose of, since it is not widely supported, 
and does not have any functionality that could not be provided with 
properly implemented IFRAME or OBJECT elements (ones which allow for 
control of borders etc).

EMBED is trickier. What other way is there to include a multimedia object 
such as a video in a page (rather than linking to it as a document)? 
OBJECT and IFRAME could, again, be used,  but they are not implemented 
where EMBED is.

We should probably  think about the accessibility issues related to 
IFRAME anyway - are they the same as those for FRAME?
