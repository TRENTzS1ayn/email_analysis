LAYER I  agree with you. For EMBED, the problem is  that there is no 
replacement prior to HTML 4.0 (I may be wrong on this. Anyone?) I would 
recommend that EMBED only be used within the content of an OBJECT (much 
as I recommend IMG be used, although nobody seems to buy this. It may be 
more of an option for AU though.) since it provides a mechanism which is  
widely supported, although non-standard. This goes back to the 'where 
possible' provisions. It is not possible to provide legacy browsers with 
an EMBED which is W3C recommended. This does not mean that it is not 
possible to provide the functionality in an accessible way, which is the 
ultimate goal. Just that the non-W3C technology should not be used as the 
primary means - it is a kluge, and where it can be replaced (eg by using 
it as content of an OBJECT, then using CSS display:none if possible (I am 
thinking out loud here and don't know if that works)) an appropriate 
system must be recommended by the guidelines.

This is one of those tricky problems that goes to the heart of the 
matter. Arewe ready to discuss this  on the call, or is there other  
agenda material?
