A technique for ensuring that multimedia embedded in a page degrades 
gracefully.

Use the EMBED proprietary element within the content of an OBJECT, and 
associated with aprropriate descriptive text. Note that EMBED is not a 
W3C-recognised element, and that there is no mechanism to associate ALT 
text with it directly (CMcCN:: Can someone with NS3 or IE or something  
check this?). Therefore this  technique is  only useful to solve a legacy 
problem. Use of EMBED in other manners actually creates an accessibility 
problem.
