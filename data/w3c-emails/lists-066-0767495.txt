We should hve a 'look to the future' clause I think. Use technologies 
which enhance accessibility, such as CGM, which allows the inclusion of 
descriptive and searchable text within graphic objects, when they become 
available.

Ditto the onActivate and other logical triggers (another hobbyhorse of mine)

I realise this is not thought out real well, but then it is the sort of
thing for which, by definition, the techniques are not going to be well
established at the date of release, so it only needs some (considerable)
wordsmithing (assuming we are not giving priorities any more). 

Cheers
