WAI Page Author Guidelines WG:

As discussed in the GLWG meeting today, here's a draft of a call for
cross-disability review of the guidelines before they go to Proposed
Recommendation status: <http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/X-Disability-Review.htm>.


The intent is to send it to disability organizations who _haven't_ been so
involved in WAI work to date, to let them know that there's something here
to comment on, and how to do that. 

We'd like to send it out this Monday. Any comments first?

thanks

Judy
