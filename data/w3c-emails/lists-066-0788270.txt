The intent of the split guideline/technique is to provide some kind of
"selection method" to implement each guideline: a list of possible
fixes. I'm not sure a better paradigm can be devised given the
contextual dependency on each technique applicability.

We talked some about that a while ago, where it was question to have
guidelines organized by browser compatibility, but it didn't
concretize. Too much back-office-brain power needed I guess.

Yes, I suggested that too, make the technique document a non-normative 
annex.

Yes to this one as well, I don't think the current separation brings
in much.

Without looking at automatic generation as the only goal, trying to
formalize the guidelines structure a little more might be helpful.

But this might go against your earlier argument in favor of shortness
of normative the guideline info.

A good improvement.

No question about that.

Good list, should go to the EO group (I will forward it there, check
w3.org/WAI/EO for followup)

I still favor "Content" over Product & Service, Page and Site, etc.

Yes, it could indeed be splitted in two, along the lines

 - use latest W3C format (HTML4 with CSS)
 - for non W3C format, provide alternative representations so that no
   information is lost when data is inaccessible, unsupported, or turned off.

As I said in a prior posting to this list, putting the emphasis on the
non disability market first is a better option (first mobile and web
phone, e.g. temporary visual impairment, then permanent visual
impairment: blind users)

where exactly ?

Can you elaborate on the "impracticality" and the "other meaning"
aspects ?

These guidelines promote the design of web content so that it can be
accessed no matter what operating system, device, or modality of user
interface one has, hence the universality.

In which way are we not considering enough universality in the
design (given our limited context of web content production) ?

A.7 is really about machine comprehension (if you don't have the lang
attribute indicating the language of the content, voice output can be
messy) whereas B.3 is about human comprehension (consistency, simple
icons, etc), for learning disability for instance.

The term language used in both cases in confusing I agree. How about
"Use terms and formats that facilitate comprehension of information"
for B.3 ?

No, again, it's for the machine to parse, not the human.
