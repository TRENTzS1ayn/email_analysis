By and large I agree with Daniel's comments. I have included those I
disagree with below, with my comments interspersed.

I'm not sure that we want ot include stuff in each guideline/technique,
rather than using a once-off covering statement. But this is not a strong
opinion.

Or document/ document fragment. My understanding of the technical use of
these terms in XML is that they are comprehensible, and sepcify
effectively the range of things we want to cover. But Content is good too.

I disagree violently. It is a single guideline, which requires a complex
exception case to be defined. THis is best done in two sentences - the
alternatives are to simplify the guideline, which I think would lead to an
incomplete statement being made in one long and horrible sentence, or to
run the two sentences together, which reduces the focus on interpreting
both sentences carefully.
