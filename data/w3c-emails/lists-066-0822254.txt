Thus, Charles' proposed kludge amounts to the following:

<object data="symphony.au"> Mahler's first symphony <embed [attribute
referring to symphony.au]> </object>

Whereas, a standard-compliant solution would use an anchor element instead
of EMBED: <a href="symphony.au"> Listen to Mahler's first symphony </a>
within the content of OBJECT. Of course, some functionality is lost, but
the result is not overly inconvenient for the reader and maintains
conformity with the HTML specification.

The legacy will, of course, disappear as users upgrade their software.
