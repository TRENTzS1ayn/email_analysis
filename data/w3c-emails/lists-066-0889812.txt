Hello,

The latest version of the Page Authoring Guidelines [1] 
(and techniques [2]) is now available online.

Some highlights:

The links between the guidelines and techniques documents have 
been fixed in this release.

The examples and detailed discussions of the new techniques (added in
the
November 17 release) still need to be incorporated.  


For further details about changes, please consult the changes
logs (for Guidelines [3], for Techniques [4]).
