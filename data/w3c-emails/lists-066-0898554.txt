Currently, there are few solutions available in this area. MathML, once
supported by appropriate braille and speech output software, will work,
but it is difficult to incorporate MathML into an HTML document at this
stage. I understand that most authors use in-line images as a kludge to
present the mathematical notation visually. Perhaps as an interim measure
they could use LaTeX markup as convenient ALT text (it has the advantage
of being relatively compact and well known).

The other alternative would be to use OBJECT to incorporate each
mathematical expression into a document:

<object type\"text/xml" data="equation1.xml" Equation 1, marked up in
MathML </object>

and likewise for every mathematical expression in the document.
