My main concern related to math is that I would like to point to the
guidelines for faculty on the UIUC campus for how to make accessible WWW
documents.  At least 30 to 40 percent of the instructors on campus use some
type of simple math and/or complex math in their WWW documents.  There is
no mention of how to represent mathematical expressions in the current
guidelines.  Currently most instructors use images, which we know are not
very accessible.  Since educators may be the first group forced (due to
educational legislation in the USA) to use the guidelines, I think it would
be important to have a technique or section the clearly indicates what to
do now and in the future for math with some examples to demonstrate.  

John Gardner at Oregon State or T. V. Raman at Adobe may be a good
reference for this issue, if the working group wants to pursue it.

Now:
Some type of alt text or longdesc that represents math?

Future:
MathML ?
