There hasn't been much attention paid to math lately.  I am glad it is
coming around again.  Most in-line use of math could be adequately
represented today by writing words in the Alt tag.  A good screen reader
will read the alt tag smoothly.

Personally I do not believe that it is possible for an author today to do
anything except write a longdesc word description of displayed equations
that would make them usable by people with severe print disabilities.  And
I am dubious that long complicated equations would be very usable in word
form.  This is only "better than nothing".  

It may not even be better than nothing.  I do not believe that either
Netscape or Internet Explorer has yet implemented longdesc.  PW Webspeak
has.  At least they say they have, but I haven't found anything to test it
on yet.

MathML is certainly capable of providing accessible math.  My group has
already submitted a proposal to the NSF to make a mathML plug-in that would
render mathML in a linear form compatible with screen readers.  This could
be done quickly but speaking linear math is clumsier than one would like.
Our next step would be to make a self-voicing plug-in that can render math
more naturally.

My concern is that I do not see any groundswell of acceptance of mathML.
Friends tell me that the visual rendering is currently really ugly, and
nobody wants to put ugly things on the web when they have the choice.  So
mathML may soon be accessible to blind people, but if it isn't accessible
to sighted people it won't be used.

The authoring guideline is simple.  Use mathML.  However you can't expect
authors to follow that guideline until browsers support mathML acceptably.
