My knee-jerk answer is yes, because CSS actually includes a mechanism whereby
HTML 3.2 presentational elements which were deprecated in HTML 4.0 are
included in the CSS cascade.

The point against is that inline elements are not part of style sheets,
which is what the checkpoint actually requires.

What do other folks think?

  Question:  Does the HTML Writers Guild's homepage, at
  http://www.hwg.org/index.html , satisfy checkpoint 3.3?
  
  It uses both HTML _and_ CSS for layout and presentation.
