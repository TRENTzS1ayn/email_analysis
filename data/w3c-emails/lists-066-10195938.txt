"The power of the web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless
of disability is an essential aspect"

Quoted in the UK Guardian Newspaper Thursday 15 July.

It is funny kind of Universality that excludes non-readers

The Guidelines make frequent reference to learning difficulty, but do not
give advice, whereas they do give advice for helping visitors who are blind.

Moreover the 'discussions' in great part are concerned with specifics (ie
alt text)that directly affect the users experience.

Unless people start making an effort to understand issues concerning LD it
is unlikely that progress will be made. For all the strengths at the WAI
your efforts and arguments are lack lustre, and show a lack of concern.
