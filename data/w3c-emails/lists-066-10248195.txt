ah, the sleeping giant has awoken and I thank you for the kind words.  But
since my life's work is to play devil's advocate and always have an
apprentice on staff, i must comment on your last line.

If you go outside these groups and high-end web houses, web developers still
do not know what "deprecate" is.  Not many read the specs - that is for
technical or inquisitive types.  Instead, they just go to the web authoring
tool (whatever version they are using) and type away.  If they know it has
deprecated they may chose not to use it because they do not understand it
and they like their design. In presentations, I have asked for a show of
hands many times and many web developers have no idea why it is there, let
alone it know what it is.

I think we should consider putting "do not use deprecated "stuff" on the
QuickTips?  I know, I know, i just took back your free line <grin>
