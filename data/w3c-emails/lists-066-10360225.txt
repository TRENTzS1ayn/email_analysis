I got bored today.  There's a "logo" at the bottom of:

     http://www.kynn.com/

Unfortunately, it is:

* Broken in Netscape for Windows because Netscape is broken
* Broken in Netscape for Mac because Netscape is broken
* Broken in MSIE for Mac because MSIE is broken
* Slightly broken in Opera because Opera is slightly broken

But, hey, it looks great in:

* MSIE 4 for Windows
* Lynx
* iCab
* Anything that doesn't touch CSS

Feel free to tell me "Kynn, that's dopey and you wasted an
hour on THAT?!" but keep in mind that I'm not on the GL list
so you'll have to remember to CC me.

BTW, isn't the required text awful long and wordy?
