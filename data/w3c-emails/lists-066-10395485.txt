I agree with Charles. In fact, one could argue that the distinction
between priorities 1 and 2 in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
is firmly related to the difference between accessibility strategies as a
remedy, and access conceived as a fundamental, infrastructural aspect of
the design of electronic documents. It is at the second level that markup
features such as ABBR and ACRONYM assume particular importance by allowing
a higher quality of braille/speech output in user agents which support
them (this latter issue is being addressed by the User Agent guidelines).
Actually, all three sets of guidelines should be considered as a package,
since there are aspects of the Content guidelines (at priority 2 level)
which are based on the anticipated satisfaction of requirements set forth
in the user agent guidelines. To this extent, the User Agent and Web
Content documents complement each other.
