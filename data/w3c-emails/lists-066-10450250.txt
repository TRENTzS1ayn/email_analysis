Kynn,

Thank you for the reminder about the next upcoming HWG online class on Web
accessibility, but in leaving out the second half of my comment about
training, you imply I stated that WAI has _no_ responsibility to educate
people, where I was in fact countering the implication elsewhere that WAI
somehow had _sole_ responsibility to train people people who us the W3C/WAI
guidelines. 

The rest of my comment read: 

>While I think
>WAI has some useful support materials available and many more on the way,
>and many people involved in WAI do many presentations and trainings, I hope
>I'm misreading the intent of those earlier comments. WAI can help --
>hopefully greatly -- with creation of re-usable training resources, but
>training activities can and should be shared among many organizations,
>including, in the case of US federal agencies, by (US) FedWeb which has
>already been conducting trainings for federal agencies on this topic for
>the past two years to prepare them for their obligations under US Section
>508. And yes, WAI must be prepared to deal with potential backlash from
>individuals or organizations that react in any of many possible ways to

>the many organizations involved in trying to make the Web more accessible
