I have closed discussion of Checkpoint 3.3 on the WAI IG and the Education
and Outreach Working Group list, since this discusssion is really right in
your working group's territory. So the Web Content Guidelines Working Group
is now carrying this discussion until resolved. 

Please report back to WAI IG and to the EOWG once there's a resolution on
this -- thanks.

Judy
