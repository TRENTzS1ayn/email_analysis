No, the purpose of the "conformance" section is precisely to restrict and
define the valid claims which may be made. Thus, the absence of "partial
conformance" in the definition implicitly precludes recognising such a
claim as amounting to a genuine (valid) conformance statement, for
whatever purpose, legal or otherwise, such claims may be issued.

I agree with Charles that there are substantial reasons which favour
confining conformance claims to the categories defined in the document;
but this issue should at least be discussed further in the long term.
