Bruce,

I am still struggling at preparing a list of accommodations for the
learning and cognitively disabled population. Not many people have been
looking for accessibility for those groups specifically. Since this person
says that's his purpose, I would like to see what he/she has done towards
that end. Please post the URL for the site, or if you prefer, send it to me
private e-mail. 

Thanks,

Anne
