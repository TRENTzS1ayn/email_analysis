Anne --

I would be glad to share the site, but I can't (don't have permission / 
don't have the technical ability) since it is currently on a private 
intranet.

The site does precious little for the truly cognitively impaired.  The site 
is pretty, but that is really for everybody (especially the non-technical 
bureaucrats that are funding the project).  All parts of Checkpoint 14 are 
addressed nicely, but the site remain totally inaccessible to a non-reader.

Really what the author is trying to do is to twist the WCAG against itself 
by playing one disability group (the learning impaired) against another 
(the blind) [sigh] -- all without really doing anything in particular for 
the first group! [heavier sigh]
