I, too, would have no idea how to get on an intranet, unless I had access
to a box on it ...

I agree that meeting checkpoint 14 would not meet the needs of a
non-reader, tho it may, or may not, meet needs of cognitively impaired
folks with some reading skills. 

Based on my development of "strategies" so far, I'd suggest that an
all-graphic version of a page would not meet the needs of the cognitively
impaired folks with some-to-average reading skills - a page which combines
graphics and text would. I suspect the site was developed for the
cognitively impaired folks who need auditory input either with or without
visual stimuli (graphics, animation and/or text). An all-text version that
doesn't work in speech while giving you a view of the original page isn't
going to work for some of the cognitively disabled, tho it will work for
some others.

Not trying to do; he's doing it! And he's pointed out what needs to be
"Fixed" in the guidelines very nicely... The guidelines don't give him much
to go on to build a page accessible to the widest number of disabled folks
including specifically cognitively disabled folks. That work is still ahead.
