Does anyone have a suggestion as to how this issue can best be resolved?
As explained in an earlier message, there are problems with Ian's
suggestion to use the &quot; character entity instead of the Q element to
denote in-line quotations. Specifically, I have argued that correct
braille presentation requires maintenance of the distinctions between
double and single, opening and closing quotation marks respectively; and I
am unaware of a backward-compatible means of doing so. Does Unicode (or
ISO 8859-1 which is what most older user agents support) include distinct
opening and closing single quotation marks?

If not, I think the best solution would be to leave the requirement in
checkpoint 3.7 as is.
