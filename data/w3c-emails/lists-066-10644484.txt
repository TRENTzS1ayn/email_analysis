"...Does Unicode (or ISO 8859-1 which is what most older user agents
support) include distinct opening and closing single quotation marks?"

Unicode has the correct opening and closing quotation marks. 
So people can use them (e.g., with numerical character references).
ISO-8859-1 doesn't have the marks used in English, but has of other
languages.

I think that the checkpoint should e splitted into 
"do not use BLOCKQUOTE for formatting" and 
"use Q for short quotations" (sorry for using neutral quots) 

I think that everybody agrees on the first.

Concerning the second, Using Q is better than 
hardcoding the quot characters because
1. It is more informative (machine understandable)
2. More flexible rendering. May be affected by user's stylesheet.
3. Author doesn't have to bother in matching the quots, or choosing 
the correct ones when nesting (less room for errors).

People who insist on backward compatibility will probably insist on
using neutral quots, as both Q and unicode character references 
are not supported in some browsers.
