I would suggest leaving the requirement as is - for those who want to avoid Q
there is the argument that 11.1 allows that at the moment, but the value of
having the quotation marked up rather than identified by what Jason has
pointed out are ambiguous cues seems to argue against a change. Another
approach (which is regularly used in print typography) is to apply a
different styling to Q elements - this gives a visual cue which, like the use
of quotation marks, has been widely used for longer than my lifetime.

  Does anyone have a suggestion as to how this issue can best be resolved?
  As explained in an earlier message, there are problems with Ian's
  suggestion to use the &quot; character entity instead of the Q element to
  denote in-line quotations. Specifically, I have argued that correct
  braille presentation requires maintenance of the distinctions between
  double and single, opening and closing quotation marks respectively; and I
  am unaware of a backward-compatible means of doing so. Does Unicode (or
  ISO 8859-1 which is what most older user agents support) include distinct
  opening and closing single quotation marks?
  
  If not, I think the best solution would be to leave the requirement in
  checkpoint 3.7 as is.
