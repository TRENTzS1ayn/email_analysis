I disagree entirely; I think we need to be more concerned with the
checkpoint priorities and remember they are based on "must", "should"
and "may", and not focus so highly on single-A/double-AA/triple-AAA!

I think WCAG _should_ be a Chinese menu (anyone need that idiom
explained?) because that's how it's written and that's apparently the
intent of the document!  To use it otherwise -- to decree that the
priority levels constitute a sensible implementation plan -- is
ridiculous!
