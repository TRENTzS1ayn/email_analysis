Few notes on language:

1. There are no XML examples in the guidelines. 
One can have an XML example with using the
xml:lang attribute. This is one of the few xml attributes 
with predefined semantics.

2. I've been reading the HTTP 1.1 spec. that is, RFC 2068. 
In section 14.13 third paragraph we find:

"If no Content-Language is specified, the default is that the 
content is intended for all language audiences. This may mean 
that the sender does not consider it to be specific to any 
natural language, or that the sender does not know for 
which language it is intended. "

It seems to me that the last sentence 
is equivalent to: if the content provider is not absolutely drunk
he/she must serve all documents that contain text with a 
Content-Language header.

As far as HTML and XML are concerned specifying 
the language in both in an HTTP header and the markup
seems OK. With HTTP headers one can also specify language 
of plain text files and images that do not allow specifying language
in the file itself.

So I think that the guidelines should recommend using 
HTTP Content-Language header in addition to 
<HTML lang="language-code">
