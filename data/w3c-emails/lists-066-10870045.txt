<http://www.w3.org/WAI/style/default.css> gives you answer.  It says:

  /* this exposes a bug in NS4p3..5 - links become block elements!
    A {
     border:none;
    } 
  */

That's the reason.  Well, I'm aware of this problem, and as far as I know,
"border-style: none" doesn't expose such a buggy effect, and works fine
with other CSS-aware user agents, though, it doesn't erase borders in
Netscape Navigator :-<

I'm using some "hack" to erase borders at <http://www.w3.org/Mobile/>,
which is also Triple-A conformant to the WCAG 1.0.  You may want to
look at the trick ...
