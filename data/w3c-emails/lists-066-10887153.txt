I think that the last 'MAY' may confuse people unnecessarily.  

It would appear from reading the cited clauses in CSS1 and CSS2 that if the
author wishes the stylesheets to take precedence in CSS-compliant user
agents, the combination of HTML 3.2 presentational attributes and CSS
stylesheets can always be written so that the stylesheet will take
precedence.  It may be a hit-or-miss proposition based on uneven
implementation of the CSS specifications, but the outcome for conforming
UAs seems clear.

It would seem more appropriate to say style sheets "will take precedence"
where supported, or at least "can take precedence" where supported.
