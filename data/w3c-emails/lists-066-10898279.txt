Wendy,

I agree that it is surely a good thing to have ZD-NET recognize the importance
of Web accessibility.  It's too bad that the articles are mostly out of date
and provide information that might have been buried in a pile of old magazines
if not recently collected and posted to the site.

The main piece, Making Your Web Site Accessible: By Liora Alschuler, July 15,
1998, seems very out of date with respect to Bobby, even though it is only a
year old.

Oh well.  Some good, some not so good.  At least they date the articles.

Chuck
