Although everybody seems to love complaining about 
WAI's press coverage, I think that ZDnet's section
is the best piece I read so far about accessibility,
in the general web authoring online magazines.

The major impression the reader is left with is that 
"accessible design is good design" and that the cost of making 
accessible site is essentially the same of making inaccessible 
ones.

True, a great deal of the stuff there is outdated, but it has links 
to other resources that are updated, notably Bobby and the WAI's 
website.

People who want to do accessible sites will go to the 
other resouces after getting a non-threatning 
good impression from ZDnet's site.
