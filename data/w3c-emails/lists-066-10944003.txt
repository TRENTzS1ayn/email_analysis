Chuck,

Thanks for the references. Much of what I read confirms what I've done in
practice over the years using "Learning Styles" theories as guidelines to
develop the broad range of instructional approaches necessary to maximize
learning for each student in class. Early learning style theories suggested
presenting information only in the "strongest" modality, but putting that
into practice brought about the need to provide a class with presentations
in a variety of modality. What CAST identifies as "Universal Design for
Learning" is what has been happening in Learning Styles classrooms and
schools for over a decade. I would enjoy discussing this in depth with you
off the list. 

CAST does an excellent job of translating the modality variation needed
into "high tech" vs the paper-based ways of the past. Unfortunately,
learning style theorists, including my favorite, Rita Dunn, hasn't updated
her classroom suggestions to high tech, and are still based on reams of
index cards. CAST seems to be filling this void. 

Again, I welcome any suggestions or additions to the list of Strategies. 

Anne
