Yes. I think so. HTTP is important for content providing. 

I would go even to a more basic level.
Authors should be first told that they have set 
Content-Type headers correctly rather than write 
"Click with the right mouse button to save the file to disc" 
and only after they do that, we should tell them: also set 
the type attribute in your anchors.

As of now the guidelines note the latter pedantic guideline
but don't mention the more basic one.
