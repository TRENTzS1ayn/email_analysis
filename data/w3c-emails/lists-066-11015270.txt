Raising the profile of LD by mention is a step, but making the attempt to
provide is a greater step that every parent and carer does continuously and
daily, mostly without a theoretical basis.

Theory and practice differ, and it is important to recognise that
theoretical models will be very difficult to achieve.
Proving the whys and wherefores has not stopped the producers and directors
of films, soaps and music yet. It has produced many formulas for success,
mostly financial, a few artistic.

Complex text and complex speech do not need to be tested.

The masses will, and are far more successful at producing entertaining
sites, its finding them that is difficult.
