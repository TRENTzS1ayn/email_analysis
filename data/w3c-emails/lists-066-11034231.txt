>What is available currently for children in the
lowest grades.

I would like to stress this, as suitable reading materials such as News
headlines are very hard to find for adults learning to read.

Ie News headlines are available but self advocacy materials are expensive to
produce and most publishers wish to retain copyright.

This applies to other curricular material as well. It is not just the
problem of creating them, but also it is finding them online.
