Hello all,

We do not have a meeting this week since we scheduled the teleconferences
to be the 2nd and 4th thursdays of the month.  July had a 5th thursday so
our next meeting is next week (12 August).

We're scheduling meetings into September and October that will be every
other Thursday to avoid future confusion.

Thanks,
--wendy
