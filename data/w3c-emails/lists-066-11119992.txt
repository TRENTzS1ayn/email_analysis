Chuck has mentioned research, however he has written to me confirming that
the $2.5 million project

> is not specifically for the web nor specifically for reading and literacy
instruction.

So I am not sure who you imagine is doing or funding this research.
You will understand why I consider this a poor excuse for inaction.

Chuck will express his own concerns better than I can.
