Jonathan, I have to say that I find most of what you post to this list
inaccessible.  Perhaps it is a cognitive disability of my own; I can
see and read the words that you write, but I can't quite find the
meaning.

We want to go somewhere (accessibility for the cognitively
challenged), but we're not sure exactly where (what form that
accessibility should take) or how to get there (what steps to take).
Should we start driving, or look at a map?  Jason and Charles are
suggesting that we send out an expedition and find the way (or WAI)
first, and *then* start moving that way.  You're suggesting that we
simply set out blindly, perhaps praying that we end up where we wanted
to be.  I just don't get it.
