You might take a look at http://www.ipl.org/ for kid appropriate content.

A number of other resources are listed on our Resources web page under Digital
Media / Text (excuse the term) at http://www.cast.org/resources.html.  Many of
the resources include books with images.

We have also created a very basic introduction to the use of images, alt tags
and descriptions at http://www.cast.org/strategies/image_barrier.html.
