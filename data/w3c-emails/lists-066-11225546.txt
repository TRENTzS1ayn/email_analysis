This is a complex subject.
as an analogy imagine taking a photo, now it does represent a part of
reality.
However if we insisted on understanding the semantics of images before using
it we would have problems.

It is a fact that images are more accessible than words to non readers.
To recommend their use is hardly controversial.

However to construct a theory of narrative use of images and its success
with LD is very difficult.
This is tantamount to predicting if a (film) story will be successful, and
this is notoriously difficult.
It has to amuse motivate educate and generally fit the needs of carer and
user, a tall order.

did you look at William Loughborough's reworking of the WAI homepage.

Not to everyone's liking but definitely more accessible to many and I would
guess more people.
