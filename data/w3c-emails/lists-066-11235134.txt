this site evidently has links to many sites that are useful for those
learning to read.

However and this is the crux of why I am saying that research is not
helpful, difficult a position as that is to maintain, it is not directly
accessible to the intended end user but to their carers.

There are a huge number of sites like this available every major charity
concerned with LD has one at least.

WAI needs to produce a page or more that is directly accessible to a
different group than the one it currently helps.

Otherwise why should anyone else? They will cry off that they have not the
research funds....
