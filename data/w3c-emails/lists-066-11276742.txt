The talking browsers must allow viewing of the graphics as well as
highlighting the text being read. They are useless without this feature.

Chuck, children are likely to progress from text-to-speech to reading on
their own when the content permits on their own, because once they can
read, reading is faster than listening to the text read to them. (perhaps
some research to be sure this happens would be in order?) The "even strain"
probably needs to be applied individually rather than to a class at a time,
and will require coordination of the material, the teacher, the student,
and if motivation is critical, the parents and significant others in the
student's life. I'm not sure you can do much with the "even strain" from a
distance.
