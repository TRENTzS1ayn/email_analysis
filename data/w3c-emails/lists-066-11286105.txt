Jonathan, 

You hit the crux of the matter. An initiative that has encouraged the
development of high-tech solutions to reach the blind and the
motor-impaired, low-tech solutions to aid the color-impaired, has a much
smaller task to "recommend" including pictures. The resistence to this
simple solution makes no sense.
