In this area, I am learning, not learned. I'm open to discussion.

I'm curious about your clicking to provide the full image in a second
window. Why do you choose to put it in another window? Is there an
advantage to the visual user? 

The software I use for web authoring does not provide the option to open
another window, but I can link an image to a full-sized version and the
user hits the back key to return to the original page. 

We are discovering, as

Both purpose and individual preferences will always be factors. If the
audience is known, individual preferences may be known. With the wide
audience of the web it may be only possible to guess at individual
preferences, and the result of missing some will cost audience. Purpose
should be an important, if not the most important, consideration. If the
purpose of a site is to teach or inform, and individual preferences aren't
met satisfactorily, the audience will decline, and so will the
"effectiveness" of the site. 

My efforts at finding suitable sites and e-text for a third grader were
more fruitful yesterday than in the past. I have enough e-text or online
reading selections to "last the year", but not enough to be able to sift
through for quality without running out of "stuff". Sites with activities
are available suitably labeled for approximate grade/age use. A big hurdle
is that a lot of sites list "classics", "award winners" and other lists of
books that contain only book title and author, no guess at an age or grade
level preference, or even the subject. It'll be pretty dreary if I have to
go to a library and examine every one of those books (couple hundred) to
find the ones that are useful, then have Taylor look at each of the useful
ones and find the ones with interesting subject matter. Many sites boast
lists of books, but the "classics" are always the same, title and author
only.  

Does CAST have, or have access to a narrative to the classic and award
winning children's books that would include reading/interest levels and a
hint at the subject? If so, you may want to include it in your teacher
resources (and send me a copy or give me the URL please!).
