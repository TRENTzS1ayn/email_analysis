I suspect that you have not heard anyone who is blind using a flat,
non-expressive voice, at 500 words per minute.  Kids often try this too but it
is not unusual for kids using text-to-speech to gain access to subject area
content in spite of reading difficulties to move through the materials faster
than their reading peers.

I am not recommending it as an approach for speed, but it can be faster.  It
is not uncommon for middle school kids to set the reading rate to 225 or 250
words per minute.
