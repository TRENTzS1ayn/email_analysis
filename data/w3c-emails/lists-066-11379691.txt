Are you saying that if computer hadn't been invented we wouldn't have to be
figuring out how to include people with all disabilities to the table?

The same way the picture books site can be functional INCLUDE MEANINGFUL
GRAPHICS so that a user can get to where he or she is going on that site.
It's like putting the picture books on the top-most shelf in the library
--- out of reach to the users without help from others.

Carefully, sincerely, openly and acceptingly. Just as we want folks to act
towards any other accommodation for persons with any disability. I honestly
don't think that the folks first to the table should be turning away the
newcomers. A hearty welcome, along with welcoming accommodations would be
so much better.
