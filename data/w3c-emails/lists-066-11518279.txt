Is the graph of a function equivalent to its equation? I am not sure how
to answer such a question, but I would tend to say that they both express
the same relationship in different ways. However, and more importantly,
the effect of a sound or image is usually to supplement text, and not to
operate as a substitute for it. Charles and I are in agreement that there
is an upper limit to the conceptual complexity that can be conveyed
non-linguistically.

This is why I am arguing that instead of thinking in terms of "non-textual
equivalents to text", we should instead be asking the question: under what
circumstances should non-linguistic (auditory/visual) representations be
provided as an aid to comprehension, and what recommendations can be laid
down in regard to their proper use? Charles and I are in agreement, it
seems, that not every actual and potential document conveys information
that can be represented, or clarified, non-linguistically; but there
remains a significant class of cases in which this is not only possible
but also of positive cognitive benefit. We need to find ways of
characterising these cases and formulating a more precise requirement that
can be practically applied.
