As far as i can tell, W3C's HTML Validator works only with internet IPs and
URLs.  Does the W3C have anything that we can download and use on the
Intranet or for development servers that are behind the firewall.  CSS has a
validator i can download.

I know weblint has something that I can download and use but at a cost.


thanks, rob
