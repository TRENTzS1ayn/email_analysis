In short: detail.

From the HTML 4.0 spec:

The HTML spec doesn't say what the "additional information"
should be. I think the caption should be a short title
for the table (and not that since CAPTION is an element
it can take marked up content) while summary should give
more information about what one can conclude from the
table, the headers of the table, etc. Summary
can only take simple text values.

Hope this helps,
