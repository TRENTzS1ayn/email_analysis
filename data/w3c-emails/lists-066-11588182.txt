No, it is the HTML spec that you need to read for that one I think.

Caption is an element, so whatever you put in there will be displayed, unless
you set it not to display. As an element I think (I haven't checked this)
that you can put links to non-tabular versions, or to graphic equivalents, or
whatever, in it. Summary is an attribute - it doesn't display except if a
browser understands it, and you can only ever have plain text in it.

  In tables, I am not sure what the difference is between caption and summary.
  Maybe I did not read the Techniques close enough.  Anyway, what is the
  difference?
