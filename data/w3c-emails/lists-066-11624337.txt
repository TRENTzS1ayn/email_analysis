Jonathan, I found a site that your folks may enjoy:

 ME AND MY AEROBICS CLASS

http://member.aol.com/AngeIBea/page7/index.htm

I sent it here so that other members can share in a (clean) web site where
the message is in the graphics not the text. Whether you perceive a deep or
shallow meaning from the site is up to you, but the message is in the graphic.

Excuse me if this is inappropriate to share with the group.
