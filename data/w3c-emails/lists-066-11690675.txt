 I've compiled some sources of information that could be culled for the
browser support page.    I've marked the most interesting sources with *'s.
 Note that the last resource has 5 stars, it looks very promising.  most of
 the trace stuff includes how screen readers  interact with browsers.  that
info may not be appropriate for the browser  support page, perhaps someone
(EO?) ought to create a page that tracks issues of interactions between ATs
and UAs?
