aloha, ian!

a minor navigational comment -- although the linear presentation is listed in
the Table of Contents for the Guidelines Impact Matrix, it would be of great
utility if there were a link to the "List Presentation" underneath the "Tabular
Presentation" and a link to the "Tabular Presentation" under the "List
Presentation".

In other words, i'd like to hear something along the following lines, in which
underscores denote the beginning and end of hyperlink text:

TABULAR PRESENTATION  
Each checkpoint links to its definition in the _Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines 1.0_. The following information is available linearly, in a _List
Presentation_

LIST PRESENTATION  
Each checkpoint links to its definition in the _Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines 1.0_. The following information is available in a _Tabular
Presentation_

aloha, jon!

thanks for your response...  i'm not opposed to 2 separate-but-equal versions
of the matrix, and i do appreciate the fact that when you reference the URI for
the UA matrix (especially when posting the agenda), you reference the linear
version...

you asked:
>Do you find the linear version of the issues list usable?

yes, i do find it quite usable, and i appreciate the effort that has gone into
encoding it and which will go into maintaining it...

you also suggested:
>you may want to forward your comments to the gl list for there
>consideration.

this i shall do, along with a copy of my follow-up comments to your questions,
        gregory.
