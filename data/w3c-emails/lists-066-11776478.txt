I find it sad if significant that chuck chose two books by tufte.

There can be no doubt that Tufte's works relate to the discussion between
Charles and Jason.

However it is a very rich field, and in my opinionTufte is far too
pseudo-scientific, how about something emotive.

You seem to be concerned with the compexity of scientific concepts, which by
definition rely on controls.

Emotions are a little more complicated, as is Art.
