Hello,

The WAI Team discussed Triple-A Conformance of some pages and documents
including WCAG 1.0. Checkpoint 14.2 reads:

   14.2 Supplement text with graphic or auditory 
        presentations where they will facilitate
        comprehension of the page. [Priority 3] 

This seems to mean that an all-text document (or one with
text almost exclusively such as the GL home page or the
WCAG 1.0) cannot conform at Level Triple-A. 

I think we discuss this issue at a teleconference.

 - Ian
