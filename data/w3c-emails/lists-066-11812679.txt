PJ:  14.1 has the additional phrase "appropriate for a site's content".
In my opinion that phrase is implied in 14.2,  so, it's not all "all-text
documents" that have
to conform.

PJ:  Yes this should be discussed.  I believe there is a role for the assistive
technology here.
Many tools used by persons with dyslexia, for example Arkenstone's RUBY, add the
highlighting
and audio which render the "all-text" document accessible.  I do NOT believe it
is a
priority 3 for the author to add that functionality when the audience's tools
can handle it.
Lower level audiences' do not have tools that add enough graphics & audio so
more of the
burden is on the author.
