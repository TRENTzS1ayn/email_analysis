 14.2 Supplement text with graphic or auditory 
        presentations where they will facilitate
        comprehension of the page. [Priority 3] 

IJ:: "This seems to mean that an all-text document...cannot conform at
Level Triple-A."

The decision as to what qualifies as "where they will facilitate" is an
easy exit for this since so many on this list and IG have made it clear
that in their humble opinions the addition of graphic or auditory
presentations not only will not facilitate, but in fact inhibit
comprehension.

No matter how deplorable it may be that non-readers are shut out of
access to text, until something more than "wouldn't it be nice if..."
shows up, things like 14.2 can have no effect: i.e. *what* graphics,
etc. will actually be useful? The problem of pinning down what colors
are "effective" is a trivial problem compared to which illustrations are
in fact illustrative and the color debate rages on.

Triple-A in this case is in the mind of the author since the trial judge
would be hard put to argue that the GL home page would demonstrably
improve with the addition of illustrations in the face of opposing views
claiming that they interfere with usability.
