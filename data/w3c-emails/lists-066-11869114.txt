CMcCN:: "provide photos of people using braille devices."

WL: I can't believe that a photo of someone using a braille device would
do anything beyond forcing more scrolls on the reader.  How could this
be of any use? The idea of SMIL examples is clearly valid but if we are
discussing the pages about guideline efforts, the subject matter doesn't
obviously cry out for their inclusion. Perhaps in the
techniques/examples document but not on the WAI page. This is what
you're going to run into when you attempt to decide what illustrations
are appropriate, necessary, sufficient, etc. - a bunch of academics
debating if a picture of someone reading braille improves understanding
of textual materials' accessibility. IMHO this is "Red Herring #6754B".
