It is precisely due to the ambiguous scope and nature of the requirement
that checkpoint 14.2 bears a priority 3 rating. It was introduced in
recognition of the value of multimedia content in facilitating
comprehension. My interpretation would be that the author has a
responsibility to determine whether adding auditory/visual content would
significantly amplify or clarify the information conveyed in the text.

I would argue that checkpoint 14.2 needs to be formulated more precisely,
or to be supplemented by appropriate guidance in the techniques document,
if its priority is ever to be increased.
