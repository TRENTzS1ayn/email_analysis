You don't need to use images in a MAP - it also allows block content (for
example a paragraph, containing a number of links - the standard format for a
text navbar.

Using a MAP and a DIV are effectively the same for authoring, except there is
no need to class a MAP, since it is expected to be a set of links, and you
can also use a single map by reference as an imagemap (somewhat analagous to
the way you can use a single stylesheet).

  Option 2:
  MAP element
  PROs: Currently used for image based navigational bars
  CONs: 
  1. More complex than DIV to author
  2. What if authors did not want to use images in their navigation bars
