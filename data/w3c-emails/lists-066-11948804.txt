Dan Brickley is an RDF automatically build sitemaps type. He is here today,
so I had a bit of a chat to him about the whole thing. We seemed to think
that the title-based navigation was effectively pretending that there are not
semantics already atached to the element types, which seems like a backward
step.

Not that we have managed to solve the entire problem (yet *grin*). But he did
also provide this pointer to similar work that is (or perhaps was) going on
in the Mozilla project.

Subject: hiding / identifying HTML navigation


the (out of date) todo list at http://www.mozilla.org/rdf/doc/ntd.html
says:
Hiding html navigation

Many pages have a simple html based sitemap which should be hidden if
nav center is visible. The
portion of html which should be hidden should be placed within
<navigation>...</navigation> 

Need to hack the html parser (and/or layout engine) so that this portion
of the html gets thrown out if
the navcenter is open.

This is a bit, er, hacky. I think there was some discussion of using CSS
classes instead. The same thing is being discussed[1] by the Web
Accessibility Initiative[2] right now so if someone could point to any
more recent thinking on this I'd be grateful.

cheers,
