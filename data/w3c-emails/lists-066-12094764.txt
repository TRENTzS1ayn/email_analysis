The ALT attribute of the AREA element is the mechanism provided for in the
HTML 3.2 and 4.0 specifications. It seems reasonable to require user
agents to support this capability. Likewise, it is difficult to envisage
how, in a braille or speech context, the active regions of a client-side
image map could be rendered other than via text (there may be other
indicators, such as audible cues, but surely in almost all cases, a
textual label would be necessary).

I think we need further discussion of the alternatives before accepting
Ian's proposal.
