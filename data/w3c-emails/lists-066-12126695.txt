I think we have enough work to justify meet weekly.  I, however, will never
be able to stay longer than 1 hr 10 min because of an unbreakable family
obligation.

So, although it was not one of your options, my first choice would be for
weekly, 1-hour meetings starting as soon as possible.

Second choice, weekly 1.5 hour meetings from which I have to depart early.
