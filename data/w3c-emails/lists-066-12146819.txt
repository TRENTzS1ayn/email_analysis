Sounds OK to me, except that <map>....</p> needs to be changed in the
example.

Actually I would suggest that we review our examples and make them into XHTML
examples, or provde equivalent XHTML examples, in the event that XHTML
becomes a recommendation.

  per yesterday's discussion, here is my proposal for rewording the section
  in the techniques document that discusses grouping and bypassing links.
  
  4.6.1 Grouping and bypassing links
  
  When links are grouped into logical sets (for example, a navigation bar
  that appears on every page in a site) they should be marked up as a unit.
  Navigation bars are usually the first thing someone encounters on a page.
  For users with speech synthesizers, this means hearing the same links on
  every page before reaching the interesting content of a page. Other
  keyboard users, such as some users with physical disabilities, will have to
  tab through all of these links to reach links further down the page.  Note:
  this is not true for all browsers.
  
  We suggest using the MAP element with the title "attribute" to group and
  label the links.  There are  a number of ways to allow users to jump past
  the group of links.
  
       The first link in the group skips over the set of navigation links
  when selected.     
       Provide a style sheet that allows users to hide the set of navigation
  links.
       Provide a script that shows or hides the set of navigation links as
  desired by the user.
  
  The first option seems to be compatible with yesterday's, today's, and
  tomorrow's browsers.  The other two options are not as backwards compatible
  but may be more useful in the future. 
  
  In the future, user agents will allow users to skip over elements such as
  navigation bars. 
  
  Example.
  
  In this example, the MAP element groups a set of links, the "title"
  attribute gives it a human readable label, the "class" attribute identifies
  it as a navigation bar (e.g., for style sheets), and a link at the
  beginning of the group
  
  links to the anchor after the group. 
  
     <HEAD>
     <TITLE>How to use our site</TITLE>
     </HEAD>
     <BODY>     
       <MAP title="Navigation bar" class="nav">    
         [<A href="#how">Bypass navigation bar</A>]
         [<A href="home.html">Home</A>]
         [<A href="search.html">Search</A>]
         [<A href="new.html">New and highlighted</A>]
         [<A href="sitemap.html">Site map</A>]
       </P>     
       <H1><A name="how">How to use our site</A></H1>
     <!-- content of page -->     
     </BODY>     
  
  End example.
  
  
  
  the current wording in the techniques document
  (http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TECHS-19990505/#group-bypass):
  
  4.6.1 Grouping and bypassing links
  
  When links are grouped into logical sets (for example, in a navigation bar
  that appears on every page in a site) they should be marked up as a unit.
  Navigation bars are usually the first thing someone encounters on a
  page. For users with speech synthesizers, this means having to hear a
  number of links on every page before
  reaching the interesting content of a page. There are several ways to allow
  users to bypass groups of links (as
  users with vision do when they see the same set on each page):
  
       Include a link that allows users to skip over the set of navigation
  links. 
       Use the HTML 4.0 "tabindex" attribute to allow users to jump to an
  anchor after the set of
       navigation links. This attribute is not yet widely supported. 
       Provide a style sheet that allows users to hide the set of navigation
  links. 
  
  In the future, user agents will allow users to skip over elements such as
  navigation bars. 
  
  In HTML, use the DIV, SPAN, P, or FRAME elements to group links then
  identify the group with the "id" or
  "class" attributes. 
  
  Example.
  
  In this example, the P element groups a set of links, the "class" attribute
  identifies it as a navigation bar (e.g.,
  for style sheets), "tabindex" is set on an anchor following the group, and
  a link at the beginning of the group
  links to the anchor after the group. 
  
     <HEAD>
     <TITLE>How to use our site</TITLE>
     </HEAD>
     <BODY>     
       <P class="nav">    
         [<A href="#how">Bypass navigation bar</A>]
         [<A href="home.html">Home</A>]
         [<A href="search.html">Search</A>]
         [<A href="new.html">New and highlighted</A>]
         [<A href="sitemap.html">Site map</A>]
       </P>     
       <H1><A name="how" tabindex="1">How to use our site</A></H1>
