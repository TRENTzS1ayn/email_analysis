Visually the bypassing text ([<A href="#how">Bypass navigation bar</A>])
takes too much space. Can we hide it when links are shown on a screen?

Maybe the link is not even needed later if the ua can skip over structures
with different hierarchical levels. Should that be mentioned in the text?

Also I think it would be good to say that the ultimate goal is to be able
to mark-up the central content and the navigation bars so that the user can
jump between them. For instance, a user trying to create a mental model of
a site or searching something might want to read the content or part of the
content, and jump to a named navigation bar every now and then to get to
other parts of the site (or page) or to find out at what part of the site
he is at the moment.
