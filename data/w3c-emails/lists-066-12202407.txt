I am note sure, but I think there were dependent agents (screen readers) that
didn't separate links lacking normal text between them. I don't know of any that
have that problem today. So if the recommendation to separate links with normal
text is still there, it probably should be removed.

That's unfortunate, because I had been going to extra trouble to
separate active links with non-active non-blank characters just like
that, as a result of an earlier accessibility recommendation :-}

While I guess we'll all agree that this business is built on
compromise, I'm now wondering whether the optimal compromise may have
shifted...?

best regards
