I think that for the moment, the most common way to satisfy the requirement
will be by using text in an alt attribute. I think that Ian's proposal does
not obscure the requirement that links in image maps are accessible. I think
it misses the requirement that the links are identifiable in a device
independent manner. With this small change made I think we should accept the
proposal.

  The ALT attribute of the AREA element is the mechanism provided for in the

  agents to support this capability. Likewise, it is difficult to envisage
  how, in a braille or speech context, the active regions of a client-side
  image map could be rendered other than via text (there may be other
  indicators, such as audible cues, but surely in almost all cases, a
  textual label would be necessary).
  
  I think we need further discussion of the alternatives before accepting
  Ian's proposal.
