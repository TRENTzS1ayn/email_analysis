Here's one mistake in the w3c accessibility guidelines:

"Synthesized speech is critical for individuals who are blind and for many
people with the reading difficulties that often accompany cognitive
disabilities, learning disabilities, and deafness."  (Guideline 1)

Maybe just too much info in one sentence, but it implies that synthesized
speech is critical for the deaf.
