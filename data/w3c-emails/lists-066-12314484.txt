Is ER the most appropriate group?  This proposal rings with "user testing"
in my ears, and I think that the UA group is closest to the users.  However
there is no "user testing" component in any of the group's charter. 

As mentioned before, I am working on proposed edits to the Navigation and
Validation sections of the Techniques document.
