Hi Al,

I need a few words of clarification:

How do you define "site structural plan?"  How does a person go about
designing one?  What information does it need to include?  Are there
examples that we can point people to?  Is this similar to the CSUN
guidelines for how to submit electronic documents to the CSUN annual
conference (refer to http://www.csun.edu/cod/conf2000/00call.html#9)?  Or
more along the lines of the "Navigation Templates" in Sun's new design
(refer to http://www.sun.com/980113/sunonnet/)?  Or a bit of both?

this seems like part of the "what" of the plan described above.
