My suggestion would be to avoid confusing the reader: 

"Synthesized speech is/may be critical for individuals who are
blind/visually impaired and for many people with reading difficulties that
often accompany cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities." 

Speaking difficulties and deafness may or may not be present in persons
with cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities. Speech synthesis
isn't going to be of much help to the deaf, or to those with speech
impairments, so why confuse the reader by mentioning them.
