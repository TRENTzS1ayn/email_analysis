I have heard it said, however, that some people with hearing
impairments find synthesized speech to be of substantial benefit and
easier to listen to than human speech in certain cases. It would
probably be better to avoid confusing the issue by not mentioning this
observation in the guidelines; the sentence in question should be
treated as an erratum and rewritten, with appropriate notification on
the errata page. It is a minor explanatory error.
