Wendy mentioned in the last teleconference that the chairs and editors
were hoping to establish a weekly, 1.5 hour meeting schedule,
maintaining the current Thursday 2000 UTC (4 PM Boston time)
allocation.

Am I correct in presuming that there will be no such meeting this
week, but that a new schedule may start next week, with a meeting on 9
September?
