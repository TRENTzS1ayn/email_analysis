Hello all,

Please note that the first 4 items on next week's agenda are reports on
action items from the last four meetings (back through the beginning of
July!).  There are several items that I know are complete, but there are
several more that we haven't heard about for a while.  Therefore, please
check through the action item summaries to see if you took responsibility
for finishing an item.  This gives you a little less than a week to get it
done if you haven't started it yet! <grin>

I propose that we start each meeting this way so that we can continue
making the kind of progress that we made earlier in the summer. 

be well,
