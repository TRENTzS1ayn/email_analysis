I agree with Charles that the OBJECT element is much more flexible
than the LONGDESC attribute, and that its use should be encouraged.
The nested structure of OBJECT permits various alternative
representations of a multimedia resource to be provided easily,
including a written description with block-level markup. It should be
remembered that LONGDESC is essentially an attempt to mittigate the
access consequences resulting from the inadequacies of the IMG
element, which were rectified in HTML 4.0 with the introduction of
OBJECT.
