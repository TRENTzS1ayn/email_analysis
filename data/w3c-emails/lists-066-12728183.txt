For Checkpoint 11.3, "Provide information so that users may receive documents
according to their preferences"

The Techniques Document has the following example:

"1) Instead of including links such as "Here is the French version of this
document", use content negotiation so that the French version is served to
clients requesting French versions of documents."

I have never seen markup (or scripting) that actually shows how to do content
negotiation.  I honestly don't even know if it is only something that can be
done server-side or if it can be done client-side. 

I need to include a meaningful example in the EO WCAG Curriculum that will show
students how to actually do it (or what it means to be able to do it), and  be
able to explain the concept in a few words.  

I also can't think of any reason that the same example couldn't be included in
the WCAG Techniques document, since the current example isn't really an example
at all.

Thanks in advance,
Chuck Letourneau
