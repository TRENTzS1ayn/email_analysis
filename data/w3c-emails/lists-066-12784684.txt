I followed up the example that Max suggested (
http://www.w3.org/1999/08/smil-pressrelease), setting Netscape's language
preference to French (fr) and received the following message. Seems like
"negotiation" is a little strong a concept for whats going on.

>Message when language set to French:
>Not Acceptable
>An appropriate representation of the requested resource
/1999/08/smil-pressrelease
>could not be found on this server.
>Available variants:

Is this HTTP protocol? It seems as though: if you have *no* language specified,
server delivers a default. If you have a language defined, the server tries to
deliver that language version, and presents a list of language editions
available otherwise. Is that the net of this content negotiation.

I'm nottoo sure if this is a kind of information you need, or I don't
know too much about it, but ...

First, I don't know any markup or scripting to enable content
negotiation.  At least I couldn't find any markup for this purpose
within HTML 4.0 specification.  I guess maybe there is some scripting
technique, but I'm not familiar with kinds of scripting used on the
Web at all.

Typically, document provider prepares several files for the documenht,
one file for each language and/or character encoding, etc. to put on a
server that has capability for content negotiation.  (Most popular
servers have this function nowadays, I think.)  If the document in
question has English version and Japanese version, they would be named
as foobar.html.en and foobar.html.ja.

On the client-side, user would set the preferred language.  Lynx has
an item for this in its options menu.  If you set this preference to
``ja'', for examples, and access foobar.html, the server returns
foobar.html.ja.  If you don't set this option, the server returns the
document in the default language, which is configured by server
administrator.

You can find a real-world example at:
http://www.w3.org/1999/08/smil-pressrelease
with ``ja'' set to the language preference in your browser, you get
the Japanese version.

     Cheers,
Max
