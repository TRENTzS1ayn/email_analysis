Sort of. According to RFC 2616 (HTTP/1.1 latest dratf standard)
When a client specifies languages that are not available the server can do
two different things:
1. return a 406 error message listing the avialable alternatives.
   This is what the example does. HTTP does not specify exactly how to
write the HTML.
   In my view the returned document could be more human friendly. E.g.:

Choose your preferred language
The document you requested is not available in the language(s) the 
you most prefer.

Available versions:
   SMIL press release (English)
   SMIL press release (Japanese) [this should be written in Japanese; both 
                                  should be active links]

2. The second option permitted by the spec. is to return the document in
some default 
   language (as the server does if no language priorities were stated by
the client)

It is up to the content provider to decide, which option to take, what is the 
default language, and how to write the 406 error message.
