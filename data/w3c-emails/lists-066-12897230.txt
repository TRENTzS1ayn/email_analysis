An oversight?

Checkpoint 7.3 - "Until user agents allow users to freeze moving content,
avoid movement in pages." points to section 4.9.2 - "Visual information and
motion"
in the Technique document.  

However, there is no mention of freezing motion in section 4.9.2.

Was the intent of this checkpoint to require script or program writers to
include a PAUSE/STOP control with their applets or plug ins that cause or
allow moving content?

Are the STOP and PAUSE buttons on the QuickTime and RealPlayer consoles
examples of this checkpoint and technique?
