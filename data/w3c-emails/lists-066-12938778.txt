I agree with the conclusion that a claim of conformance includes a claim that
equivalents are valid. I think that in fact there is only ever a claim for
this - there is no test by which it can be absolutely determined that a given
"candidate equivalent" in Eric's terminology is in fact valid, just an
assertion that it is sufficient.

  It seems to me that any conformance claim implies a claim that equivalents 
  are either validated or validatable. It does not imply that any specific 
  techniques (e.g., Appendix A - Validation) have actually been followed. Of 
  course, use of the techniques may make the claim more easily defensible.
