I'll try to answer some of these unresolved issues.
It should be pointed out that some are addressed by other 
work groups of WAI and some in other activities of W3C.

The answers are embedded in the text of the original message.

In HTML:
<object> and <applet> element's content (excluding the param elements if
available)
<img> the alt attribute.
for <frameset> I would say <noframes>

There are no specific limitations beyond common sense. This applies also 
to paragraphs and headings, and may depend on the type of content, language
etc.
It would be difficult to quantify.

It could be that alt="" is OK if the image is supplementary 
and all its content is fully available in the text, or if the paragraph is 
right after the image.

A relevant example to your query might be a server side image map. In this
case 
the alt text may say "Navigation links are at the bottom of the page"
(if there is a chunk of content between the map and the text navigation
links.)

No. The user agent should be able to find the longdesc attribute.

In the case of longdesc attribute, the HTML specification say that's its 
value is a URI. The server side image map example I gave above uses human
language
because alt text is human language.

This is a reformulation of issue 1, I think. Unless I am missing something.

Depend on what you are doing. For example nested object elements specify 
a sequence of equivalents. But you may consider just puting a list of links 
to an image, a video clip, or whatever, and the text should made it clear 
that these are alternatives. You may also provide alternatives using HTTP
content 
negotiation.

I would say that giving the user the alternative that suits him 
best automatically is better, but limitation of HTTP, HTML and their 
implementation in current browsers may dictate otherwise in some cases. 

The guidelines do not address this in detail because they attempt to be
stable.
The techniques document, which may be revised independently of the
guidelines, 
addresses these issuses in greater detail.

Generally there should be that for any given disability there should be at
least 
one accessible equivalent. That is providing an image as the only equivalent 
to a video clip is not good enough.

alt text and longdesc should not be used to give "another language
equivalent".
Current specifications such as HTTP (content negotiation) or HTML (the link
element) allow 
to specify "a language equivalent" to a complete document. This issue may
be improved
(e.g. specifying alternatives fragments) in future versions of these or
other specifications, but belongs to the internationalization activity of
W3C.

Use <object> instead of <img>

This is an internationalization issue. It has some aspects regarding 
accessibility, and somewhat addressed in the techniques document.
(1) HTTP content negotiation is the preferred technique, and (2) different
HTML 
documents in different languages can refer to each other via <link> and (3)
simple anchors at the begining of each document as a fall back in case the
previous two
didn't work (due to poor implementation in the user agent).

I would use all three simultaneously. If browsers were to implement <link> 
in some reasonable way (as Lynx does) the third option would not be needed.

How title and summary are presented are mainly a user agent issue. Although
giving authors a clue how they are implemented should be helpful for writing 
this content well. This is not done in current guidelines or techniques due
to lack of 
implementations at this point.

The general answer is that title is not for equivalents. It is for giving
suplementary information.  One exception would be <frame> where title may
serve as "a link 
description" to the function of the frame. This is shortcoming of HTML, or
more 
precisely of the way frames were imposed on HTML by Netscape.

The title of <link> also serves as a link description but it suplements 
the rev and rel attributes (although these are optional).
