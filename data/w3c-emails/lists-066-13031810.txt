It would be a misuse of MAP to use it for anything but navigation.
Thus, in a sense, a user agent may suppose that all MAPs are
for navigation (even if they may differ in structure).

I think this is about semantics, not presentation. Therefore, for
HTML one could add an element specifically to create navigation bars
(e.g.,
the BANNER element in HTML 3 as pointed out by Bert Bos). Or, 
one could write a schema that includes vocabulary for navigation
bars. This would provide definitive information to any
user agent that recognized the schema.
