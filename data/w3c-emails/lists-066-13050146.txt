ND  
  In HTML:
  <object> and <applet> element's content (excluding the param elements if
  available)
  <img> the alt attribute.
  for <frameset> I would say <noframes>
CMN
I am not sure I understand. Are you asking whrere the user looks for
equivalent content? In that case it is important to make that clear in
techniques (by including information such as Nir ahs given) and there is a
dependency between this group and the user agent guidelines to make sure they
are interpreting the specifications the same way.
   
EH

ND  
  There are no specific limitations beyond common sense. This applies also 
  to paragraphs and headings, and may depend on the type of content, language
  etc.
  It would be difficult to quantify.
CMN
In fact there is a limitation - the element including the pointy brackets can
eba maximum of 64k in size. In practice the alt text should be as concise as
possible consistent with it fulfilling its function. That's about as much as
can be said - some things simply do not reduce to simple numeric expressions.

ND  
  It could be that alt="" is OK if the image is supplementary 
  and all its content is fully available in the text, or if the paragraph is 
  right after the image.
  
  A relevant example to your query might be a server side image map. In this
  case 
  the alt text may say "Navigation links are at the bottom of the page"
  (if there is a chunk of content between the map and the text navigation
  links.)
CMN
I think Nir's answer is good. I would prefer to have alt="illustration " in
order to be clear that there is one. I wuld far prefer to have

  <object type="image/svg" data="illustration.svg">
    <object type="image/png" data="illustration.png">
      <p>A <a href="illustration">simple graphic diagram</a> is also
      available</p>
    </object>
  </object>

EH

ND  
  No. The user agent should be able to find the longdesc attribute.

ND  
  In the case of longdesc attribute, the HTML specification say that's its 
  value is a URI. The server side image map example I gave above uses human
  language
  because alt text is human language.
CMN
I agree with Nir

ND  
  This is a reformulation of issue 1, I think. Unless I am missing something.
CMN
This actually seems like issue 4 with a different perspective. Where it is
not explicit in markup (for example a longdesc is explicitly associated with
a particular object) it should either be done in the content of the document
itself (e.g., "the following mathematical formula shows that gravity gets
exponentially weaker as objects move farther apart"), or (in the future
perhaps) as machine-readable metadata. 
  
EH

  >simply an elaboration of #3.)
ND  
  Depend on what you are doing. For example nested object elements specify 
  a sequence of equivalents. But you may consider just puting a list of links 
  to an image, a video clip, or whatever, and the text should made it clear 
  that these are alternatives. You may also provide alternatives using HTTP
  content 
  negotiation.
  
  I would say that giving the user the alternative that suits him 
  best automatically is better, but limitation of HTTP, HTML and their 
  implementation in current browsers may dictate otherwise in some cases. 
  
  The guidelines do not address this in detail because they attempt to be
  stable.
  The techniques document, which may be revised independently of the
  guidelines, 
  addresses these issuses in greater detail.
CMN
Agreed - this is a good technique in the absence of a mechanism for doing it
in a machine-comprehensible way (such a mechanism is provided by SMIL, and
hopefully in SMIL 2 it will in fact be much more powerful.

ND  
  Generally there should be that for any given disability there should be at
  least 
  one accessible equivalent. That is providing an image as the only equivalent 
  to a video clip is not good enough.  
CMN
Currently there is no markup which allow the specification of multiple
alternatives. This is one of the areas where the adoption of RDF and the move
to XML will allow us to create much richer markup. At a page-by-page level it
can be done using PICS already (this is implemented in plenty of browsers).
There is some very good work in this area being done in the UK.
  
The Protocols and formats group are looking at this issue. The hows are a lot
more complex than the whats and whys, which are what I think is n the
province of WCAG.

ND  
  alt text and longdesc should not be used to give "another language
  equivalent".
  Current specifications such as HTTP (content negotiation) or HTML (the link
  element) allow 
  to specify "a language equivalent" to a complete document. This issue may
  be improved
  (e.g. specifying alternatives fragments) in future versions of these or
  other specifications, but belongs to the internationalization activity of
  W3C.

  Use <object> instead of <img>

ND  
  This is an internationalization issue. It has some aspects regarding 
  accessibility, and somewhat addressed in the techniques document.
  (1) HTTP content negotiation is the preferred technique, and (2) different
  HTML 
  documents in different languages can refer to each other via <link> and (3)
  simple anchors at the begining of each document as a fall back in case the
  previous two
  didn't work (due to poor implementation in the user agent).
  
  I would use all three simultaneously. If browsers were to implement <link> 
  in some reasonable way (as Lynx does) the third option would not be needed.
CMN
This is in fact a crossover issue -  how does one handle the use of signed
languages such as Auslan, BSL and ASL as alternatives? One answer is to use
SMIL. Another approach is to use object and allow for content negotiation.
  
This is probably an open issue for techniques in this group.

ND  
  How title and summary are presented are mainly a user agent issue. Although
  giving authors a clue how they are implemented should be helpful for writing 
  this content well. This is not done in current guidelines or techniques due
  to lack of 
  implementations at this point.

ND  
  The general answer is that title is not for equivalents. It is for giving
  suplementary information.  One exception would be <frame> where title may
  serve as "a link 
  description" to the function of the frame. This is shortcoming of HTML, or
  more 
  precisely of the way frames were imposed on HTML by Netscape.
  
  The title of <link> also serves as a link description but it suplements 
  the rev and rel attributes (although these are optional).
CMN
I think Nir has answered these pretty well.
