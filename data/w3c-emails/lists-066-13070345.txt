MK: In SMIL title is strongly recommended for every element, so it would be
too bad it that could not be used to give brief characterization of the
element (I thought that is the function of title anyway?). Some elements in
SMIL don't have any other information available e.g. A and ANCHOR elements
(even the link text in A is outside the SMIL doc, there is only a URI to a
file containing the text).

I think we just have different levels of equivalency starting from title,
which is not always very clear, alt that tries to express function more
verbosely, and longdesc that tries to give the most complete equivalent
description.
