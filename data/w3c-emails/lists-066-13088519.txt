Title should be used to give what Marja calls a brief characterisation and
Nir calls supplementary information, in a natural language form. This might
be one part of the equivalence puzzle, but it is not a detailed decription of
the object, nor a functional replacement, although it might in some cases be
reusable as a functional replacement.

Marja is right - there are a number of pieces in the equivalence puzzle. One
of the challenges we have faced (and I think WCAG has resolved it as well as
possible given the pieces currently existing) is how those pieces relate to
each other.

  MK: In SMIL title is strongly recommended for every element, so it would be
  too bad it that could not be used to give brief characterization of the
  element (I thought that is the function of title anyway?). Some elements in
  SMIL don't have any other information available e.g. A and ANCHOR elements
  (even the link text in A is outside the SMIL doc, there is only a URI to a
  file containing the text).
  
  I think we just have different levels of equivalency starting from title,
  which is not always very clear, alt that tries to express function more
  verbosely, and longdesc that tries to give the most complete equivalent
  description.
