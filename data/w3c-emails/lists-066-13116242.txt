The entry in the errata page might read something like this:
3.  Clarification of rationale for Guideline 1
Added: 17 September 1999
Class: clarification
The rationale for Guideline 1 says "...Synthesized
speech is critical for individuals who are blind and for many people with
the reading difficulties that often accompany cognitive disabilities,
learning disabilities, and deafness...." It should say, "Synthesized speech
is critical for individuals who are blind and for many people with reading
disabilities."
