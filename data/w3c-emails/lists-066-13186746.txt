it is actually only inline content in the example. I think it must be block
in HTML4.0
In anycase <map name="foo"><p>...some links</p></map> should do it.

what do you mean "does not handle"? does it render the content or not?

example)

You mean they render the content, right? That what Netscape4.6, IE5.0,
Opera3.60 and 
Lynx2.8.2 do for me. (I used a <p>..</p> inside the map in my test.)

>3. Amaya does not even render the MAP of your example.

That's a bug in Amaya, (reported already by Charles McCathieNeville to the
Amaya mailing list) but it practicallly doesn't matter since people are
using Amaya 
only as a fifth browser. (people use for authoring, testing pages in yet
another 
browser, etc. It is a testbed browser; not exactly designed for usability 
and mass consumption anyways)

Didn't get that. Please explain.

The conclusion is that block content in MAP is rendered by quite a lot of
browsers.
(it would desirable to check also Netscape 3, and IE4 and 3)
on the other hand, realy making an image map out of it is not supported.
