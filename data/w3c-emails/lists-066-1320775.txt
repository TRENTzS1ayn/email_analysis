I've been having trouble sending responses to the mailing list. Could
someone please forward it to everyone if this letter doesn't go through
as I intended? Thanks!

Hello Everyone,  
  
Personally, I feel that 4.Web Site Accessibility Guidelines most closely
describes what it is we're trying to do. If I were to suggest another
name, however, it would be:

"Guidelines for Accessible Web Sites" which I think is closer to the
spoken form of the concept and therefore easier to understand. 

Also, in having read some other suggestions, please remember that the
point of a title is to describe the content in a simple, easily
understood way. 

Sincerely, 

Dave Trendler

Hello,

We would like to spend one last round discussing what to name
the
guidelines document.  The following is a summary of the
discussions up to
this point.  Ideally, we would like to wrap up this discussion
by this
Friday, but understand that the holiday season is fast
approaching.  Could
you please send any comments regarding the 5 suggestions below,
or propose
another alternative?  Since this issues requires coordination
with the
other working groups, a final summary will be sent to the
Coordination
Group for discussion.


In the current title ("WAI Page Author Guidelines") "Page
Author" is not
appropriate since persons usually
author more than a single page. There is consensus that:

   1.The title should reflect that it addresses more than just a
single
page in isolation. 
   2.The phrase "Universal Design" should not be used in the
title since it
carries so many negative connotations (so "Universal Design
Guidelines for
WWW Documents" is out). 
   3.We don't want to focus in on particular technologies (so
"HTML and CSS
Accessible Design
     Guidelines" is out). 

Proposals

   1.Web Author Guidelines 
   2.Site Author Guidelines 
   3.Web Content Accessible Guidelines. 
   4.Web Site Accessibility Guidelines 
   5.W3C Web Accessibility Initiative Author Guidelines (then
make other
groups - W3C WAI User
     Agent Guidelines and W3C WAI Authoring Tools Guidelines) 


Thanks,
