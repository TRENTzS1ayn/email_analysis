My prefence is not to rely totally upon the HTTP content negotiation
when users can choose from multiple languages/content types.  Even
when the server supports the content negotiation and the document is
provided in a way that can make use of the content negotiation
mechanism, it would be better to have links pointing to different
versions of the file.  The reasons I prefer this are:

1. As far as I know, there are not too many people who have set their
   browsers to make use of this mechanism.

2. Browsers used in an shared environment may not be configured in a
   way that certain user would do.

In both cases, users would have no idea if the file is available in
different language if there were no links to other versions included
in the page.

If browsers have easier-to-use interface to configure the language
preferences, the case 1 above can be easily resolved, though.

    Cheers,
Max
