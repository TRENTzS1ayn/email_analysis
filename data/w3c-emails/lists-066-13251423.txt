I agree. One should use both content negotiation and have links to 
alternative versions. there are several other reasons:
There are clients who should read all versions. Namely indexing robots.

In addition, returning 406 messages is problematic since IE5 repaces the
message
with its own "friendly message" that says that the server could not preform
the 
request, without listing alternatives, leaving the user in a dead end. It
is better 
to return an unacceptable response and let the user choose whether he wants
to 
read it, to follow a link to an alternative or not read anything.

Nir.
