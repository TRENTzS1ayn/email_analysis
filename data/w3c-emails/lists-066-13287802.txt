One should be careful about the type of negotiation.

For example most browsers DO send an accept- header that corresponds
correctly 
to the images that they can handle internally, so negotiating GIF and PNG 
can be done and will work.

We actually need to do a more carful research in what browsers support and how
concerning content negotiation and http.

Regards,
Nir.
