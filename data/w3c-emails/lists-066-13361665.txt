What's the best way of replacing/completing a javascript that fetches
a new page using an onchange event on a FORM SELECT ?

This is usually done on a page to cut on the number of "activate" the
user has to go thru: one instead of two.
e.g.

<FORM name="f1">
<SELECT name="s1" 
        onchange="window.location =
                    document.f1.s1.options [
                      document.f1.s1.selectedIndex].value"> 
<OPTION VALUE="http://www.site.com">Go to Site1</OPTION>
<OPTION VALUE="http://www.joe.com">Go to Joe</OPTION>
....etc

As you can see, no submit button, no FORM action.
(invalid HTML among other things)

For non-script aware agents, one would have to add a submit button
next to the SELECT, an action to the FORM, and have a server
script/cgi at the other end of the action handling the redirect to the
new page.

My question: is it better to have this server program (CGI or else)
use HTML redirect, that is, return a simple HTML document with

 <META http-equiv="refresh" content="0,http://www.site.com">

or operate directly at the HTTP level by returning a "303 See Other"
HTTP reply ?
