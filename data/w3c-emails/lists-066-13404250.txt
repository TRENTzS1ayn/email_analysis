Dear Wendy et al.,

It is, um, "interesting" for sure.

It worked nice on my first pass and my first response was "WOW!  How did 
they get ACCESSKEY to do that?"

This is "just" stupid javascript tricks, which is not covered by the WCAG.

The page is not nearly as function with Lynx or older browsers.

The page is P1 compliant at best, since it does not parse through the W3C 
validator.

Really it is not P1 either, since in a few places the ALT reads like 
"looker.gif (1665 bytes)" for the graphical horizontal rule (and a few 
other places too).

At the very least, the Keyboard Navigation section of accessinfo.htm should 
have a disclaimer that the hot keys only work with the 4x (?) versions of 
IE and Navigator.

Boy, am I a wet blanket or what?

Bruce Bailey
