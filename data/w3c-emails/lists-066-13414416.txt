Bruce,

I hadn't looked at the rest of the page for accessibility, but thanks for 
pointing out that it's not.  I was just passing on an interesting use of 
javascript and "accesskeys".

Note that the example has implications for browsers like opera that use 
keys without modifiers for browser navigation and to change user 
preferences.  for example, opera uses the "e" and "d" keys to move forwards 
and backwards through elements, and "g" to turn graphics on and off.  "r" 
is used to reply to news articles.

which is too bad because i thought it worked really well (using netscape).

just fyi - the short cut key puzzle continues.
