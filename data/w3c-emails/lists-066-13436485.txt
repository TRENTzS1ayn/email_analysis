yes, that is odd.  I don't have a good response.  We do seem to have 
overlooked this.

yes.  We used to discuss the example that we created of a java marquee that 
could be paused.  it is still referenced from the "services" see 
[TRACE]  The Trace Research & Development Center. Consult this site for a 
variet of information about accessibility, including a scrolling Java 
applet that may be frozen by the user.

I would say yes.

I have added this issue to the open issues list for the Techniques document.
