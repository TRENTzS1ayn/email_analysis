Ian,

The HTML WG agreed to this change yesterday at their telephone conference

Best wishes,

Steven

> Steven,

> The HTML 4.01 Proposed Recommendation [1] includes
> some changes to the content model of the MAP element [2]
> to allow mixing of block content and AREA elements:
>
> <!ELEMENT MAP - - ((%block;) | AREA)+ -- client-side image map -->
>
> This change was incorporated into HTML 4.0 [3] to allow authors
> to create richer non-graphical alternatives to image maps.
> The HTML 4.0 Recommendation used the wrong content model,
> however, but HTML 4.01 corrects that mistake.

> In HTML 4.01, the following text describes the role of

>
> <BLOCKQUOTE>
>    2. Block-level content. This content should include
>       A elements that specify the geometric regions of the
>       image map and the link associated with each region.
>       Note that the user agent may render block-level
>       content of a MAP element. Authors should use this
>       method to create more accessible documents.
> </BLOCKQUOTE>

> I am proposing two changes to the description of MAP,
> again to promote accessibility. The goal of the proposal
> is to make it easier for users of speech
> synthesizers and users with motor impairments
> to bypass navigation bars (groups of links).
> These groups of links often appear first on a page
> and are often repeated on many pages of a site. Often,
> the users cited must wade through numerous links
> before getting to important content on the page.
>
> If user agents can suppose that MAP may be used
> to identify navigation bars (or other navigation
> mechanisms), they can offer navigation bar
> hide/display functionality. The HTML 4.01 specification
> does not prohibit the use of MAP for general navigation
> mechanisms, but this proposal will make it more obvious
> that this is possible.
>
> The proposal involves two changes:
>
> Change 1) Change the second sentence of the above
>           quoted text to "User agents should
>           render block-level content of the MAP element." The
>           change is from "may render" to "should render".
>
>           In a number of current browsers tested, block-level
>           content is rendered, so this change conforms to
>           current practice and will not break pages.
>
> Change 2) Change the first sentence of section 13.6.1's
>           description of the MAP element from:
>
>            <BLOCKQUOTE>
>             The MAP element specifies a client-side
>             image map that may be associated with one or more
>             elements (IMG, OBJECT, or INPUT).
>            </BLOCKQUOTE>
