This sounds like an enforcement issue.  Conformance claims need to be
evaluated in terms of the widely available technology when the content
claiming to conform was published.

It is not clear that a separate date is needed for the conformance
evaluation apart from the [last-change] date of the server resource. 

If one wants to date selective stuff in the page we should follow DSIG
practices and not re-invent this paricular wheel.
