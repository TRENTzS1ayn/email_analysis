I am wondering whether it is better to define SVG symbols with a desc as
child of the symbol, or to have a desc and a use as siblings.

The benefit of having the desc defined within the symbol is that it reduces
teh amount of work required, and provides a simple mechanism to ensure that
people can use well--described graphic elements from libraries. The benefit
of having it as a sibling for a use element is that it is easier to write a
player that does not need to dereference the URI of the use element. But it
seems like that would only really apply to a generic XML renderer that used
a style sheet to render some textual content, and make no use of Xlink.

Which seems to me like the sort of user agent that is basically broken, and
need not be considered a use scenario.

thoughts?
