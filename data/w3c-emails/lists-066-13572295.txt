Right, this is roughly in accord with my further thinking.

Specifically, it makes sense to be able to rely on the description being
available with the object that we get from a library. This also fits nicely
with the Authoring Tool Guidelines.

Are there widely-used XML tools that have no idea how to use an xlink as
transcluded? I don't imagine so. In which case it is not smart to suggest
that people encourage their existence by finding ways to make them work.

  I have no idea what you mean by that. How can a symbol be used without
  fetching it?
  
  Besides, these descriptions would be different. One is the description
  of a symbol; the other is the description of one usage of a symbol.

  The former is possible and desirable, the latter is not a good idea.
