Hmmm. Being able to zoom is a nice feature, and is available in SVG (although
that will take a while to come out it can provide huge leaps in
accessibility, becuase at the bottom of it all is plain-text XML with lots of
accessibility benefits. But in the meantime...

Sounds like Ken has it pretty well under control, except that for the 50
states thing there seems no reason not to ofer a client-side imagemap and a
gif as one alternative - that is a very good way of doing a lot of
accessibility, although the final result hinges a lot on how well the image
is designed and used, and there are restrictions in the current technology.
Fortunately, they do allow alt to be used for each hotspot as well as for the
image as a whole.

  I don't think I explained the possibilities correctly.  We can use this
  technique in conjunction with the javascript code to detect whether or not
  they have flash installed, and show the generated gif as the alternate
  image.  This will:
  
  - allow those who have flash installed to see the zoomable flash version
  - allow those who don't (or don't want to install it) to see the actual map.
  This would also support special needs, as the alt tag would carry through.
