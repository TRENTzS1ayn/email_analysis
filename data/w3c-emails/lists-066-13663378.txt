I have created and used Flash files on my family genealogy web site
(www.denmon.org) in my grad education @ NYU's Interactive Telecomm
program course work, but also have included on the page a static image
for browsers that don't have the plug-in...if I may put in my two cents.
(I have also used Director, as well--Director 7.0 seem slightly better,
but I have not worked with it enough to know...any thoughts?)

Here at the Lighthouse we are working on redesigning the site
(www.lighthouse.org) and accessibility issues are a high priority in
this process.  We would like to include animations and audio and how to
better understand the ways inwhich we can incorporate this type of
design usability.

...thank you for letting me chime in; look forward to hearing what
others are doing and our continued dialog.

OBJECTIVE: Make Macromedia FLASH accessible via alternate methods?  Has
anyone done this? This is what we are thinking and  please chime in...we
are
working with Macromedia Flash and not other macromedia formats.  We have
two
premises:
(1)If the FLASH plug-in is not used, provide an alternate method
viewing and reading .. For example an image or a text
(2)If the FLASH plug-in is used, provide FLASH FILE and an
alternate
method to either view OR reading, preferably read for web browsers with
the
plug-in turned off, screen readers, pwWebSpeak.  For example as in an
ALT
tag or text and or TITLE tag.  

Please read the bottom message to understand my comments to Ken our
developer and Charles.

Ken:   Hmm, nice thought...but we need the FLASH for the ZOOM-ing and
other
reasons.

Charles, pls read below and circulate if you like.  

Ken do you agree?

Rob,

I may have found the most expedient and elegant solution
to
our dilemma possible.  In most instances, we can merely tell generator
to
display the output as a GIF instead of a flash image.  Try this link to
see
it in
action.


http://207.153.198.240/usmint/fsq/display2.cfm?Plot_Opt=gu&stateg=AL&sta
tet=
AL&Mint=b&found=NJ&path=207.153.198.240%2Fusmint%2Ffsq

The code changes are minimal, but it will have the
following
limitations:

- they can't zoom-in on the maps (it's a gif)
- the "learn more about the 50 state quarters" page will
probably have to
stay as a flash piece, because it is interactive (i.e.
they
can click on a
state)
- the Fed Reserve Banks page will also have to stay as
flash, because of the
roll-overs.
- the image doesn't immediately begin to stream to the
display

there are also the following advantages:

- smaller download (the gifs should be around 12k)
- no need for plug-ins (at all)
- can alt-tag the heck out of them

Thoughts?

-Ken
