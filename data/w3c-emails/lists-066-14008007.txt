The chairs and editors have cancelled the October 14 WCAG (GL) WG
conference call.  Sorry about this folks... I promise this is the last
conference call we postpone (unless something else comes up <grin>).  

We are rapidly approaching the end of our first charter (November 30, 1999)
and we still have a lot of work we can do before we then.  Please review
the outstanding issues lists (especially the Techniques issues [1]), pick a
pet topic, and get discussion going on the mailing list.  Conference calls
are great, but the list is always "on".

[1]  Techniques issues - http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wai-gl-tech-issues.html

[2]  Guidelines issues - http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wai-gl-issues.html  

Regards,
Chuck Letourneau
Co-chair WCAG WG
