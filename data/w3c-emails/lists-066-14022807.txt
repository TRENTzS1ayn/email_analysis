hi all,

I think we ought to discuss the current state of the group, particularly 
our charter and the current state of work items.

The AU group decided that their document is ready for Proposed 
Recommendation status.  It goes to the Director next week for review.  UA 
is hoping to go to Last Call in the near future.  Both of these documents 
rely on WCAG and we still have some issues as well as documents to finish.

Our charter is up next month, so let's take some time today to think about 
where we want to go from here.
