what is the issue?  is this related to accesskey?

i believe so...  as i've stated in UA and AU, i think that ACCESSKEY and
TABINDEX are accorded much too low a priority in WCAG, as accelerator keys are
the basis of many adaptive solutions...  i believe that use of ACCESSKEY and
TABINDEX should be encouraged (and accorded a P1) and that providing info about
the ACCESSKEYs defined for a document, or the TABINDEX order, should be
accorded an "until user agents..." P3 (techniques: use of the LINK element,
provision of a link to a page listing the ACCESSKEYs defined for a page, etc.)

for background, check:

my summation of the ACCESSKEY issue for the UA mailing list

author-defined UI controls)

and the threads that trail off from and/or lead to the above...

sorry that this is so brief and scattered, but my ride just arrived, and i have
to make tracks...
