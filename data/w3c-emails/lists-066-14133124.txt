I noticed this resolution in the minutes:

Resolved: shouldn't use " ". &nbsp just another form of white space.
" " because ignored. &nbsp because it should not be used for formatting.
only used to keep pieces of text together (e.g. in WCAG we keep the
word "priority" and the level together).

I use &nbsp in empty table cells to get the borders to show up. Is there
another way?
