using &nbsp; to get table borders to show up is a hack to solve a particular
implementation bug in layout/presentation. Although this doesn't contravene
any specification that I can think of, it should not be necessary.

So far as I know there is no other way to solve the particular bug.

  I noticed this resolution in the minutes:
  
  Resolved: shouldn't use " ". &nbsp just another form of white space.
  " " because ignored. &nbsp because it should not be used for formatting.
  only used to keep pieces of text together (e.g. in WCAG we keep the
  word "priority" and the level together).
  
  I use &nbsp in empty table cells to get the borders to show up. Is there
  another way?
