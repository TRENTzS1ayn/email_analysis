hi all,

In case you missed the October 21 teleconference, or have not read the 
minutes [1], the people on the call determined that before our charter 
expires at the end of the month we need to:
1.  Restructure the Techniques document. (please review [2])
2.  Add as many techniques to the techniques document as possible.
3.  Close out as many open issues from the issues list as possible.
4.  Plan for the next phase
5. Review and approve a new charter.

We have a call scheduled for this Thursday at 4:00 Eastern on 
+1-617-252-1038.  However, Thursday is a holiday in many countries, so 
attendance may be low.  I encourage lots of discussion on the list over the 
next few weeks.
