I agree that the proper use of HTTP headers is a Good Thing (TM) and
should be practised universally. I agree in principle that users should be
able to take advantage of some kind of configuration mechanism, although
in practise I am still sceptical - having had webservers changed on me a
couple of times.

I disagree that fixed-media websites are a fundamentally different case,
and suggest that even if that is so they are sufficiently prevalent,
particularly in education, to require the same level of attention.

I also fail to see that there is something bad about HTTP headers and the
spoofing of them in document META HTTP-EQUIV is not a good thing. I am
happy to continue the discussion off list if nobody else is interested,
but would genuinely like to know.

Cheers

Charles
