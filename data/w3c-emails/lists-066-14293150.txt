Jon,

we discussed scripting in the last teleconference as something we would like
the next generation of the guidelines. I have started doing some practical
work (drawing in part on work Wendy did at TRACE) - hopefully there will be
some stuff that can be used by next week's teleconference (Because I am
working it up for a presentation on Monday ;-)

In general I strongly support your suggestion taht we consider this aspect of
content accessibility in a rechartered GL group.

cheers

Charles McCN

  I am not sure I can attend on Thursday, if I can it will probably be late.
  But I think WAI needs to have some guidelines related to writing scripts.
  Is this something this working group is interested in addressing?
