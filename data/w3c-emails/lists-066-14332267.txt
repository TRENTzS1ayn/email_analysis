Could use some help here in regards to Issue 2 under "Guideline 11 -
implications for PDF, deprecated elements, etc." in
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wai-gl-issues.html
are we saying deprecated can be ok and if so when?

here is the text snippet:
Issue raised by: Coordination Group - 1 June 1999, Robert Neff - 28 May 1999
(on IG list)

Issue 2.  Daniel raised an issue about the use of deprecated tags when there
is not another workable solution. We need to share our interpretation that
some use of deprecated is o.k. The CG feels we should either address this in
errata or the next version. See the discussion about post 1.0 changes for
the proposed test to use to determine which document changes should go in .
