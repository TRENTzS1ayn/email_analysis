hello all,

We realized at our last call that tomorrow is a holiday for several people, 
but we decided to go ahead with a call.  We will discuss issues but take 
them to the list to reach full conclusion (as we should anyway since those 
who call in are a small minority of our entire working group).

Agenda for 11 Nov telecon.  4:00-5:00 Eastern +1-617-252-1038

1.  Review action items from last telecon. [1]
2.  Discuss the charter wish list.  [2]
3. Discuss the open issue, "Guideline 11 - implications for PDF, deprecated 
elements, etc." [3]

thanks,
--wendy
