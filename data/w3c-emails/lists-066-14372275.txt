The idea was that authors should not rely on getting a space inserted between
two things if they do something like 

  text<img src="foo" alt=" ">runs on,

because there is no guarantee that the space will be rendered.

  why is alt=" " (with a space between the quotes) to be discouraged, whilst
  alt="" (with no space between the quotes) is considered o.k. when used with the
  A element as a pseudo-OBJECT, as in:
  
  <A href="foo.html"><img alt="" src=...>prices</A>
  
  i also don't understand the contention that:
  
  quote
  authors  shouldn't use " " since spaces are ignored by user agents.
  unquote
