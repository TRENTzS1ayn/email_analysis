So far as I know I have not received answers to the questions raised in 

 Re: minutes posted
 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999OctDec/0021.html

about this point.  

To recap in brief,

What user agents ignore the space character in ALT=" "?  What do they do?

What access impairment is caused by the use of ALT="&nbsp;" on a spacer
image used inline between otherwise un-separated text content?  How should
one mark this up otherwise if not ALT=" "?

Unless someone can answer those questions better, 
I would like to dissent on points 1. and 2.
