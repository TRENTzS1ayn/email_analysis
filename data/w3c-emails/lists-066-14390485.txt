aloha, charles!

ok, that assuages my concerns -- at least for now...

and, while i philosophically agree that ALT text shouldn't be used for
formatting, i'm not dead-set against the flip side of the equation -- using ALT
text to carry semantic information hidden behind a transparent gif, as in the
examples located at:

http://www.hicom.net/~oedipus/vicug/iaap/table_32.html

thankfully, however, the strategies outlined in the document listed above, have
been superseded by HTML4 and CSS -- now all i need to do is pray that someone
implements both specs in the same damn browser, so that the semantic info that
can be embedded in a table can be exposed to my UA or by my UA to my AT...
