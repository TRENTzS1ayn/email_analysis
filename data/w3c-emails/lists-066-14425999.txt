My interpretation of the HTML specification is that it is ambiguous as to
whether user agents may ignore (or suppress) a single space as the value
of a CDATA attribute. This is why I have been arguing that it would be
best to avoid relying on a questionable aspect of HTML processing by
ensuring that at least one space appears in the HTML document immediately
before or after an IMG element, or, possibly, by using the &nbsp;
character entity as the value of the ALT attribute.

Any discussion along these lines should be accompanied by a clear
statement to the effect that images should not be used to control spacing
between adjacent text in a document, as this violates the
content/presentation distinction mandated by guideline 3.
