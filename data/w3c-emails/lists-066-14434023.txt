Well, there's a lot that one doesn't know about how HTML will be
rendered, and that is one of its strengths.

I'd say we have a clear idea of what is meant by 'foo&nbsp;bar', even
if there are limits to what we know about how it will be rendered.  
And we know that because &nbsp; is not classified as white space[1],
the rules concerning the suppression of leading and/or trailing white
space do not apply to it.  It would seem to me that foo<IMG SRC=..
ALT="&nbsp;">bar, from the point of a text browser, is equivalent to
foo&nbsp;bar, and as such it is distinctively different from the
otherwise similar construct where ALT="".  And would, one hopes, be
indexed differently.

Indeed, but nbsp is not white space.

I honestly don't know, also I'm not sure whether an isolated white
space counts as leading or trailing or neither.  I've used ALT=" "  
before, but in view of the uncertainty about this point, I'd be
willing (in appropriate situations) to use no-break space instead,
without a qualm.

I'm _not_ talking about formatting as such, but about maintaining a
separation between two text tokens separated by nothing but an image
(say for example a logo), that would otherwise in a text-mode browser
get run together and thus misinterpreted as a single word.

Hope this is useful.
