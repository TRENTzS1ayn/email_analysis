aloha, wendy!

i have to go into the city earlier than i expected this afternoon -- in fact, i
should have left a half an hour ago -- so i regret to inform you that i won't
be attending this afternoon's teleconference...

quote
We will discuss issues but take them to the list to reach full conclusion (as
we should anyway since those who call in are a small minority of our entire
working group)
