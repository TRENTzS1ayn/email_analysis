Here is what HPR hears:

1. There are five separate links in this list item, separated by spaces
2. There are five separate links in this list item, with no separation
3. There # are # five # separate # links in this list item, separated by
hashes (#)
4. There . are . five . separate . links in this list item, separated by
periods (.)
5. There are five separate links in this list item, separated by spaces and
included in a MAP element

And in each case the five separate links are five separate links for hpr.

Whoops!

http://www.w3.org/1999/11/wai-test-links should be a lot more interesting
;-)

Thanks to Jim Thatcher for picking it up...

  there is a page at http://ww.w3.org/1999/11/wai-html-links with some test
  cases for whether links still need to be separated by non-printing
  characters.

  Please review the page and give us some information...
