  Here is what HPR hears:
  
  1. There are five separate links in this list item, separated by spaces
  2. There are five separate links in this list item, with no separation
  3. There # are # five # separate # links in this list item, separated by
  hashes (#)
  4. There . are . five . separate . links in this list item, separated by
  periods (.)
  5. There are five separate links in this list item, separated by spaces and
  included in a MAP element
  
  And in each case the five separate links are five separate links for hpr.

  Whoops!
  
  http://www.w3.org/1999/11/wai-test-links should be a lot more interesting
  ;-)
  
  Thanks to Jim Thatcher for picking it up...

    there is a page at http://ww.w3.org/1999/11/wai-html-links with some test
    cases for whether links still need to be separated by non-printing
    characters.
  
    Please review the page and give us some information...
