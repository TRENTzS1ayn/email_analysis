(thanks for doing the test, Jim)

I have tested Amaya 2.2 and Netscape 4.7 and Lynx 2.8 (all on linux 2.2 - 
the Redhat 6.0 distribution). I wrote
the results into the page:

Everything works fine in Lynx v2.8

Amaya does not render the block content inside a map (case 5) - this is a
known bug.

In Both Netsacpe and Amaya it is difficult to tell that the links without
visual separators (cases 1 and 2) are different. In Amaya you have to select
the entire link to identify that it is separate. In Netscape there is no way
to do that, so you have to run the mouse over the link, and look at the
address in the status bar (Amaya doesn't put the target in the status bar,
although it is available in the links view)

    Here is what HPR hears:
    
    1. There are five separate links in this list item, separated by spaces
    2. There are five separate links in this list item, with no separation
    3. There # are # five # separate # links in this list item, separated by
    hashes (#)
    4. There . are . five . separate . links in this list item, separated by
    periods (.)
    5. There are five separate links in this list item, separated by spaces and
    included in a MAP element
    
    And in each case the five separate links are five separate links for hpr.

    Whoops!
    
    http://www.w3.org/1999/11/wai-test-links should be a lot more interesting
    ;-)
    
    Thanks to Jim Thatcher for picking it up...

      there is a page at http://ww.w3.org/1999/11/wai-html-links with some test
      cases for whether links still need to be separated by non-printing
      characters.
    
      Please review the page and give us some information...
