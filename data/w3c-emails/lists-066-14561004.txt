Hi all,

I took an action item at last week's call to find out how whitespace is 
being handled in XML, to ensure that the strategy/interpretation of 
whitespace in alt is consistent with future mechanisms.  I also created an 
HTML test page and discovered some interesting results.


XML investigation

the XML spec [1] says the following re: the preservation of white space:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
An XML processor must always pass all characters in a document that are not 
markup through to the application. A validating XML processor must also 
inform the application which of these characters constitute white space 
appearing in element content.

A special attribute named xml:space may be attached to an element to signal 
an intention that in that element, white space should be preserved by 
applications.
</BLOCKQUOTE>


HTML test page

I have created a test page [2].  the results from MSIE5 and Opera 3.6 
(win98) are included in the page.  Note the results for &nbsp;.

Could people send the results of other browsers and platforms?  I'm 
particularly interested in HomePage Reader, Web Speak, and Netscape and 
results from Macintosh and Linux platforms.  Gregory has already reported 
that Lynx likes " " but not "" (it will ignore).  What does it do for &nbsp;?

I am leaning towards the following proposal, although i would like to see 
what the results of other tests are before committing to anything.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
for spacer images, use alt=" ".
</BLOCKQUOTE>

nice and simple, eh?  it seems most inline with the XML spec as well.

thoughts?
