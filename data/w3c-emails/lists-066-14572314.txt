in my previous message I proposed

<BLOCKQUOTE>
for spacer images, use alt=" ".
</BLOCKQUOTE>

I just realized I had a bug in the &nbsp; examples.  Therefore, I am 
considering updating my proposal.

The  HTML 4 spec doesn't say much about &nbsp; from what i can find.  Other 
than it is a "non-breaking space." [1]  I don't see any suggestions for 
usage.  I'm looking to see if character entities used as values of 
attributes are discussed anywhere...
