character references are allowed in attribute values:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
CDATA is a sequence of characters from the document character set and may 
include character entities. User agents should interpret attribute values 
as follows:
Replace character entities with characters,
Ignore line feeds,
Replace each carriage return or tab with a single space.

User agents may ignore leading and trailing white space in CDATA attribute 
values (e.g., "   myval   " may be interpreted as "myval"). Authors should 
not declare attribute values with leading or trailing white space.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

from http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html

Therefore, technically, we aren't suggesting that authors use a "leading or 
trailing" white space, but just a space (either limited use of &nbsp; or " ").
