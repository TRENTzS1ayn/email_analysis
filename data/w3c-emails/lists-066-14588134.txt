What it _does_ say, though, makes it clear that nbsp does not count as
"white space", and is therefore not subject to the rules that pertain
to white space.

[It may be noted in passing that this is a change from what had been
proposed in the never-completed HTML3.0 draft, where, aside from its
non-breaking property, the no-break space was stated to be otherwise
"white" space.]

Clearly, the specification cannot go into detail about the visual
rendering (indeed, it explicitly states that it does not prescribe the
rendering of any kind of space, apart from what it says about "white
space"): how could it, if it intends to address rendering also into
non-visual formats?

Attribute value strings are entirely open to the use of any of the
three valid representations of a character in HTML: the named
character entity, the numerical character reference per its Unicode
value, or the raw coded character per the advertised "charset" value.

While it's true that some early browsers got this wrong, this now
does not seem to be a problem in practice.

I don't see any real problem with the no-break space in this regard.
Surely the practical situation is something like this scenario.  If
two words are separated by an image (say, some kind of logo), that the
author considers would best be rendered by an inter-word space in the
absence of an image display, then ALT="&nbsp;" (or ALT="&#160;") now
seems to be the best compromise.  I used to put ALT=" ", and got the
desired results, but this now seems to be in doubt on theoretical
grounds because of the clause about removing leading or trailing
_white_ space.

I'm sorry, this was a lot of verbiage about a single character - whose
display, beyond occupying space, is not visible!

best regards
