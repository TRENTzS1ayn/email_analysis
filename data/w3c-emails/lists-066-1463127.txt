I am  a teacher of adults with learning difficulties, they do not all
conform to the above description however:

"the browser should be able to select for all qualities".



I take exception to your recommendation:
A.2 Alternative text and descriptions
Text is considered accessible to almost all users since it may be handled by
screen readers, non-visual browsers, braille readers, etc. It is good
practice, as you design a document containing non-textual information
(images, graphics, applets, sounds, etc.) to think about supplementing that
information with textual equivalents wherever possible.


Our site specifically requires that text is kept to a minimum and that
graphics as nearly as possible are transparent in understanding.

AltText should be supplied but "the browser should be able to select for all
qualities".
