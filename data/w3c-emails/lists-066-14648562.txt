I agree with Gregory's points: one of the fundamental tenets of the
guidelines is that it is possible to serve generic content which can then
be transformed by the client software to meet the requirements of the
user, possibly with assistance from author-supplied style sheets if these
are supplied and applicable.

Advising content providers to customise their material to meemeet the
(perceived or actual) needs of specific communities of readers would
amount, in effect, to a transfer of control over the presentation of
content from users to authors, whereas the former, rather than the latter,
are in the best position to understand their own needs and to ensure that
client software is configured appropriately so thatappropriate stylistic
preferences and user interface conventions are applied. This is only
possible, however, if structurally-oriented markup with explicit semantics
is issued by the server and the content itself exhibits the characteristic
of medium redundancy (through textual equivalents etc.) as mandated by the
guidelines.
