Note: this is an issue for the next working group.  The charter for this 
group ends in 2 weeks and before then we need to draft a new charter, 
release another version of techniques (primarily a restructuring), and 
close current open issues.

However, I suggest people check out the latest W3C Recommendations XPath 
and XSLT.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The World Wide Web Consortium announces two new Recommendations - XSL 
Transformations (XSLT [1]) and XML Path Language (XPath[2]) - that will 
enable the transformation and styled presentation of XML documents. "Anyone 
using XML can now take advantage of XSLT, a powerful new tool for 
manipulating, converting and styling documents, and XPath, a simple way of 
referring to parts of an XML document." said Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director. 
"Together, XSLT and XPath strike a fine balance between simplicity of use 
and underlying power."
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The major theme of the WCAG is "graceful transformation" meaning that 
content is separate from presentation  so that the user can control the 
presentation whether it be on a cell phone, a handheld device, an auto pc, 
etc.  Therefore, as gregory said, we need to address functional limitations.
