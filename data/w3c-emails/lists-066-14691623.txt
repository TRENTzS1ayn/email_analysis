SL:: "How about a web page whose structure has been known to improve the
efficiency of some individuals..."

WL: Of course I'd like to see many Web pages with such a structure. If
usability/accessibility/universality/interoperability are the central
focus of the author then "blind" won't be all that big a deal. The
notion of some author being aware of and designing specifically for
certain populations seems entirely specious - it will never have much
effect on anybody's lives. "...stripping graphics..." has never been and
will never be a guideline goal - it should be strictly a user event. The
"ghetto" and economic arguments are still valid and the guidelines, if
they are going to include usability functions (skipovers, etc.) will
probably get more commercial validity. If a site that is accessible to
PWDs can  incontrovertibly be shown as more usable (hence more
economically viable) then whatever guidelines produced that result will
be <lan=fr>de rigeur</lan> for the design house that conforms.
