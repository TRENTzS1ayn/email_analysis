During last week's call, the following discussion occurred:

Wendy Chisholm: This issue is based on a comment by Dave Clark [1]. Is 20% 
realistic to use? A bad idea? We need to allow an exception for image 
dimensions since it won't work.

Charles McCathieNevile: Using proportional sizing for raster-based image 
formats means that you may get weird shapes that make them more or less 
incomprehensible.

Action Wendy: Add to erratum /techniques that for raster-based, absolute 
dimensions ok. For scalable vector graphics percentages may be useful.

does the rest of the group agree with this conclusion?  if so, then i will 
go ahead with my action item.
