At last week's meeting we determined that the note for checkpoint 10.2 was 
incorrect for groups of controls, such as checkboxes.  therefore, I propose 
the following text be added to the errata page:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Placement of labels for form controls.
Added: 18 November 1999
Type: Error
Refers to: Checkpoint 10.2 in WCAG 1.0
Description (and correction). The note for checkpoint 10.2
should be reworded to say, "A label for a text area, a text input control 
or group of controls (e.g., a group of checkboxes) must
immediately precede its control (or group of controls) on the same line or 
be in the line preceding the control (or group of controls).  Refer also to 
checkpoint 12.4."
</BLOCKQUOTE>

It currently says, "The label must immediately precede its control on the 
same line (allowing more than one control/label per line) or be in the line 
preceding the control (with only one label and one control per line). Refer 
also to checkpoint 12.4."  Which only applies to text areas and text boxes.
