Hi, Wendy

I think that XSLT and XPath will be interesting, however there's an assumption
that the information will be in XML.  Currently, dynamic pages are generated
from information stored in relational and other kinds of databases
rather than XML.  A second issue is how long will it be before the
standards are adopted and implemented with a consistent result across
the different forms of technology?
