I have an action item to propose a schema for making conformance claims in
metadata. Since Daniel Dardailler has already done this, and Wendy dug out
the URI, I think I have satisfied this action with remarkably little effort.

Daniel's original PICS schema is at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999AprJun/0161.html

I would suggest that for now we use the PICS schema, since PICS is widely
implemented and well understood in the real world. (Also because it is nice to
see it used for something other than censorship).

I would like to see a more complex schema that gave checkpoint by checkpoint
information, in RDF. Part of the reason for that is that such a schema would
be useful for finding detailed information about Authoring Tool Accessibility
Guideline implementations. But that will take a little more work to set up.

Cheers
