Hi,

I've was chatting with a couple of programmers last night about dynamic
pages.  If a programmer wants to add a new output format, it would be
easiest to just add a new subroutine and put an entry in a look-up list.
Having to deal with post-processors just adds another level of
complexity with little benefit.  For example, if the web page being
outputed has a significant change, then the associated post-processor
files will probably need to be adjusted.  Why not just change the
associated subroutine?  Plus the programmer would need to worry about
how the web server would interact with the post-processors, version
skews, etc.

Scott
