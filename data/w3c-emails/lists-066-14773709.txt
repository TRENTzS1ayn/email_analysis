Chairs,
I noticed Jason White mentioned in the WCAG minutes having a tool to
maintain the issues list.  The User Agent working group has been using a
tool for the past 6 months.  It is CGI based on perl scripts, if your
interested in trying it, I set up a demo at:

http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/issue-demo/issue-edit.cgi

It creates both linear and table versions of the issues list and not can
even mark issues that were raised during last call and proposed recommendation.

Jon
