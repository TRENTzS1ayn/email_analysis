The informative only technique doc may 
be somewhat improved in its element index:

CAPTION is also defined in HTML3.2
OPTGROUP is not defined in HTML3.2 or HTML2.0
PARAM is also defined in HTML3.2
PARAM has nothing to do with forms
SCRIPT is also defined in HTML3.2
STYLE is also defined in HTML3.2
