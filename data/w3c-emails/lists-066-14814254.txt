Scott,

In your previous post you suggested that a programmer who had created a 
dynamic page could more easily write a new subroutine than "dealing with 
postprocessors."  Your main concern was that if the data changed, then 
someone would have to go change the postprocessor.

If the data and structure of the page is appropriately separated from the 
presentation, then changes to data can happen independently from changes in 
presentation.

In your second post you used the example of a Table as a reason for why 
someone would want to use dynamically generated pages. There are quite a 
few ways to address this issue either on the client- or the 
server-side.  It will depend on how the data or content of the page is 
marked up, but a client-side tool could more effectively allow the user to 
interact with the data than a static presentation generated then served 
(i.e., querying a cell for information about its header(s) or table for a 
collection of cells).

There are also several client-side generated schemes that work well.  I 
have been working on a client-side script that uses style sheets to show 
and hide information in a dynamic way that also works when scripts or style 
sheets are not loaded.  It is dynamic presentation of content, but because 
of style sheets and scripting, it can either linearize into a table of 
contents and text, or be displayed with a "visual imperative."  I have 
chosen a blue horizontal menu bar, with orange submenus that pop up, and 
other text that is shown depending on which submenu is selected.  in other 
words, it transforms gracefully because content is separate from presentation.

I am anxious to investigate how I might use a combination of XML, RDF, and 
scripting.  Especially with data tables.


You are advocating server-side scripting.  As long as the content is 
separate from the structure, and the nature of the content is static, I 
don't think it depends where the generation (or transformation) happens - 
on the client, the server, or some gateway. Until user agents all support 
scripting consistently and adopt a common object model, some of that 
generation will more reliably happen on a server, but in the future it's 
really not going to matter where the presentation comes from: a subroutine, 
a style sheet, it happens on the fly as the user agent interprets meta 
information, etc.  It will depend on what you are doing and what is most 
effective.

therefore, your suggestion (if I understand it correctly) follows along 
quite nicely with the themes of WCAG: graceful transformation and 
separation of content from structure.  You are more than welcome to develop 
server-side strategies for inclusion in the techniques document.  We are in 
the process of restructuring it and adding new techniques before the end of 
the charter (30 Nov), so now is a good time to get something 
included.  Particularly, if you have examples for the checkpoints that 
specifically mention scripting.

thanks,
