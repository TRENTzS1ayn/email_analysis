Hi, Nir

Actually, the issue of specifying the tailoring can be handled in a
number of different ways depending on the application.  For example, if
the user is accessing a personal portal, when he/she signs up for the
portal, there could be an option for blind user customization.  In a
search form, there could be a button requesting output customized for a
blind user.  Cookies are another option.
