In response to Charles' comment, I could rather unhelpfully suggest
that a full transcript of all textual material be provided in an
appropriate sign language as a video track or using any symbolic
representation that is ultimately developed. The difficulty here is
that for a given written or spoken language, there may be more than
one corresponding sign language (E.G. the Australian sign language or
the American sign language). I don't know to what extent the
transcription could be automated.
