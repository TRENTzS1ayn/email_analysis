Hi,

I thought it might be helpful to boil down what I sent out last week
on dynamically generated web pages.

1.  A server generates a web page by basically gathering information from
    one or more data sources like databases, XML documents, real time
    data suppliers, dynamic data generators, etc; analyzing the
    information as appropriate; deciding the format to present the
    information and then creating the web page in the format selected.

2.  Since the document does not exist before the server generates it,
    the server can easily generate the document in multiple forms.  This
    flexibility lets the document be generated in a form which is designed
    for visual users and also a form which is designed for blind users.

3.  The ability to generate a document in multiple forms avoids the
    problem of compromising a desired visual form for the accessibility
    of the page for blind users and the problem of compromising
    accessibility for blind users to achieve a certain desired
    visual presentation.

4.  Allowing the programmer handle the form of a generated web page
    at the software level will be easier and more efficient.  The software
    has to generate the document any way.  Supporting multiple
    forms will probably not be much harder.  Also, it avoids the problem
    that the programmer can run into with version skews, etc,
    for tools like CSS, etc.


Is there anything that I'm missing in this technical analysis?
