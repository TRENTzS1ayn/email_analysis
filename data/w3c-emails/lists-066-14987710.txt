aloha, scott!

you are still, in my opinion, attempting to impose a many-sizes-fits-all policy
on content delivery -- an approach which is doomed for you cannot possibly
predict (nor can you reasonably expect content providers to know) what the
individual blind user needs in order to make sense of, and interact with, the
content being delivered...

yes, the server should assume half of the burden (which can be done via
responsible browser sniffing, so that the stylesheet and inline style
declarations delivered with the content, for example, won't crash the
requesting UA nor cause the content to be rendered in unexpected and
incomprehensible ways), but the client side should handle the quote blind
tailorization unquote -- particularly if the requester is using an AT that can
access his or her user agent of choice's DOM...  and even if the blind
individual requesting the content isn't using a user agent that has implemented
the DOM, or is incapable of supporting it, then an intermediary proxy, of the
sort that len kasday and i have been talking about in WAI circles since 1997,
could do the client side work for a client that doesn't have the resources or
access to the DOM needed by the UA slash A.T. combination described in my
scenario...  of course, the proxy would have to be heuristic, and constantly
updated, so as to take into account new scenarios and combinations, but 

gregory.
