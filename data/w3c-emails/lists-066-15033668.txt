Advising frames because you can change only the navigation bar 
without changing the other pages is not sufficently conviencing.

One may use a preprocessing tool in which the navigation bar of 
all pages may be changed in batch.

Also, if existing pages were not generated with a preprocessor, but were 
written in a template which is consistent across pages, a program that
modifies 
the navigation bar of multiple pages may be written.

Concerning the Lynx browser, the more recent versions present the frameset 
as a list of links to the different frames.
You may also use an online Lynx simulator such as 
http://www.delorie.com/web/lynxview.html or even better get Lynx from 
http://lynx.browser.org

Nir.
