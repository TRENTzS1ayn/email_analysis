Hi, Charles

I believe your analysis is not very complete.  For example, results of
search engines cannot be generated before the search query is specified.
Or a web page which has the most recent article from some set of web sites
listed in a user specified profile.  Or web pages which are stored at a
central repository and generated on demand depending on the university
which is the subscriber.  Or a web page listing descriptions of
items in a shopping cart. Or a web page which does a comparison of
long distances costs depending on a user's calling pattern.

In terms of templates, you're making certain assumptions which aren't
necessarily true.  Templates can have multi-layers of flexibility when
structured proerly.  You're assuming that the templates must be discreet
from each other.    In a well architected system, it is very easy to
specify structures which can be shared among templates.  This allows for
a single change to be easily propogated.  This approach can actually
allow for multiple formats outside of 2.  The trick is to think
abstractly about the attributes.  (If you're a programmer, I can show
you software which does that.)
