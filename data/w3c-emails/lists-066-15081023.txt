One problem with dynamically generated pages is that one has 
to configure the server to send the appropriate last-modified 
response header to allow caching.

In addition, the server would like documents to be cached only 
if it can assure that the cached document that is served to 
the user is the appropiate variant.

The simplest way to solve this problem is to have 
prewritten "static" versions on the server, with different URLs, 
and the server may use redirects (using a response with 302 
status code) based on content negotiation. (Content negotiation 
includes user-agent request header). 

Having each variant with a different URL makes the documents that the users 
receive non-negotiated documents that can be cached, and using static files 
makes the last-modified header a trivial matter: usually the server will 
use the operating system's information about the file in question.

However even with this solution you get less caching than with serving 
one document with one URL.

So I would recommend to 
1. attempt to reduce the number of variants to a minimum. (using diffeent 
 style sheets per different media and following WAI guidelines)
2. If more than one variant is served, have them with different URLs 
 and make sure the appropriate last-modified header is sent.

What is this "mimimum" in article 1 above if a function of what 
clients can actually do. (support to which style sheet languages, what level, 
bugs etc.)

Clearly, all this matters only if the document is "otherwise static".
In case of serving pages based on user input that can not 
be repeated by other users, caching is irrelevant anyway.
