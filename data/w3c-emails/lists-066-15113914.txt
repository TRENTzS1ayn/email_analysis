Hi, Charles

The template database approach works with limited templates and context.
However, for example, a web site lets each user set up a profile
describing how each web page should be configured for him.  If the web site
works with hundres and pages and thousands of users, the template
and database approach is not reasonable.

Actually, the appropriate design does not necessarily significantly
increase the complexity.  Give me an example and I probably have a way
for it not to be that complex.  (I hope <smile>.)

I don't understand your statement "that in general creating different
versions of a page sometimes overcome some implementation-specific
limitations".  How would a user decide what is relevant?  (This goes back to the
concept-barrier issues.)
