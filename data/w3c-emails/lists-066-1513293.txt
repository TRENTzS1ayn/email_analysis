The point of my comment was that it is possible to automatically translate
text into signs. It is possible to translate text into visual symbols
which are easily understood.

Concentrating on the latter approach for a moment:
Graphic representations of language tend to have small vocabularies. It
does not usually make sense to attempt automated translation between text
and graphics - that is, like machine translation of English to Japanese,
notoriously difficult. But it does make sense to ask that users of graphic
languages which cannot be translated easily provide a text version of what
they are 'saying'. This will provide the mechanics of communication
between, for example, a blind person and a person who can only or best
understand a vocabulary made of visual symbols.

It then remains for the people in question to discover their shared
vocabulary. However, without the mechanical steps having been made there
is a very large communication barrier that precludes the process.
