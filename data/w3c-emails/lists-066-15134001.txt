I just noticed this technique by Delorie:
http://www.delorie.com/web/ses-hint.html
that allows making a left side navigation bar 
that is rendered after the main text in a linear medium,
using tables.

The idea is to have three cells instead of two:
The first cell is empty, the second cell on the same row 
spans two rows and includes the main text, and the third cell 
which is on the next and last row is the navigation bar.

The reference above and the technique may be mentioned is some
future techniques document update.

Regards,
Nir.
