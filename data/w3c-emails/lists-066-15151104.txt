Hi, Charles

OK  Each of the examples of template and database you gave probably 
would not benefit very often from caching the generated web page
depending on the appplication.

The issue is how long will a blind user need to search through a web page
to get to a desired section.  The demo I've created is organized
by using the concepts which underly the structure of the web page.
The only way to understand the difference is to look at my demo
and compare the standard web page to the one formatted for blind users.
The URL is:
