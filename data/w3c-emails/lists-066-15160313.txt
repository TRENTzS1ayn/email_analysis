This is true - assuming, of course, that we are dealing with a
situation where cacheing of the results is meaningful.

This is also a significant consideration, but only if there is a
relatively small number of variants to be considered.  If the dynamics
are creating different pages every time, with billions of possible
responses (as for example with the results of a search from a search
engine), then these considerations would not seem relevant.  But I
certainly agree with you about the importance of giving thought to
these issues, and making things cacheable when appropriate.

There are useful resources on this topic from Mark Nottingham,
http://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/
and Andrew Daviel, http://vancouver-webpages.com/CacheNow/

This is what Andrew Daviel calls the "negotiated redirect", and is 
indeed the only cache-worthy approach that works with pure HTTP/1.0.

That's agreed.

However, I've encountered very mixed reactions amongst practitioners
to the idea of promoting its use today, because although definitely
beneficial for pure HTTP/1.0, it actually inhibits some of the
optimisations that are possible in HTTP/1.1 (and some of these
features, e.g the Vary: header, can be present as optional extensions
also in HTTP/1.0, so one does not necessarily have to wait for
comprehensive deployment of full HTTP/1.1 capability before starting
to apply them).

I didn't disagree with the rest of what you said; and it's true that
some of the technical issues raised here have not been specific to web
accessibility considerations - but I thought it might be useful to at
least mention the issues here, now that the "negotiated redirect" has
come up in the discussion.

all the best
