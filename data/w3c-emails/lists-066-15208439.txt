I fail to discern where the current text is ambiguous: it clearly
specifies the interim requirement as being applicable until user agents
can interpolate synthetic speech into the audio track of the multimedia

If clarification is needed, it should be supplied in the techniques
document, not as an erratum to the guidelines.
