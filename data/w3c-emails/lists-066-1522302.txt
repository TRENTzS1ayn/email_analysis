I HAVE NO COMMENTS BUT I SURE DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS FOR YOU AND
HOPEFULLY YOU'LL BE ABLE TO ANSWER THEM:
I WAS WONDERING IF THERE'S ANY CHARGE TO GETTING ACCESS TO HTML? WILL I
BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH MY FRIENDS FROM AOL IF I GET A SUBSCRIPTION
OF HTML? PLEASE GIVE ME SOME INFO ON HOW TO GET ACCESS TO AOL.
PLEASE GET BACK TO ME ASAP.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
