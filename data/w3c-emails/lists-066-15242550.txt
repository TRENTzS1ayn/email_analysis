Yes, it does matter. The C in CSS stands for Cascading, that is, there is an
ability for the presentation ideas of the author and the user to interact to
provide the best blend - the author knew the material best, the user knows
their requirements best.

A system that does not support that potential for input from both sides, and
"negotiation" is generally poorer than one which does (assuming in each case
that they are well-implemented).

  Hi,
  
  My impression is one reason for using CSS is to be able to create
  different presentations of web pages.  From the user's point of view, does
  it matter how different presentation forms are created?  I think the
  goal is to get the user a presentation of a web page which meets his/her needs
  and preferences.
