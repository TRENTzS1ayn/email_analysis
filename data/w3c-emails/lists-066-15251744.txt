Hi, Charles

The problem is that user style sheets do not understand
concepts / subject material.  The combination of knowledge of subject
material and of user can significantly affect layout.

For example, results from seach engines often have links for next page
of search results and previous page of search results.   These links are
usually at the end of the search results.  However, for a blind user the
better solution is to have these links at the top of the page so the
blind user doesn't have to read though the search results.  An even
better solution for blind users is to tie the links to a keys so  that
the blind user can jump to the next page of results no matter where
he/she is on the page.  The user style sheet will not understand the
purpose of these links.

I've put up some examples of how information is presented on web pages in
visual forms.  The URL is:

     http://members.aol.com/criptrip/dynamic_web_pages/demo.html
    
Take a look at them.  How would user style sheets display them in a
way easier to use for blind people?


Something to remember is that dynamically generating web pages in
different formats for different types of users does not prevent user
style sheets from being used.  The over all combination user-specific
dynamically generated web pages in combination with user style sheets
results in web pages even better presented for the user.
