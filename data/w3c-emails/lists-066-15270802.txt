Just a reminder: we are holding a conference call today in spite of the
fact that it is a holiday (Thanksgiving) in the US.  I don't know if any of
our editors will be on the call, so I suggest we use the time to discuss
Wendy's draft charter.  It can be found at:

http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/new-charter-2000.html

Attendance at today's meeting is optional for our American colleagues.  If
you have to choose between turkey and talking, I will understand if you opt
for the food.

Regards,
Chuck Letourneau
Co-chair, WAI WCAG WG
