at least i can type with my mouth full !!!

by the way, does anyone have any comments or suggestions on the Case Study
we submitted on how to make Macromedia accessible?  Would like to modify the
50 State Quarter Interactive Map at www1.usmint.gov.  We are also making
more of these for other products and one is in development now.

Comments?
