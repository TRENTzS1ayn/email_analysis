They are not necessarily unread.  One could have moved back two pages in
error, and need to move forward one page to get to the page bearing the
link that one wants to re-visit.  Charles's comment is correct in terms of
maintaining a convenient capability for hierarchical motion, and web pages
in slidesets often have next/previous buttons at the top as well as at the
foot.

Anything HTML can understand, the user stylesheet can understand by using
selectors keyed to the HTML namespace.

The purpose of the parts of a document can be understood by the user
stylesheet if the XML, CLASS and REL terms used are drawn from a schema
published earlier and used in writing the user stylesheet.

We have somehow to get an abstract definition of the purpose of the
varieties of content in the page.  The originating author does not
understand the best possible use of the User Interface media for the
particular user who is browsing the content, and we want to have
technological support for graceful transformation of the content into a
presentation that is tailored to the specific needs of the user.

To get that, we need meaningful terms used in XML element and attribute
names and values and/or HTML CLASS and REL attribute values.  By
meaningful, I mean the tokens relate to meanings that stylesheet-writers
can depend on.

This can be achieved by schemas published and adhered to, or it can be
achieved by loosing media critics on the current web content and using a
schema language to express the current idioms as documented from observation.

The latter is technically harder, but probably easier to achieve sooner
than performing the "herding cats" task of getting millions of autonomous
web authors to follow our set of rules.
