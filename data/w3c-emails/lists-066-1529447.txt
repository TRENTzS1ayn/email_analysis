Sorry Leanne, but you have got thew wrong idea here.

HTML is not something you can subcscribe to - it is just a language that
is used to write things on the Web. If you subscribe to any Internet
Service Provider (AOL is just one) then you will be able to communicate
with your friends.

To get onto AOL I suppose you go to their website: http://www.aol.com

cheers

  HOPEFULLY YOU'LL BE ABLE TO ANSWER THEM:
  I WAS WONDERING IF THERE'S ANY CHARGE TO GETTING ACCESS TO HTML? WILL I
  BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH MY FRIENDS FROM AOL IF I GET A SUBSCRIPTION
  OF HTML? PLEASE GIVE ME SOME INFO ON HOW TO GET ACCESS TO AOL.
  PLEASE GET BACK TO ME ASAP.
  
  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
