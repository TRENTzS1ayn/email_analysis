aloha!

in addition to including the phone number and time of the call in meeting
announcements, could you please email the reminders the day _BEFORE_ the
meeting, as it does me little good if i receive a reminder for a meeting
shortly before the meeting begins, especially if that is a day where i could
spare an hour or so for a telecon, but don't want to get sucked into answering
all of my accumulated email!
