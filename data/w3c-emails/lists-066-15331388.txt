My fault, my responsibility.  I completely forgot that we had scheduled an
"optional" meeting for the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday, and remembered
only a couple of hours beforehand.  Apologies to those who wished to attend
but didn't because of my late notice.  

Please note, however, that the meeting was announced on the GL home page.
We should all (myself especially) remember to use that valuable resource
for information.

Regards,
Chuck Letourneau
Co-Chair, WCG WG
