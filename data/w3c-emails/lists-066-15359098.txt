Thanks for your answer Wendy!

I'm a little confused. Did you really mean that the text equivalent of a
visual track can be an auditory description. I thought it would be text if
it is text equivalent? If it is audio why is it then important to do
automatic text-to-speech processing (read the text aload)?
