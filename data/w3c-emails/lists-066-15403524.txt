OK. So does the text equivalent in WCAG 1.3 refer to the collated text?
Reading that aload makes sense because then you don't need to worry about
timing. The user can just listen to it separately from the video. And I
guess this is something that the screenreaders can already do
automatically. But I guess we wanted every browser to do that in 1.3 UNTIL
UA clause?

It did not occur to me earlier from WCAG that the author needs to always
provide the collated text. Should that be said more explicitly if that is
demanded?

Captions do have timecodes. Video (or audio) description has too. But
having textual transcript of audio description with proper timecodes means
the audio description already exists. So I don't know why to generate it
from text, to save space?

Going from text to audio description means we need to generate the
timecodes too which is not necessarily a simple task especially if we try
to do it automatically. Pausing might work, but I'm not sure for instance
with SMIL, if you can pause everything else but not the automatic audio of
the collated text. At least we should know what element contains the
collated text and that info is not available in SMIL.

OK, so collated transcripts are needed for video presentations as P1? In
this case there is no need for synchronization with video and audio(unless
if you want to synchronize the info with a group of people where some can
see or hear).
