I would have thought that whatever technique is used to apply headers to a
table cell should still apply, except the headers would then apply to the
whole of the nested table.

  hello,
  
  in the Evaluation and Repair Tools working group we have been discussing 
  how to evaluate and repair tables.  Particularly, nested tables.
  
  if nested tables are used to present data, is there a way to associate the 
  cells in the inner table with header cells in the outer table?  I would 
  assume that axis and headers could work  across tables (if a UA was built 
  that way).  However, in HTML 4.0 the only values for "scope" are row, col, 
  rowgroup, and colgroup.  so, it seems that "scope" could *not* be an inner 
  table.
  
  Nested tables seem less of a problem for layout tables. I propose that the 
  evaluation and repair is to handle each table separately, like Mark Novak's 
  HelpDB tool.
