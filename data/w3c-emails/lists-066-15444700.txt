Indeed, and the user agent would need to communicate the fact that the
contents of every such cell is actually a table. Incidentally, do there
exist genuine data tables which employ nesting other than in an attempt to
control layout? To my knowledge, nested tables do not appear in
conventional printed publications and are largely an artifact of the web,
in which case the author should reconsider whether or not to use them at
all.
