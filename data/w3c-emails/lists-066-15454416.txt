a 3d bar chart is a simple nested table especially if it is a multi-colored
sum,
as is a linked excel chart.
In general spreadsheets are linked and have been historically.

The difficulty I as a novice have had trying to construct a first nested
table indicates to me at least that somewhere, someone took a leap of faith.

Surely it is not absolute that the constraints on the containing table are
global and determine the behaviour of the tables contained.
This shows a lack of foresight, and given the number of years it has
remained a distinct abscence of flexibility.
