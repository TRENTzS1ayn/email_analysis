Yes, there are a number of cases where tabular data is nested. (I can see the
tables in books in my mind's eye, but don't have an example to hand.)

In some cases it could be done differently, but as onathan pointed out in
some cases it makes very good sense as a compact way to present data (in
situations where the reader can make use of the structure to improve
efficiency of comprehenson).

  Indeed, and the user agent would need to communicate the fact that the
  contents of every such cell is actually a table. Incidentally, do there
  exist genuine data tables which employ nesting other than in an attempt to
  control layout? To my knowledge, nested tables do not appear in
  conventional printed publications and are largely an artifact of the web,
  in which case the author should reconsider whether or not to use them at
  all.
