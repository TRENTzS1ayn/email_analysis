OK. So, now couple of more questions.

Is the WCAG asking authors to create that kind of textstream file for video
so that the UA can create the audio description automatically from it? 

How would the UA know where that textstream file is located e.g. how to
find it among other textstream files, such as captions?

OK. It may save some time. I was thinking first that there is a text file
that is attached to video always anyway so that the only thing needed is to
read it automatically by the UA. It seems like the textstream file you are
talking about is done just for the purpose to be read as audio description
of the video. Or can it be used for other purposes?
So in this way it does not save time, it is done for the audio descriptions.

Which might be clumsy e.g. it you need to pause in a middle of a sentence
or a scene. So the author still need to look carefully how to time
everything together.

Does this mean that we actually rather want the textstream for audio than a
recorded audio description? That I did not actually understand from 1.3.
Maybe my foreign language problems?
