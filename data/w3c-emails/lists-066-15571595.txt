hi all,

I am still working on the draft of the charter.  I appreciate the comments 
from those on the call last week.  I should have something out for everyone 
to review early next week.

We're also working on an end of charter report, and a restructured 
Techniques document.

Therefore, there will be lots more to talk about in the near future.

SO - when are we going to talk?

Several of us will be at the User Agent face to face next Thursday.  Should 
we schedule a call for those that aren't at UA?  I would at least like to 
see discussion on the list once the charter, report, and Techniques are 
available for review.

Note that the group still exists!  Although the charter technically ended 
on 30 Nov, we should still be moving forward with the pending deliverables 
(charter, end of charter report, new techniques).  Therefore, we should 
schedule more meetings.

If no one is opposed, I will schedule an indefinite number of meetings at 
our regular time.
