> Test Case for grouping of Links and whitespace
>
> Status of this document
>
> This is a test document written by Charles McCathieNevile to test how groups of links are rendered by different technologies
>
> In each of the five test cases there are five (5) links to different pages. If you can, or cannot, easily find and use each link, please email w3c-wai-gl@w3.org explaining which cases did not work, and what equipment you were using:
>
>    * Operating system and version
>    * Browser and version,
>    * Hardware (such as keyboard, monitor, or head-wand, emacspeak with Dectalk Express)
>    * Any "assistive technology" you used
>
> As responses are posted they will be added to this page.
>
> Five Test cases:
>
>   1. There are five separate links in this list item, separated by spaces
>   2. There are five separate links in this list item, with no separation
>   3. There#are#five#separate#links in this list item, separated by hashes (#)
>   4. There.are.five.separate.links in this list item, separated by periods (.)
>   5. There are five separate links in this list item, separated by spaces and included in a MAP element
>
> Known Results
>
> Result are listed by Browser, then by Operating system. These will be periodically updated based on feedback received.

> Amaya v2.2:

> Linux 2.2 (RedHat v6.0)
>
>   1. Keyboard, mouse, monitor: All are usable except case 5, where none of the content of the MAP is visible. (This is a known bug in Amaya). Where there are no visible separators (case 1 and case 2) it is not obvious that the links are separate except by selecting the link, or looking at the Links View.

> Home Page Reader v2.5:

> Windows 98 (results should be the same for all versions of Windows)
>
>   1. Hardware unknown: All links are usable.

> Lynx v2.8:
>
> Linux 2.2 (RedHat v6.0)
>
>   1. Keyboard, mouse, monitor: All are usable,
>
> Netscape v4.7:
>
> Linux 2.2 (RedHat v6.0)
>
>   1. Keyboard, mouse, monitor: All links are usable. Where there are no visible separators (case 2) it is not obvious that the links are separate. Where there is only a space it is difficult to see. In each case the status bar provides the destination of the link (but there is no way to tab between links in Netscape for linux - you have to use the mouse).
