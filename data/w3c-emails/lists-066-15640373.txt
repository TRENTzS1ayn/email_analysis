The WG discussed what type of support for RDF and metadata
in general UAs should provide. This was considered
due to checkpoint 13.2 of WCAG: 

   "Provide metadata to add semantic information 
   to pages and sites."

The result of discussions was: implement the spec. We couldn't
come up with any Guidelines-level requirements since metadata
could be used for everything. 

For discussions, refer to issue #72 [2] and the 15 September
resolution (from minutes [3]):

      Resolved: Include as techniques.

Marja, Jim Allan, Charles, and myself were asked to provide
links to sources of metadata in various specs (HTML, SMIL,
CSS, Schemas). Links to those resolutions are in [3].

Refer also to minutes of 9 September GL meeting [4] where
we said about metadata:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
9. CMN will take the issue regarding meta data to PF
  (see list of potential strategies). 
  CMN: no consensus on meta data in PF yet. 
  WC: should GL and PF get together to discuss this? 
  CMN: Yes.

Have I succeeded in closing the loop? <wink>
