Hi all,

I think GL is done debating about what to use as alt-text.  It seems that 
we would  rather be encouraging authors to use style sheets for 
positioning.  While I agree with this, it is not entirely realistic today 
due to the inconsistent support for CSS positioning.  Therefore, I propose 
the following for the ERT document:

1.  Images with alt="", alt=" ", and alt="&nbsp;" (or alt="&#160;") should 
be flagged.

2. If the image is part of a link that has text (e.g., <a 
href="home.html"><img src="button.gif" alt=" ">Refer to our home page</a>) 
this is o.k.

3.  If the image is not part of a link, query the author for the use of the 
image.

3a. If the author identifies the image as a space between words and those 
words should not be separated, advise them to use &nbsp; (or alt="&#160;") 
instead of an image.

3b. If the image is purely decorative and has no meaning to the content of 
the page, advise them to provide a brief descriptive text and suggest that 
they may also want to link to a longer description of the image with the 
"longdesc" attribute.

Exceptions to this rule are image effects that could be created with style 
sheets, such as graphical list bullets.  Advise authors to use style 
sheets.  (See examples in the WCAG 1.0 Techniques document)

3c.  If the image is a space that is used to format the layout of text, 
advise them to use style sheets or alt=" ".

3d.  If the author indicates the image has a function, advise the author to 
provide a functional text equivalent and if necessary link to a longer 
description.

Any further thoughts from GL?  I am also including the last message on this 
thread, sent by Jason White on 18 November.
