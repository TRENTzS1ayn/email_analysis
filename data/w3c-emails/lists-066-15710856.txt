I disagree completely with the approach which Robert Neff is advocating in
this discussion. The priorities are to be determined on the basis of
impact (as Eric calls it). This is established by the definitions
corresponding to the three priority levels. As a matter of principle
therefore, questions of "unjustifiable burden" etc., should not be taken
to account except in choosing among a range of solutions that are equally
efficacious from an access standpoint but incur different costs, in which
case the least costly solution is to be preferred, with all other factors
being equal. The legal systems in various jurisdictions are free to
determine what requirements should be imposed on web site developers, and
where "unjustifiable hardship" (or the equivalent concept in any given
legal setting) arises; these matters should not be second-guessed by this
working group.
