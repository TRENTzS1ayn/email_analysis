I thought the consensus was that alt=" " (and even alt="  " [or more 
spaces]) is, strictly speaking, not valid html (because of the whole 
leading/trailing-spaces-may-be-ignored thing) but that this did not trip up 
any known browsers.

The consensus was that alt="  " (or any number of spaces) should probably 
be rendered the same way as alt=" ", but browser behavior on this point was 
variable.

I also thought the consensus was that alt=" " is NOT the same thing as 
alt="" no matter what the interpretation.

My version of Lynx (pretty new, but maybe not the very latest) treats 
alt="" VERY differently than alt=" ".

According to working draft of the WAI UA guidelines, alt="" SHOULD hide the 
image (and any associate link).  This IS what my version of Lynx does.

I don't think the difference between alt="" and alt=" " is author 
preference.  It is more an obscure technical issue.

We can "trump" the whole issue by deciding that alt="" should NEVER be 
allowed by the WCAG.  This is an overly zealous rule.  It has the virtue of 
being very simple.  We can leave the validity of alt=" " to the validation 
services (they don't currently report an error).

I don't think, in practice, you should flag for alt=" " since then you must 
also test for all permutations of &nbsp; &#160; and spaces.  Certainly this 
kind of test can be put into an algorithm, but if an author thinks that 
their alt text is best represented by (some form of) spaces, who are we to 
question that?  We don't actually have a test for GOOD alt text (without 
human intervention anyway) except for the obvious things like alt="foo.gif 
(1234 bytes)".

My point is, if the author goes to the trouble of inserting alt text (even 
alt=" ") then they must have thought about it for a second or two.  This is 
what we are trying to promote!  There are no authoring products that 
generate alt=" " for you, although some do generate alt="" and stuff like 
alt="foo.gif (1234 bytes)".  For spacer gifs, alt=" " is logical, whereas 
alt="" is ALWAYS questionable.  It is not possible to tell if alt="" is by 
design or accident.  This is NOT true for alt=" ".
