hi all,

Ian and I added some text to the browser support page [1] this a.m.  We 
also created a page of tests for each checkpoint [2].

Please note the status of this document:
<status>
We are currently working on support by major browsers. As of 8 December 
1999, we have begun to document the most current versions of Opera, 
Microsoft Internet Explorer (MSIE), Netscape Navigator (NN), and Lynx. We 
also intend to document information about older versions of these and other 
browsers on various platforms as well as combinations of graphical desktop 
browsers and dependent assistive technologies (screen readers, screen 
magnifiers, and voice input software) that address accessibility requirements.

An associated Tests for the User Agent Support Page is also under 
development to help us test support.
</status>

We need to finish creating tests for each checkpoint.  There are probably 
some that we can borrow from the ERT.  Otherwise, we will need to create them.

Then, we need people to contribute information about a variety of browsers.

If you would like to volunteer for either of these activities, please let 
me know.

Also note that this is not the highest priority for the group right 
now.  Our primary concern is creating a new charter and closing open issues 
(primarily checkpoint 1.3 and the null alt-text debate). I will be sending 
a draft of a new charter within the week.

thanks,
--wendy
