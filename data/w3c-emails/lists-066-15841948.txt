I would argue that even priority 2 is too high.  If the listener has some
residual hearing, then the visual synchronized captions are only aiding or
making it easier to get the information.    The definition of Priority 3 is
:
"A Web content developer may address this checkpoint. Otherwise, one or
more groups will find it somewhat difficult to access information in the
document. Satisfying this checkpoint will improve access to Web documents.
"
I do not feel that adding visual captions to audio clips is removing
"significant barriers" [see P2 definition].  I am also assuming that volume
control and play back controls on the user agent will provide the access to
the audio information that the user with residual hearing may need.
Remember,  as the residual hearing approaches zero, the benefit of visual
synchronized captions approaches zero, but never gets there because
synchronized timed presentation of the text captions gives indication to
rhythm or timing of the text - but, which is something that can be
approached  - with good punctuation, hence requiring only a P3.
