I respectfully disagree.  Reading synchronized captions is MUCH easier and 
MUCH more functional than referring to a separate transcript.  So much so 
that P2 might even be too LOW.  Think of this from the perspective of a 
person who is deaf and who is quite comfortable with (closed) captions on 
television.

I also have to say again that if (1) one's video is already in "Real Player 
G2" format (very popular), and (2) you already have a text transcript, then 
(3) creating synchronized captions (via SMIL) is VERY easy.

If anyone cares to provide an example (1) and a corresponding (2), I would 
be pleased to volunteer creating (3).
