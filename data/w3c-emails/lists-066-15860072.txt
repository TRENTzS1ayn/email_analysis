phil, good points.

just to clarify, could you state where you feel  P1, P2, P3 should be for
Audion/Video.

but i also think you can add in here text transcripts in html format.  Would
we want to say this is P1

So for Audio - Video
P1 is text transcripts
P2 is "What goes here?"
P3 is "Caption and Description"  with visual syncrohnization

For examples, pls see http://www1.usmint.gov/GoldenDollar/Sen_Dorgan.htm and
http://www1.usmint.gov/GoldenDollar/broadcast.cfm

regards, rob
