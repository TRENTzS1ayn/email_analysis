Bruce, I agree with you for a video that has also has the audio track, but
do you have the same opinion for just an audio only file?  In other words,
say there is an audio file of a musical song, isn't reading the musical
score, with the words, more accessible than a empty (remember there is no
video in this example) view with some caption text popping up now and then?

I respectfully disagree.  Reading synchronized captions is MUCH easier and
MUCH more functional than referring to a separate transcript.  So much so
that P2 might even be too LOW.  Think of this from the perspective of a
person who is deaf and who is quite comfortable with (closed) captions on
television.

I also have to say again that if (1) one's video is already in "Real Player
G2" format (very popular), and (2) you already have a text transcript, then
(3) creating synchronized captions (via SMIL) is VERY easy.

If anyone cares to provide an example (1) and a corresponding (2), I would
be pleased to volunteer creating (3).
