Phill, if you are just reading it then that is the case. However for people
who have marinal hearing, having the sound and the captions/score available
and synchronisd is more valuable than one or the other (similarly for people
who can hear, but have difficulty reading). One of the challenges we face is
that there are people who are looking for mulit-modal support - there are
more paople with poor hearing than there are with no hearing (and similarly
for other disabilities).

  Bruce, I agree with you for a video that has also has the audio track, but
  do you have the same opinion for just an audio only file?  In other words,
  say there is an audio file of a musical song, isn't reading the musical
  score, with the words, more accessible than a empty (remember there is no
  video in this example) view with some caption text popping up now and then?

  Please respond to "webmaster@dors.sailorsite.net"

  I respectfully disagree.  Reading synchronized captions is MUCH easier and
  MUCH more functional than referring to a separate transcript.  So much so
  that P2 might even be too LOW.  Think of this from the perspective of a
  person who is deaf and who is quite comfortable with (closed) captions on
  television.
  
  I also have to say again that if (1) one's video is already in "Real Player
  G2" format (very popular), and (2) you already have a text transcript, then
  (3) creating synchronized captions (via SMIL) is VERY easy.
  
  If anyone cares to provide an example (1) and a corresponding (2), I would
  be pleased to volunteer creating (3).
