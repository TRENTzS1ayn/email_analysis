To make this discussion more concrete:

<object type="audio/basic" data="soundfile.au"> Sound of a pipe organ
</object>

If sound support is switched off or unavailable, the description will be
rendered. The user agent should also provide an option with which to play
the sound file and render the description. Obviously it would be better if
the sound were not played until that part of the document containing the
OBJECT element appeared on screen; but this is a user agent problem. So
far as the author is concerned, no question of synchronization would
seem to occur, at least, not under the current checkpoint 1.4.

However, if both the auditory and visual tracks change and are
synchronized, then the captions must likewise be synchronized, as in such
circumstances one is dealing with a multimedia presentation to which
checkpoint 1.4 applies.
