Hello everyone
We have had a major breakthrough in the UK regarding accessible Website
design.

The UK Government has just published its first set of Web design guidelines. 
All Governmental Web sites are subject to these guidelines.

The Government consulted with us (the Royal National Institute for the Blind)
and other disability organisations, and as a result access for all is a strong
theme (particularly section 4 which is about design).  Excerpt: "In addition to
compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act, it is vital that all potential
users of government web services are able to access sites. Designers should
consider carefully whether it is necessary to depart from these
recommendations and, if they do, ensure that optional displays are available
to permit inclusive access."

While the guidelines do not effect sites which are not Government-run, we will
use them to encourage business to think of all potential users when designing
Web sites.

Best wishes

1.7 million people in the UK experience a serious sight problem or blindness.
Poor Web design prevents many disabled people from getting the most from
the Web. Support our campaign for better Web design!
