While I agree in large measure with Eric's comments, one point of
clarification should be noted: the guidelines do take account of sound
files (namely in checkpoint 1.1), but, on my interpretation, these are not
presently subject to the synchronisation requirement of checkpoint 1.4.
Charles has argued (and I agree with him) that such synchronisation is
necessary. This is particularly the case, as Eric rightly notes, in
respect of long, changing sounds and audio streams. Naturally, one can
dispute the priority level. To what extent is it beneficial, for those
with limited hearing, to have the sounds synchronised with the textual
transcript, and to what degree does it hinder access if this is not so?

At present, as I read the guidelines (and I do so against the background
of their history) the textual equivalents of audio files (where these are
not part of a "multimedia presentation"--that is to say, where they are
not accompanied by visual content) need not be synchronised with the
sound. Charles has argued persuasively that such a requirement should be
added in a future revision or as an erratum.
