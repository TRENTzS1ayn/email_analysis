If I am following this then, P1 is text transcript of auditory information, 
while P2 would be "live" captions.  So transcript is to audio as ALT is to 
IMG.

Where do the guidelines differentiate between music/sound/noise and speech 
output / voice recording?  What is the audio equivalent for ALT=""?  What 
is the appropriate tags for the annoying MIDI background "music" that many 
sites seem to favor?
