Great questions / responses. There are a few things which I've written
down to keep in mind while laying out web pages and working with
designs. The 'jump to main content' is a great idea, and one I'll be
using -- generally, even in a table heavy site, content will live in one
place.

Also, I think the accelerated use of DBs to drive websites should help
with accessibility of documents on the web. If you're using a DB to
populate a design with content, it's trivial to design a text-only
version to be populated with the exact same content -- no more text
versions that are six months out of date.
