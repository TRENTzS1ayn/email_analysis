Are we in agreement that we discussing only audio that meaningful content? 
 I am thinking of a typical RealAudio archive of a radio broadcast.

P1 is met by providing a transcript.

With the very reasonable points made about residual hearing, English as a 
foreign language, learning disabilities, etc., P2 (significant barriers) 
seem fair to me for these groups.

With the points raised (additional audiences served by live captioning), I 
would now argue that for multimedia (video w/ voice) that P1 *requires* 
captions (and that mere transcripts are not good enough).  The Deaf are so 
comfortable now with synchronized television (and movie) captioning that 
IMHO a separate transcript is not much of an accommodation.

Does SMIL support captions for ReadAudio broadcasts?
Does anyone have examples of synchronized captions for audio-only content?
