It is my understanding that Smil can easily synchronize a text transcript
with an audio-only presentation (such synchronization, after all, is what
it is designed to accomplish).

It appears to be broadly agreed within the group that a requirement to
synchronize text transcripts with audio presentations should be
established, at least at a priority 2 level.

Is there anyone who would prefer to raise the priority? Also, is this
issue significant/urgent enough to be added to the errata (with a
specifically proposed change to checkpoint 1.4) or should it instead be
left for the next revision of the guidelines (assuming that there is one)?
