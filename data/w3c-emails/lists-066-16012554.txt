What is scary is that it seems there are web designers who are only following
a small part of the market space, and not learning what the web itself is and
is becoming. The fact that there are strategies for delivering content over
the wide range of deployed devices and software, and that technology like
SMIL and SVG is being developed to allow even more types of content to be
delivered over an even wider range of clients, is very positive. The fact
that there are web designers who are not aware of this is an argument for
thinking carefully before hiring one, and for those of us who are aware of
such technologies to actively promote their use and the idea of
interoperability that motivates them.

In this particular article the author has placed himself on the horns of a
dilemma that is entirely of his on making, by failing to understand that
there are approaches which can deliver the dynamic content he is searching to
provide in a way which transforms gracefully - he is dumbing down his own
approach to technology, rather than the technology requiring him to dumb
anything else down.
