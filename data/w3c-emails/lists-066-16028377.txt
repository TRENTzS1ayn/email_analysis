Actually SMIL on it's own _can_ provide synchronised text, but at the moment
the common way to do this is to use some other, proprietary format such as
realtext that also has timing built in.

Somewhere i did an example, because the audio track was extremely poor
quality. But I fear I have lost it. If I get time I'll have another go.

  It appears to be broadly agreed within the group that a requirement to
  synchronize text transcripts with audio presentations should be
  established, at least at a priority 2 level.
  
  Is there anyone who would prefer to raise the priority? Also, is this
  issue significant/urgent enough to be added to the errata (with a
  specifically proposed change to checkpoint 1.4) or should it instead be
  left for the next revision of the guidelines (assuming that there is one)?
