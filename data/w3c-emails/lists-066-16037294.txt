Charles, are you suggesting that for the "equivalent alternative" of a
musical song, that I have all three, the music, and the synchronized text
AND the synchronized musical score?  [i.e., the "bouncing ball" video
production?]

I could agree that all three would be useful, perhaps improve
accessibility, and certainly improve teaching techniques - still a P3.
