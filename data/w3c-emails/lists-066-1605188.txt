I too have had a difficult time coming up with a practical example for
using TABINDEX in a FORM.  I have to design a very complex and poorly
ordered form to make TABINDEX useful, and it seems much easier to just
design the form well from the start.

However, I have started using TABINDEX to provide the user with a way of
easily skipping over any NAVIGATION bar or advertising links that may lurk
at the top of my pages.   I generally assign TABINDEX=1 to what I feel is
the most important link on the page (quite often the "Next Page" link), and
go on from there as systematically as I can.  Usually the last "n" tab
stops correspond to the standard nav-bar (or nav-bar text alternative) links.

Happy holiday season to all,
Chuck Letourneau
