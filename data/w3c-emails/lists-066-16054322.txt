Hello,

We have a teleconference scheduled for tomorrow (Thursday, 16 December, 
4:00-5:00 Eastern, at +1-617-252-1038).

I propose that we discuss:
1.  proposed charter [1].
2.  proposed timeline for completing the charter [2].
3.  proposed end of charter report [3].

if we have time:
4. captions for audio clips
5. space and null alt-text


A couple of comments about the charter:
In my first drafts of the charter I included an activity that would review 
the top 20 sites as rated by some portal.  I thought that this exercise 
would help us identify current technique trends as well as start a dialog 
between our group and the developers of the top 20 sites.  I had hoped that 
this might result in the top 20 sites becoming more accessible, and perhaps 
participation in the group by some of those developers.  However, others 
felt this activity is more appropriate in EO.

I think we could contribute to the EO activity by going through this 
exercise.  My main goal is to increase the accessibility of the Web by 
working with developers of top sites as well as increasing the number of 
developers on the list.  I think the major focus of the next phase of the 
group is creating and testing techniques and a strong developer and 
designer contingency will be key.

However, we have more than enough on our plate.  Therefore we may not want 
to promise reviewing the top 20 sites if we find other ways to meet the 
needs I have identified.  These needs have been documented in the charter.

I look forward to comments and review.  "hear" you all tomorrow,
