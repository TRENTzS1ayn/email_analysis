GF:
I'm afraid I have to disagree with some of this, too.

1.  I'm definitely not in favor of separating audio-only presentations from audio+video+text+etc presentations.  I think that splitting presentations into "unimedia" and "multimedia" is going to generate unnecessary confusion among authors who are already confused about accessibility.  "Multimedia" appears to be gaining acceptance as a term which encompasses the presentation of sound and pictures.  Do we REALLY need to invent a new word?  Although an audio-only presentation in its native state is not "multi"media, adding a text track to this single audio track qualifies it for "multi" status, no?  

2. Having said that... if you ARE providing access for an audio-only presentation, I prefer that synchronized text-- i.e., captions-- receive Priority 2.  A text transcript (not synchronized) should be Priority 1.  (Okay, okay...  I REALLY prefer that captions receive Priority 1 status here, but I have been persuaded that synchronized text is not exactly necessary with audio-only media.)

3.  You're right-- making a musical score available *could* be useful, but I'm not so sure  it's a high-priority access issue.  Writing scores imposes big obstacles on the author, not the least of which is musical literacy on the author's part.  What if the author didn't compose the music and doesn't know how to even read or write music?  Who's going to prepare and mark up the score?  And presentation of music visibly as opposed to aurally raises the specter of rights issues.  Rights may have been negotiated from a composer to make the music available aurally for a specific use, but not visibly.  This adds a layer of complexity that will guarantee a lack of accessibile multimedia.
