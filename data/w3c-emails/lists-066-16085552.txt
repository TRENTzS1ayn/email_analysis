aloha, phil!

use of the WHO definitions of disability, impairment, and functional limitation
was proposed by denis anson for inclusion in UAGL, and while the members of the
UA WG in attendance at the recent UA face2face in austin resolved to adopt the
definition (and i accepted an action item to alert the AU and GL WGs that we
had done so), the resolution was apparently over-turned by the Coordination
Group in this week's CG telecon...

here is the relevant extract from the raw minutes of today's UA telecon -- jg
stands for jon gunderson and mq for mickey quenzer; while LC stands for "Last
Call"

quote
LC#137: Use of terms for disabilities, impairment -- add in agenda

jg: Denis Anson brought WHO def to f2f. jg brought to coordination
group...CG those defs are medical model, contemporary-more positive, inclusive.
Many disability groups do not like WHO def. CG recommends using standing
def. in the current document. Comments.... 

mq: so we don't have to change anything. its all personal preference 

jg: good for keeping in harmony with other documents, and Judy Brewer would
balk. Issue closed. no decension in group.
