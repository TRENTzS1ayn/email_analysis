Hi, Gregory

Have you had a chance to look at the demo web pages I've put up?  They are
actually good examples of the difference between structuring a web page
on the basis of the semantic or concepts being conveyed by the page
versus structuring a web page for visual interest or impact.

The point you might have missed in my comments was that focus of the
conversation was on web pages personalized for each customer.
Personalized web pages is applying the technology of dynamically
generated web pages to create web pages specialized for the particular
user requesting the page.  This might include languages, layout, colors,
stock quotes, news articles, etc.  The online banking is old technology
compared to what is now being cooked up.

Something, I'm not quite sure I'm conveying very well is that style
sheets will NOT support transformation of web pages on the basis of
semantic content.  They only support transformation on structure.  Web
pages organized according to semantic aspects is a better design for
blind users.  In order to evaluate this, it is important to understand
the difference between organization according to visual impact and
organization according to semantic aspects.  (Also, remember that in
general once information is translated into HTML, the semantic
relationships are lost to most software reading the HTML as explained by
Tim Berners-Lee).

Just to be clear  ...  your note mentioned a generic user .  What was
talked about is that there would be NO generic user.  Each web page
is specialized in content, format, language, etc to each individual
user.
