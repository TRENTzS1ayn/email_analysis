Hi, Gregory

The impression I'm getting is that an issue that seems to be bothering
you is the labeling.  Different people have different views.  For
example, since I use a wheelchair, I tend to look for doors with
wheelchair symbols because I know they will be easier for me to use.
For most people who aren't disabled, they don't need to look for the
specially marked doors.  Having the doors marked with wheelchair symbols
seems very straight-forward.

Looking at the template.  Blind people have less trouble using web pages
which are organized according to semantic/concept structure.  (I believe
this is probably true for most blind users.)  Sighted people often
prefer web pages which are organized to be visually interesting.  Does
this make sense to you?  (You might want to look at my examples before
answering this.)

In most situations, these pages are very different.  (Trying to get one
page to be both usually means compromising either the visual impact or
the ease of use by blind users.  Guess who probably does not come out
well in these compromises.)  As a result, the templates used to generate
the web pages need to be different.  What would you call a template
designed to present information organized according to semantic
structure?  It would not be very convenient to call it the
"semantically-organized template" since most blind users would not know
what that means.
