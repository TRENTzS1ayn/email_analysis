Yes, if there's only one term used. I don't find it jolting to
say "a text equivalent for the image" and "equivalent text
for the image" in the same document. It's perhaps slightly better
to use the term consistently, but I don't think it causes confusion.

Still, I support consistency.

I remember your reticence about this in the WCAG 1.0 discussions, but
as I recall, the WG decided to go ahead with the expression. (I
looked through archives for the discussion, but couldn't find the
info. Meanwhile, Eric, a missing style sheet (at least one [1]) 
prevents me (with broken Netscape) from reading your revisions
of last April).
