Based on today's discussion [1] I revised the charter [2] and timeline [3].

The major changes in the charter and timeline:

1.  the testing procedures are not a deliverable but a matter of how we 
work.  therefore it has been removed from the list of deliverables and the 
timeline, but we mention testing where we discuss the Techniques document.

2.  the impact matrix is not longer a deliverable but mentioned as a 
supporting document of the Guidelines since it could get incorporated into 
the guidelines either per checkpoint or as an appendix.  we don't want to 
promise an extra deliverable.

3. in the coordination section, we mention mobile and I18N explicitly and 
have pulled the piece about CG out into the intro (it was in the paragraph 
about PF).

I would like to send the charter to the Director next week.  Please post 
comments before next Wednesday (December 22).  Note that the timeline and 
end of charter report [4] are supporting materials for the charter, thus I 
would also like comments on them before Wednesday as well.

Thanks,
