Hi,
This afternoon a blind friend and I discussed possible terminology.
The idea we came up with was "non-graphic" personal web pages.
It is probably preferable to "text-only" since it is possible to
have a web page of text, but have the layout have a graphic feel
to it, e.g. text in double columns.  Blind users might have slightly higher
recognition of the phrase "non-graphic".  Also, browsers seem to be
categorized as graphic and non-graphic.

The draw-back is that people are somewhat used to the phrase "text-only".

What do people think?

Scott
