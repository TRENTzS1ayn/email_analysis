The charter looks fine although I'm not entirely satisfied that 5.User
Agent Support for Accessibility (W3C Note) should be a "deliverable".

As to the timelines I suggest that so long as everything claimed as a
"deliverable" is included, everyone will understand that the dates are,
to say the least, flexible. On the whole they seem optimistically dated
judging by the alt="" fiasco <grin>

My only comment on the end-charter report is "well done".
