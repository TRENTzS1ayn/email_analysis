Agreed.  Thank you Jason!

Perhaps we should return to our discussion of defining "accessible"?

Accessible is too frequently used (by folks oriented towards learning 
disability issues) to mean comprehensible or usable.

In the mainstream, accessible to all too frequently used to merely mean 
available (either geographically or electronically).

The WCAG defines "Accessible" as:
<Q>Content is accessible when it may be used by someone with a 
disability.</Q>
http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#accessible

This definition is not quite circular, but it is self-referential.  I think 
it could be improved.

I would vote for something like:

<DT>Accessible</DT>
<DD>Usable to someone with a disability, especially a severe sensory or 
physical impairment.  Accessible does not necessarily imply meaningful, 
comprehensible, nor even useful.  Accessible is a significantly higher 
standard than merely "available".</DD>
