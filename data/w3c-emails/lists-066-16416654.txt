Could anyone point me in the direction of public and published works
similiar to:
Programming Bots, Spiders, and Intelligent Agents in Microsoft Visual C++
from MS by david pallman.
preferably using public source (with XML), and written in an accessible
manner but in other languages?

creating intelligent (user) agents that are transparent, open and
configurable by people with a learning disability currently involves
mediation.

The creation of the means to access the information held within XML needs to
be available to the end user, not just the corporations that would control
access.

Does wai have documentation on this area of accessibility?

Merry Xmas to you all and best wishes for the new year
