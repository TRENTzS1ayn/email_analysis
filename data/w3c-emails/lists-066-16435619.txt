Hi, Charles

I may not have been very clear in my posting.  An issue seems to be
whether to identify a type of page as being designed for blind users.
There seems to be a variety of opinions on this aspect through my very
informal surveying.  For example, one blind man said if he can ask
for information in braille, how is it different to ask for a web page which
is easier to use?

The reason that the phrase "non-graphical" came up was a way to address the
preferences of those blind users who are uncomfortable with selecting
a web page format which is identified as being for blind users.

The phrase "non-graphical" was not meant to convey that the pages would
only have graphical elements removed.  The format would include other aspects
such as order based on the semantic information of the page, etc.

Do you have a different suggestion for terminology?


I agree that a better approach is to provide alternatives from which
a user can make a selection.  A key technical limitation has to do
with the fact about which Tim Berners-Lee has written that it is very hard
for software to extract semantic information out of HTML once the
HTML is created.  As a result, alternatives which are dependent
on semantic aspects need organized along the semantic aspects
before the HTML is created.

Do you understand this technical limitation?


A second question is whether you think that it is easier for many blind people
to use web pages which are organized along semantic aspects?  What tests
have you done along these lines?


In my informal surveying, a number of blind users have commented on how they
are challenged using screen readers.  The more complicated they are,
the harder it will be for blind users of average intelligence or
technical motivation to use them.  Learning to use screen readers is
not the preferred past-time of many blind people.

One blind man's view of a screen reader is like a tool for cutting through
the underbrush.  The more types and variations of underbrush, the
more complex the underbrush device has to become and the harder it is
to learn to use.  A better strategy would be to avoid creating the
underbrush when possible.  While there are those who might like
fighting through the underbrush, there are those who just want to
get through the underbrush as quickly as possible and get on
with other aspects of their lives.

I believe from the various conversations I've had with blind folks
whose lives are not technology that each aspect which makes web
pages easier to use will help diminish the digital divide which
could harm the quality of their lives.


Do you understand the issue of the visual imperative of web pages
and why sighted people are less likely to compromise the
visual appeal of web pages in order to make them easier to use
by blind people?
