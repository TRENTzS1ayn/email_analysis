There is in fact a great deal of semantic information that can be extracted
from HTML if it has been encoded, but there are a lot of visually oriented
designers who are sufficiently bloody-minded about the importance of visual
presentation that they will hard-code the "underbrush" into content while
leaving out the semantic information that would make their page useful across
different hardware and software setups.

It is true that there is a limit to the amount of information that can be
extracted from the current versions of Explorer, Opera, Netscape, Neoplanet,
Doczilla and Lynx. Structured browsers can provide more (e.g. Amaya) but more
still will be available when RDF and XML are implemented and shippable (in
part this is not really possible, because the XML linking mechanism has not
yet been finished).

The idea of providing a non-graphic version which has been optimised is not
intrinsically bad. The idea that this restructured view of a page, and a
completely unstructured view as propogated on the web today adds up to
accessibility is wrong, for the reasons I outlined in my previous message on
the topic. In order to make this approach work to provide accessibility the
workload increases to provide various different presentations optimised for
various groups, and becomes isolating to the extent that different groups of
users are not getting the same page and have difficulty in talking about what
is ostensibly the same thing in a way that other groups can recognise.

I would suggest that you are doing a good job on presenting the page to one
group of users, but that it would be more profitable to focus your efforst on
the original page.

As a visual user I perfectly understand the visual imperative for
communication. My basic training in Graphic Communication also gives me an
understanding that there is more to it than having a lot of fancy images -
there are plenty of examples of visually designed and visualy appealing but
almost unusable sites out there. Those just demonstrate that it is possible
to do a bad job in many media at once as well as to do a good job. I would
encourage you to continue with the approach of having a site which a
primarily visual user is comfortable with, but I would encourage you to turn
some of your talent to making that version itself better for users.

  Hi, Charles
  
  I may not have been very clear in my posting.  An issue seems to be
  whether to identify a type of page as being designed for blind users.
  There seems to be a variety of opinions on this aspect through my very
  informal surveying.  For example, one blind man said if he can ask
  for information in braille, how is it different to ask for a web page which
  is easier to use?
  
  The reason that the phrase "non-graphical" came up was a way to address the
  preferences of those blind users who are uncomfortable with selecting
  a web page format which is identified as being for blind users.
  
  The phrase "non-graphical" was not meant to convey that the pages would
  only have graphical elements removed.  The format would include other aspects
  such as order based on the semantic information of the page, etc.
  
  Do you have a different suggestion for terminology?
  
  
  I agree that a better approach is to provide alternatives from which
  a user can make a selection.  A key technical limitation has to do
  with the fact about which Tim Berners-Lee has written that it is very hard
  for software to extract semantic information out of HTML once the
  HTML is created.  As a result, alternatives which are dependent
  on semantic aspects need organized along the semantic aspects
  before the HTML is created.
  
  Do you understand this technical limitation?
  
  
  A second question is whether you think that it is easier for many blind people
  to use web pages which are organized along semantic aspects?  What tests
  have you done along these lines?
  
  
  In my informal surveying, a number of blind users have commented on how they
  are challenged using screen readers.  The more complicated they are,
  the harder it will be for blind users of average intelligence or
  technical motivation to use them.  Learning to use screen readers is
  not the preferred past-time of many blind people.
  
  One blind man's view of a screen reader is like a tool for cutting through
  the underbrush.  The more types and variations of underbrush, the
  more complex the underbrush device has to become and the harder it is
  to learn to use.  A better strategy would be to avoid creating the
  underbrush when possible.  While there are those who might like
  fighting through the underbrush, there are those who just want to
  get through the underbrush as quickly as possible and get on
  with other aspects of their lives.
  
  I believe from the various conversations I've had with blind folks
  whose lives are not technology that each aspect which makes web
  pages easier to use will help diminish the digital divide which
  could harm the quality of their lives.
  
  
  Do you understand the issue of the visual imperative of web pages
  and why sighted people are less likely to compromise the
  visual appeal of web pages in order to make them easier to use
  by blind people?
