Hi, Charles

I'm not sure we are using semantic information in the same way.
Blind users would find a web page helpful where links are in order
according to most likely to be used.  Given an arbirtrary wen page,
no software could order the links according to frequency of use.
The software would need to know the purpose of each link, but would not be
able to figure that out from the HTML.  This is an example
of semantic information which is lost when semantic information is
encoded into HTML.

Remember I'm proposing that different formats be made available
for dynamically generated web pages.  This helps reduce the amount
of work needed.

How many different formats do you think are needed?

Given ease of use versus the frequency of talking about the same page,
which do you think is more important?  How often do people talk about
particular web pages as compared to actually using the web pages?
My suspicion is that people spend much more time using web pages
instead of talking about them.  It would seem to make more sense
to optimise for ease of use than ease of communication.

The example I've put up comes from talking with blind users and
seeing what their needs are for working with web pages.  In the
original version in my example, a table is used so that the results
are nicely lined up to be visually appealing.  Blind users don't
need that type of formatting and there's not a strong reason
for their page to be in a table.  Web pages which are organized
so that the most important information comes first benefits blind users.
Creating a similar order of importance is not as easy in a visual
situation since the media is two dimensional rather than the one
dimensional experienced by users.
