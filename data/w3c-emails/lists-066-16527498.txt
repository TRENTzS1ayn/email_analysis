William,

>The charter looks fine although I'm not entirely satisfied that 5.User
>Agent Support for Accessibility (W3C Note) should be a "deliverable".
Is this because of the discussion from Thursday's call that the User Agent 
Support page could be wrapped into the test suite for Techniques?  If it is 
not a deliverable on its own, we could include it in the list of supporting 
documents for the next release of the WCAG.

The other thing, is that Ian and I are working on a draft of this 
document.  The information we gather could be included in the Techniques 
test suite once it is created.  Therefore, if we're going to have something 
anyway, why not list it as a deliverable?  Something has to be generated to 
support WCAG1.0, but the next version might have a different form of 
support, OR no need for a user agent support page.

thoughts?

>My only comment on the end-charter report is "well done".

Thanks to Chuck Letourneau for writing the majority of it!
