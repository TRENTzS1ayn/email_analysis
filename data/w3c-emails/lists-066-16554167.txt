sorry for not beeing there, was in new york attending e-business conference.
the format was panalist from industry would dicuss the seminar topic and
then answer questions.  Just so happened the panelist said, "they were
having trouble with cross browser compatibility"   Later, I asked the
questions to the audience (probably 1000+) are they using the WCAG and are
they familiar with Section 508 and ADA and compiance issues.  Then there was
silence and I was asked to further explain and i did.  mentioned lawsuits
and 31 plus million PWD as a market force.  After several said they were not
aware. The guy from major travel web site  ( i think) said they will comply
with all fedral and ADA guidelines.

I also met with Jupiter, a leading interent market research company and
think i convinced them to write or schedule a four research article.  Their
stuff goes to all the corporate CEOs and executives.  see jup.com and it its
a subscription service that costs - we get it.
