I think that defining priority on the basis of a implementation difficulty is
a serious mistake. We have a reasonable ability to understand user needs in a
regular way, and to get them roughly right. Deciding what is easily
implemented is clearly not within the bounds even of a group of developers,
since one lot will say "that can't be done" while another lot comes and says
"oh, we did that years ago".

At least this has been my experience in the Authoring Tools Group.
