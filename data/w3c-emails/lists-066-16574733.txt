we will be doing personalization soon.  we can include this in our
requirements matrix and see how it works out.  Personalization also depends
on the software selected.  There are some high-end packages like Vignette
story server and others.

by the way, need to convince marketing there are 31 million PWD who are a
market force.  Most marketing execs want to see numbers who buy at the site.
I see personalization as a convincing way because there is  no way to tell
who is hiting us with screen readers.

i am for it!

Subject: Personalized web pages


> Hi,

> One of the questions was how to make it easy to use by blind people.
> I basically said that there are different views of the issues. Some
