Yes, it would seem to be a good thing for SMIL to allow text content in teh
XML itself, using normal SMIL timing and allowing for CSS or XSL as a
presentation control.

This would achieve all the goals of having text, and allow a SMIL
presentation to be read sa plain XML without any multimedia player.

  If synchronization becomes so important should we try to talk to SMIL WG to
  be able to do a SMIL file that contains both the text and timecodes? Or
  maybe it should be a separate standard? Having one file for each text line
  that needs to be synchronized is really cumbersome. And if the
  synchronization changes the files need to change as well. A good tool may
  help to manage this but still I would prefer the timecodes with the text.
  
  Another thing is that the user should be able to control what media is
  shown. The author design can be a default, but if the author has not
  thought of every necessary combination, the user should still be able to
  change it.
  
  One question: if we say synchronization is necessary then what is the
  amount of synchronization that is needed? Every sentence? Every paragraph?
  
  I think synchronization is often at least P3 (often probably more) but in
  some cases I would also like to be able to just read the text and not care
  about the synchronization at all. Is there a way to have both? A SMIL
  synchronization file that refers to different text portions in a text
  transcript file (without forcing it to be divided into several files)? Or
  just being able to ignore the time codes when reading synchronized text?
