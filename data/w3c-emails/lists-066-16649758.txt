Hi, Charles

I wasn't sure if you are aware that a number of people in the HCI world
talk about how web pages can be viewed as interfaces which you use once
and then throw away.

Since search engines and portals give options to users to get the web
pages in the formats they like, is there a reason why search engines and
portals should give users the options to get their web web pages in
glorious graphics mode?  I'm very visual and about 50% of my thinking is
in images.  It is easier for me to work with information which I receive
rendered graphically.

If we can get paper towels in sizes and styles we like, shouldn't we
also get web pages which are generated dynamically in the styles and
formats we like?  Shouldn't blind users get web pages which are easier
for them to use?

Are you suggesting that all users should get the same dynamically
generated web pages when the technology like XML provide the ability to
create web pages in formats individualized to each user likes?
