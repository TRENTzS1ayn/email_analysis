 from an implementation standpoint, what does everyone think about having
text transcripts as P2 for a video clip and synchronized captions P3?
  
and Charles McCN replied:
I think that defining priority on the basis of a implementation difficulty is
a serious mistake. We have a reasonable ability to understand user needs in a
regular way, and to get them roughly right. Deciding what is easily
implemented is clearly not within the bounds even of a group of developers,
since one lot will say "that can't be done" while another lot comes and says
"oh, we did that years ago".


Geoff F:
I agree with Charles.  Also, Rob's proposal means there's no Priority 1 for
 multimedia, and that's a serious mistake.  I lobby for...

-- audio-only multimedia:  transcripts P1, synchronized captions P2
-- audio+video multimedia:  synchronized captions P1, transcripts P2
