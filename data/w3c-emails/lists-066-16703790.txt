Wendy,
I think things like scripting and XSLT are about transforming information.
Transformation can include rendering content on a specific medium like a
graphical display.  This seems fundamentally different then representing
the information in a document format like HTML, XML, SMIL or MathML.
Therefore a separate line in the charter would highlight this difference.
