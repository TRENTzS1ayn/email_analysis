10.3
http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/wai-pageauth.html#tech-linear-tables

After attending CSUN and walking the show floor, it appeared to me that
most, if not all platforms had user agents and/or assistive technologies
that provided a linear text alternative for all tables that layed out text
in parallel, word-wrapped columns.  Please understand, I don't think we are
there yet on navigating tables, and we still need the table header markup
and checkpoints under "if you use tables".   I was just very curious if
anyone new of a platform that did not support access to word-wrapped
columns.  By platform I mean like OS/2 has a screen reader that works well
with Lynx, and the combination provide access to word wrapped columns, DOS
as a platform has a screen reader and browser that handles word-wrapped
columns of text, and of course the Windows platform has solved the problem
and is quite competitive.  So, are we there yet?

"Until user agents ...

How will content developers know when most user agents or assistive
technologies meet specific needs? The W3C WAI will make information about
support for accessibility features available from its Web site (either
directly or by providing links to the information). Content developers are
encouraged to consult this information regularly for pertinent updates. "

If we are there, perhaps this is a good candidate to provide information
for a "pertinent update".

Again, if anyone knows of a platform that does not support access to
word-wrapped columns - please reply.
