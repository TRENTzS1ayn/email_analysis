Hello,

The editors have published a new Techniques document [1]
and the list of changes [2] since the previous version.
For those of you reading this in a plane, here are the
changes:

    1.New checkpoint map with full checkpoint text 
    2.New element/attribute tables, with linearized alternatives, and
have been          moved from "Accessibility themes" section
      towards the end of the document. There are also linear versions  
      of these tables.
    3.New section "How Techniques are Organized" 
    4.New section (with old stuff) about CSS. 
    5.Added new links to services 
    6."Accessibility Themes for HTML" became a more 
       general section on "Accessibility Themes" 
    7.Removed the "To implement" sections. For example, 
     "To implement alt-text, use the "alt" attribute. In HTML 4.0,
applies
      to: IMG, AREA, etc." This information is included in the element 
      and attribute tables. 
    8.Moved as many examples as we could from the "Accessibilty 
      themes" section to the appropriate HTML sections (i.e.,
      example using accesskey on forms to the forms section). 
    9.Substantial content was added to and/or reorganized in the
      following subsections of "accessibility themes": Other topics,
      Validation, Browser Support, and Language information 
   10.Substantial content was added to and/or reorganized 
      in the following subsections of "HTML techniques": Links, 
      Images and Image maps, Applets and other programmatic 
      Objects, Forms, Scripts
