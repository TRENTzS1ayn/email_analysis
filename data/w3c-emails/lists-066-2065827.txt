Two further points:

1. I agree with Charles and Ian that a note must be included which
explains that the use of tables for layout purposes is an abuse of HTML
markup.

2. When I referred to the deletion of table-related tags in the preceding
message, I was using the term "tag" in its proper sense, which denotes the
start and end tags of an element. Thus, the process envisaged here
consists of the deletion of the start and end tags of table-related
elements (TABLE, TR, TD, etc.).

I should also have added a requirement (which is already present in the
guidelines anyway) that only TD cells be used for layout tables. The point
regarding structural markup is very important and this is why I have tried
to explain it as clearly as possible.
