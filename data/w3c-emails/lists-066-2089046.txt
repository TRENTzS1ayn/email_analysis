Checkpoint 5.3 is like the world's religions... everybody's view is the
correct view.  I must consider myself an agnostic, sitting on the fence.  I
think Ian is very close with his proposal. I agree with Eric's sentiment,
but not strongly enough to have 5.3 removed entirely.  I agree with Jason's
sentiment, but not strongly enough to enjoin people from using tables for
layout in all cases. 

So, here is my two cents on rewording:

"If tables are used for layout (i.e you cannot yet achieve the same design
using style sheets - see Guideline/checkpoint whatever) then design all
layout tables so that the content is presented logically when the table is
linearized."
     Priority 1.

And by all means, add a note as per Jason's and Eric's comments: "using
tables for layout is wrong, and here's why... "

Perhaps Checkpoint 10.3, which as Eric points out is similar in intent,
could be combined with a reworded 5.3.  However, I think the caution or
reminder of the difficulties caused by tables used for layout (as distinct
from the specific case of columns of text) should remain in the checkpoints.
