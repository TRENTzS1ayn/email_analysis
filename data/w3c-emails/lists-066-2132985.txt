I object to 5.3 (didn't think I was religious), I like your wording, Chuck.

"If tables are used for layout (i.e you cannot yet achieve the same design
using style sheets - see Guideline/checkpoint whatever) then design all
layout tables so that the content is presented logically when the table is
linearized."

Checkpoint 5.3 is like the world's religions... everybody's view is the
correct view.  I must consider myself an agnostic, sitting on the fence.  I
think Ian is very close with his proposal. I agree with Eric's sentiment,
but not strongly enough to have 5.3 removed entirely.  I agree with Jason's
sentiment, but not strongly enough to enjoin people from using tables for
layout in all cases.

So, here is my two cents on rewording:

"If tables are used for layout (i.e you cannot yet achieve the same design
using style sheets - see Guideline/checkpoint whatever) then design all
layout tables so that the content is presented logically when the table is
linearized."
     Priority 1.

And by all means, add a note as per Jason's and Eric's comments: "using
tables for layout is wrong, and here's why... "

Perhaps Checkpoint 10.3, which as Eric points out is similar in intent,
could be combined with a reworded 5.3.  However, I think the caution or
reminder of the difficulties caused by tables used for layout (as distinct
from the specific case of columns of text) should remain in the
checkpoints.
