I too like Chuck's wording, and feel that it more precisely captures the
really important acessibility issue. I think the religious issue of
misusing markup should be addressed by a note for this particular
checkpoint, as suggested. I actually feel that it is much more than a
simple religious issue - it is also about the ability to move into the
future in an accessible way.

As an aside, I would personally like to see a discussion of the
religiHH philosophy behind accessible design as an informative
appendix (and would be happy to write a rantH short piece) which
included the ideas that accessible design is simply good design for a
world where innovation is the order of the day, and that accessiblity
built in from the beginning is a lot more effective than accessiblity
retro-fitted. (Trying to convert large Java applications or applets from
the AWT model to the more accessible swing classes is a good way to
discover this, but there are many others.)

  Checkpoint 5.3 is like the world's religions... everybody's view is the
  correct view.  I must consider myself an agnostic, sitting on the fence.  I
  think Ian is very close with his proposal. I agree with Eric's sentiment,
  but not strongly enough to have 5.3 removed entirely.  I agree with Jason's
  sentiment, but not strongly enough to enjoin people from using tables for
  layout in all cases.
  
  So, here is my two cents on rewording:
  
  "If tables are used for layout (i.e you cannot yet achieve the same design
  using style sheets - see Guideline/checkpoint whatever) then design all
  layout tables so that the content is presented logically when the table is
  linearized."
       Priority 1.
  
  And by all means, add a note as per Jason's and Eric's comments: "using
  tables for layout is wrong, and here's why... "
  
  Perhaps Checkpoint 10.3, which as Eric points out is similar in intent,
  could be combined with a reworded 5.3.  However, I think the caution or
  reminder of the difficulties caused by tables used for layout (as distinct
  from the specific case of columns of text) should remain in the
  checkpoints.
