While a few people have expressed some support for my proposed rewording of
5.3 (and I thank you), I think that Jason's most recent attempt (5.3 and
5.4 below) is very good and pretty succinctly captures his previous
comments.  This wording gives us (authors) the flexibility we need to work
with the current crop of agents and yet leads us not into temptation
(pardon the ever expanding and probably irreligious religious theme I
started.) <Grin>

Cheers!
Chuck
