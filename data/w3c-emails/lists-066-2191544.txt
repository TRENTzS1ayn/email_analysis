I think that somewhere between the two lies the answer we seek.

A further proposal...

x.1
Tables must not be used for layout unless an appropriate reading order
is preserved when table is linearized. See also checkpoints 3.2,
3.3 and 3.4. [Priority 1]

techniques: Use style languages to associate presentation effects with
particular media-dependent renderings.

x.2
In tables used for layout, correct markup should be used to convey the
structure of the document (including headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.)
[Priority 2]

techniques: further discussion of how to do this 

x.3
Do not use structural markup to create presentation effects [Priority 3] 
 This makes it very difficult to interpret the structure of a document. In
 certain cases it can create significant problems - see (the checkpoints
 which deal with special cases)

techniques: Do not use TH, THEAD, etc in layout tables. Use Style
languages. A philosophical discussion of the need to design well so
accessibility can keep pace with general innovation. etc.

General notes:
This differs from Jason's proposal in that it requires tables which can be
linearised as priority 1 and effectively reduces the priority of using TH
etc to p3. It also provides a general principle of seperating style from
structure at a p3 level, with certain specific practices being p1 or p2
requirements.

It is possible to create fairly complex layouts without tables, which use
style sheets in a manner which transforms gracefully. We should dig out
the most complex such arrangements that we can find (I happen to have a
handy example - grin) and use them in the techniques to show how it is
done.

  While a few people have expressed some support for my proposed rewording of
  5.3 (and I thank you), I think that Jason's most recent attempt (5.3 and
  5.4 below) is very good and pretty succinctly captures his previous
  comments.  This wording gives us (authors) the flexibility we need to work
  with the current crop of agents and yet leads us not into temptation
  (pardon the ever expanding and probably irreligious religious theme I
  started.) <Grin>
  
  Cheers!
