4/18/99 Revision of 4/16/99 Version of the WCAG Document

I have just finished a once-through of the 16 April 1999 version of the 
guidelines.

My revision is available through the following page: 
http://etsr.digitalchainsaw.com/wcagpub/

The document URI is: http://etsr.digitalchainsaw.com/wcagpub/r990416a.htm

I will attempt to summarize some of the highlights on Monday as time permits.

I noticed significant improvements in the document.

By the way, in my revision of checkpoint 1.3 , I tried to address Jason 
White's concern and fix another limitation.
