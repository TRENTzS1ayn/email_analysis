There are a number of places in the Web Content Techniques document [1]
where ALT text is less than ideal.  The most serious ones are the
following, but some others could probably be improved:


Section 4.4.1:

alt="Item" should probably be alt="* "

The list right now looks like:

  ItemAudrey
  ItemLaurie
  ItemAlice

when it should look like:

  * Audrey
  * Laurie
  * Alice


Section 4.7.7:

Since there are alternate texts for the image map later, perhaps the
map itself should just have alt=""?


Section 5.3.1:

alt="Example in big red characters" should be replaced by alt="example".
The sentence

  This is an Example in big red characters of what we mean.

is a bit strange, while 

  This is an example of what we mean.

makes much more sense.
