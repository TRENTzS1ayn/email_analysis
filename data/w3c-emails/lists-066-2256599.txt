We don't have the lines reserved yet but we would like to announce that
there may be teleconf calls on the 22nd and or 23rd of April in connection
with the Proposed recommendation of the Web Content Guidelines.   In case we
have any issues that would indicate a needed change in the guidelines, we
would be scheduling a call.  This is just a notice of possible call at that
time.  We will follow with more detail shortly
