To: WAI Markup Guidelines<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>

I would like to see a stronger statement of Priority 1 for proper use of TD
and TH.  Based on the current Web Content guidelines this is really the
only information currently available to user agents for determining whether
a table is being used for layout or tabular data.  Without this information
user agents need to play a guessing game on what a table is being used for.
