I tend to support these comments. A suitable text equivalent for a
graphical bullet might be ALT="*", but in general, user agents tend to
insert their own bullets for list items, and thus an empty ALT string
would seem preferable.

Also, as the Techniques Document should (and probably does -- I have not
had a chance to read the latest draft) emphasize, graphical bullets are
best controlled by style sheets (an image can be designated in CSS 2 as
a list item bullet).

Given that a textual equivalent fulfils the function of the multimedia
content, and in general does not describe it, the ALT text referring to
"big red letters" in the quoted example should not do so; as suggested,
the text itslf is equivalent. Of course, a better solution would be to use
style sheets to produce the required font effect, or even:

<object data="logo.png" type="image/png"> Text of the Logo </object>
where the image represents the logo, in a special font.
