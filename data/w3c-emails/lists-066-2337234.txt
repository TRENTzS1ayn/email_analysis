My recall of the idea behind 1.3 was that it called for non-text
equivalents to be presented where appropriate. Audio description of video,
however it is generated, is a particularly outstanding example (but in my
opinion is an example not a checkpoint). I don't think this is a
showstopper - the point is handled in other places anyway.

  The relationship between checkpoints 1.1 and 1.3 caused significant
  confusion during last Tuesday's teleconference, and I am concerned that it
  would be likewise obscure to most readers. This shortcoming could be
  rectified by adding an explanatory note to checkpoint 1.3 which explains
  that the combined effect of checkpoints 1.1 and 1.3 is that a description
  of the video must be provided both as text, and as a synchronized audio
  stream.
  
  I would argue that such clarification is needed irrespective of the
  proposed "Until most multimedia players [...]" qualification of checkpoint
  1.3.
