For images they have an innate size. Some browsers slow down if they don't
know how big an image is (others don't seem to. Is there some trick?)
until they have got the whole image. In general it is preferable not to
use image sizes in pixels, but it might be worth allowing this as an
exception. It might not - it might be better to lower the priority.

  I agree that for most elements, proportional spacing is preferable. But for

  knows how to set-up the page.
  I am going to be asked to defend this checkpoint, and, right now, I do not
  know how.
  What am I not getting?
