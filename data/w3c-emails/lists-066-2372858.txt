I don't think this can rate a P1. User Agents should not be playing a
guessing game - tables used for layout are a temporary hack which may
require users to play a guessing game while user agents do not support
proper presentation mechanisms. It seems unlikely to me that the presence
or absence of TH is a make or break issue for accessibility - it is only
there to make a guess more educated in any case.

  I would like to see a stronger statement of Priority 1 for proper use of TD
  and TH.  Based on the current Web Content guidelines this is really the
  only information currently available to user agents for determining whether
  a table is being used for layout or tabular data.  Without this information
  user agents need to play a guessing game on what a table is being used for.
