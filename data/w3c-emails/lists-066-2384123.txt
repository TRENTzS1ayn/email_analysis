Hi!

As an employee with a boss with a visual impairment, accessibility is   
real important to me.  I am also just learning how to create webpages,   
therefore I no little of HTML.  I would like to take an HTML class, but I   
am afraid that it will not touch on the aspects that I have seen in your   
report, and not teach me to take advantage of them.  Is there anywhere   
that you know of that teaches HTML with a concentration on accessibility?
