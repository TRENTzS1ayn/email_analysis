Charlotte,

(This is not definitive advice or a W3C official recommendation, just
personal thoughts)

the only place I know off the top of my head is Kynn Bartlett's online
course taught for the HTML Writers' Guild. Details can be found from
http://www.hwg.org/ but you may get a wider response if you ask the
Accessibility Interest Group - mailto:w3c-wai-ig@w3.org - which has a
large mailing list of people. Alternatively look at the WAI Education and
Outreach group pages - http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO and see what they have
listed. (I also have a large but unfinished set of Tutorials I wrote which
teach HTML 4 and CSS 2 with accessibility treated as one of the basic
design goals rather than a seperate function - if you want access to those
I can dig them out. They were a project I did at an old job, and are very
unpolished.)

Hope that helps

  Hi!
  
  As an employee with a boss with a visual impairment, accessibility is   
  real important to me.  I am also just learning how to create webpages,   
  therefore I no little of HTML.  I would like to take an HTML class, but I   
  am afraid that it will not touch on the aspects that I have seen in your   
  report, and not teach me to take advantage of them.  Is there anywhere   
  that you know of that teaches HTML with a concentration on accessibility?
