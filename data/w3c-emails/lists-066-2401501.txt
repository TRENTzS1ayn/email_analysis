I am not making a statement supporting tables for layout.  I am just saying
that if tables are being used for layout (and they will be whether you, I
or the W3C likes it or not) that it would help if the guidelines made a
strong statement on not using TH in layout tables.  Assistive technologies
can then use this information to offer a better rendering of the
information in the table.  My recommendation is not based on any opinion of
of whether to use tables for layout or not, I just want UA to have better
information on which to make decisions on rendering.
