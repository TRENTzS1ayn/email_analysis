I'm not sure this has been covered in some of the proposed changes.

6.5 Frames.
"6.5 Provide an alternative presentation or page when the primary content
is dynamic (e.g., when frame contents change, when scripts cause changes,
etc.). "

The intent of this checkpoint is not clear as stated and seems to repeat
6.3  In particular, this is in the Frames section of the checklist, yet the
reference is to dynamic content.  If it is specific to frames (not scripts)
that change the content of the target frame, then it may not be an "issue"
for browsers and assistive technologies that support frames, any more than
selecting a link and loading the new page.  If the issue is related to
browsers and assistive technologies that do not support frames, then is
could be solved by adding "frames" to 6.3 to provide alternative accessible
page when frames are not supported, or - removing the phrase "scripts cause
changes" from checkpoint 6.5 because it's covered in 6.3.
