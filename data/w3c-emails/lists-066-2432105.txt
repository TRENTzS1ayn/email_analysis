7.2, 7.4, 7.5 Until user agents provide.
"7.2 Until user agents provide the ability to stop the refresh, do not
create periodically auto-refreshing pages"

7.2, 7.4, and 7.5  are presented as temporary until there are better user
agents.  There *are* user tools, add-ons to browsers, that  already exist
that can block many of these functions (such as interMute
http://www.intermute.com/ ). It's not clear to me which working group has
the responsibility to investigate these tools and promote user tools in
general and not require all functions to be necessarily built into the
browser.
