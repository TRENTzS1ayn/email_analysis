I read past minutes and many post to the list, but I don't understand why
important video information available as a text description or audio
description is made more accessible by being synchronized with the video.

Whether I buy the book or buy the video, I can usually figure out how to do
the complicated task that I bought the book or video for.  My ability to
accomplish the task is usually dependent on my ability to comprehend and/or
the authors ability to describe in written or video format. I don't know of
an example where the synchronization would provide more accessibility.

This is similar to internationalization issues of translating audio and
video information.  Synchronizing the alternative content should be
priority 3.
