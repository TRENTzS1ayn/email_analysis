Unsynchronised alternatives can lead to a completely different interpretation
of a video. A simple example is to provide captions which imply that speakers
are taking different positions in a debate to those they are in fact taking.

  Whether I buy the book or buy the video, I can usually figure out how to do
  the complicated task that I bought the book or video for.  My ability to
  accomplish the task is usually dependent on my ability to comprehend and/or
  the authors ability to describe in written or video format. I don't know of
  an example where the synchronization would provide more accessibility.
  
  This is similar to internationalization issues of translating audio and
  video information.  Synchronizing the alternative content should be
  priority 3.
