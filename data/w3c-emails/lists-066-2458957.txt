I agree that captions incorrectly synchronized [poorly or mislabeled] with
the video can lead to completely different interpretations - just as a
transcript of our working groups minutes which are incorrectly labeled as
to who is saying what can lead to completely different interpretations.  I
agree "IF" I provide captions with the video they should be synchronized
correctly.  But why priority 1 to *have to* provide a captioned video? -
when a separate text transcript will do?

 For example, if we were to video record a W3C conference call where some
members were present in one room, say at MIT, and others participating via
the phone; and we provide the clip on the W3C web site, would it have to be
closed captioned to meet the guidelines - or is it just as accessible to
have the transcript of the video conference call?  I can think of more
elaborate video conference calls I been in where charts (HTML pages) where
shown and mechanical models were displayed, but I could provide all the
information in a text description file - and it be fully accessible -
without the production of synchronizing captions and video descriptions
with the original recorded video.
