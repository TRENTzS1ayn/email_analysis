I think it is difficult to estimate the costs, there are so many factors
that influence the time and cost.  

For the guidelines to be implemented broadly they must be integrated into
authoring tools, so that most authors will not even know they are creating
accessible materials.  In this case the user will not even perceive a cost.
 So I don't think looking at todays tools and workloads is a very important
issue in  determining the checkpoints in the document.  

Nobody would of started putting in concrete curbcuts and ramps if they
would have looked at the costs or retrofitting street, but the benefits to
all people (not just people with disabilities) is well documented.  

The guidelines foremost concern should be defining the principles to make
web documents more accessible.
