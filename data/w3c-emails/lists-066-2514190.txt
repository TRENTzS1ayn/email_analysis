I am concerned that checkpoint 14.2 is not feasible to implement.

It reads:

"Use the clearest and simplest language appropriate for a site's content. 
[Priority 1]"

Following are a few reasons.

For any writing significant piece of ordinary writing, it is almost always 
possible, even enough effort, to write it more clearly and more simply. I 
don't think that the Working Group intends to have people re-write all their 
content, but that seems to be the implication of the checkpoint. Even though 
I don't think that the intent was to require simplified text equivalent for 
texts, I think that this the practical result of the current wording of 14.2. 

The other major reason is that my concern for accessibility of language is 
paralleled by desire to not tamper with people's preferred manner of 
expression unless it is absolutely necessary. 

I strongly as I have advocated a concern for language-related issues. I do 
consider them less fundamental/critical than sensory-related issues.

I would rather delete this checkpoint than have it jeopardize the adoption of 
the guidelines document as a whole.

I would appreciate other's opinions on this subject.
