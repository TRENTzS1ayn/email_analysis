Further to today's discussion of checkpoint 10.3, I would point out that
linearization can be carried out on the server side with an appropriate
script, provided that the pages are written in such a way that they can be
linearized and structural markup is used correctly (see the proposed
wording of checkpoint 5.3).

I would therefore argue that if checkpoint 10.3 is retained, it would not
place as much of a burden on web site developers as some would suggest.

I have noticed the debate within the interest group on this topic. Whereas
my personal view is that the "until" clause in 10.3 is largely satisfied
today, and that the requirement would be substantially met if
linearization tools were widely available for major graphical browsers, I
am concerned by the apparent controversy surrounding this point within the
interest group. It might be better to retain the checkpoint and to clarify
the situation in the techniques document.

In essence, while I would like to be able to delete 10.3 I would not be
comfortable in doing so.
