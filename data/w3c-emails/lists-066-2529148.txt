I agree with Jon. Also, as I have previously argued, the document is
intended to specify the requirements that must, may and should be met (in
other words at three levels of priority) in order to make web-based
information accessible. Considerations of cost are irrelevant except when
deciding between two equally effective accessibility solutions, one of
which is more costly than the other. All solutions proposed by the
guidelines are technically feasible in that they can be implemented using
available technologies and standards.
