There is no need to do anything to get text alternative 
for graphical list markers if they are inserted with stylesheets.

If the graphical bullet is not shown the browser's default marker will
be shown.

Adding "disc" is useful only if you want a disc rather than the browser's
default.

I think the best approach is to modify the checkpoint and delete the 
thing about text alternative to graphical bullets. Also deleting the
depracated example in the techniques doc. of "forging" a UL with DL 
and IMG should be deleted because it just adds to the confusion.

Graphical bullets should not convey new content. More generally
stylesheets should not convey new content, so graphical bullets 
shouldn't convey "new" unless "new" is conveyed some other way.
The techniques doc. already addresses this issue.
