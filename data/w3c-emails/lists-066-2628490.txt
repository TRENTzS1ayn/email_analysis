Howdy!

Today's update: Introductory set installed. It received a major revision
from its previous incarnation, with a course outline page added up front.
Changes to slidemaker tool for all slide sets. Some requested navigation
features added to checkpoint and example slides. Some content changes
(example 1.1a), also the example for the MathML checkpoint was changed.
