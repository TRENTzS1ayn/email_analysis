ISSUE PR - 1    The AC Member felt that the document does identify design
issues, but they did not think its current form lent it to ready use by web
page designers or evaluators.  Their suggestion is to use this material as a
basis for a design guide that is intended specifically as a tool for page
authors, site designers, evaluators, and others.  The introduction and
definitions were a particular problem.
They also felt that accessibility by persons with disabilities is a major
focus of this document, but the document also addresses additional issues
including language, literacy, access by specific technologies, and special
work environments. They suggested that we make use of  the user or
environment situations being addressed by each design recommendation more
explicit as part of the suggestion for the design guide above.


PROPOSED RESOLUTION:  First, we will review the introduction and definitions
to clear up some issues like the definition of natural language, adding
interim to the glossary, and mentioning that although the document touches
on internationalization and device independence, that the document does not
provide a comprehensive coverage of these topics.  We will also mention that
the Education and Outreach group is working on design guides and other
materials to be used to present and train people in the use of these
guidelines.


SPECIFIC WORDING:   Don't yet have all of this.   Some parts are

Natural Language:   An interpersonal communication language that was
developed within the natural course of people communicating with each other.
This includes spoken, written and signed languages.
Interim checkpoints: Checkpoints that are valid and necessary today to allow
people to access the web, but which we do not expect will be needed in the
future after web technologies have incorporated one or more features or
capabilities.
