ISSUE - 3:    The AC Member felt that although Guideline 6 reads: "Ensure
that pages featuring new technologies transform gracefully", it was not
necessarily clear enough that forms were a particular problem.   They
suggested adding either a specific guideline about "Forms", a checkpoint
(6.6), or at least refer to "Forms" explicitly in 6.3 and  6.4 and provide
techniques for them.
The reason for this concern was that many browsers do not support forms or
the form submission techniques depend on using Java or Javascripts .. etc.
Furthermore, many people are unaware of the forms being new technologies.


PROPOSED RESOLUTION:  To follow the AC Member's recommendation and include
Forms in an example in 6.3.  The Java/ Javascript would then be covered in
6.3 and be easier to spot.
