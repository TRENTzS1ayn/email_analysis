ISSUE - 5 :
An AC Member suggested that we should provide hot links from the techniques
document to the Guidelines document.  They further suggested that this can
be implemented in a fashion similar to the links provided from the
guidelines to the techniques using sections. i.e. a technique for a
checkpoint numbered "n" may return a reader to the Guidelines document
checkpoint "n".


PROPOSED RESOLUTION:   The anchors are in the guidelines doc.  We will
create links back to the guidelines from the checkpoint map.
