ISSUE - 6 :  An AC Member suggested that Checkpoint 5.3 should read: "once
style sheets are fully supported, prohibit the use of tables for layout" as
tables for layout do not transform well at all.
Another AC Member suggested that 5.3 be reworded per a draft that was being
discussed by the working group that said "5.3 Do not use tables for layout
unless the content makes sense when linearized or a linearized version that
makes sense is provided. This includes the proper use of structural markup
within table cells (refer to Guideline 3). "


PROPOSED RESOLUTION:
The wording for this item was originally
5.3Avoid using tables for layout [Priority 2]
This was immediately followed by another priority 2 item which read
5.4If a table is used for layout, do not use any structural markup for the
purpose of visual formatting. [Priority 2]

This left an ambiguous guideline that sounded like you should avoid tables
but that there were times when it was ok. Though exactly when this was was
not clear.
To address this and the suggestions of the two AC Members, we propose to
combine the two AC Members' suggestions.


SPECIFIC WORDING:
"5.3 Do not use tables for layout unless the content makes sense when
linearized or a linearized version that makes sense is provided. This
includes the proper use of structural markup within table cells (refer to
Guideline 3). [Priority 2]
Note. When style sheet positioning is fully supported then tables should not
be used - refer to checkpoint 3.6.
This keeps the priority the same and clarifies when and how it is ok to use
tables for layout and what to do if they are not accessible when linearized.
It also adds a link from this guideline to the issue of proper use of
markup, which is covered elsewhere but is so essential to tables.  Finally,
a note was added to remind authors that tables should not be used for layout
once it is possible to use style sheets reliably.
