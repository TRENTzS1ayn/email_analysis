ISSUE - 9 :    This item referes to checkpoint 4.1 which reads

"4.1 Clearly identify changes in the natural language of a document's text
and any text  equivalents (e.g., captions) of non-text content"

An AC Member felt that checkpoint 4.1 should have the same priority as
checkpoint 4.3 which has a priority of 3.     They were aware of no browser
or assistive technologies that supported the LANG attribute today.  They
felt that marking a phrase with the LANG attribute will not  "make a
difference" until user agents support it - and should not therefore be
required above a priority 3 level.


PROPOSED RESOLUTION:

None yet.  This is open for suggestions and discussion.
