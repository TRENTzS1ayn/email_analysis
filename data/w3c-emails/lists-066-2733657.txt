ISSUE - 10:  This deals with 4.2 which reads


"4.2 Specify the expansion of abbreviations and acronyms. [Priority 2 for
the first occurrence of the acronym or abbreviation in a given document,
Priority 3 thereafter.]"

An AC Member felt that to expand abbreviations and acronyms is good writing
style.  They did not feel that this checkpoint was an accessibility issue.
They knew of no user agents that support the ACRONYM or ABBR tag.   As a
result they felt that to should be priority 3.

This is a similar situation as PRI -9.  Should an item be required before it
is supported by user agents?    This would help solve legacy problems in the
future.  But how much should it be required today?


PROPOSED RESOLUTION:
None yet.    Comments?  Ideas?
