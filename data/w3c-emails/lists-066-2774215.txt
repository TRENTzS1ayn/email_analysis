The phone number for Tuesday's GL Teleconferences is
+1-617-252-7000
The teleconf time is
4:00 to whenever we finish.  (We have the bridge til 8:00 pm  Eastern
Daylight Time but hopefully it will be vacant for the majority of that)

We will be going over any proposed changes to the Guidelines as a result of
the Feedback from the W3C Advisory Committee Members.
