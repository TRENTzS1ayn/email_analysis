  Does anyone know of books devoted to designing web sites for either
  accessibility or usability?  The only one I know is Crystal Waters
  "Universal web design".  Failing that, books with good chapters on
  accessibility or usability (or bits dotted through the book, like Daggett
  on html4).  I know the ig talked about encouraging authors of html 4.0
  books to include sections on the accessibility features - is there any
  evidence that this succeeded?
