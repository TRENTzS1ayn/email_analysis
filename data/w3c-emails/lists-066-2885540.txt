This is a question of comprehension: to what extent do people with
cognitive disabilities, dyslexia, etc., benefit from the expansion of
abbreviations and acronyms? Obviously, all readers can take advantage of
this feature, as it improves the readability of documents.

Unless there is evidence suggesting that such expansions do not
significantly benefit particular groups of users, I would recommend
against making any change to the priority of this checkpoint.
