Hi Phill,

This is where the support pages on the W3C site come in. All the "UNTIL"
clauses point to a chain that provides info about when "UNTIL" is met
There is some question as to whether W3C would make the judgement or whether
authors would.  I believe that W3c working groups should call it when it
happens just like it calls what goes into the guidelines.  Too difficult for
authors otherwise.  But that is not critical.

Gregg

I agree that the intent of this "until user agents..." clause are met that
the P3 will be removed.

It begs the question whether the GL charter, or the WAI charter really
outlines "who and how"  this information will be communicated to content
authors and developers.  12 months from now (4 web years), who will be
charted to review the P3's and/or the "until user agents..." and the "now
that this is supported..." clauses?  I would recommend that this concern be
forwarded to the coordination group and/or on to the WAI advisory
committee.

Regards,
Phill Jenkins
