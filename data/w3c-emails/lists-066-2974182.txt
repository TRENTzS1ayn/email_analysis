Actually, after talking to Graham, I decided to register both "charset" and 
"language". I had forgotten that language *is* a media feature for programs 
that "display" text by reading it aloud, such as text-to-speech converters 
that are used by blind people.

I submitted the draft yesterday, and it should appear in the next day or 
two. I'll copy the pointer here when it comes out.
