I agree with Jason.

Also the fact that when lang is not present charset maybe used
is restricted to cases like Japanese and English, but not to English and
Spanish. More precisely there is always one document one charset,
but there might be several languages in one document. E.g.,
when writing just a paragraph in Japanese in an English
document it could be that the document have charset iso-8859-1 and the
Japanese written with numerical references. Not to mention what language 
a browser should asociate with UTF-8.
