4.5 Tables

Bullet 4 says
A linear sequence is usually generated by reading a row left to right and proceeding each cell with the label of its column. 

I find no mention of change to writing direction. 

The writing direction for a table may be reversed, as part of 
%i18n. 

For right-to-left languages, the cell order in a row is also
right-to-left. That can be recognized in the table attribute dir="rtl".

The writing direction may be inherited from its presence on body,
or most any ancestral element of table.
