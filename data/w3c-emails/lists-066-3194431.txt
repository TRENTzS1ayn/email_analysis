Hello, Some of you may get this twice - those of you who have previously
participated in the math and science discussions. If you are able, a response
by the end of the day would be appreciated. From my tests, most of the
character entities defined in HTML4 for math symbols were NOT supported by
Communicator 4 and Explorer 4. Thus, is the following technique valid?

Follows is part of the source file that I tested - the character entity
information is taken from the HTML4 Rec.. In communicator I get question
marks,
in Explorer I get boxes. If you are able to produce something else, please let
me know what I have missed. I don't see that "symbol" is a valid attribute of
"face" but I tried it anyway, just for grins. Using FONT face for the whole
doc
produces interesting results  Also note that the *only* character entities
that
are recognized are the last two (for division). It seems that everything
included in the list of "Character entity references for ISO 8859-1
characters"
is supported by both. However, note that very few in this ISO list are related
to math.
