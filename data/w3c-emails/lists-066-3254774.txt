To: Web Content Guidelines Working Group

By now hopefully people have seen the mail on the WAI IG list, but just to
be sure: today the W3C announced the release of "Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines 1.0" as a Recommendation. 

For more detail see the press release, testimonials, and accompanying FAQ
available from: http://www.w3.org/1999/05/WCAG-RECPressRelease

I would like to thank everyone in the group for your contributions in
bringing this document so far.
