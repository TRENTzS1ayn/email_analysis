To:"'GL - WAI Guidelines WG'"<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>


I speak for all the editors and chairs when I say what a great working group
this has been - (and is).   A number of us have been working in this area
for many years working on guidelines.  But we have never been able to
develop anything that even approached these guidelines for depth, breadth,
comprehensiveness or practicality.  And it is due to the many great
discussions and insights from the gl working group members.  This has really
been something else.   In fact I know of people working in other areas of
access that have expressed their envy at having such a group as this to work
through issues, ideas and problems.  Reach back and pat yourselves on the
back (we can't reach you from here).

We are not done, but it is great to sit back for a moment and enjoy what we
have done.  Congratulations all.  And thanks

Gregg
