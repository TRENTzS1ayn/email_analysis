I'm sure I"m not the first person to say this, but I find it very strange 
that you recommend using style sheets so that more people can access the 
site. A significant percentage of people use Netscape 3, which cannot 
process style sheets. Compared to Netscape 3 users, the group of people 
using special-needs hardware/software is tiny. I don't want to minimize the 
importance of consideration for people with special needs, but if I am 
trying to reach the largest possible audience, I will definitely choose to 
use markup that is readable for Netscape 3!

Am I missing something? I am happy to be corrected if I am wrong.

Thanks,
Virginia
