Here it is:
 
((PICS-version 1.1)
 (rating-system "http://www.w3.org/WAI/wcag-conformance")
 (rating-service "http://www.w3.org/WAI") 
 (icon "wcag1A")
 (name "W3C WCAG 1.0 Conformance level")
 (description "The W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0
               (http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505)
               Conformance level Rating System. Claim are not verified
               by W3C. Content providers are solely responsible for
               the use of these logos. ") 

 (category  (transmit-as "c") (name "WCAG Conformance level")
  (label  (name "Level A") (value 0)
          (description "All Priority 1 checkpoints are satisfied") )
  (label  (name "Level Double-A") (value 1)
          (description "All Priority 1 and 2 checkpoints are satisfied") )
  (label  (name "Level Triple-A") (value 2)
          (description "All Priority 1, 2, and 3 checkpoints are satisfied") 
)))


I've put the above in http://www.w3.org/wai/wcag-conformance.rat and
people can put in their HTML page the following label (for AA level
for instance)

<META http-equiv="PICS-Label" 
      content='(PICS-1.1 "http://www.w3.org/wai/wcag-conformance" labels
        exp "1999.12.31"  for "http://www.foo.com/foo.html"  by "jow@foo.com" 
        ratings (c 1))'>


Issue:
  - we need an icon for the rating system that's different from the
    individual icons for each conformance level (right now I've used
    the icon for level A but I would suggest using a version without A 
    in it)
  - the metadata label itself (what's in the META tag) is a valid
    claim of conformance I think: it has all the information needed in 
    Form 1, although for most of it you have to follow a pointer:

     The guidelines title: "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0" 
     The guidelines URI: http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505 
     The conformance level satisfied: "A", "Double-A", or "Triple-A". 
        From the label, you follow http://www.w3.org/wai/wcag-conformance
        which is the rating system with the description or the overall 
        system and the description of what "(c 1)" means.
     The scope covered by the claim (e.g., page, site, or defined
     portion of a site.).  
        PICS label can be generic ("gen true") or specific to indicate 
        scope
