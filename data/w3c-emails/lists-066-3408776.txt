Flicker and other visual events that may cause a seizure (such as quick
changes from light to dark) may be created by the following 4 ways (there
may be more):
1.  scripting
2.  animated images
3.  applets
4.  embedded multimedia objects

possible suggestions for UA:
1.  allow users to disable scripting, applets, and multimedia objects 
2.  allow the user to control the rate of change (of scripts, applets, and
multimedia objects).
3.  allows users to pause animated images (i.e. only show first or last
frame, or step through frames at user request)
