Dear Sir or Madame,
     I have a domain which I had paid for unfortunately the server in technical support from dxm had not been helpful in assisting my domain to getting published.  Countless hours have been wasted trying to accomplish this task.  IS THERE ANYONE OUT THERE THAT KNOWS AND ASSIST OR HELP THIS PROJECT TO GET OFF THE GROUND!!!  I don't know wherelse to turn.  I have a webpage ready for publishing.  The question is how do I get PUBLISHED?  I cancelled my service with DXM due to total frustration and aggravation.  Please send an intelligent knowledgable individual who what they are doing to assist my company with getting publish PLEASE!!!  

                                                   Thank You with any help you can provide
