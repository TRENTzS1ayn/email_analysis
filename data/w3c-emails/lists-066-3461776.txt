Hi Phill,

For now, the Web Content WG will be tracking such
information. However, I agree that in the medium-term, it
would be appropriate for the UA WG to at least participate
in tracking this information, if not taking over the responsibility
entirely.

This should be discussed/confirmed by the WAI CG.
