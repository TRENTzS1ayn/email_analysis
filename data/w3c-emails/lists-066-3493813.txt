Hello all,

Please remember that we have a working group meeting tomorrow (Thursday,
June 10, 1999 - 4:00 to 5:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) 1 617 252
1038).  Please refer to the issues lists for items on the agenda.  Note
that it is currently being updated and should be posted later today.  We
will start with the GL issues and if we're lucky start looking at the
techniques open issues.

The main items on the agenda for tomorrow are:

1. Timelines.  We need to produce another working draft of the techniques
document, and eventually a WCAG 1.1.

2.  Implications of Guideline 11 - see the discussions on the IG list
(refer to
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/1999AprJun/0309.html and the
thread "Acroboat 4.0 and PDF accessibility").
