I don't think this is a good approach. The most that this can do is pont up a
design that fails one of the most basic rendering tests. My experience with
multi-browser testing is that it generally gives false-positives for
accessibility, so I am much less enamoured of it than I was. It seems to me
that as a technique it actually requires a fair degree of skill to interpret
the results. So If we were to specify a minimum set of tests I think we
should also point out what these tests do and do not show.
