My problem with BrowserMaster is its consetration on a rather limited 
set of viewing situations. Namly only on computer screens, as well
assuming that users are using their full screen space (up to 
Windows95's task bar). 

The vast majority of designers do take into account these 
considerations.

Another program which is in my view is worthwhile mentioning 
in the Techniques doc is WebTV's simulator. Not only that the 
screen is of low resolution, it also has large fonts,
limited scrolling, no way to choose font-family, 
among other features.

Although it is limited to simulating a particular browsers, 
it gives a user familiar only with graphical computer 
screens more understaning of alternative viewing situations.   

You can get it at http://developer.webtv.net/

Another simulator is W3C's Amaya that has a text mode view 
(that does not attempt to simulate a particular existing browser).
