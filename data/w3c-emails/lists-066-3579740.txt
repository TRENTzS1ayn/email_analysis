Hello,

Web Content Guidelines Issue 10 (refer to [1]) concerns the use of 
deprecated features of HTML vs. use of CSS for style (e.g.,
borders around images).

Although we want the guidelines to send the message "use style sheets", 
they must also take into account the current support for CSS. There
have been some questions on the list about how to satisfy
the following checkpoints at the same time:

 - 3.3 Use style sheets to control layout and presentation. [Priority 2] 

 - 11.1 Use W3C technologies when they are available and appropriate
        for a task and use the latest versions when supported. [Priority
2] 

 - 11.2 Avoid deprecated features of W3C technologies. [Priority 2] 

I propose the following changes to improve the situation:

 a) Change wording of 3.3 to say "Use style sheets to control
    layout and presentation when supported by user agents."

 b) Change priority of 11.2 to 3

 c) Change wording of 11.2 to read "Avoid deprecated features of
    W3C technologies. Note: Authors should stop using deprecated
    features when they are supported by by other technologies such
    as style sheets."

- Ian
