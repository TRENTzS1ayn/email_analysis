Comments on Ian's proposal:

1. Style sheets are already in part supported by most up to date user
agents; hence the "when supported by user agents" clause is unnecessary in
checkpoint 3.3.

2. I support Ian's proposed change to checkpoint 11.2, except for the
lowering of its priority from 2 to 3: presentational elements and
attributes detract from the extent to which content-level semantics are
preserved in the document, and they can also generate serious access
problems if they are used to control colours, fonts etc., and can not be
turned off in legacy user agents (as I understand from previous
discussions is the case in some circumstances).

I agree that there should be a parallel established between the
qualifications regarding user agent support, in checkpoints 11.1 and 11.2.

Checkpoint 3.3 only requires that style sheets be used, not that
unsupported features thereof be employed. Perhaps this could be clarified
not by amending 3.3, but by adding a reference to 11.1 or a clarifying
note which clarifies the scope of the checkpoint.
