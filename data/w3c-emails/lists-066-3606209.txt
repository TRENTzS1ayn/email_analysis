I agree with Len. I think we would be better off requiring consistent
positioning. The checkpoint itself requires proper positioning, but hte
explanatory text says the the label must be above or before the control.

  Checkpoint 10.2 has labels preceding fields, which make obvious good sense

  However, for radio buttons and checkboxes, which one can think of as
  "bullet" controls because they look like bullets, Chuck's curriculum
  example has the label following the controls.  See

  Question: do we change the checkpoint or Chuck's example?
  
  I think we should consider switching to what Chuck has for bullet style
  controls.
