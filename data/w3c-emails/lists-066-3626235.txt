where does someone in the beginnings of the learning mode find the most
knowledgeable and productive contributor to assist me in the makings of
a web page that would offer and stay up to date on the latest changes
mentioned......someone who could cater to my needs and aspirations not
knowing presently for sure where all this is leading......yet wanting to
be of the most service to the most needy???


Who would or could I contact to get started in the makings and
maintaining of my web page to include all the necessary details???
someone with an open line of communications with lots of options and
flexibility!!!"
