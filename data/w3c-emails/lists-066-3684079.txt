Current list of issues that I have identified that need coordination with Web
Content Guidelines
#3: Should user agents be able recognize markup for navigation bars 
#43: Navigation and activation of elements with ACCESSKEY attributes defined 
#12: Recommend full implmentation of MathML 
#33: Allow the user to view header information associated with a cell 
#35: Allow the user to view the summary attribute of a table
#49: Add a checkpoint that says that UAs should allow users to turn off
flicker
#51: Language support
Allow user to access alternative content (already in current guidelines)

the UA list.
Thanks,
