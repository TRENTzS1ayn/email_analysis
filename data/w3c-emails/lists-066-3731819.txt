No, but the hypertext of the document does.

In the particular case of the connotations of being a W3C Recommendation, I
would judge that the image bears no unique information but repeats what is
in the hypertext.  Note I say hypertext because the links back to
discussions of document grades outside the current document is readily
accessible via link following from the online presence of the
Recommendation, which is its home form and its definitive form.
