The UA Group have an item which was focused on flicker rate.  They believe
that they have addressed it, but wanted to run it by the GL group for
review.  The resolution they came up with is below:
http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-table.html#49
Please take a look and see if you feel they have covered it well.
The question they ask is:
Can they now consider it a closed item?
thanks
Gregg
