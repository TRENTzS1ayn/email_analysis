The User Agent Guidelines Group has asked us if we would double check the
current set of User Agent Guidelines to be sure that they have included
check points for all of the features that we had assumed that the user agent
would be providing, when we wrote the GL Guidelines.
This would basically involve comparing the current User Agent Guidelines
against the GL Guidelines to see if check points are provided for all
features or capabilities we would like to see in user agents.
Six areas they have identified and have as points on their list (which
aren't necessarily reflected in the current UA Guidelines are:
#03:  Should user agents be able to recognize markup for navigation bars
#43:  Navigation and activation of elements with ACCESSKEY attributes
defined
#12:  Recommend full implementation of MathML
#33:  Allow the user to view header information associated with a cell
#35:  Allow the user to view the summary attribute of a table
#51:  Language support
Allow user to access alternative content (already in current guidelines)
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WAI-USERAGENT-19990611/


This is something that we should do quickly so that we can get information
back to the group.
If you spot any items post them both to GL and to UA, so that both groups
are aware of them.  That will also prevent more than one of us from posting
the same issue to UA.  (If you don't know how to post to UA, you can just
forward the items to Wendy or I, or Chuck or I, and we will forward it to
the two groups.
Thanks much.
Gregg
