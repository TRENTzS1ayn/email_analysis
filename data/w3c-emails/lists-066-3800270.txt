I've already done an initial review:

Our current discussion in UAGL on this topic is about using schemas
as the proper way to identify semantic units such as navigation bars.

The 11 June draft of the UAGL [2] distinguishes activation
(checkpoint 1.3) from navigation (checkpoints 7.4 and 7.5). I think that
"accesskey" is an (HTML) implementation detail.

Our current proposal to address this is to have a checkpoint
that recommends support for W3C specifications where applicable,
effectively mirroring checkpoint 11.1 in WCAG 1.0. MathML is
just an example of what to implement should you be implementing
a math markup language.
