Wendy, Thanks. Next Thursday afternoon I will be traveling between Mathews
and Dinwiddie counties for an all-day orientation on Friday for summer
school. I will make an effort to be home and set up in time to join the
conference, traffic and other factors permitting. What will it cost to
participate in the conference (I am an individual; nobody else pays my
phone bills)? How do I join the list you mentioned?
