So much activity has been on various lists about the problems of
accessing the Web by people with reading, cognitive, attention,
learning, and "related" disabilities that apparently we will discuss
what might be appropriate to include in the next guideline set to
address the problem.

I wonder if there might be a means *where deemed appropriate by the
author or required by law* of providing vastly simplified textual
explanation of material that may be of interest but may not be fully
understandable by everybody.

Also, if there is possible elucidation of textual content, perhaps a
prod to provide illustrative graphics for those for whom this is an
important tool for "getting" the meaning.

Although there is (and will not be for some time) any universal set of
graphics to signify words and it is not always useful to try to make
complex material simple, the facility for doing so when appropriate
should be sought and if found, applauded.
