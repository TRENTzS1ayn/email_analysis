DD:: "First, can we come up with an objective rating system, vs a
subjective one, in the area of readability?"

WL: Although probably not, it doesn't matter if what we are trying to do
is to encourage authors to label *their* notion of "difficulty level" so
that those who surf looking for *anything* to use for people with
cognitive/learning/etc. problems can find something to look at.

The biggest problem we've been hearing about is that there is a paucity
of stuff out there.  If we simply urge (without priority levels above
three) inclusion of metadata to help find certain materials it might be
useful to teachers, etc. who are sort of begging for more *stuff*.
