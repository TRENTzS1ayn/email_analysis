Correction, Chuck, we really DO want adults with a 4th grade reading level
to be able to access information on the causes of the Civil War, and if
they must read material which was originally written for 4th graders in
order to do so, they should not be dissuaded. An aside: Even among the
PHD's who can write well above the head of the 4th grader, there is no
ready concensus on the "why's" of that war!!!!
