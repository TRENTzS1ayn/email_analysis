>>Correction, Chuck, we really DO want adults with a 4th grade reading level
to be able to access information on the causes of the Civil War, and if
they must read material which was originally written for 4th graders in
order to do so, they should not be dissuaded. An aside: Even among the
PHD's who can write well above the head of the 4th grader, there is no
ready concensus on the "why's" of that war!!!!

Not sure I can agree with you on this one.  An intelligent adult with reading
difficulties should have access to content that was prepared for someone who
is a bit more worldly than a 4th grader - especially if they want to
understand that the Civil was caused by reasons more complex than might be
exposed by a 4th grade history textbook.  As you point out, even scholars
disagree on this and I would want the adult to be exposed to the complexity of
factors.

I speak from the point of view of my experience as a teacher and administrator
in elementary, middle and high schools and as an instructor for both
undergraduate and graduate courses in education, learning disabilities, and
educational technology.

We probably shouldn't go too far with this on this particular list.
