Good point on image, although one might argue this is also addressed
by alt and longdesc (i.e. if you can't see the image because of
colorblindess, you should be able to access the textual description)

Beyond using Style Sheet, lots of UA will provide a setting to render
text with the desktop colors of choice, thus overiding author colors.

Agreed.

I'd rather be inclusive than restrictive:
  "A.1.3?For all image map links, provide alternative text for 
  each link (e.g., via the "alt" attribute of HTML AREA element or the
  content of the A element).

Agreed, it's more focused like that.

How come ?
As long as it's not a P1, I'm fine.
