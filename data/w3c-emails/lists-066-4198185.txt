Even if the user agent and access software both support frames, at prsent
they are still somewhat inconvenient to use, because the TITLE attribute
is not yet supported. Both Emacs/W3 and Lynx attempt to derive the title
from the NAME attribute, which, as mentioned on this list, is meant to
identify the frame to the software and not to be read by the user. The
value of NAME thus often provides only a very limited clue as to the
intended content of the frame.
