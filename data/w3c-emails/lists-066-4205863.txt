Actually Alan, I just assume everyone respects me - I am notoriously hard
to offend even when you mean to do so. But I digress.

This is in fact another legacy problem, although it is one that is in a
different to imagemaps, as an example. It seems pretty clear as CSS
adoption spreads (Oh so slowly! sigh.) that eventually TABLEs will not be
used for anything except tabular data, except by excessively backwards
people.

At which point it will be important for somebody to put a TABLE module
into Lynx...

  Lynx can often produce a _better_ result by not understanding TABLEs.
  But only because authors leaped on TABLEs as a visual formatting
  strategem.
