SHOW THE COLORS -- A service project that doubles as a fund raiser!
Promote partriotism in your neighborhood by placing U.S. Flags in the front
yard of subscribers on five national holidays.  Your group could raise
$5,000 to $10,000 per year.  We provide the equipment, management support,
and incentives to make it easy for you.
