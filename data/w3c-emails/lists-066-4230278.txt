Chuck has raised this issue before. What should we be doing about HTML
applications? Currently they are briefly covered in the Guidelines - if
you create a User Interface, make it accessible. Do we need to go beyond
that? Are there any checkpoints we should have but do not?

  TABINDEX is very useful when designing HTML dialogs and applications.  For
  example, an "OK" button may appear towards the top of the HTML document, but
  the button needs to be near the end of the tab order.
  
  If you think of HTML as pages and forms, you are right - TABINDEX isn't used
  often.
