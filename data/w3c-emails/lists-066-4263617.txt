The current Microsoft home page, http://www.microsoft.com has a menu-driven
interface, written in DHTML.  You'll only see it if running IE4 or greater.

I defined a HTML application as dynamic HTML.  Presents user interface,
responds to user input and possibly reformats itself based on such.

HTML applications are quite common place at Microsoft now.  The Personal Web
Server for Windows 95 and Windows 98 has had HTML based administration for 2
years, as does it's bigger brother, Internet Information Server.  Outlook 98
has HTML based UI in several places - the Find and Organize features.
(which I demo'd in Minneapolis)

Internet Explorer's Find dialog is also implemented in HTML.  The Windows 98
Internet Connection Wizard is also a HTML dialog.

I think that it's important that the guidelines strongly address dynamic
(small 'd') HTML with a refresher on Accessible Software Design - keyboard
access, color, etc.

What is an HTML application ?
A DHTML page ?
Anything with a FORM ?

I can't find a definition in the guidelines or techniques.
