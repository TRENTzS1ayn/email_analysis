OK, I understand dHTML, DHTML, Dynamic HTML can loosely be defined as
being the same thing: a combination of HTML, CSS and some scripting
language, which presents a dynamic user interface, responds to user
input and possibly reformats itself based on such.

The issue is: can we produce guidelines for a technology that has no
formal specification and how useful will they be ?
