The Charles are of a like mind with regard to language - it is not
especially important what language is used. 

I think that the document adequately covers the provision of user
interfaces and notification of changes. (A2 and A13) Further detail in
each field is outside the scope of the document.

  It's not the language that matters, but the ability to convey information
  and present user interface.
