> PART 2: PROPOSED REVISIONS FOR THE PAGL DOCUMENT

Could you indicate which version you used as your starting point, and
whether or not all your changes are indicated with a following [NOTE]
comment. Without that information, it's hard to tell what is your
contribution.

> 2.A. PROPOSED INTRODUCTORY PORTION OF GUIDELINES DOCUMENT
> 
> Purpose
> 
> The Page Authoring guidelines document is designed to help Web authors 
> improve the accessibility of Web sites for people with disabilities. The 
> document also indicates how following the guidelines can also make Web 
> sites more accessible and usable to individuals without disabilities.

I still strongly feel that we should sell these guidelines as being
primarily for solving the issue of Device Independence wrt access
of Web Content (output and input).

> Benefits
> 
> Adhering to the guidelines in this document:
> 
> * Will ensure a basic level of accessibility for people with disabilities. 
> For many individuals with disabilities, following these guidelines will 
> have a profound positive influence on their access to Web-based 
> information.
> 
> * Will help increase usability and accessibility by both nondisabled and 
> disabled individuals who are using a mobile and voice technologies or who 
> are operating in constrained environments (noise-free, nonvisual). 
> 
> * Is expected to promote comprehension, appreciation, and hence, overall 
> effectiveness of Web content.

I'd put point 2 first and add "(e.g. better search engine results) in point 3.
