This is great feedback Wendy, thanks for getting it!

He can simply set the alt attribute of the IMG object to a different value
when he switches to a different image.

I agree.  There needs to be a CSS attribute to control the rendering of the
ALT and TITLE attributes.  Possible values would be:  TOOLTIP or NONE.  That
way, the author can control the visual appearance, and if required, the user
can override it.

For purposes of accessibility, the tool tip doesn't matter - that the
information is there and available in the object is the key (exposed by
DHTML/DOM/MSAA whatever).  The reason the tool tip exists currently is to
make the author more aware of the attribute and to test for it's presence
easily.
