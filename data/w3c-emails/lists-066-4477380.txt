You can control the rendering of the "alt" and "title" attributes
with CSS2:
 a) Get the value of the attribute with an attribute selector
 b) Use :before or :after to insert the text (whose style can
    be specified) before or after the element's content.

This is, of course, different from the current tooltip mechanism
which does not involve/change the document's rendering at all.
With relative positioning, the 'visibility' property, and scripts,
you can even simulate a tooltip effect.
