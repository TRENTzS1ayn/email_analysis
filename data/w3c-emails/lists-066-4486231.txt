But the tooltip does change the document's rendering.  It hides portions of
the document temporarily to comment on other portions of the document.

The tooltip is a move, not a display region.  It is a transient behavior.
This sort of a method is not in the device model of the the SCREEN display
medium in CSS2 even 'though it is a cliche of the GUI screen at the present
time.

This illustrates how far the W3C standards are from addressing the world in
which the Web actually operates.
