Tooltips are an implementation issue, and therefore in the purview of UA,
not PAGL. And for what it's worth, my personal view is that rather than
being a core CSS attribute it should be a preference in a UA which
implements them.

  I agree.  There needs to be a CSS attribute to control the rendering of the
  ALT and TITLE attributes.  Possible values would be:  TOOLTIP or NONE.  That
  way, the author can control the visual appearance, and if required, the user
  can override it.
  
  For purposes of accessibility, the tool tip doesn't matter - that the
  information is there and available in the object is the key (exposed by
  DHTML/DOM/MSAA whatever).  The reason the tool tip exists currently is to
  make the author more aware of the attribute and to test for it's presence
  easily.
