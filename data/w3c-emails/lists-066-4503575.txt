Hello,

In preparation for the call tomorrow, updated open issues lists have been
posted for both the Guidelines document and the Techniques document.  They
are both available from the GL home page at http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/ as
the third and fourth links under "Open issues and Changes."

Hope to hear you all tomorrow,
--wendy
