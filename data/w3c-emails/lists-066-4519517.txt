Tooltips are an implementation issue, and therefore in the purview of UA,
not PAGL. And for what it's worth, my personal view is that rather than
being a core CSS attribute it should be a preference in a UA which
implements them.

I agree that it's not a PAGL issue, but I hope the list will indulge me
another comment.

I disagree that it should be a UA preference, because then the author loses
control of the visual appearance of the page.  In theory, the author should
be able to set every possible rendering attribute, and then the user should
have the option of overriding that to fit their viewing needs.

If it's solely a UA option, the author cannot control the default and then
might be tempted not to use ALT or TITLE because the possibility of the
appearance of the ToolTip on most screens would ruin the appearance of their
page (which was the original complaint).

If the author can set a attribute that hides the display of the ToolTip,
they will be assured that the visual appearance of their pages will not be
affected, except in the cases where the user has overridden their desire
because of a particular need.
