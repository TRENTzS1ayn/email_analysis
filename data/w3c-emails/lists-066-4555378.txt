To the Working Group...

Please note we have a conference call scheduled for Thursday, January 14
from 4:00 to 5:30 PM Eastern Standard Time (GMT -5).

The phone number is 1-617-252-1038

Please be prepared to discuss briefly, and resolve firmly, any open issues
(Yes, I am an optimist (Grin)).  Our agenda will be to work through as many
as we can in the time allotted.  We will probably start with the Guideline
open issues.  See  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/ to find the links to the
documents.

We look forward the discussions.

Regards,
The chairs and editors
