Another interesting consequence of the "language and comprehension" issue
is that all documents would need to be translated into every modern
language. People who belong to small linguistic communities and who have
not learned a second language will find most of the web to be
inaccessible. This is simply a consequence of the fact that some
languages have a small (and, unfortunately, in many cases a diminishing) 
number of users. We need principled grounds on which to decide
what kinds of diversity should be taken into account in the guidelines.
