I didn't mean what I say to be restricted to the assistive technology
add-on framework.

Take the example of a page that has a big onLoad event that generates
all the HTML on the fly (using specific JavaScript document.write
syntax)

If the HTML is accessible, the only thing that prevents this page from 
being accessible is the knowledge of the scripting language.

Lynx could implement a JavaScript runtime, and make this kind of page
(today completely inaccessible) accessible, but why JavaScript, and
not VBScript ?

My point is that if we had a scripting language standardized, it would 
result in more UA implementing it.
