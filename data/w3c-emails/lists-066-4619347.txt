  The framework of the names for the WAI set of guidelines was determined
  by the Coordnation Group. They chose, "W3C <working group chosen
  phrase> Accessibility Guidelines."
   
  There was much discussion about the terms "site" and
  "content." It was felt that "site" implies server issues.
  After much discussion it was felt that the guidelines address making
  "content" accessible and therefore it would be appropriate to use in
  the title. However, it might not be as marketable as "site" We all
  agreed to send the following two choices to the list for comment:
   
  1.  W3C Web Site Accessibility Guidelines 
  2.  W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
