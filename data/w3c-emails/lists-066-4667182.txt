The guidelines are not specific to HTML or CSS, although the examples
associated with some of the checkpoints are.

But it's also admitted that sites that make heavy use of DHTML are not
adequately covered by the guidelines.  When this was raised before, I was
told that DHTML is not a W3C recommendation and thus ignored.

How can you say the guidelines are not specific to HTML?  All throughout the
guidelines are specific HTML/CSS items.  The whole set of guidelines is
presented with heavy HTML influence with names such as "pages", "elements",
"tables", etc.

A major problem with the guidelines is that it assumes HTML as a static
entity of pages, linked together.  A set of guidelines, such as Trace's,
Microsoft's or IBM's, *then* applied as techniques to HTML/CSS/DHTML would
be much more useful.
