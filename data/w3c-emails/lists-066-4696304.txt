My vote: ..Content..

> The framework of the names for the WAI set of guidelines was determined
> by the Coordnation Group. They chose, "W3C <working group chosen
> phrase> Accessibility Guidelines."
>  
> There was much discussion about the terms "site" and
> "content." It was felt that "site" implies server issues.
> After much discussion it was felt that the guidelines address making
> "content" accessible and therefore it would be appropriate to use in
> the title. However, it might not be as marketable as "site" We all
> agreed to send the following two choices to the list for comment:
>  
> 1.  W3C Web Site Accessibility Guidelines 
> 2.  W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
