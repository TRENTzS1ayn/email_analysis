  Let me see if I get this right - any page which employs scripting, or does
  dynamic effects, with or without scripting, is considered inaccessible
  unless a static version is also available?

CMN::
Absolutely correct as far as I can see. Of course there are a number of
ways to make the content accessible, the simplest of which is often to
provide a server-side implentation of client-side scripting.
CO::  
  My goal in making comments to this list is to try to improve the relevance
  the guidelines have to the type of HTML design I'm working with.
  
  I look at http://www.investor.msn.com and http://www.msnbc.com and ask "How
  can the guidelines help here?"  and am at a loss - scripting isn't covered
  (provide static versions), dynamic HTML (not W3C) isn't covered, ActiveX
  objects (not W3C) aren't covered.
  
  Yet - the guidelines are supposed to be for all "web content" and not
  specific to HTML.  Does that mean that HTML contained in product
  documentation and user interfaces (such as many Microsoft products) are not
  covered?

CMN:: 
No, it simply means that at the present time there are many Microsoft
products (as well as many parts of the web which are not Microsoft
products) which are not accessible. The things you mention are covered in
the guidelines.

From the most recent Working Draft:

 A.2 Provide descriptions for all important graphics, scripts or applets
if they are not fully described through alternative text or in the
document's content.

 A.9 Ensure that pages using newer technologies will transform gracefully
into an accessible form if the technology is not supported or is turned
off.

 A.13 Use interim accessibility solutions so that assistive technology or
older browsers will operate correctly.
