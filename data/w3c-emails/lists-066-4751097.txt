In the technique doc, I would add some semi-ascii-art examples of OK
tables (single row of header cells at the top and/or single column of
header cells on the side) where the "scope" attribute is easily
infered by the UA:

Single header row at the top:

  TR TH TH TH
  TR TD TD TD
  TR TD TD TD

Single header column on the left:

  TR TH TD TD
  TR TH TD TD
  TR TH TD TD

Headers on both rows and columns (~ below represents an empty cell):

  TR  ~ TH TH
  TR TH TD TD
  TR TH TD TD
