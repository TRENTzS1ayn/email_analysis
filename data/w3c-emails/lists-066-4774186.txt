I am! The resulting insert will be suitable for my book, which Judy and I
agree is a good thing to do in order to promote the WAI. My idea is to
include either the Tips and/or Checklist as part of the book jacket --
something a person can tear off. 

Something else that we should consider -- brailling the insert. When I
developed the VIOLD CD-ROM at Digital, we brailled the installation
instructions on the CD jacket. This worked very nicely and actually turned
out to be a "hit" with many of the customers -- it was perceived as a novel
approach to publishing. Reactions were similar to the reactions we often
receive when distributing brailled business cards. (This not to be
misinterpreted as "braille is a novelty"; rather, it's means for attracting
a wider level of interest).
