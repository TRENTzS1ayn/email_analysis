server-side scripts are a totally different topic.  Dynamic HTML and DOM
allow for *client* side scripts.  That's the whole purpose of Dynamic HTML!

Providing "generic HTML" may not be an option and be rejected out of hand by
many web developers.  Guidelines on producing accessible, dynamic content
would be useful.  Direct accessibility, not a lowest common denominator
approach.
