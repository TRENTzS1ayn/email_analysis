Whoops! Jason is correct. I neglected to consider this.

Sorry, I haven't followed this thread well enough to remember what's been

I assume that "W3C Web Markup Accessibility Guidelines" is too difficult
for the average user to understand...and somewhere down the line we'll
figure out a diffierent mechanism for page creation.
