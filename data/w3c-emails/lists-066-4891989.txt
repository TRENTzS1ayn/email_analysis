I think it is difficult to come up with one solution that helps all,
especially with LD.  What helps one person will make it more difficult for
another.  I think the only general page authoring mechanism is to ask the
author to provide redundent forms of information and hopefully the user
agent will allow the user to filter the representations that is most
effective for themselves.
