I read the telecon minutes and it sounded like math and science (although
math was only mentioned specifically) was NOT going to be considered for a
guideline.  I think it should be considered for a guideline since:

1. The first people who may be required the guidelines are people in
education and there is alot of math and science representations in education.

2. I think math and science issues are just as important as "blinking" text
and animations. 

3. Visibility is important.  If people do not clearly see math or science
issues being addressed in the guidelines document, most will probably not
go looking for help in the techniques document.
