I agree that it would become difficult to try to have specific items for
every interest group.  While science is maybe too specific for the current
guidelines, I think at least the issue of math is broader and used by many
groups.  I think at least math should be considered for a guideline.  The
guidelines will be used extensively and I think we want people to get this
item right for the previously stated reasons.  If math is burried in the
techniques document many people may not find the information they need to
do math correctly.

Jon

P.S. By the way charles do you have a history degree?
