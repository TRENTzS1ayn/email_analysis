I think we identified someplaces where a discussion of including
Mathematical content could be included within the Guidelines document. I
still don't see a Guideline which relates to Math. Maybe a Checkpoint.

  I agree that it would become difficult to try to have specific items for
  every interest group.  While science is maybe too specific for the current
  guidelines, I think at least the issue of math is broader and used by many
  groups.  I think at least math should be considered for a guideline.  The
  guidelines will be used extensively and I think we want people to get this
  item right for the previously stated reasons.  If math is burried in the
  techniques document many people may not find the information they need to
  do math correctly.
