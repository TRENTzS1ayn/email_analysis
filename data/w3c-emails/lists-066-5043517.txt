This was about what I had in mind, more eloquently expressed. (But that's
what I expect from Ian.)

  I don't see any reason to single out "Math" and "Science" in 
  the Guidelines. What particular accessibility issues do they raise?
  What distinguishes those subjects from Architecture or Philosophy
  or Art History?
  
  I could see adding a checkpoint to the guidelines that reads
  something like:
  
   "Where it's possible to mark up content (for example
    mathematical equations) instead of using images, 
    use a markup language."
  
  Then, in the techniques document, one could talk about
  using MathML to mark up math content.
