In addition to how math should be marked/expressed 
I would point out how it shouldn't be marked referring to common 
bad techniques.

That is:
1. Do not use a TABLE to arrange several images that 
    constitute one equation/formula. Use one image instead.
2. Do not use <FONT face="symbol"> to "generate" mathematical symbols.
    Use HTML character entities (or numerical reference) instead.
    (FONT face should be used only for suggesting style)
 
Both techniques are commonly applied by various TeX/LaTeX to 
HTML converters, some of which are referred to from the W3C's Math 
section.
