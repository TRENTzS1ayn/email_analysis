It is handled by lynx, emacs/w3, and maybe others, and on the other
hand, I don't how many agent support the NOFRAME tags (e.g. I don't a
see a way in my Netscape to say : use NOFRAME)

People accessing frame without an index (built by the UA) and without
NOFRAME can still access information, it's just not convenient because
you have to move to the next line and up rather randomly.

Lastly, can you please point at the agreement or argument that this
should stay a P1 since I posted my message above ? I looked for it
before reopening this issue and I couldn't find it in the archive.
