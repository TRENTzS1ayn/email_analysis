Since the problem is mostly confusion, as the page that disappears
abruptly is usually void of information, I would say "don't" with a
P2.

It's also bad design, should be done by the server, and it's really
annoying when using the back button, as one as to hit back twice
before the page move forward again...

I don't think that's a valid approach, as the time for someone with a
disability to read and activate this "slow down" link is probably
greater than the time author are willing their mainstream audience to
stay on this page.
