  annoying when using the back button, as one as to hit back twice
  before the page move forward again...

  The checkpoint does not apply to instant redirects (eg PURLs) - they are

DD::  I don't think that's a valid approach, as the time for someone with
a
  disability to read and activate this "slow down" link is probably
  greater than the time author are willing their mainstream audience to
  stay on this page.
CMN::
It might be valid if there is enough time, but i don't think it is very
good.
