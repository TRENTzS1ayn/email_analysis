While Netscape does not allow you to "turn off" frames, it will let you
open a selected frame in a new window.  The problem with frames and screen
readers is similar to that of tables and screen readers, i.e. it will read
across the frames as one garbled sentence.

Are you certain this is still a problem with current screen readers?  Each
frame is drawn in it's own particular window.  The screen reader "knows"
that there are two windows.  If the screen reader is reading across frame
boundaries, it's because it's ignoring the window boundary.

A similar example is with the Windows Explorer.  There is a tree on the left
representing the hierarchy of the file system, with the particular files
shown in the right side window.  Screen readers do not read across those
windows.

So while older screen readers might have ignored the frame boundary, I
believe that most of them have updated to respect the window boundary and
use programmatic means, such as Active Accessibility to get the information.

I want to make a semantic distinction here about "screen readers" versus other enabling technologies.

The visibility of HTML Frames is an option left to the author. At many framed sites I visit there are no frame borders; content from multiple frames appear merged as a single body of content. Unless one of the frame's contents exceeds its visible are and gains scroll-bars on the side, I can't tell that the site is framed, and neither can a screen reader. There is no "window boundary" to make the distinction.

A program which is not "looking" at the screen, but is programmatically intercepting or interpreting non-visual information about the document or its presentation is no longer "just" a screen reader, its something else. For example: although I haven't had the opportunity to use it, I understand that PWWebSpeak is an enabling Web Browser, not a generalized screen reader. Because it understands HTML and the underlying structure, its no longer limited to "reading across the screen;" it can understand tables and frames as distinct containers and present them to the user appropriately. A program which intercepts Windows system calls to interpret how the underlying program builds an image on the screen would also not be a screen reader.
