Well, according to the specifications there isn't. The mechanism in teh
Recommendations is to do exactly as Nir suggests. What is often used is
the pseudo-HTTP command refresh, which has been implemented by a number of
browsers directly, and does allow for a timed redirect. Perhaps we should
recommend not using the timed redirect more strongly.

  The optimal way to redirect the user to a new page
  when a URL is moved permanently is by returning 
  the status code 301 as per HTTP/1.1 (some older servers 
  like CERN's can't do that but can give a 302 status code which is 
  almost as good)
  
  Whether this is instant or not is up to the user agent.
  For example the W3C validator recognizes the HTTP status 
  codes 301 and 302 but informes the user of the new location 
  rather than validating instantly the document in the new location.
  
  I would recommend using the appropriate redirect HTTP status,
  and if this is impossible, just to place a page with a normal link 
  to the new URL, indicating that this technique is suboptimal as 
  link checker programs and indexing robots are less likely to update 
  their records timely if at all. For the sake of completeness I would mention
  the the META refresh thing is non-standard (without a disscussion)
  and that it is not supported by many agents.
