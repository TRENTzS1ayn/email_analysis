Hiyas!
Just wanted to congratulate you on your work on the WAI guidelines
pages. Wow! So nice to have what I need to allow people with
disabilities access to my pages!
You have helped me take what seemed a daunting task and make it seem
easy.
May all thats good in the Universe shine down upon you all.
Andy Harakal
