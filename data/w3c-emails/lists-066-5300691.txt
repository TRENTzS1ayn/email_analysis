The current guidelines only require NOFRAMES as a P2, since access to
individual frames can be provided by User Agents.

This reflects the priority system accurately. But the techniques document
should strongly recommend the use of NOFRAMES. The User Agent-based
strategy is an emergency interfce designed to solve a problem which is
properly addressed by the page author. Although in many cases the Frames
are used in a way which makes the repair strategy adequate, the solution
it provides can be particularly difficult to use (just this morning I
waded through multiple framesets to get from page A to page B via a whole
lot of NOFRAMES elements that said I wouldn't be able to do it, and one
which was the right idea executed badly).

FRAMES, by definition, are a non-serial medium. It is possible to
serialise the most common use - that of a navigation bar and content
frame, reasonably easily, and with a low impact on usability. For more
complex framesets the difficulties encoutnered by users increase rapidly
with the increased complexity. Although the title and name can be used to
give some clues about the structure of the FRAMESET, the NOFRAMES element
is the best (and the 'proper') way to actually provide access to the
structure in a serial manner by design.

just my 2c (now I am in a country where I can get 2c)
