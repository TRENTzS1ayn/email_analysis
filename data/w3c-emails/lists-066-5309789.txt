What is the status of the material in Section C?

If C.1 were a regular guideline, and the 8 things-to-do were regular 
checkpoints, they would probably have priority numbers attached. Also, the 
fact that they are in an appendix suggests that they are not regular.

Is it it the case the that the imperatives (must, should, may) don't apply 
to these 8 things as they do to the regular checkpoints?

By the way, I appreciated an earlier version of the guidelines that 
included a list of the checkpoints ranked by priority.
