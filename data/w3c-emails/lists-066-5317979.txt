The Charles' are once again in a agreement and I would add, although I'm
sure that this is thought of already, that the content of the <NOFRAMES> tag
be *replacement* information - Not just a "Get a frames capable browser"
like so many pages do already.

A possible repair strategy is to evaluate the content of a <NOFRAMES> tag
and see if it mentions browser names and flag is as a possible problem.
