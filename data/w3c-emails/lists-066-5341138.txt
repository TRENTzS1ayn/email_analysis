To: WAI Markup Guidelines<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>


The effective use of cross-references can be a helpful tool in providing
readers with a better understanding of the interrelations among
guidelines. It would perhaps be advantageous to consider in which contexts
cross-references could usefully be introduced. One further possibility,
apart from those which Charles has mentioned, relates to mathematical
notation etc. If the proposed guideline (A.6) is introduced which requires
markup to be used to represent specialised notations (mathematics, music,
chemistry, etc.), then a cross-reference should be made to the interim
solution (namely images with appropriate markup notation as ALT text, as
proposed in our earlier discussion), which would be a checkpoint under
A.1.

This is only an example and a careful search would probably reveal other
areas in which cross-references would help to make explicit the
the connections which may not be obvious to a reader. This should
alleviate potential disputes as to whether particular concerns are taken
into account in the document by facilitating a better over-all
understanding. This does not, of course, reduce in any way the importance
of scrutinising the document for whatever omissions may remain.
