Hello,

What are the differences  between wai-gl-techniques-19980918 and the most recent version?

I'm working in Flanders Language Village/Lernout & hauspie (L&H). I'm composing guidelines for creating accessdible webpages for visually impaired and blind people.
I rely on your "Techniques for WAI guidelines:page authoring".
19980918. What's the difference between:
WAI Page Author Guidelines
WAI User Agent Guidelines
WAI Authoring Tool Guidelines?

Thanks for your kind help.

PLEASE SEND E-MAIL TO MY HOME
