It has always been my assumption that we would say something like:

  - Avoid complex FRAMESET, which is defined as: more than 4 FRAMEs,
    but if you do, use NOFRAMES.
  - In all cases, provide FRAME title/name.

This way, for most of frameset, with a scrollable TOC on the side,
some horizontal banner on the top and a content page, the UA can built
a reasonable UI, but for more complex stuff, the author has to help.
