Please tell us more about the project. Note that while the Page Author
Guidelines have improved greatly, it is still a working draft and is
likely
to change before becoming a Recommendation. Thank you for continuing
to track the changes.

This one is for people who develop content.

> WAI User Agent Guidelines

This one is for browser developers and other user agent developers
(to make their software more accessible).

> WAI Authoring Tool Guidelines?

This one is specifically for developers of authoring tools,
(to make their software more accessible, to promote authoring
accessible documents, and to ensure that the produced documents
follow the Page Author Guidelines).

Good luck,
