Can anyone refresh my memory as to why using LANG is still not a P1 ?

I think this was raised in the past at least by Nir, Jason and myself.

If you don't know the language of some text, a speech system will
output garbage, therefore making it a P1.

In fact, I need to know for the EO group working on the quicktips.
