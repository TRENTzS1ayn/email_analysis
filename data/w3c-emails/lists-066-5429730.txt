It should not be priority one.  Adding <body LANG="zh"> to a page will not
make a Chinese page speak correctly with an English text to speech
synthesizer.

While there are a lot of good reasons to use LANG and I support that, we
should limit Priority 1 items to things that have a direct, beneficial
impact on the accessibility of the web.

Subject: Lang attribute not P1 ?



Can anyone refresh my memory as to why using LANG is still not a P1 ?

I think this was raised in the past at least by Nir, Jason and myself.

If you don't know the language of some text, a speech system will
output garbage, therefore making it a P1.

In fact, I need to know for the EO group working on the quicktips.
