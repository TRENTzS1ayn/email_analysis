I think we should advocate the use of NOFRAMES for all FRAMESETs. Although
by and large the UA can solve the problem for simple sets, it is not
really the best solution - the best solution is to solve it by design, and
the responsibility is on the author to do that.

  It has always been my assumption that we would say something like:
  
    - Avoid complex FRAMESET, which is defined as: more than 4 FRAMEs,
      but if you do, use NOFRAMES.
    - In all cases, provide FRAME title/name.
  
  This way, for most of frameset, with a scrollable TOC on the side,
  some horizontal banner on the top and a content page, the UA can built
  a reasonable UI, but for more complex stuff, the author has to help.
