On the other hand, with a speech synthesiser that handles English,
Mandarin and Japanese, and defaults to Japanese, adding <BODY LANG-"zh">
will have a chinese page spoken correctly.

  While there are a lot of good reasons to use LANG and I support that, we
  should limit Priority 1 items to things that have a direct, beneficial
  impact on the accessibility of the web.

  Can anyone refresh my memory as to why using LANG is still not a P1 ?
  
  I think this was raised in the past at least by Nir, Jason and myself.
  
  If you don't know the language of some text, a speech system will
  output garbage, therefore making it a P1.
  
  In fact, I need to know for the EO group working on the quicktips.
