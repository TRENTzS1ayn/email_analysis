Rob, I'm not sure what you are asking for.

I looked at dol.gov and although it uses a TABLE to do a column
layout, it does so in a way that permit a graceful degradation when
the table is linearized (actually, ignored, as with lynx).

So it complies with the guidelines and the tips:

> 9. Tables  Avoid using tables to format text columns. Make sure cell-by-cell
> reading order makes sense for tabular data. 

We say "Avoid" in the tips, rather than "Don't" because it's a legacy
situation: people with user agents that can linearize table (such as
Opera, Lynx, WebSpeak, EmacsSpeak, Mosaic, etc) are just fine, but
people with user agent or combination of UA and assistive technology
that can only layout your data in columns are getting non-sensical
information ala:
  
Quick Guide    Most of us know more about
DOL Agencies   the TV drama 'ER' than we do
etc

which requires them to jump to the line by guessing when the column
actually ends (like, right after Quick Guide)
