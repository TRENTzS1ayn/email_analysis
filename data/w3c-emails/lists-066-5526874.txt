OK, but this requires that the charset information is correct. Which is in
fact a better way to do it. I guess the i18n people could give us a more
definitive answer. I think it might be a linguistics problem.

I realise that I have not actually expresssed a priority opinion. This is
on purpose - mine is not yet firm.

  The Japanese version of Home Page Reader does not (currently) use LANG
  attribute. English and Japanese use completely different character set
  (Alphabet and Kanji). Therefore detecting Japanese and English is not so
  difficult for TTS Engine. ProTALKER does not speak Native-English. It
  speaks limited English word in Japanese accent.  We are looking at
  supporting the LANG attribute in the future.
  
  I agree that it is not a P1 for authors, but perhaps a high priority for
  UAs
