Would it be possible to change the headers in Techniques document to
something else than A.N or B.N? I think it is somewhat confusing to go from
Guideline A.1 to checkpoint A.1.3 which is then under B.7 in Techniques
document or A1.1 which is under A.2. When going back and forth between the
documents it is easy to get lost.

Maybe the Techniques document could just use plain numbering, such as 1.2.3
or add something like TA.2 or TA.7 to better differentiate from guidelines.
