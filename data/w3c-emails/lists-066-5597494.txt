Right.  As an example, take a look at "International Layout in CSS" [1]
WD.  Charset of this document is ISO-8859-1, and the basic language of
this document is specified as <html lang="en-US">.  Yet this document
uses several other languages like <span lang="ja">tate naka yoko</span>.
"Tate naka yoko" is a Japanese word, even if it is written in latin
alphabet and encoded in ISO-8859-1.  You can't guess the language
from charset.
