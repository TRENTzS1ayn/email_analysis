We discussed conformance on the 28 Jan call.  As part of that discussion,
the following action item was assigned to the working group:

To determine if conformance shall include only P1's or P1's and P2's, the
group needs to take a critical look at all P1's and P2's to decide if they
are all required.

Also consider if all P1s are actually P1?  are all P2s P2?

The Candadian government considers a document in conformance with the
guidelines if all P1 and all P2 checkpoints are met.  Other people feel
that only P1 checkpoints need to be met.

The minutes from the discussion are available at:

also note that this issue was sent to the Coordination Group.
