Simple tables cause simple problems. The simple solution is to avoid
saying, anywhere, anytime 'use tables for layout'. It is a bad thing.
People will still do it, and people need to be able to use tables for
tabular information, so solutions are still necessary. But we are
currently giving a mixed message by encouraging people to use simple
tables.

  Where possible, use a markup language to mark up content rather than using
  images.  For example, use MathML to mark up mathematical equations, and
  Cascading Style Sheets to create text formatting and control layout.

  Note.  Since new markup languages are evolving it will take some time for
  the browsers to be released as well as time for users to adopt the new
  browsers.  Therefore, until a majority of browsers in use support new
  languages, simple tables (to control layout) and bitmap text with alt-text
  (for special text effects, including mathematical equations) may be used.
  Where necessary, provide an alternative page to ensure that the information
  is accessible.  (See also A.9 and A.14).
