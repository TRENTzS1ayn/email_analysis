When I'm looking the examples of Checkpoint A.6.2. under B4 lists in the
Tecniques doc, I think that putting the numbers in the list makes it harder
to read visually. And I don't think that is our aim.

In some cases the numbering is certainly OK, but in my viewpoint it
shouldn't be done like in this example. Actually, I think if the numbering
is done this way it does not help much anybody. I cannot make sense of this
list when going down one item at a time and not knowing the semantics? For
instance, couldn't the ball-point be at any level with the earlier 1s.

1 writing tools
1 pens
1 highlighters
1 red
2 green
3 blue
2 ball-point
1 green
2 purple
3 mauve
1 pencils
1 #2 lead
2 soft lead
2 erasers

Could it be possible to add the numbering to the lists only when list
numbering is turned on in the browser settings? Also similar to tables,
users should be able to get context info i.e. the path of an item in the
list and move up and down the hierarchy with keys.
