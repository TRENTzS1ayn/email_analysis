Excuse me, but if indentation is "necessary" in HTML then there is
something wrong.  How are you going to indent the speaking browser?

If indentation is a desirable presentation of something, then CSS has
the ideal solution, and its use is already a general principle of WAI.  
Many authors will still be (mis)using TABLE to achieve this on old
browsers, but I wouldn't have thought that this point (viz.
"Quotations") in the guidelines was the right place to discuss the
rights and wrongs of that.
