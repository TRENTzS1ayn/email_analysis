This gets to the difference between things which are required for
improving accessibility and the things which improve useability (there is,
of course, a substantial cross-over). The general useability is part of
good hypertext authoring. 

The specific jump for groups of links is related to problems experienced
by users of screen readers, which is definitley within our scope. I am not
sure that the broad solution is within the scope of this activity. Does
someone have a good answer to that question?

  Could this be more general? E.g. provide shortcut links for bypassing
  groups of related information or jumping directly to certain information.
