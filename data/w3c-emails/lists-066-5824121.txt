I think that we should advocate the use of NOFRAMES for all framesets. I
am prepared to see it as P2 for all framesets, although for 
complex framesets, especially those which are more than 3 frames, or which
do not match the common pattern I think P1 may still be appropriate. I am
not so concerned, although I would be interested to hear the Mobile
Browser people comment on this.
