A new version of the Guidelines was posted last night.  It is available at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-19990210/

There have been many changes to both the Guidelines document (26) and to
the Techniques document (10).  Most notably the names have changed to "Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines."
