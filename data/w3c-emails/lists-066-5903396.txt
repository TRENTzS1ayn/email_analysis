Hello,

A new public draft of the Guidelines [1] is available.
The purpose of this draft was to introduce the new
title of the document to the public. As a reminder,
the new title is "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines".

Other than the title change, the only changes to the
document since the 10 Feb WG release were minor and editorial 
in nature. They are listed at [2].

Thank you,

 - Ian
