I have 3 issues with the latest document that are not marked open in
the issues list:

 - A 5.2 should be P2 
   this was agreed in a telecon sometimes ago but is not reflected
 - technique for A 10.1 needs to explain how this is done
   ("a second copy of the page")
 - A 8.2 on table: before saying "if you use table" we should have a
   P2 saying : avoid using table for layout

I hope we can discuss them today on the telecon.
