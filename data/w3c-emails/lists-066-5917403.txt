In the Guidelines document A.10.1 currently reads:
"For auto-refreshing or timed response pages, provide a second copy of the
page where refresh only happens after a link has been selected (until user
agents provide this ability themselves)."

Are you saying that in the Guidelines document we need to be more specific
or that we need to include more information in the Techniques document?
Currently, the Techniques document includes the text of the checkpoint
followed by this note:
"Note. Automatic refresh is valid behavior, supported by some user agents,
but this behavior is not required by  the HTML 4.0 specification."

As with other checkpoints, we ought to include an example and more prose in
the techniques document.   What do you propose including in the guidelines
document?

So, in total, is this how you would like the A.8 checkpoints to read:

1.  Avoid using tables for layout [Priority 2]
2.If a table is used for layout, do not use any structural markup for the
purpose of visual formatting. For example,
     in HTML do not use the table header (TH) element to cause the contents
of a cell to be displayed centered and in
     bold. Other attributes of a table, such as a caption describing the
layout purpose and content of columns is
     valuable, particularly if some cells become navbars, frames, images,
imagemaps, or lists of links. [Priority 1] 
 3.For data tables, identify headers for rows and columns (e.g., the HTML
TD and TH elements). [Priority 1] 
  4.For data tables that have more than one row and/or more than one column
of header cells, use markup to
     associate data cells and header cells (e.g., in HTML, THEAD, TFOOT,
TBODY, COLGROUP, the "axis",
     "scope", and "headers" attributes, etc.). [Priority 1] 
  5.Provide summaries for tables (e.g., via the "summary" attribute on HTML
TABLE elements). [Priority 3] 
  6.Provide abbreviations for header labels (e.g., in HTML, the "abbr"
attribute on TH). [Priority 3] 

Charles has raised a related point in regards to A.6.4 (see
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999JanMar/0217.html):
"Simple tables cause simple problems. The simple solution is to avoid 
saying, anywhere, anytime 'use tables for layout'. It is a bad thing. 
People will still do it, and people need to be able to use tables for 
tabular information, so solutions are still necessary. But we are 
currently giving a mixed message by encouraging people to use simple 
tables.

This sounds like the basis for a good discussion in today's call.
