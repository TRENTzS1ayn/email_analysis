the following items were discussed on the call today and resolved as follows:

>> - technique for A 10.1 needs to explain how this is done
>>   ("a second copy of the page")
>>
Daniel is going to take a stab at rewriting this checkpoint, then we'll
decide what to do in the techniques document.


 the six A.8 checkpoints will read:

1.  Avoid using tables for layout [Priority 2]

2.If a table is used for layout, do not use any structural markup for the
purpose of visual formatting. For example,   in HTML do not use the table
header (TH) element to cause the contents of a cell to be displayed
centered and in bold. Other attributes of a table, such as a caption
describing the layout purpose and content of columns is valuable,
particularly if some cells become navbars, frames, images,
imagemaps, or lists of links. [Priority 1] 

 3.For data tables, identify headers for rows and columns (e.g., the HTML
TD and TH elements). [Priority 1] 

 4.For data tables that have more than one row and/or more than one column
of header cells, use markup to    associate data cells and header cells
(e.g., in HTML, THEAD, TFOOT, TBODY, COLGROUP, the "axis",   "scope", and
"headers" attributes, etc.). [Priority 1] 

  5.Provide summaries for tables (e.g., via the "summary" attribute on HTML
TABLE elements). [Priority 3] 

  6.Provide abbreviations for header labels (e.g., in HTML, the "abbr"
attribute on TH). [Priority 3] 


A.6.4 will read:

  Where possible, use a markup language to mark up content rather than
using images.  For example, use MathML to mark up mathematical equations,
and Cascading Style Sheets to create text formatting and control layout.
[Priority 2]
  
  Note.   Where necessary, provide an alternative page to ensure that the
information is accessible.  (See also A.9 and A.14).
