I would put the explanation into techniques. Which is basically this:

This checkpoint does not require a website to avoid complex content. It
requires that the language (and other aids to comprehension - images,
multimedia examples, etc) be as simple as possible to understand. For
example, in most contexts, 'eschew sesquipedalianism' is a much more
complex way of saying 'don't use big words when you can use simple ones'.

Examples where the use of the simplest words may not be appropriate
include poetry, and technical literature which uses specialised terms.
the practise of providing a gloss (short explanation of meaning), or ruby
for unfamiliar words is only about one two thousand years older than the
web, and is still a valuable technique. the HTML element RUBY, or a link
to a glossary, are two ways of achieveing this.
