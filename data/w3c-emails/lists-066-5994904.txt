Actually I think that orientation is somewhat different to graceful
transformation/device independence, but I agree with Daniel that the
guidelines could all be placed in one section.

  I still think the current split in

    B. Orientation, Navigation, and Comprehension

  It's all about device independence and transforming gracefully, and
  orientation, navigation are just applicative aspects of this problem.
  
  If I look at checkpoints under B1, B2 and B3, most of them are here so
  that the "page remains usable - that is navigatable for instance -
  despite user, technological, or situational constraints." which is
  what A starts with.
  
  OK, now suppose you can argue with me about what I just said, and ask
  yourself how much of that argument is going to be relevant for the
  target audience of these guidelines ??
  
  I think a simpler and better Table of Content would be:
    A. Intro (talking about transform gracefully and navigation)
    B. Guidelines (numbered 1 to 17)
    C. D. etc. same as current
