I think we should squarely address the fact that what we have here is a
heightened sensitivity to a general good quality.  Anyhow, from the prince
of pedantic peroration, please consider:

"Use language that is as simple as possible, while appropriate for the
content 
of your site. [Priority 1]

"To reach the widest possible audience, use direct, simple language.  This
is a well known rule in written communication.  For people with some
disabilities, anything short of direct writing can be more than a nuisance,
it can be disastrous.  Conditions ranging from dyslexia to deafness can
make access to written information difficult.  For these people, complex
structure and obscure words can break the thread by which their reading
hangs.  This is the disability-access argument for plain language.  This
consideration applies over and above the fact that once you publish to the
World Wide Web, your audience is a World audience and many of the people on
the Web with your content have a first language different from yours."
