I took an action item during the 11 Feb call to rewrite the text of A.1 so
that it is clear special handling of alt-text is required for the cases of
images listed as note at the end of this checkpoint.

It currently reads:
Provide alternative text for all images (e.g., in HTML, via the "alt"
     attribute of the IMG and INPUT elements, or via "title" or within the
     content of OBJECT). Note. This includes images used as image maps,
     spacers, bullets in lists, graphical buttons, links, and to present math
     equations. [Priority 1] 

I propose:
Provide alternative text for all images (e.g., in HTML, via the "alt"
     attribute of the IMG and INPUT elements, or via "title" or within the
     content of OBJECT). Note. Specific recommendations are provided in the
Techniques Document for writing alternative text  for images used as image
maps,  as spacers, as bullets in lists, as graphical buttons, as links, or
to  present mathematical equations. [Priority 1] 


Jason, you in particular wanted mention of techniques for providing
alternative text for math.  What do you think of this proposal?  I would
like to keep the specifics in the techniques document.  

Thoughts?
