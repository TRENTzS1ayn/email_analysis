I have just been looking at the whole thing a bit more carefully - it
seems to me that you can either use a DOCTYPE or a namespace - if you are
going to mix bits of different XML then you use namespaces. Anyway, I
suspect it is an issue we need to sort out.

  In XML, this is done by DOCTYPE declarations.  Namespaces are a little
  bit different; they indicate the intended semantics of a set of
  elements, but neither indicate a data schema nor assert compliance
  therewith.
