Al Gilman suggested the following as a statement of checkpoint B.3.1.:

"Use language that is as simple as possible, while appropriate for the
content of your site. [Priority 1]"

This sounds reasonable to me. Simpler seems better for this checkpoint.

I (Eric Hansen) assume that Al intended that any other material (such as 
the longer paragraph) would be put in the Techniques document.

I think that virtually any of the material posted on this thread (re: B.3.1 
- Simple and straightforward language) might be crafted into/included in 
the Techniques document.
