8 hours of plane = more comments to swallow by the editors...

My most serious comment is still about the structural change and I'd
like to talk about it on today's call.

Most things here are in the range of clarification of existing text,
with a couple of new proposal on the content itself that we can rasie
on today's call as well (like new checkpoint on metadata).

>  Accessibility does not mean minimal page design, it means thoughtful

Also mention "nor duplicate page design"

Mention that the Techniques doc "is an evolving" document.

mention a tar/zip of what (the HTML + attached pieces)

providing a proprietary format here. Why not Word then (no!)

OK to cut the line to fit but let's try to keep it sensical.
This one is fine, but A.5 and A.12 are weird

>  A.12 Use features that enable activation of page elements via input ...

It would be unfortunate it it meant rewording the guidelines though
(it's a presentation issue), but I don't have a good solution.

Add here something explaining what checkpoint/guidelines/techniques are.
(I know the intro is being reworked completely)

I think it should be reserved: first the rationale, then the details.
Same issue with A.3 that starts with an "If"

    3. For scripts that present critical information or functions,

Use "important", the defined term, not critical (or add critical in
the index definition)

Add "instant redirection done by the server"

>  A.11 Ensure that embedded custom user interfaces are directly accessible.
> 
>   The accessibility of objects with their own interface is independent

Somehow I feel this is not true. I'd rather not affirm that.

I would actually favor moving this one in A.9 and removing A.11
altogether. 

    1. For image maps, provide alternative text for links. (See also A.1)

This is really a plain dup of A.1.1. Although I see the need for
repeating A.1.1. for animated gif, I think here it looks really like a 
bug.

>  Users not operating in a graphical environment are

This is poorly phrased. To me, not operating in a graphical
environment means you don't have window, so popup is not an issue. I
guess the word operating is the problem. Maybe "User not using the
graphical features of the desktop are disoriented..."

I think it's the only case where "must" is used and emphased in a
checkpoint. Since it's a P1, it's not needed.
Use Active form isntead: Provide...
I realize A.14.4 has the same problem (but it's not in <strong>)

I'm not really happy with this one. I like it to be a P2 for things
like PDF, Word.

> A page that is too elaborate may deter a larger audience than you
> might expect. 

I don't understand this sentence.

>  To decrease the amount of sifting readers perform to find important

"sifting" is not in my vocabulary, so I suggest using a more common
word (I always use myself as a criteria for english language
acessibility :-)

> B.2 Checkpoints:

Need a new one for "use Metadata".
  Use metadata (e.g. RDF) to add semantics information to your page
 (such as author, kind of content, etc

And a technique pointing to w3.org/Metadata.

I got feedback from people that these two should be P2.

>   8. Facilitate off-line browsing by creating a single downloadable

How is this accessibility related ? Suggest dropping.

Not sure what this one mean. Need to be more detailed. Maybe only a
technique then ?

In the graphics, I would indicate visually the unraised dots (with
empty little circle), so that people understand the notion of 6 dots matrix
more easily.
