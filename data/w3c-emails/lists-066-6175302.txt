A lot of people ask for PDF. We do have to draw the line somewhere
(e.g., we don't provide a stuffit archive). Arnaud and I thought
PDF and PS was enough and I haven't changed this list since then.

Agreed. 

I have a separate problem with defining the word "important". It already
has a meaning in English. Can't we use that one?

Proposed: 

"This guideline is very important for objects that contain
text but does not apply when the server performs the instant
redirection."

I'm not sure what "objects that contain text" means, however.

Proposed:

"When you embed an object in a document that has its "own interface"
(i.e, it may not be controlled by the user agent), you must consider and
ensure the accessibility of that interface (e.g., device-independent
access to functionality, keyboard operability, self-voicing, etc.)  If
the interface of the embedded object cannot be made accessible, an
alternative accessible solution must be provided."

Perhaps the WG should discuss that at the teleconf. For now, I'll
leave as is.

(This is A.12.1)

Furthermore, it is duplicated as A.1.3.

Proposed: Delete A.12.1 but leave A.1.3.

Other opinions?

I will add a Priority 2 checkpoint for this and a link
to the RDF specification.

Opinions?

Helps accessibility by reducing amount of navigation across documents.

I agree. I propose making it a comment related to the previous
checkpoint, which reads:

    Group related links, such as links used to create a 
    navigation bar, and attach a meaningful title on the 
    element creating the group

We can do this during the last call period. I nominate you. <grin>
