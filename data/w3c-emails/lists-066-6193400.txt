My philosphy is to make a document that can be used as a quick reference
and a learning document.

Most people will try to fix separate prolems one at a time, before they
learn how to fix all problems.

Bobby testing software is setup this way.  Bobby test software shows all
Priority 1 errors in groups.

ALT TEXT  first and then the next error type next etc.

It should be possible to change one type of error at a time by looking at
the appropriate section.

Here is a segment of what I am talking about.  I did not change very much
of the existing text.  Much of the existing text has run on sentences, and
lack definitions.


An example of what I am talking about

---------------------------

  A.1 Provide alternative text for all images, applets, and image maps.

Problem:

Voice browsers and the visually impaired are unable to read

- Images - submit, reset, bullets, 
- Image Maps - This includes images with one or multiple links.  The cursor
can not be put over the image.
- Program Applets -Applets are unable to be read by
early/freeware/shareware voice browsers.

This includes images used as submit buttons, bullets in lists, and all of
the links within an image map as well as invisible images used to layout a
page. Alternative text does not describe the visual appearance of an image,
applet, or image map. Rather, it is used to represent the function that the
image, applet, or image map performs whether it be decorative, informative,
or for purposes of layout. If alternative text is not provided, users who
are blind, have low vision, or any user who cannot or has chosen not to
view graphics will not know the purpose of the visual components on the
page. Since "bare" ASCII art (characters that form images) does not allow
alt-text, it must be marked up especially for this purpose


Checkpoints:

   1.Provide alternative text for all images (e.g., in HTML, via the "alt"
attribute of the IMG and INPUT elements, or via "title" or within the
content of OBJECT). Note. This includes image used as image maps, spacers,
and bullets in lists, graphical buttons and links. [Priority 1] 
   2.Provide alternative text for all applets and other programmatic
objects (e.g., in HTML, via the "alt" attribute or within the content of
APPLET, or via the "title" attribute or within the content of OBJECT). (See
also A.11) [Priority 1] 
   3.For all image map links, provide alternative text for each link (e.g.,
via the "alt" attribute of HTML AREA element). [Priority 1] 
   4.For all image map links, provide redundant textual links. [Priority 2]
if client-side image maps are used, [Priority 1] for server-side. 
   5.Do not use an image map to create a set of buttons in a form. Instead,
use separate buttons or images (accompanied by alternative text). [Priority
2] 
   6.Replace ASCII art with an image and alternative text. [Priority 1] or
[Priority 2] depending on the importance of the information (e.g., an
important chart). Note. If the description of (important) ASCII art is
long, provide a description in addition to alternative text. (See alsoA.2) 

Solutions
IMAGES
The solution is ALT TEXT.  This is in the form ALT="Text description".  The
Alt Text describes the image in words so that the message can be understood
without the image.

EXAMPLE

<IMG SRC="filename.gif" ALT="Text Description " HEIGHT=Y WIDTH=X>

< > - Everything within these brackets is the same command
IMG SRC="filename.gif" - Put file filename.gif here.
ALT="TEXT DESCRIPTION" - Put the text description of the image in the place
 of TEXT DESCRIPTION.
HEIGHT=Y - Y= The Height of the image.  Y is an Integer.
WIDTH=X  - X= The width of the image.  X is an Integer

??? Where does the location command go?  IE: Align commands?

IMAGES WITH LINKS AND IMAGE MAPS
The solution is ALT TEXT and text links.  Voice browsers must have an ALT
TEXT description of the image and text links to follow.  The reason for
this is the voice browsers can read images, and voice browsers are unable
to move over an image to choose a link follow.  

"PUT SAMPLE CODE HERE"

APPLETS
Applets allow for the additional of text description inside the applets.
Most voice browsers are not able to read this information.  ALT TEXT is
need by most people and should be included for all Appletts.  This is
similar to ALT TEXT for IMAGES.


What do you mean by bullets etc.


The Program BOBBY says that SUBMIT and RESET do nto require ALT TEXT?
