To:"'GL - WAI Guidelines WG'"<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>


Tonight we will be posting the lastest version of the guidelines.  They have
been spiffed up and reformatted  and the latest comments and suggestions
incorporated.   (See change log for a careful chronological log of all
changes made to the guidelines since you looked at them.)

TOMORROW NIGHT they will be going for LAST CALL review. This takes 3 weeks.
At the end of that they proceed toward formal W3C Recommendation.

SO  if you want to affect the guidelines before they go out for last call?..
watch your GL list tonight ( or tomorrow) and get your comments in by 5:00
eastern time.

Thanks much


Hoping you find them just perfect

Gregg
For the chairs and editors


Ps  And thank so very much to those who have been contributing to the
guidelines efforts and teleconferences.
