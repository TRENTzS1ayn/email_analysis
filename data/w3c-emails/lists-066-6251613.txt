I find them just perfect.

I think my enjoyment of their perfection coud be enhanced by the use of a
few more XML examples, eg xml:lang, using the content of an element which
is used to include an object (generalising the OBJECT / APPLET example).

I don't think it is a problem, and I think the editors have done a
great job.
