This numbering is backwards.  If you use numbers, level 1 of conformance
must be the strictest.  The die is cast in the order used for priorities.
Don't cross up the reader by reversing your field here.

Sorry I didn't catch this earlier.  Thanks to Eric for making the

Otherwise define an enumeration of adverbs, for example {essentially,
substantially, entirely} conformant, for conformance to all { P1 , P1 & P2
, P1 & P2 & P3 } checkpoints.

It must be explained that this is the "this version" URL from the document
and not the "latest version" URL.
