We discussed this on the teleconference several times. We
chose "P1", "P12", and "P123" so that listeners would immediately
know which sets of checkpoints were satisfied. Numbering them
alone (e.g., "P3") was confusing because one wouldn't know whether
that meant P3 alone or P1 + P2 + P3. 

"P123" is the longest because it means you've done the most work.

That's why the wording in the original statement was:

"Identify this document with this URI:
<http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-19990226>"

This was to avoid needing to explain the difference between
the latest version and the specific version.
