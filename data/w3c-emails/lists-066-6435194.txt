Programmers will grok this.  The people writing the ratings will be OK.
But the people reading the ratings won't and so the scheme is, well, less
mnemonic than would be best.  The WG can do what the WG decides but
statements that librarians and teachers will tend to grasp instantly rather
than after training would be preferred.

"Identify the document with" is too abstract.  

In this situation we need to say something more consumerized along the
lines of "As part of how you cite the document, give the URL and spell it
exactly as shown here: <http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-1999%%%%>"
