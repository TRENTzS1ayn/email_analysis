How about 

"P12. P1. P12. P12. Check check. P1. P12. P12. Check check P12..."

Which is what sound engineers say on stage all the time.

  Just want to let you know that I am watching how this plays out with great
  interest.  I am envisioning Bobby Approved A, Bobby Approved AA and Bobby
  Approved AAA.  Or perhaps Bobby Approved C1, C12 and C123.  I'm not sure which
  I prefer but CAST will surely want to align Bobby with the conformance
  recommendations in a near future release.
  
  On the other hand, you might consider using Conforms (C1), Conforms Very Well
  (C12), and Conforms Extremely Well (C123) or something of this sort so that
  there is a natural language way of describing levels of conformance.  Can't
  imagine how we will squeeze all of that onto a Bobby approved icon - but ya
  never know.
  
  For some odd reason, I can't imaging standing on stage and actually saying P -
  1 - 2 - 3.
