To: WAI-PF for action in XHTML2 engineering process.

Cc: WAI-GL for info or if you want to mention counters in a "suggestions for
future work" section -- entirely your choice.

There is history in why people use inaccessible counters.  See 

  Accessible web page counters

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/1999JanMar/0339.html

for a recent mention on the Interest Group list.

We should keep this counters fiasco on our list of trouble spots where we
want XHTML2 to be not just as good as HTML4 but better.

On the shopping list for how to fix this: More flexible object inclusion.

On the shopping list for the migration plan:  More flexible ways to assert
alternative and/or equivalence relationships between things.
