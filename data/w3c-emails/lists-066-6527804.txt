There is more to this guideline than this exchange reveals.  I was shocked
when I first encountered this guideline, because the fact that lists give
the appearance of order to things that are semantically sets is one of my
hot buttons.  But there is a reason for it.  And it goes beyond just those
cases that are natural OL applications.

Numbering of list items is a navigation aid for someone using a screen
reader, which really treats the document as a sequence of lines.  Braille
formatting uses hierarchical numbering of sections and not indenting to
show structure for a similar reason.  So the guidelines need to expose this
issue.  There is benefit to ordinal marking of lists for navigation for
this group.  This is not a pure win-win deal; so the practice has to be
applied with a grain of salt.  But there is some motivation to use OL over
UL even when the underlying semantics indicate UL.

On the other hand, this particular example is so dysfunctional that we had
better come up with a better one if we want to pass the laugh test.  A long
single-level list would be a better idea.
