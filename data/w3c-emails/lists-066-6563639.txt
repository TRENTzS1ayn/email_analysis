This is exactly the kind of thing I don't like.  Technology should
serve people, and not vice versa.  The information that there are four
sub items is present in the document, and software should be able to
extract it for those that need it.  Requiring all users to see the
redundant information clutters up the page, and requiring all authors
to perform a mechanical task that should be automated will encourage
dismissal of the guidelines as onerous, irrelevant, and in conflict
with good design principles.  There is no good reason for this
guideline.

To put it another way: if you need this information, would you rather
require on the world's thousands of Web authors to give it to you,
probably incorrectly and possibly in a different language than your
native one, or your browser, in a way configurable by you and always
right?
