Hello Greg, thanks for the comments.

I assume these are the same as those included in Chuck Opperman
message earlier today, as archived:
 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999JanMar/0318.html

They look the same, just checking.

BTW, there's already been a couple of reactions to your messages, you
might want to check this same archive archive if you missed them.
