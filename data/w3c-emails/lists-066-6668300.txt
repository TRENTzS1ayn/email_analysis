Greg, looking more closely at your comments, it seems that you've not
reviewed the latest version of the guidelines:
  http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH/

I don't think you looked at a very old version, so it shouldn't be too
hard to map your guidelines refs (A.12.3, B.1.2, etc) to the more
recent numbering, but it would help if you sent us the exact release
date of the document you reviewed.

Thanks

> pages only using ALT as these guidelines recommend will not be accessible

> should only be pri 3 because we assume the person can find a UA that support
> keyboard access to client-side image maps. That is, it's no more important
> than avoiding hard-coding colors, which our UA also allows you to override,
> and you dropped that one altogether because of the readily available
> workaround. Or is this really important for people with cognitive
> impairments, and if so, should that rationale be called out?
> 
> A.1.5 As with A.1.4, it should be ok to use client side image maps as long
> as there is ALT on the AREAs so we should reduce priority to 3.
> 
> A.5.2 This should be Pri 1 if A.5.1 is not done correctly, but only Pri 3 if
> A.5.1 is done correctly. Making this high priority implies that you have to
> do both, which I don't feel is true.

> 
> A.6.2 Using OL and UL is Pri 3--it does not provide access, only makes it
> easier. After all, who's to say what lists cross the line from where it's ok

> A.6.3 In discussing this with our Web team, I recommend that it is higher

> off than it is to avoid abusing BLOCKQUOTE. Therefore if it's important that
> a paragraph be set off (e.g. indented) I'd use BLOCKQUOTE instead of relying

> A.10.4 There is no A.10.4 but I'd suggest that the Note 1 about is important
> enough to be listed as a Checkpoint because they are so frequently used and
> because the general injunction to avoid non-W3C-approved HTML constructs is
> not specific enough to make people follow it everywhere. Also, A.10.2 and
> A.10.3 can be interpreted as prohibiting BLINK and MARQUEE but they are
> vaguely enough worded that they can also be interpreted otherwise. (For
> example, does A.10.2 prohibit blinking, or just blinking that causes
> flicker? I would rephrase it to clarify that the two clauses are separate.)

> 
> B.1.5 Use of OPTGROUP should be Pri 3 as it improves usability but not basic

> 
> B.2.9 I still say reserved class names like "nav" are a horrible hack that

> bars with different styles, such as bars for the first- and second-tier

> Lower Priority:
> 
> A.2.1 Does it describe how to make D links reliably invisible?
> 
> A.3.3 What exactly is meant by played automatically? Only startup sounds, or
> also sounds played automatically in response to user input?
> 
> A.8.1 Just out of curiosity, why still no table attribute specifying whether
> it's for layout only etc. (as I'd recommended a long time ago)?
> 
> A.8.3 May want to add note that it's appropriate to override the styles so
> the TH etc. don't look abnormal.
> 
> A.9.3 I'd recommend listing a third alternative mechanism, something simpler

> 
> A.13 I'd suggest re-ordering to put the Pri 2's ahead of the Pri 3's, lest
