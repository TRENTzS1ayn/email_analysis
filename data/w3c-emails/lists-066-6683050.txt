Thanks for your comments Richard,

Building on Ian Jacob's reply of March 3, the Education and Outreach
working group is developing a training curriculum to aid designers in
creating accessible web pages.  The curriculum will contain exactly the
kind of examples you hoped to see in the Guidelines.  When the curriculum
is ready for public release, it will be announced on the WAI mailing lists.

Regards,
Chuck Letourneau
