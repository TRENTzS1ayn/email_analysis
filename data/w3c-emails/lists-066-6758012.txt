Misha,

Thank you for your prompt review. The editors will take into
account your comments. I've snipped the purely editorial ones 
from my comments below.

Perhaps it would be better to say something like "Provide clues
about natural language information". And in the subhead (or
rationale) explain that such markup will help, for example,
speech synthesizers.

Yes, I believe it should be Guideline 10.

I agree. There are trwo problems in the example part of 15.9:
  a) The LINK element should be mentioned in a checkpoint about
     navigation tools (that may be synthesized by UAs).
  b) The part about archives is another solution that is not
     related to the checkpoint. This has to be cleared up.

Hmm, I recently changed them to designate specific versions
intentionally.
Perhaps unlike a technical specification, it's best in this case
to point to the latest version. And 13.1 reinforces that.

Good catch. Our scripts were producing an extra &nbsp; at
the beginning of that markup. The one between "Priority" and "1"
is left intentionally.

Thank you again Misha,
