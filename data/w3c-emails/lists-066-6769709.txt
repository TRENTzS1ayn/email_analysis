Garbled attempt to say "supplement the text content with metadata in the
markup."

"Supplement markup" is, strictly speaking, wrong.  Careful speakers of
English will, as Misha did, interpret this as implying "do something that
is outside the markup."

Perhaps "augment" or "enhance" may have been intended, but a more
straightforward statement would be to use apply, employ, or provide as in

  "Provide markup that aids conversion to speech and Braille."  Or
  "Use markup that documents language and pronunciation."
