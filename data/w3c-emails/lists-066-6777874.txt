Again, Misha's wording is better.

Al

PS:  Not Americanism, just Constructivism.

[The degree of] consistency between pages is the inverse of [the degree of]
difference between pages.  

Talking about consistency "between" pages presumes that the consistency
relation is a binary relation and is applied pairwise to all possible pairs
in the page set at the site.  "Across" neatly avoids the issue of whether
consistency is a pair or set property by allowing for both interpretations,
whichever the reader is prone to assume.  This choice also avoids getting
entangled in the number connotations of "between" or "among."
