Amaya actually traverses such links to 'make book', allowing you to do
this. But I agree that much of this belongs in the techniques document
only.

(PS I like most of your suggestions Misha - thanks)

  Sorry.
  
  Point a) -- there is in the HTML specification a remark suggesting that
  LINK markup be used to annotate the structure of a super-document tree
  composed of multiple HTML elements/files.  That is why LINK is mentioned
  here.  This is a pretty academic point, however.  Perhaps in the
  _techniques_ for this guideline, we can refer the reader to a tool that
  walks the LINKs and merges the document in a print-to-file pass.
  
  Point b) -- The .zip solution is related in that it facilitates review
  while the user is not paying connect time charges.  Admittedly it is an
  alternative to the literal satisfaction of the guideline as presently
  stated.  But it is a technique addressing some of the same problems.
  
  To create a guideline that fits both techniques, one could perhaps broaden
  it to: "Facilitate offline reading of the material at a time and in a tool
  of the user's choice."
  
  Technique 1: Composite document in plain text file.
  
  Technique 2: .zip etc. archive of document.
