Misha raised the question "Do we cite specific releases of W3C documents
when we link to them, or do we use the 'latest' URL (as given in the
document)?"   Has this been logged into the open-issues list?  

To my mind this is a substantive issue requiring thought.  We may even wish
to make selective use of both URLs and explain how the present document
relates to each reference.
