That's very encouraging.

Your point is well-taken. The introduction has been
designed to tell authors that designing with accessibility
in mind will help them produce pages that transform
gracefully in a number of situations. The priorities, however,
reflect needs of people with disabilities. While it may be
true that a Priority 1 checkpoint such as 1.1 ("Provide
text equivalents for all images") will benefit a number
of user classes, search robots, etc. , the priority
was assigned because of accessibility needs.

Can you explain what you mean by a "guideline
on the language of the captioning"? Do you mean
that the caption's natural language should be identified?
Although 6.2 comes close to covering 
this ("Identify the primary (natural) language of a document."), 
perhaps we need to add a checkpoint about identifying the natural
language of alternative content. There is also an "hreflang" attribute
in HTML for identifying the language of the target of a link.
Should that be included?

ok.

There have been many discussions about this, but I will raise
your point with the Working Group.

While I agree with you that we should avoid subject language,
the Working Group chose the wording for some checkpoints very
carefully. For example, checkpoint 2.1 uses the word "important"
intentionally (and links to its definition in the glossary). Not
every image needs a long description. We must rely on the user's
judgement to determine that an image (or applet, etc.) is important
enough that it deserves one.

As for "if needed" and "where possible", I agree that these
should be reviewed and deleted ... "where possible".

The term "properly" in 5.1 needs elaboration. The WG should
address, for example, whether a jump from an H2 to and H4 is
considered "properly nested" or whether such a jump
is permissible. (As opposed, for example, to an H3 preceding
and H2 when logically the first follows the second.)

I think the Priority 1 is "tempered" by the notion of important.
The Working Group might consider lowering the Priority explicitly
for less important cases, as it did for checkpoint 10.1, which reads:

  [Priority 1 if information or functionality is important and not
  presented elsewhere, otherwise Priority 2.]

Please explain how you would change the wording of the checkpoint:

   Ensure that all information conveyed with color is 
   also available without color, for example from context or markup.

Yes, I agree that the editors need to state more clearly what is
meant in the case of HTML by "nested header".

That's an elegant phrasing.

Very much so. Thank you again,
