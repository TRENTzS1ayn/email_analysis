We can add "Don't use FONT to the techniques" if it's not clear
enough. However, the techniques doc already states in 2.10:

   Fonts

          Instead of using deprecated presentation elements 
          and attributes, use the many CSS properties to control font
          characteristics: 'font-family', 'font-size',
'font-size-adjust',                 'font-stretch', 'font-style',
'font-variant', and 'font-weight'.

This doesn't seem like an issue to me. You can point to a chapter
of the HTML 4.0 spec, which is a different document than the
cover page. It's addressable separately but still part of the spec.

I don't think we need to go this far.

Here is the comment from L. David Baron. I think it's not
just editorial.

Ok.

See my response to her as well.

That's what we already have. The issue is whether the "Section
A" should be "Section 1" instead. The "A" part is not longer
involved in the guideline numbering.
