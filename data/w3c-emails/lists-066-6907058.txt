Yes, that's what I interpreted. 
My comment was that this might be made more explicit.
Maybe the bullet list comes to early in the section, and confused me.

This was to illustrate that "implicitly" (in my reading) 
the guidelines are concerned with access by disabled. 
When meant to support wider access in a general sense, 
I think the language of the captioning should also be 
considered. For example, here in The Netherlands most 
movies with foreign speech are subtitled in Dutch.

Yes, it is hard to find something better. What about:

- Ensure that all essential information....
  [this is countered as bearing a subjective value]
- ......coveyed with color other than enhancing the expressiveness 
  [not sure, this is proper english]
