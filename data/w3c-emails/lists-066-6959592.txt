I fully agree with Warner on this point.

Just FYI, ISO-HTML [1] takes a very strict attitude towards this issue,
and actually it *requires* to "nest" sections, by introducing pseudo
elements <div1> through <div6>, though, these elements shall not appear
in valid ISO-HTML documents.  An example:

     <h1>heading 1 text</h1> 
     <div1>
     ...
        <h2>heading 2 text</h2>
        <div2>
         ....
        </div2>
     </div1>
     <h1>other heading 1</h1>

If you are interested in it, take a look at relevant section of User's
Guide to ISO-HTML [2].
