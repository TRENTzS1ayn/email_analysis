Under Priorities:

"The checkpoints have been written so that it will be possible to verify
when they have been satisfied. "

As discussed in an EOWG telecon a possible clarifying statement might
minimize the perhaps too optimistic hopes raised in the above quote.

Somehting like: Although an author's Website may have its conformance
with many checkpoints verified *objectively* by a tool such as Bobby,
there are also some checkpoints (e.g. "provide textual equivalents")
that, although their presence may be verified mechanically, only the
subjectively applied skills of a human author can approve. 

I assume that if you want to explicitly include this caveat you can find
a *real* wordsmith like Ian to state it better.
