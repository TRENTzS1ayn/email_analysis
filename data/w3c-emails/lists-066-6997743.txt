{EH: Comments by Eric Hansen (EH) on Checkpoint 8.5 -- Relevance to 
nonreaders}

{EH: The 2/26/99 version of checkpoint 8.5 reads: "For applets and 
programmatic objects, when possible provide an alternative function or 
presentation in a format other than an applet.  [Priority 2] "For example, 
for an applet, provide a video equivalent. For an animation, provide a 
snapshot of the animation.}" 

{EH: The following is my preferred revision of checkpoint 8.5:} 

8.5 For applets and programmatic objects, provide an equivalent in another, 
nontext format.  [Priority 2].  (Note. Checkpoint 1.2 requires a text 
equivalent for applets and programmatic objects {EH: See 1.2 Provide text 
equivalents for all applets and other programmatic objects.  [Priority 
1]}.) For an animation, one might provide a snapshot of the animation. For 
an applet, one might provide a video equivalent.{EH: Not stated as commands 
but as possibilities. I am not sure what was intended.)

This checkpoint is helpful for people whose browsers cannot run the applets 
or programmatic objects but who can perceive visual presentations.

It can also be helpful to nonreaders, including deaf nonreaders. For 
example, for an applet, one might provide a video equivalent of a person 
communicating the content using a manual communication system (e.g., sign 
language).

{EH: I removed the reference to "possible".}

{EH: Note that the introductory material for guideline 8 lacks reference to 
any disability groups or other user groups so it seems justifiable to 
mention them with the checkpoints.}
