We attempt to emphasize that good design produces accessible documents,
thus I don't think there's a conflict. However, if the tone leans
towards accessibility, I think that's to be expected from this document.
Nonetheless, I will review the language of the introduction.

It is likely that the editors will adopt a clearer numbering convention.

We intend to provide this as a separate W3C Note.

I'm not sure what you mean by strategies. Could you be more specific?
The prose at the beginning of section A discusses general
principles (these are not exactly strategies, admittedly) and the
checkpoints themselves are strategies for addressing the
guidelines. Perhaps a more implementation-oriented discussion
of strategies belongs in the techniques document. Any suggestions
are appreciated.

This is another document that we intend to provide as a W3C Note.

The Working Group has strong reservations about making
such a statement because of the difficulties raised by
alternative pages (see the Note after the checkpoints
in Guideline 13). Furthermore, the Working Group feels
that the checkpoint about alternative pages (13.5) should
be listed *after* the others of that guideline despite
the fact that it is a priority 1 checkpoint in order to
dissuade authors from using this solution as a first
option. Authors should attempt to make their pages
accessible, not separate but equal.

Proposed text:

      Users with blindness will understand the function of 
      the image when the text is read aloud by a speech synthesizer.

Checkpoint 15.1 does not refer to the use of "title" as
a means of a creating a tool tip. Checkpoint 15.1 talks
about link phrases, which should be understandable out
of context, terse, meaningful, and device-independent.

The "title" attribute in HTML should be used to give advisory
information about the target of a link. This information
MAY be used as a tool-tip by a user agent, but this is
not required in any W3C specification. 

Do users need to be told that it's possible to interact
with a Web document? Isn't that so fundamental to the 
Web that it's not necessary to state for every link
that this link is meant to be interacted with?

Proposed change:

  * Why certain pages are not accessible to people with disabilities.

The goal is that when an author or site or tool says "We meet
the requirements set forth by the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines", that "meet the requirements" is well-defined
and verifiable.

Eric Hansen has sent some interesting suggestions [1]
about the conformance section that the Working Group
has not yet had the opportunity to review. I trust that
some of your questions will be addressed during that review.

I think that's a good observation. It should be it's own section.
(The section follows the preceding paragraphs since it relies on some
of the definitions in them.)

It is interesting that you are associating the term "transformation" so
strongly with "style sheets". Does that connection come
from an XSL perspective?

Style sheets provide some of the solutions listed in the
guidelines, but others rely on proper use of markup,
organization of content and of an entire site, navigation
tools, etc.

As mentioned above, this is meant to be discussed in a
separate W3C Note.

Proposed change to 1.2:

  Provide text equivalents for all applets and other programmatic
objects
  that present visual information.

These subjects are discussed in section 2.9 of the Techniques Document.
However, we will look further into a discussion of CSS2's aural
cascading style sheets and how they can control cueing, background
sounds, etc. The editors will also look into more information about
synchronization and SMIL.

Yes, the conflict must be clearly documented. We will also re-examine
checkpoint 13.1, which says to use the latest W3C technologies. 
The phrase "wherever possible" must be clarified. It may be more
appropriate to use CSS1 features, for example, than some CSS2 features
until CSS2 is more widely supported. It is crucial for authors
to ensure that whatever features they use transform gracefully,
and style sheets are designed to do so.

As confusing as it may sound, CSS allows you to
use relative units in absolute positioning (and you should). 
Thus, you may position an image to be offset by "3em" from
the top of its containing element. This is a fixed distance,
but is relative to the current font size, so it scales
nicely.

Thus, relative "units" should be used wherever possible.
