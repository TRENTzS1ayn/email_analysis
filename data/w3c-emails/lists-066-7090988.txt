        Reply to:   multimedia comments


Just a couple multimedia-related comments on the Page-Author Guidelines...

1.  The third paragraph of the summary for guideline 2 confuses me primarily because of this sentence:

"If a visual presentation has an associated auditory presentation (e.g., a movie), the audio version of the descriptions should be synchronized with the existing auditory presentation..."

If you change "existing auditory presentation" to "primary audio" that would clarify things.  Or, if you really want to use "presentation", then perhaps "primary audio presentation."

2.  The link to the techniques document from guideline 3.2 leads to information that is now out of date: 

a.  The sentence "Some media formats, such as QuickTime 3.0, allow captions and video descriptions to be added to the multimedia clip" should be altered to include SMIL and SAMI, as both are now available and both allow for captions and descriptions (okay, SAMI is still just captions only).

b.  "Future technologies, on the other hand, will allow separate audio/visual files
to be combined with text files via a synchronization file to create captioned audio and movies"  should be altered to specifically mention formats, such as SMIL and SAMI which operate in this manner.  Perhaps something like, "Some technologies, such as SMIL and SAMI, allow  separate audio/visual files to be combined with text files via a synchronization file to create captioned audio and movies...".

Thanks.
