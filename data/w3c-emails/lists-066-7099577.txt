It should be remembered that HTML is an application of SGML (as emphasized
in the HTML 4.0 specification). SGML is built upon a separation of content
from presentation. A well designed HTML document will therefore conform to
the HTML specification (including one of the DTD's) and will use style
sheets to control presentation, employ elements and attributes in
accordance with their definitions in the specification, etc.

Almost by definition, such a document will satisfy many, though not all,
accessibility requirements. A well designed document is thus often, though
not invariably, accessible.
