Hi,
The Guidelines do not currently state their intended audience.  Some
Participants thought that they did not have enough knowledge or experience
to follow the Guidelines and Techniques, others thought the Guidelines were
too repetitive for experienced authors, for example in emphasising that
visual information requires text equivalents.

Related problem: Some particpants who used authoring tools were not able to
follow the example code.

Potential solutions:
* The intended audience could be indicated: not in a way which excludes
those with less knowledge, but indicates the expected level of knowledge
and experience.
* Also it could be acknowledged that authoring tools may not yet support
the implementation of some tags, and state that the WAI is working on that.

Regards,

Chetz and Helen.
