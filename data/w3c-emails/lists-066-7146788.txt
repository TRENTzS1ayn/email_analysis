Hi,
Checkpoint 7.4 says that data cells in tables must be associated to header
cells.  This is Priority 1 although Headers and IDs are not yet widely
supported.  A participant thought that it is unreasonable to say that
authors 'must' implement tags that are not yet supported.

Chetz has previously raised this issue and a paragraph was inserted in 'How
the Guidelines are organised' which states that some technologies may not
be supported yet in some browsers.
This may not be sufficient: some particpants were frustrated to find that a
tag was not yet supported when they had worked on implementing it.  In some
cases they removed the tag altogether.  They stated that they wished to be
informed if tags are not widely supported.

Potential Solution:
* Perhaps the Guidelines / Techniques can warn authors that this may be the
case (for each Guideline, rather than just in 'How the GLs are organised')
so that they have a choice.  If tags are likely to be supported only by
special devices and not by the main browsers this could be indicated.

Otherwise, the Note in 'How the GLs are organised' could be moved to a more
prominent position, such as the beginning of the Intro.

Regards,

Chetz and Helen.
