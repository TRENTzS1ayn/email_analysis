Hi,
Should Checkpoint 1.1 have a similar note as in 1.6 for important images?

Should there be a link to the example of ASCII art from either the
Guidelines or the Techniques?

Should there be a link in the Guidelines to either mention of 'Brief
descriptions of images' sections in the Techniques (1.2 and 2.7)?

Perhaps the mention of screen readers in the list at the beginning of
Section A should have a link to the description of screen readers in
Appendix C.

Checkpoint 11.1 has a link "see also Guideline 11".  Is this a typo?

Checkpoint 11.3 says "Provide keyboard short-cuts to links".  Does this
mean for all links?  If there were many links on a page this would be
impossible.

Regards,

Chetz and Helen.
