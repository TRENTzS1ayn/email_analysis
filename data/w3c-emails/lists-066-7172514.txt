Hi,
For the Techniques document:
Accesskey, Longdesc, Headers and IDs, etc. were often perceived by
participants to be 'special', which meant that they were less confident in
transferring their existing knowledge while implementing them.  For
example, Participants did not expect ALT to be displayed at the same time
as the image, but they were unsure whether Longdesc would be displayed in
Netscape or IE.

Related problem:
Some of the new tags are not described in HTML 4.0 reference books, maybe
because they are perceived to be 'only' accessibility tags.

Potential solution:
* There may therefore be a need for the Guidelines / Techniques to provide
additional support for implementing these tags.

* Participants said that they would like examples of how tags, especially
new tags, might be rendered in mainstream browsers and how screen readers
may deal with them.  This has been provided for Tables and may also be
useful for others, such as Longdesc and D-link.

Regards,

Chetz and Helen.
