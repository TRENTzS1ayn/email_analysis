Hi,
For the Techniques document:

The use of variables in examples is not always obvious, for example the
third example in 2.5 Tables uses the variables 'a2' - 'a8', but does not
use 'a1'.  Participants had difficulties in allocating names to variables
because they did not know whether the choice in the example was crucial, or
a matter of preference.

Potential solution:
* Names of variables in examples should be chosen with care and, where
necessary, explained.

Related problem:
Currently, all the examples have to be read before an author can decide
which to use.  Some Participants were observed to just read the first
example and then implement it straight away, rather than reading them all
and choosing the most appropriate.

Potential solution:
* The examples could be listed in such a way that it could be seen at a
glance which would be the most appropriate to use.  For example, a list of
types of table with the associated example:
<list of types of table>,
Simple tables - use example 1,
Complex tables - use example 2,
etc.
<presentation of examples>,
Example 1,
Example 2.

Regards,

Chetz and Helen.
