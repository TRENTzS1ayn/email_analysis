Hi,
The use of a validator requires knowledge about doc-type etc, which authors
may not know about.  A participant used the W3C validator on the
recommendation of the Guidelines, but was unable to provide sufficient
information for the validator to work properly.

Potential solution:
* Section 1.10.2 could warn that certain information is required by the
validator.  And / or acknowledge that some authors may have to rely on
other methods.
This is a difficult issue since the Guidelines cannot provide instructions
for use of a validator, but we wanted to point out that using a validator
is not necessarily straight-forward for all authors.

Related problem:
Viewing a page with images turned off is not as easy as it sounds if the
page has already been viewed with images turned on.  An author would, at
least, have to restart their browser, and may also have to clear the cache.

Potential solution:
* Section 1.10.5 could be more specific about techniques for viewing pages
without images.

Regards,

Chetz and Helen.
