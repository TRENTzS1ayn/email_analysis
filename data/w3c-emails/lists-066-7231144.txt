Thank you Eric. I like a lot of the suggested edits. Below are
my edits to your suggested methods:

Fine.

I propose merging 9. and 10. into something like:

Review structure and content for clarity and simplicity.
Readability statistics, such as those generated by some word
processors may be useful indicators of clarity and simplicity.  Better
still, ask an experienced (human) editor to review written content for
clarity. Editors can also improve the usability of documents by
identifying intercultural problems that might arise due to language or
icon usage.

Proposed rewrite:

   Invite people with disabilities to review your documents.  Expert
   and novice users with disabilities will provide valuable feedback
   about accessibility or usability problems and their severity.
