Now I understand better. I propose the following wording:

    4.1 Ensure that all information conveyed with color 
        is also available without color,
        for example from context or markup. [Priority 1] 

              When text has a purely decorative value 
              and conveys no information other than the color 
              itself, it is not necessary to provide that 
              information elsewhere.
