Chetz and Helen,

a few comments and questions (chetz's original text marked with CC:: my
responses marked with WC::):

CC::
>Participants were observed to perform two types of 'finding' task while

WC::
Did participants not make use of the Checklist of Checkpoints?  The
checklist is organized by topic and points back to the Guidelines document.


CC::

WC::
yes, others have made this comment as well.  We are addressing this problem.

CC::

WC::
All of the URLs between the Guidelines doc, the Techniques doc and the
checklist of checkpoints are relative, thus they should be no longer than a
few words (this was a change that may not have been in effect in the
version that participants used).

CC::

>T2.2?  Is there a way in which the numbering could match across the
>documents, for example, could G1.1 relate to T1.1?
>
WC::
hmmm.  New section numbering is an interesting idea.  Unfortunately, since
the Techniques document and the Guidelines document are organized
differently (Guidelines by issue, Techniques by issues then HTML topics) i
don't think we will be able to synch them up as suggested.

other thoughts?

WC::
yes, we have violated our own guidelines.  thanks for pointing this out.
We will remedy this.

CC::

WC::
these are interesting proposals.  we will try them out.

CC::
>Related problem: position of links.
>In Checkpoint 1.1 the link "Provide text equivalents for all images" goes

>1.1 <no link> Provide text equivalents for all images [Priority 1]

>Examples of providing text equivalents.
>
>This could be applied to many of the Checkpoints.

WC::
i believe this is what the other WAI guidelines have done.  This is a good
solution.

CC::
>Finally, Checkpoint 15.5 recommends the use of a site map. A participant
>suggested that the Guidelines could use one because it can be difficult to
>navigate between the documents.
>
WC::
<grin>  hopefully we can find a solution that makes it less confusing.  if
not, maybe we'll have to create an example of an accessible site map.

thanks again chetz and helen!!
*great* comments,
