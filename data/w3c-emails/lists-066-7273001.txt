Hello,

What kind of addtional support do you propose should be added for using new
elements?

Since the user agent working group is thinking about on how longdesc and
other new elements and attributes ought to be used, we don't want to
duplicate their efforts in our document.  If we link to specific
discussions of new elements in the user agent guidelines, will this satisfy
the needs of the participants?

thanks,
--wendy
