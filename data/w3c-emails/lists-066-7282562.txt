Thanks for your note William.

I was on the Education and Outreach call as well, and heard the discussion
around this point.  While at first skeptical about the need for
clarification, I tried stepping back to look at the statement from the
point of view of a relative newcomer.  I now think you are correct.
Someone might think the Guidelines are hinting (and being coy by not
mentioning names) that those machine verification applications are what we
are referring to.  I would support asking the editors to add a sentence of
clarification.

Might it be as simple as restating the existing sentence?

"The checkpoints have been written so that it will be possible [for a
person/an author] to verify when they have been satisfied."

Comments?
