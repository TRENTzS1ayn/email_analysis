Chetz's comment marked with CC::, my responses with WC::

points.

WC::
We have been trying to make the phrases as short as possible.  More strides
towards this end were hopefully made in the last version, as editing still
continues.  We welcome all  proposals for particular changes!

CC::

WC::
We provide a zipped version, a postscript version, and a PDF version.

WC::
how do you suggest we break up the document into smaller files?  each
guideline in its own file?  each technique section?  could you create a
prototype of how this would look?

CC::

>People who:

><list item> cannot view graphics,
><list item> have chosen not to view graphics."

WC::
good idea. we will look into this.  

CC::
>* Where bold text is used for emphasis, such as paragraph 3 of Guideline 2,

>Checkpoints.

WC::
other people have made this comment as well.  We are currently removing
much of the use of bold text.

CC::
>* The links in each Guideline could also be listed separately from the text

>Guideline, then follow links (as mentioned in our previous message

WC::
yes, we agree with your previous message.

CC::
>By the way, some bold text is presented using <b>, others with <strong>.
>Is this intentional?
>
WC:: no, this is not intentional.
