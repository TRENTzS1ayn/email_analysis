as mentioned before, we are working to ensure that it is obvious where a
link goes. please check with the open issues list on monday 15 march and
keep track of discussions on the mailing list to see how this evolves.

we discussed server-side image maps at length at the working group
teleconference last week.  This section will be modified to reflect those
changes.

WC::
The group began discussions on this topic during last week's call.  most
likely, it will disappear since the "title attribute in HTML is meant for
advisory titles (e.g., on a link, to describe the target). It should not be
assigned the exclusive role of providing a description of an image, script,
etc." (Tim Berners-Lee).  However, this is an open issue for the group, so
please watch the list for developments.
