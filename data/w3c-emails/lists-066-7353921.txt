we are adding a checkpoint that requires authors to comply with a published
formal grammar (DTD or schema) as well as indicate which grammar they are
complying with.  This also means that we will include some text in the
Techniques document.  

However, if the validator is not easy to use, comments about how to make it
more usable ought to be directed to the keeper of that page, Gerald Oskoboiny.
