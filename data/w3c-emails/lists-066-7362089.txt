  We have been trying to make the phrases as short as possible.  More strides
  towards this end were hopefully made in the last version, as editing still
  continues.  We welcome all  proposals for particular changes!
  
CMN:
The checklist is designed to provide some accommodation for people who do
this. However,  the short answer is that people must read the document to
understand it completely, and probably need to understand it completely if
they are going to use it effectively. There are no completely satisfactory
ways I know of for catering to people who won't read the whole document,
and I would be strongly against any suggestion that tried to do so. If the
comment is merely about the format of the document, then there is an
editorial problem - we are obliged to have one version of the document,
and providing everything in both bullet point form, and in explanatory
prose of a more extended nature, would make the document unwieldy (it
would not require reading both forms). In which case my personal 
preference is for prose, but it is an editorial decision.

  We provide a zipped version, a postscript version, and a PDF version.
  
CMN:
Most people can print from their browser without needing any other
versions. W3C policy is that there is one official version of a document,
which is specified by a URI and is therefore online, and which is in
English. Any other version - an archived copy, a printed version, a
translation, is not authorative. People can, and do, print versions for
their own convenience, which is why htere is the caveat in the 'available
versions' section.

  WC::
  how do you suggest we break up the document into smaller files?  each
  guideline in its own file?  each technique section?  could you create a
  prototype of how this would look?
  
CMN:
This would further complicate reading the document - many people find
it very difficult to thoroughly read a non-linear document. As Chetz has
pointed out, the linear version is alreday difficult to read, and people
would like it to be simplified. My personal feeling is that having a
single complete document makes referencing more intuitive and makes it
clear that all the guidelines apply at the same time, and there are
many implicit cross-references, which seems to be a
point easily missed.

  good idea. we will look into this.

  other people have made this comment as well.  We are currently removing
  much of the use of bold text.

  yes, we agree with your previous message.
