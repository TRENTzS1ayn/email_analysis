  Thanks for your note William.
  
  I was on the Education and Outreach call as well, and heard the discussion
  around this point.  While at first skeptical about the need for
  clarification, I tried stepping back to look at the statement from the
  point of view of a relative newcomer.  I now think you are correct.
  Someone might think the Guidelines are hinting (and being coy by not
  mentioning names) that those machine verification applications are what we
  are referring to.  I would support asking the editors to add a sentence of
  clarification.
  
  Might it be as simple as restating the existing sentence?
  
  "The checkpoints have been written so that it will be possible [for a
  person/an author] to verify when they have been satisfied."
  
  Comments?
