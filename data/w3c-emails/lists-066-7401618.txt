This is a tricky problem. If we remove P1 from things which are not
supported by browsers x,y and z (where x,y, and z are an ever-changing and
personal set, then we are compromising what is supposed to happen
(according to various agreed standards, such as HTML 4.0, XML 1.0, etc)
and therefore the accessibility gains which are available to people using
a good browser. This seems foolish.

On the other hand, people don't like doing something that doesn't work for
them. One of the challenges we face is getting people to understand that
the purpose of following these guidelines is that things they cannot see
(or otherwise perceive...) with their browser may be crucial for people
who are using a different browser.

  Hi,
  Checkpoint 7.4 says that data cells in tables must be associated to header
  cells.  This is Priority 1 although Headers and IDs are not yet widely
  supported.  A participant thought that it is unreasonable to say that
  authors 'must' implement tags that are not yet supported.
  
  Chetz has previously raised this issue and a paragraph was inserted in 'How
  the Guidelines are organised' which states that some technologies may not
  be supported yet in some browsers.
  This may not be sufficient: some particpants were frustrated to find that a
  tag was not yet supported when they had worked on implementing it.  In some
  cases they removed the tag altogether.  They stated that they wished to be
  informed if tags are not widely supported.
  
  Potential Solution:
  * Perhaps the Guidelines / Techniques can warn authors that this may be the
  case (for each Guideline, rather than just in 'How the GLs are organised')
  so that they have a choice.  If tags are likely to be supported only by
  special devices and not by the main browsers this could be indicated.
  
  Otherwise, the Note in 'How the GLs are organised' could be moved to a more
  prominent position, such as the beginning of the Intro.
  
  Regards,
  
  Chetz and Helen.
