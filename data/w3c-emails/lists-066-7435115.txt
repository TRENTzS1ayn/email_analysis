Hello, 

I received an action item at the 11 March teleconf [1]
to propose a checkpoint related to DTDs (and schemas) to
the list. Here is the wording based on our discussion during
the call:

Priority: 2

Text    : Create documents that validate to published formal 
          grammars. 

Comment : For example, include a document type declaration 
          at the beginning of a document that refers to a 
          published DTD. 


I am not sure how to work Schemas into the checkpoint without
it becoming unduly long. Perhaps we can mention schemas
in the techniques document?

All  suggestions welcome,


 - Ian
