I think we should state that the document needs to refer to the grammar in
which it was created (the machine equivalent of including the lang
attribute)

  Hello, 
  
  I received an action item at the 11 March teleconf [1]
  to propose a checkpoint related to DTDs (and schemas) to
  the list. Here is the wording based on our discussion during
  the call:
  
  Priority: 2
  
  Text    : Create documents that validate to published formal 
            grammars. 
  
  Comment : For example, include a document type declaration 
            at the beginning of a document that refers to a 
            published DTD. 
  
  
  I am not sure how to work Schemas into the checkpoint without
  it becoming unduly long. Perhaps we can mention schemas
  in the techniques document?
  
  All  suggestions welcome,
  
  
   - Ian
