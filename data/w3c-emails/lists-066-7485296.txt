I was thinking of the case where color is used to assist 
ease of reading, similarly as bold, italics, and other fonts 
emphasis phrases. The color is used as style of presentation.
When I print such a colored page, I loose the color information. 
It reduces readability, but I don't consider that loss as a 
Priority 1 issue. It depends on how well the document has been 
written, of course.

It is good to make authors aware to use colors only for enhancing
their message, or otherwise take care the information is 
made available in an other way.
