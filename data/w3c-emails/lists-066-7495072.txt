There is a Priority 1 problem here where someone sends a message where the
colour is critical, and you are reading it in monochrome or via  text to
speech. I got an email like that yesterday - I couldn't deduce what they
meant without colour.

  I was thinking of the case where color is used to assist 
  ease of reading, similarly as bold, italics, and other fonts 
  emphasis phrases. The color is used as style of presentation.
  When I print such a colored page, I loose the color information. 
  It reduces readability, but I don't consider that loss as a 
  Priority 1 issue. It depends on how well the document has been 
  written, of course.
  
  It is good to make authors aware to use colors only for enhancing
  their message, or otherwise take care the information is 
  made available in an other way.
  
  
  Warner.
