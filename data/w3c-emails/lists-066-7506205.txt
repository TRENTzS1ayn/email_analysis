Agree, priority is 1 in the crucial case.
I tried to show there are cases where color isn't crucial.

To me, the guideline isn't specific in defining when color 
is crucial/essential/criticial and when it is not. That's 
left to the subjective judgement of the author. So, our aim 
is to find a wording where the author receives more guidance.

Perhaps the creation of awareness on the issue is already sufficient.
Or, rather then refining the guideline wording or labeling 
the priority index, adding more explanation and description 
on what/how a disabled person perceives a Web page, is providing 
the thing needed. Examples/use cases are the things which can do 
that job.
