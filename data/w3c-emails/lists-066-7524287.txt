Dear readers,
Unfortunately I will nog be able to join the coming GL meeting.
I think the current documents cover the needs of regular HTML
readers.

One item though, that is mentioned several times, is not really
solved properly. This concerns interactive aspect of WWW usage.
More and more sites use JavaScripting for this.
I'd be happy if some guidelines could be added to regulate
scripting. 

Problems:
- Instability of the screen becuse of moving objects (already mentioned
  but from a different view point).
- In many cases Javascript-based links behave different than 
  HTML links. How can this be avoided.
- Links sometimes have strange names: the names of the scripting
  routines they belong to. How can this be avoided.
- Because of scripting requirements links show up in the tab
  order that are no real links. They are only needed for
  technical reasons. How can these "hidden links" be
  avoided or how can they be recognized by the screen
  reader (and rejected as irrelevant) or by the user?

I do hope you see my point.
Since more and more sites require interaction this
problem is becoming more and more important.

Best regards,
Jaap
