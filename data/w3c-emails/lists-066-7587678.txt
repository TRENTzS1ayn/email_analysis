See my reply below. Judy, your comments are appreciated.

The HTML 4.0 intentionally does not discuss how new elements and
attributes are to be presented. The HTML WG also elected
to say very little about the semantics of "longdesc" and in 
particular how the user agent should make the information available
to the user. The details were postponed, I believe until
they could be addressed by the WAI. It seems as though the
time has come and you are requesting further specifications for 
the attributes and elements particularly relevant to accessibility.

In my opinion, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
is not the right forum for resolving these problems. Rather,
it is some combination of WAI Working Groups. Judy,
should this be taken to the WAI CG?
