My guess is: the rendering is completely within the purview of the
User Agent Guidelines WG. The primary responsibility of the WCAG is to
ensure that the necessary information is added. Explaining how this works
in practise would be a good thing to do in a discursive techniques
document.

  The HTML 4.0 intentionally does not discuss how new elements and
  attributes are to be presented. The HTML WG also elected
  to say very little about the semantics of "longdesc" and in 
  particular how the user agent should make the information available
  to the user. The details were postponed, I believe until
  they could be addressed by the WAI. It seems as though the
  time has come and you are requesting further specifications for 
  the attributes and elements particularly relevant to accessibility.
  
  In my opinion, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
  is not the right forum for resolving these problems. Rather,
  it is some combination of WAI Working Groups. Judy,
  should this be taken to the WAI CG?
