I don't think I was suggesting that the P1 be removed, but that authors be
informed that what the Guidelines said they 'must' do may not be supported
yet.  I think there may be no harm in the Guidelines being more explicit
about the fact that some elements / attributes are not yet supported and it
is not possible to predict if or when user agents will support them.

Could the Guidelines state this more clearly in the introduction where
browser support is mentioned?

From the Guidelines: "The current document and the Techniques Document
refer to some technologies (e.g., features of >HTML, CSS, or SMIL) that may
not be supported yet in some browsers, multimedia tools, etc." ...

[insert here]
Authors should also note that some of these technologies may not be
supported by all browsers.  However, browsers that do not support such
technologies will not be adversly affected by their use.  [or words to this
affect]
... "Browser support for language features is discussed in the Techniques
Document."
