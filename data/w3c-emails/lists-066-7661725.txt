I think there is sme confusion here. As I understood it, Chetz was talking
about elements which are not in the HTML 4.0 spec. Now I think I misread
it, and you meant things like LONGDESC. It is known how to use those, but
generally they are only implemented in latest-release or specialty
browsers.

  Perhaps the Techniques could indicate that these tags are new and that it
  is not yet known how they should be used, in addition to links to specific
  discussions.  Then authors would hopefully be clear what the current
  situation is.
