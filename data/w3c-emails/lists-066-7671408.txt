I like your proposed additional wording. But I think it would harm the
guidelines utility if they were explicit about what is not widely
implemented - that changes too fast.

  I don't think I was suggesting that the P1 be removed, but that authors be
  informed that what the Guidelines said they 'must' do may not be supported
  yet.  I think there may be no harm in the Guidelines being more explicit
  about the fact that some elements / attributes are not yet supported and it
  is not possible to predict if or when user agents will support them.

  Could the Guidelines state this more clearly in the introduction where
  browser support is mentioned?

  Authors should also note that some of these technologies may not be
  supported by all browsers.  However, browsers that do not support such
  technologies will not be adversly affected by their use.  [or words to this
  affect]
  ... "Browser support for language features is discussed in the Techniques
  Document."
