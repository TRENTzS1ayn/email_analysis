Even when there is user agent support, it will still be
up to the author to mark up the relationships.Thus, I don't think
the checkpoint as worded should say "until".

I will raise this as an issue with the WG.

I will add something to this effect.

I'll add a statement to this effect:

      In general, user agents ignore HTML attributes they
      don't support and they render the content of 
      unsuppored elements.

(I'm not sure why OBJECT "hurts". It was designed not to hurt, i.e.,
for its content to be rendered when designated objects cannot
be operated.)
