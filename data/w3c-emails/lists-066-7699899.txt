Hi,
I think it is a natural question to ask how many web users, or potential
web users, are disabled, but I am also unconvinced it is relevant when so
many of the guidelines are aimed at improving access for those working
'eyes free' or 'hands free'.
Also, I'm not sure there are reliable sources of statistics.

However, I am concerned that if there is no explanation of how special
devices might render elements / attributes effectively, authors may develop
inaccurate models, as I described before.
I agree that such information does not need to be in the Guidelines.
