Perhaps it is good to stress once again that it is NOT important at all how
accurate statistics are but as Charles already mentioned and Chez agreed on
that many webusers are disabled in one way or the other.
So the real important thing is to achieve awareness about the keyproblems
and achieve consensus on how to solve, reduce or avoid them. That is what is
relevant!

Even if the figures mentioned in this article pointed to below are true for
only 50% they are still impressive enough. The main problems are descibed
pretty good in general I think.
