IJ:  
  I will raise this as an issue with the WG.
CMN:
  As I recall it was to solve a legacy problem when there were a number of
browsers which ignored all tables markup, and would therfore run the
contents together in a single line. I would be surprised if such a browser
was being used by someone who had problems with it, although I suppose
those people are out there.

IJ:  
  I'll add a statement to this effect:
  
        In general, user agents ignore HTML attributes they
        don't support and they render the content of 
        unsuppored elements.
  
  (I'm not sure why OBJECT "hurts". It was designed not to hurt, i.e.,
  for its content to be rendered when designated objects cannot
  be operated.)

OBJECT hurts in some versions of MSIE 4, which had a really buggy
implementation. Although alternative content is still important - the
early Netscape implementations didn't render some very common content
types (images, text, html) although they would happily render more complex
objects. I assume the problem has been fixed now. Part of the problem was
that it required a WIDTH and HEIGHT, which can be done as a legacy
solution. Also it sometimes crashed. Not much that can be done about that.
