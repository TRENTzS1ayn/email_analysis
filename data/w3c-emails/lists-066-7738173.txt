I think the issue is not how many people with disabilities are using the
WWW, but how many could if it was more accessible.  

I compare the WWW to a public building.  If there were no ramps into
buildings or curbcuts on the sidewalks to get to the building you will
never see a wheelchair user in the building.  If the WWW is not more
accessible to people with certain types of disabilities they will not use
it very much.  In todays information oriented society people with
disabilities ideally need to have the same access to information technology
as their able-bodied peers.
