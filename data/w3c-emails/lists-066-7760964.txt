Hello,

The editors have produced a new draft [1] of the guidelines
based on very VERY helpful reviews from a number of
people. There are some significant changes that
should improve the usability of the document. 

Not all comments have been processed yet. We will
continue to address all substantive comments by raising
them as issues either by email or at teleconferences.

If you do not feel your comments have been addressed, please
let us know as quickly as possible. If we have not
responded to your comments on the list, we may not have
gotten to them yet.

NOTE. We are publishing this document to show how
comments and WG resolutions are being incorporated.
However, this means we have essentially two
documents in last call: the original one people
were asked to review, and this internal draft.
Should reviewers (i.e., everyone) henceforth base their
comments on this draft? While I believe they should,
it is not clear in terms of the W3C Process whether
the new draft should be put on the TR page as
an updated document in last call. Judy, do you
have suggestions?
