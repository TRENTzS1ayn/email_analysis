Suppose OBJECT is supported:

  The image source is specified via an attribute.
  If the UA doesn't support that image type, or it's not available
  for some reason, the content of the OBJECT element is rendered.
  Thus, the content of OBJECT is used for providing fallback
  information.

Suppose OBJECT is not supported:

  The start and end tags will be ignored and the fallback
  information will still be rendered.
