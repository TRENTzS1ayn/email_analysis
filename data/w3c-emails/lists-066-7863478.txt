I guess I was looking for more information how the "transformation" of
documents would actually take place or be effected.  Chock it up to my
ignorance, but I am not clear how a screen reader works for web pages that
are not straightforward, linear text.  I did assume that in some cases
stylesheets or (XSL) transform sheets might get involved - I have elsewhere
heard of strategies in which some code running on some proxy would transform
general HTML documents into something suitable for things like smart phones.
I am just trying to understand all the steps involved.

This is clearer.

I am thinking of images, ad banners and other elements for which the
hyperlink highlight is not obvious.  IE5 added a "go" button because many
users were not aware they had to hit ENTER.  Much of the growth on the Web
is among new, web-naive users.  For them, it is not at all obvious that they
should click on every image they see.

In practice today (i.e. in the few docs I checked) "alt" is used on images
for text that will be rendered in a toolTip (that is not the only reason it
is specified of course).  I have seen little "title" usage.

Makes sense to discourage alt text of the form "click here" in favor of
"Click here to see joe's used cars".  "Click" is certainly tied to
mouse-drive browsers - not sure how to balance the invitation to interaction
with more the WAI guidelines.  The worst (and quite often seen) is "Click
here to find out more" - typically there when ads are inserted, and a
generic alt can be used for all ads.

Much friendlier.

Just what they do, and how they rely on "proper use..." is what I was
getting at in my request for the transform strategies overview above.
Perhaps when the other referred-to documents appear, it will all become
clearer to me...

The SMIL linking doc has some ideas on managing sounds w.r.t links - perhaps
some similar thinking would apply here?

I see - perhaps a few extra words to make this distinction would be helpful?

Hope this is useful -  Patrick
