Hello,

Here's a proposal:

1) We say something like this:
   
    Non-visual users often "get lost" in lists, especially those with
    several layers of embedding and those that do not indicate the
    specific level of indentation for each item. Content developers are
    encouraged to use UL for unordered lists and OL for ordered lists
    (i.e., use markup appropriately).  However, until user agents
provide
    a means to identify list context clearly (e.g., by supporting the
    ':before' pseudo-element in CSS2), content developers should
    consider including contextual clues in their lists.

2) We talk about a CSS2 solution:

     The following CSS2 style sheet shows how to provide compound
numbers
     for nested lists created with either UL or OL elements.
     Items are numbered as "1", "1.1", "1.1.1", etc.

     <STYLE type="text/css">
        UL, OL { counter-reset: item }
        LI { display: block }
        LI:before { content: counters(item, "."); counter-increment:
item }
     </STYLE>

3) We talk about a CSS1 solution:

      Until either CSS2 is widely supported by users agents or user
      agents allow users to control rendering of lists through other
means,
      authors should consider providing contextual clues in nested 
      lists. The following CSS1 mechanism shows how to hide the
      end of a list when style sheets are turned on, and to reveal
      it when style sheets are turned off, when user style sheets
      override the hiding mechanism, or when style sheets aren't
      supported.


        <STYLE type="text/css">
          .endoflist { display: none }
        </STYLE>
       <UL>
         <LI>Paper:
            <UL>
              <LI>Envelopes
              <LI>Notepaper
              <LI>Letterhead
              <LI>Poster paper 
                <span class="endoflist">(End of Paper)</span>
           </UL>
        <LI>Pens:
             <UL>
              <LI>Blue writing pens
              <LI>whiteboard pens 
              <span class="endoflist">(End of Pens)</span>
            </UL>
       <LI>Fasteners:
             <UL>
              <LI>paper clips
              <LI>staples
              <LI>Big lengths of rope. 
              <span class="endoflist">(End of Fasteners)</span>
            </UL> <span class="endoflist">(End of Office
Supplies)</span>
      </UL>
      


  Note: This example does not help the case of wrapping
        list items. With some more effort, the author
        could put similar markup at the end of each list
        item.        

  Question: Perhaps it's also helpful to use this mechanism
            at the beginning of each list to say how
            many items are in the list. Any thoughts?

All comments welcome!!
