Hi,

I would like to comment on section 3.8 of the Web Content guidelines, at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-19990316/wai-pageauth-tech#objects

In this section you discuss guidelines for applets.  The subsection titled
"Directly accessible applets" provides two links for more information on the
topic (to "[JAVAACCESS]", a Trace website, and "[IBMJAVA]" an IBM website),
but does not itself contain any language directing users on what techniques
to use to create these accessible applets.  

I think this subsection should be amended to specifically include the key
language on the topic, and refer to external web pages for readers to get
more detailed information and guidelines (e.g. the IBM page, and of course
the two pages on the Sun web site, 'www.sun.com/access' and
'java.sun.com/products/jfc').  Specifically, I think this subsection should
include language along the lines of:

 "To create an accessible applet, you must ensure that the applet supports
  the Java Accessibility API [link here to http://java.sun.com/products/jfc]
  This API is built into the Java Foundation Classes from Sun Microsystems,
  and can also be implemented directly by applets that aren't created 
  using the Java Foundation Classes.  Therefore, applet developers should
  either build their applets using the Java Foundation Classes, or otherwise
  implement the Java Accessibility API on their own.  

  For more information about accessible applets..."

Also, please consisder including an example Java applet which is accessible
(or at least a link to one).  The "SwingApplet" example that comes with the
Swing package is just such an applet (a minimal accessible applet)  I've
attached source to SwingApplet, as well as a web page that invokes it using
the Java Plugin (which is necessary for accessibility support until browsers
support JDK 1.2 directly).


Thanks,
