About three hours ago I emailed a revised version of the 3/16 guidelines to
the Editors and Chairs. 

I have just finished posting the document to a Web site. You can access it
through the following address: http://etsr.digitalchainsaw.com/wcagpub/

I consider a number of issues very important, some of which are now listed at
that address.

The address is temporary and the contents at the address may change.
