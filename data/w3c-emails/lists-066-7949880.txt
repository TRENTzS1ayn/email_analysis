Change:
8.3 For pages that use style sheets or presentation markup, ensure that the
content of each page is organized logically.

To:
8.3 Ensure that the content is organized properly [1], including content
that uses style sheets, presentation markup, applets, or programmatic
objects [2]. [Priority 1]
This makes it more likely that the content will be understood even when
styles are turned off, overridden by the user, or unsupported by the user
agent. Provide equivalent content and descriptions that are organized
properly [1] for applets and programmatic objects [2] so they will be
understood even when they are turned off, overridden by the user, or
unsupported by the user agents.
Techniques for checkpoint 8.3

[1] add a link to "Guideline 5. Use markup and style sheets properly."
[2] add a definition and a link to the definition of "programmatic objects"
