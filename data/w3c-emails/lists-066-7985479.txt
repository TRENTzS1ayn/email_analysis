Add a definition and a link to the definition for the term "natural
language" and include in the definition a phrase such as "national spoken
or written languages such as French, English, and Japanese." Also include
in the definition a link to the "lang" attribute spec in HTML 4.0 and ISO
definitions en, en-us, etc.
