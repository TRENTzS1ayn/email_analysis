It seems I may have caused some confusion.

I understand that LONGDESC is implemented in IE5, so you could look at it
there. I imagine it could also be implemented by a browser like Lynx in
the same way that it provides optional links to images themselves.

Blynx and Tiny are two browsers which provide an accesskey mechanism,
although it is not author-specified but auto-generated.

  Sorry for any confusion.  I was talking about elements / attributes that
  are in HTML 4.0, in particular Longdesc, Accesskey and Header + ID.
  
  Now I'm confused about whether or not is known how Longdesc is to be used:
  Wendy says it is not known and the UA group are looking into it, and
  Charles says it is known!
  If it is known, I think 2.7 of the Techniques could briefly describe, for
  example, how a screen reader might inform a user of the presence of the
  link, and whether this would differ for images, scripts or applets.
  If it is not yet known the Techniques could say that this is under
  discussion and describe how it is expected to be used.
  
  Regarding Accesskey: from previous discussions it seems that this is
  currently supported more widely (by mobile devices, I think).  It would
  also be useful to have a brief description of how a screen reader might
  inform a user of the presence of Accesskeys, and how the user might
  interact with them.  I assume the interaction with Accesskey depends on
  which element it is used with.
  
  Regarding Header & ID for Tables: I don't know whether these are currently
  supported by any type of device.  If they are not, is it known how they are
  likely to be used?  As I have suggested above the Techniques could have
  either a description of how they are used, or are likely to be used.
  
  I think all this would help authors in both how such elements should be
  implemented, and understanding how users of different browsers and
  assistive technology interact with elements.
