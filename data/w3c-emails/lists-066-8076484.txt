Hello,

Here is a proposed agenda for today's teleconference:

1) Review the attached list of proposed changes.
2) Continue through the list of outstanding issues [1] 
   (many of which are addressed by attached proposals).
   I will be augmenting the issues list throughout the 
   day as I process email.

WHEN:  March 22, 4:00pm - 5:30pm (GMT -5)
WHERE: +1 617-252-7000 (Tobin bridge)

  Regrets: Wendy.

Proposed changes to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

Reference document [1]
[1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-19990316

1) To clearly indicate the division between author responsibility
   and user agent responsibility:

   a) All checkpoints involving interim responsibility from
      authors will contain the wording "Until user agents ..."
      These checkpoints are: all of guideline 9, all of guideline 12,
      checkpoint 15.4 (group related links), and 1.7 
      (Provide redundant text links for each active region of an 
       image map.)

   b) For each checkpoint, include the "until" wording since
      checkpoints may be read on their own. It is not sufficient
      to say it in the guideline rationale.
 
   c) Include an explanation of what "Until user agents..." means.
      Proposed text:

   <BLOCKQUOTE>
    In some of the checkpoints below, content developers are
    clearly the best candidates for ensuring accessibility.
    However, there are times when user agents would be the better
    choice. Unfortunately, not all user agents or assistive
    technologies provide the accessibility control users require
    (e.g., some user agents may not allow users to turn off blinking
    content, or some screen readers may not handle tables well). 

    To address cases where the responsibility for providing
    accessible control lies with the user agent or assistive
    technology but that control is not yet easily available, certain
    checkpoints contain the phrase "until user agents ...". When
    content developers see this phrase, they should recognize that
    they are being asked to provide additional support for
    accessibility until most user agents meet users' needs. 

    For each checkpoint with this phrase, content developers must
    consider: 
1.What is their anticipated audience? For example,
  designing for a company intranet where everyone uses
  the same browser is different than designing for the
  World Wide Web. 
2.Do those users have tools available that satisfy the
  demands of the checkpoint? 

    If the answer to the second question is yes, content developers
    are not required to satisfy the checkpoint. 

    How will content developers know when most user agents or
    assistive technologies meet specific needs? The W3C WAI will
    make this information available from its Web site (either directly
    or by providing links to the information). Content developers
    are encouraged to consult this information regularly for updates
    on accessibility support. 
   </BLOCKQUOTE>


2) Divide checkpoint 9.2 into two checkpoints. 
   Current text:
               Avoid any blinking or updating of the screen 
               that causes flicker. [Priority 1]

   Proposed change:

     a) Priority 1:  Until user agents allow users to 
                     control it, avoid causing the screen to 
                     flicker. [Add note about epilepsy here.]

     b) Priority 2: Until user agents allow users to control it, 
                    avoid causing content to blink (i.e.,
                    change presentation at a regular rate, 
                    such as turning on and off).

3) Proposed change in wording of Note in guideline 12.
   Current wording: 

         The following checkpoints apply until most 
         users are able to secure newer
         technologies that address these issues.

   Proposed wording to emphasize user agents:

         The following checkpoints apply until 
         user agents and assistive technologies address
         these issues.

4) Do references designated the latest versions
   of documents or dated versions?

   Proposed:
     a) Add a link from checkpoint 13.1 (Use the latest W3C specs)
        to the references section.
     b) In the references section, add a statement about
        where to find the current versions of W3C specs.
     c) The list of references will contain dated versions so
        that readers will know what existed when the guidelines
        were created.
     d) To each entry in the list, add a link to the latest
        version.

     /* Once the WG has made a decision, inform Misha who
        raised this issue in [2] */

5) Changes for guideline 6.

   a) In 6.3, add "including text equivalents (e.g., captions)"

6) Changes for guideline 9.

   a) All checkpoints in guideline 9 priority 2
      except for the one about flicker.

7) Changes for guideline 15.

   a) Move note about LINK relationships from 15.3 to 15.2
   b) Move 15.10 to after 15.3.
   c) Change priority level of 15.6 to 2.
   d) Merge 15.4 and 15.5 into a priority 2 checkpoint.
      Proposed wording:  
           Provide information about the general layout 
           of a site (e.g., a site map, or table of contents). 
   e) For 15.9:
      i) Add an "until user agents" statement.
     ii) Add more rationale (e.g., performance)
    iii) Proposed wording: Facilitate offline browsing.

8) In Abstract, make clear that this is a reference document
   and that for more information, readers should consult the
   EO Web site.

9) Add a definition of "assistive technology" to the glossary.

10) Add a section about document conventions to "How the
    guidelines are organized". This includes:
   a) Element names are uppercase.
   b) Attribute names are quoted lowercase.
   c) Describe linking conventions.

11) Discussion of browser support for elements and attributes
   is outside the scope of this document. Need help from
   WAI CG and Web Characterization Activity.
