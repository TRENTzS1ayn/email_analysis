It was not too late at all! Thanks for the comments.

Some of your comments were resolved at the 17 March teleconference [1],
some at the 11 March teleconference [2].

Others were discussed during an 18 March telephone call that will
be the basis of discussion during the 22 March teleconference [3]

The guidelines should not refer to specific implementation issues
since they are meant to be abstract. The Techniques document will
provide some information about where browser details may be found.

 Resolved in [2], item 5.

Resolved in [2], item 5.

Discussed 18 March, see [3].

Discussed in [2]. Priority kept as 2. Wording changed to:

   Use header elements to convey logical structure and 
   use them according to specification.

Discussed in [1]. Not an editorial issue but one of markup, so
resolved wording:

        Mark up lists and list items properly.

Discussed in [1]. Decided to keep Priority 2 with some
additional rationale.

No minuted discussion. Leaving as Note in section 9:

         The BLINK and MARQUEE elements are not defined in any W3C 
         HTML specification and should not be used.

Discussed 18 March, see [3].

(Guideline 11 in [4]).

I don't know that having an "A" around an object is a basic
requirement for elements that take input.

a) What about forms?
b) In other user agents such as Opera, you can navigate to every
   element.

I'm not sure what's being requested here.

This was discussed in [1] and [3] and the results are:

a) Checkpoint 5.1 will read:
        Use header elements to convey logical structure and use 
        them according to specification. 

b) After discussion of [3], a new checkpoint in guideline 14
   should read (and refer to headings as an example):
         Divide large amounts of information into 
         manageable groups where natural and
         appropriate.

During [3], we discussed creating a new checkpoint about
organizating information. Your comment about FIELDSET
is subsumed by the new checkpoint, which is priority 2.

Yes. This was discussed at [1] and we decided  to word checkpoint 15.1
as follows: Clearly identify the target of each link. We will add
that "title" may be used in addition to clear link text to make
links understandable outside of context.

Yes, we can use this information - removing browser-specific
information - in the techniques document.

This was discussed in [1]. Resolved:

 * Use W3C technologies and use the latest versions 
   when they are supported. [Priority 2]

This was discussed in [1]. Resolved:

 * Avoid deprecated features of W3C technologies. [Priority 2]

Discussed in [1]. Resolved to create a single checkpoint
that has to do with grouping (priority 2).

I will add this to the issues list.

The techniques document will discuss this.

I will add this to the issues list.

The guidelines[5]  now say to use the "summary" attribute for this.

Here's the checkpoint in question in [5]

      For data tables, identify headers for rows and columns. [Priority
1] 
           For example, in HTML, use TD to identify data 
           cells and TH to identify headers. 

What does "abnormal" mean?
 
> A.9.3 I'd recommend listing a third alternative mechanism, something simpler

In [5], this checkpoint (8.2) reads:

 For scripts that present important information or 
 functionality, provide an equivalent. [Priority 1] 
         For example, in HTML use NOSCRIPT or a server-side 
        script that outputs the equivalent. 

 a) Would links appear within a NOSCRIPT or outside of it?
 b) What would the links refer to? If it's an alternative page,
    this is covered by 13.4, which is referred to from checkpoint 8.2

Done.

Agreed. The wording "until user agents ..." has been added.
 
> B.3.1 Seems very unrealistic.

  a) This checkpoint (16.1 in [5]) currently reads):

           Use language that is clear and simple, 
           yet appropriate for the site's content.

  b) Though admittedly subjective, this was considered very important
     by the WG to address cognitive disabilities.

> Other comments:
>

 a) Given the intentional guidelines/techniques division, I'm not sure
    this comment is accurate.

 b) We provide a zip archive and gzip archive, which the guidelines
    do say is an appropriate option for offline browsing.

Thank you for the comments Greg,
