Hello Chetz, thanks for the comments!

Instead, I propose removing the note from 1.6: 

        When replacing ASCII art with an image, specify a text 
        equivalent for the image. 

and make making a general statement in the rationale for the guideline
that reads:

      Note. When text equivalents become long
      (more than a sentence or two), shorten the text equivalent
      and add a description as well. See also Guideline 2.

Added.

The section on brief descriptions has been removed.

Added.

Yes, it has been fixed.

I will raise this as an issue with the WG.

Thank you,
