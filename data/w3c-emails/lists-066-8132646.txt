I originally sent these comments to the wrong list.

Is there a way we could add a general section to the Web Content guidleines
on indicating the purpose of certain elements.  For example the following
types of elements could indicate their purpose:

Anchors: navigation link
Table: layout or table
Event: decorative, used for visual affects
       verify, checks the user input, but no visual affects
       functional, is used to change content of the document
