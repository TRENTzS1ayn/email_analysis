Jon,

There are two mappings at issue here:

1) For an HTML element, what topics are related to it?
   This is addressed by the HTML index in the Techniques Document.
   For example, for the A element, the related HTML topics are
   "Keyboard Access" and "Links"

2) For a topic, what HTML elements/attributes are involved?
   I think that the table of contents combined with the
   HTML index covers this need as well (although not
   as efficiently).

For more information about elements or topics, I think that
users should consult the HTML specification, which describes
and defines them much better than the Techniques document could.

Another option is to provide a real index, which the Editors
are considering. However, that would not be done until the document
goes to Proposed Recommendation.

Please let me know if I've addressed your point adequately,

 - Ian
