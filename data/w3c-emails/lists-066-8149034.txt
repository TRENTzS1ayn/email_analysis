Proposed editorial clarification:

     For an audio description of a visual presentation (e.g., movie)
     that already has an auditory track:

       * synchronize the audio description with the auditory track,
      
       * collate a text version of the audio description with a 
         text version of the auditory track (caption).

I will add this information.

Perhaps something like, "Some technologies, such as SMIL and SAMI, allow  separate audio/visual files to be combined with text files via a synchronization file to create captioned audio and movies...".

Ok.
