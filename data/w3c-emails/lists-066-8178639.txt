Can you list cases very specifically where you think
"screen reader" should be used instead of a different term?

Would it be sufficient to delete "(e.g., a braille display)"
from the following excerpt from 10.1:

     "someone who is using the page without sight, with voice 
     input, or with  a keyboard or who is using an input device 
     other than a mouse (e.g., a braille display) will not 
     be able to use the form."

Or should we reconstruct the sentence?

  I believe this is covered by checkpoint 1.7:

    Povide redundant text links for each active 
    region of an image map.

  Is this not a user agent issue?

  This is covered by checkpoint 15.1:

      Clearly identify the target of each link.
