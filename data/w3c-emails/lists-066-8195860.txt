There are several axes to consider here, including:

1) The format of the "primary" information: audio or visual
2) The format of the alternative information: text, audio, or video.
3) The purpose of the alternative information: text equivalent
(function)
   or description (appearance)

So far, the WG has chosen to break up guidelines 1, 2, and 3
differently:

1)  Guideline 1 concerns visual input format,
    text alternative format, and text equivalent purpose. 

2) Guideline 2 concerns visual input format,
    text AND audio alternative format, and descriptive function.

3) Guideline 3 concerns audio input format,
    text, audio, and visual alternatives, and text equivalent
    purpose. Note that checkpoint 3.3 doesn't fit nicely
    into this is it involves "visual notification" as well
    as text transcripts.

Eric Hansen, I believe, has also commented that these three guidelines
could be restructured for more clarity. I will raise
this with the WG.

Yes! Your contribution would be very welcome!

We have removed the section on "brief descriptions" from the guidelines
document (see the minutes [1] of the 11 March conf call
where this was decided). The "title" attribute should be used in
accordance with
the HTML 4.0 specification, which says it provides advisory information.
(This statement has been added to the Techniques Document). For now,
the WG has not elected to say more about using "title" for images
in the guidelines. However, I will raise this question with the WG.

See comments above about reorganization of 1, 2, and 3. How
do video/animations differ from applets/scripts in a way that
suggests a separate guideline?

This is apparently a closed issue [2] for the WG (see
issue "Absolute Positioning". One reason that it may not be
a priority 1 issue for style sheets is that users may
override absolute units in user style sheets.

I've added a statement to the techniques document where you've
indicated to ensure that developers test their documents
with style sheets turned off.

Checkpoint 7.4 states: If a table is used for layout, do not 
use any structural markup for the purpose of visual formatting.

However, I don't think you can assume that if TH is not used,
then the table is always for layout. 

I will ask the WG to consider how the "summary" attribute is
to be used.

We can elaborate in the techniques document.

I will raise this issue with the WG.
