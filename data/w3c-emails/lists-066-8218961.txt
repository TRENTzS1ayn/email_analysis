The versions of the conformance statement in the February 26 & March 16
drafts are quite different. In the Feb 26 draft, the conformance statement
referred to documents (e.g. other guidelines, standards, etc.) or processes
(e.g., evaluation); while in the March 16 draft the conformance statement
implies a page or site. 

The proposal below separates out these two types of conformance, provides
examples of each, and slightly simplifies the language:

****

5. Conformance: 

This document defines three conformance levels:
- Conformance Level "A": satisfying all Priority 1 checkpoints;
- Conformance Level "Double-A": satisfying all Priority 1 and 2 checkpoints; 
- Conformance Level "Triple-A": satisfying all Priority 1, 2, and 3
checkpoints. 

Claims of conformance to this document by other documents (policies,
standards, other guidelines, etc.) or by processes (automated validation,
human evaluation, etc.) must:
- specify the conformance level required or implemented in the document or
process; 
- specify the title of this Guidelines document; 
- specify the URI of this Guidelines document.
Example: "This standard conforms to conformance level 'Double-A' of 'Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines' available at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-19990316."

Claims of conformance to this document by pages or sites must:
- specify the conformance level satisfied ("A," "Double-A," or "Triple-A");
- provide a link to the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) home page.
Example: "<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/WAI">WAI</A> Double-A."
