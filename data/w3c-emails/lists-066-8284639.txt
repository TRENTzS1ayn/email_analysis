Very good overall
Couple comments / suggestions

- I think that the link should be to a statement on the WAI site which
explains the purpose of the AA Rating, and the particular document that was
used to determine the rating.  The home page can in turn be pointed to from
this place... but going directly to the home page could be confusing.

- instead of
" Claims of conformance to this document by other documents (policies,
standards, other guidelines, etc.) or by processes (automated validation,
human evaluation, etc.) must:


how about
" Claims that a process (machine validation, human evaluation) or the
contents of a set of guidelines, policies or standards conform to or are
based on these Web Contents Guidelines must:


or some such.  It is a bit wordier but helps to separate this from the next
type of comformance.  You might also consider reversing the two so that the
page or site conformance is first to get that out of the way and out of
peoples heads as they read the second....

Subject:Conformance proposal re-drafted

The versions of the conformance statement in the February 26 & March 16
drafts are quite different. In the Feb 26 draft, the conformance statement
referred to documents (e.g. other guidelines, standards, etc.) or processes
(e.g., evaluation); while in the March 16 draft the conformance statement
implies a page or site.

The proposal below separates out these two types of conformance, provides
examples of each, and slightly simplifies the language:

****

5. Conformance:

This document defines three conformance levels:
- Conformance Level "A": satisfying all Priority 1 checkpoints;
- Conformance Level "Double-A": satisfying all Priority 1 and 2 checkpoints;
- Conformance Level "Triple-A": satisfying all Priority 1, 2, and 3
checkpoints.

Claims of conformance to this document by other documents (policies,
standards, other guidelines, etc.) or by processes (automated validation,
human evaluation, etc.) must:
- specify the conformance level required or implemented in the document or
process;
- specify the title of this Guidelines document;
- specify the URI of this Guidelines document.
Example: "This standard conforms to conformance level 'Double-A' of 'Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines' available at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-19990316."

Claims of conformance to this document by pages or sites must:
- specify the conformance level satisfied ("A," "Double-A," or "Triple-A");
- provide a link to the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) home page.
Example: "<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/WAI">WAI</A> Double-A."

Reactions?
