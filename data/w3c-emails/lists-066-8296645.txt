Agreed. And it probably needs a little WAI-double-A or WAI-triple-A icon to
go with it.

(By the way, what happens with screen reader read-out of A,A? Is it better
or worse than A-A, or A.A? e.g. I suppose we have to stay with double-A,
triple-A, eh? A,A would translate well into some different languages;
obviously by no means all.)

Yes, good.

Perhaps. My tendency would be to keep process & docs first, for emphasis.
