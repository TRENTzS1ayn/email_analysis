It satisfying all P-{1,1+2,1+2+3} checkpoints means that is a minimum
requirement. For a process to satisfy checkpoints depends on the process.

For example, an authoring tool might claim to be triple-A conformant if it
produced content that is triple-A (whereas I expect an authoring tool
which conforms to ATAG to have to do some other things), or a purchasing
requirement might require all websites paid for to be double-A conformant

  I'm still at lost of what that means exactly.
  
  If some organization claims that their guidelines conforms to AA for
  instance, does it mean that the best practices they advocate in their
  document "include" at least all of our AA checkpoints, or "is exactly" 
  our set of AA checkpoints ? Can they change the wording we use ?
  What does "satisfying" mean for a process ?
