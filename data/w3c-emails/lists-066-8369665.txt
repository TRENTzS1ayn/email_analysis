Yesterday's minutes [1] talk about breaking the ascii 
art checkpoint (1.6 in [2]):

    Replace ASCII art with an image or describe the 
    ASCII art and provide a means (e.g., a link) to skip over it. 

Into three checkpoints, stated briefly as:

a) Use images instead of ascii art.       (Use proper markup)
b) Provide text equivalents of ascii art. (Equivalent information)
c) Provide links over ascii art.          (Navigation)

Although breaking down the current checkpoint this way makes
sense to me, it seems to imply that any time you use ascii art,
you are not satisfying (a). That's probably why there is
currently only one checkpoint with an "or" in it. 

Unless someone wants to propose a different formulation
of checkpoint 1.6, I will leave it as is. 

Al, do you think the existing text of 1.6 should be
changed/made more precise?
