There is such thing as a "server side redirects", where the HTTP
server automatically returns the new thing in the same round-trip,
with an attached Content-Location header indicating the correct URI,
but I guess this is not what most people use (only in HTTP 1.1) and
this is getting really technical too even for the technique doc.

I'm happy if we extend the proposed wording to "use the appropriate
HTTP status code and headers".
