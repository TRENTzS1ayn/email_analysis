I guess my point is more:
1. If I am an author and using a table for layout can I explicitly mark it
as being used for layout that could be accessed by assisitve technology?

2. I think it is even more important for events.  If I am an author using
mouseover events for visual effects, can I mark this event to say that it
is probably not an important event for a non-viusal interface.
