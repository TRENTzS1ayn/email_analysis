It would help assistive technologies to be able to have a clear indication
if a table is being used for layout or data.  Some potential ways:

1. Limit the use of TH element to data tables
2. Limit the use of the CAPTION element to data tables
3. The SUMMARY attribute starts with the would "layout" or other key word
4. Something else
