Jaap,

Good to hear from you.  Your comments on interactive pages were discussed
in the working group telecon yesterday and I took the action to write up
the discussion.

We believe most of these concerns are addressed by the checkpoints under
"Guideline 6. Ensure that pages featuring new technologies transform
 gracefully."  However, when it comes to spurious stopping places in the
tabbing sequence, the User Agent guidelines are involved, too.  The User
Agent working group is developing guidelines on navigation inside the page
that address knowing what places to stop and where not to stop.  For
suitable navigation stops, including genuine links, the Web Content
guidelines require them to be self-explanatory, to let you know why you are
stopping there.

Some unnecessary anchor tags are indeed placed around scripts to make the
pages work with current browsers.  This is discussed in 
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999JanMar/0322.html>.
When the browsers implement the User Agent guidelines this misuse of markup
will no longer be necessary.
