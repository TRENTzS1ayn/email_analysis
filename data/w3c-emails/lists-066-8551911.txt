[If I understand the way this came out]

a) The proposed recommendation will not define any HTML extensions such as
predefined class="nav."

b) The proposed recommendation does not explicitly or implicitly say
anything about whether such a technique is appropriate or inappropriate.

c) This class of technique is sufficiently controversial so that the chairs
did not want to include it in something bearing the PR declaration of
working group decision.

d) There is motivation under various of the guidelines that _are_ in the
Proposed Recommendation for techniques which would employ such predefined
names.

e) The techniques are not viewed as frozen with the checkpoints.  It is
appropriate for the techniques to evolve and for novel techniques to be
initiated by the User Agent Working Group, particularly if it is believed
that User Agents and Authoring Tools can and will implement them.
Coordination with the authoring tools community is a key ingredient in a
successful proposal in this area.

If I recall correctly, this is in essence the answer on all three points
you questioned.

As above.  The Web Content guidelines do not predefine any such code.  It
is still possible for the User Agent guidelines to introduce such a technique.
