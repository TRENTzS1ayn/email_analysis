If markup indicating element function is not in Web Content guidelines then
I think it will be meaningless to define it in UAs.  Authors will not be
looking in the UA guidelines on how to develop Web Content.

JRG: I don't understand this.  I would think that any information about
grouping or function that would improve accessibility for people with
disabilities would be appropriate.
Why did the group make this decision?  
Issue 26 states that there was a resolution to include at least class="nav"
in the techniques document.
It seems to also be mentioned in issue 83

If not class is there no other markup available?

JRG: This seems to contradict statement b in this e-mail.

JRG: Is this a chicken or an egg problem?  I think this solution will make
the process less efficient for the other groups, since now all of Web
Content discussion on these issues will now be duplicated in both UA and
AU.   I thought these issues were going to resolved in GL, apparently I was
wrong.  

Has anybody discussed the process for transfering these issues to the other
groups for resolution?
