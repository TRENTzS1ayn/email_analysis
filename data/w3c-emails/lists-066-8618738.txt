I agree that we should be thinking in this way, and that this will be even
more important for XML. I also think that it much more important for XML
than it is for HTML that we make it extremely clear that kludges such as
using tables for layout are unacceptable, since they compromise the use of
well-designed language, which in the long run is extremely detrimental to
accessibility.

  I don't think the guidelines should not be neutral on the issue of marking
  certain elements for semantic function or relationships.  I think the
  guidelines should indicate that this is an important way for improving
  accessibility for some types of disabilities.  The details of how to
  indicate relationships and function, I agree should be in a techniques
  document.  I think semantic function and relationships will even become a
  more important issue as XML usage  increases.  I think it would be a good
  idea to get people thinking this way.
