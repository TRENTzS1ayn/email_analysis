when i visited

<URL:http://members.aol.com/criptrip/alt_bart_page.html>

with ms ie 4.5 for the mac with jscript and images disabled and css enabled
(my default settings) i was unable to view the contents of

<URL:javascript:showNavigationBar('navigationBarDiv')>

or

<URL:javascript:showNavigationBar('textNavigationBarDiv')>.

i went into ms ie's preferences and turned on jscript and then selected
each link.  the problem i encountered here was the text that appeared after
clicking on either link overlapped the original text on the web page making
it very difficult to view.
