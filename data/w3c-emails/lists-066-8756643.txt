Because the enclosed news article discusses US legal challenges arising out
of the Americans with Disabilities Act against web sites not incorporating
accessible design, I would like to clarify a point.  ADA legal challenges do
not require intentional discrimination.  The fact that the act occurred is
enough to prove a violation of a US civil right.  

In the case of inaccessible web page design, the fact that an inaccessible
website was posted is enough to prove disability discrimination.  It is
imperative that entities implement policies and procedures to enable the
removal of barriers at websites.  A good faith effort will be helpful in
defending ADA complaints against inaccessible websites.  But more
importantly, it makes good business sense to ensure compliance with the ADA
requirements for "effective communication" compliance.  As discussed in my
paper "Applying the ADA To the Internet:  A Web Accessibility Standard"
http://www.rit.edu/~easi/law/weblaw1.htm , the benefits of accessibility
extend beyond the community of disabilities.

The City of San Jose welcomes the W3C WAI Proposed Guidelines and encourages
the W3C members to approve these guidelines so that the the global digital
economy can truly be a marketplace for everyone, regardless of age,
disability or the limitations of their computer equipment.

>   The World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, is an industry group    
>   that develops technologies used for the Web. Its hundreds of   
>   members include AT&T, America Online, IBM, Microsoft and       
>   SAP. Implementation of the guidelines is subject to member

>   The guidelines discuss accessibility issues and provide        
>   accessible design solutions. For example, one way to make      
>   Web sites more accessible is by using style sheets to          
>   control font styles and eliminating the font element. This     
>   gives hypertext markup language (HTML) authors more control    
>   over their pages and makes those pages more accessible to      
>   people with low vision.                                        
>                                                                  
>   Another guideline explains how content developers can make     
>   images accessible by providing a text equivalent that states   
>   the purpose of the image. This would allow a blind Internet    
>   user with a speech synthesizer installed on his computer to    
>   understand the function of the image. The total cost to the    
>   Web site designer has yet to be established, Brewer said.

>   Other groups are also pushing for improved accessibility on    
>   the Web. Disabilities Information Resources, a Trenton,
