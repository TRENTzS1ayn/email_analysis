I don't agree with your conclusion. 
There is no markup that is misused for formatting effects.

This was hotly debated in the HTML WG that
produced HTML 4.0. The wording we came up with was the following:

   > Visual user agents must ensure that the content of the 
   > Q element is rendered with delimiting quotation marks. Authors

The idea was to be forward looking for this element.
So, until user agents support proper rendering of Q, you shouldn't use
it.

My conclusion: Don't use Q and you will be compliant.

Yes we are. Your continued comments are welcome.
