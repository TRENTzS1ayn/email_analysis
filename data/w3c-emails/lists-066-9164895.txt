In defence of Adam's reading of the guideline, it starts with the positive
injunction, _Mark up quotations_.  In plain English, this clearly means "if
the text is a quotation, mark it up with BLOCKQUOTE or Q."

I agree that it is sensible to apply the "until user agents" principle here
to permit the user of "" in lieu of <Q></Q> in this case, but it takes a
language lawyer to discern this.

In other words, I think this should be treated as a case deserving a formal
interpretation (whatever the process is for those).
