The task of this working group is to write clear, accurate and
comprehensive guidelines; that of the Education and Outreach working group
includes introducing these concepts to a non-technical audience. The two
requirements should not be conflated. Of course, if there are significant
ambiguities in the guidelines and/or techniques document, they ought to be
remedied in the next version, but as Al has argued, the priority system
serves two purposes: it defines the conformance levels and provides a
gradation of requirements depending on their impact upon people with
disabilities. No one has yet proposed a simpler system that would satisfy
these requirements. I think the question should be: is there any aspect of
the existing definitions which would not be clear to an attentive and
intelligent reader?
