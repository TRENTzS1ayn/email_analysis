Al has indicated that there is a need to provide "formal interpretations"
of those aspects of the guidelines which can be readily misconstrued. I
would like to suggest that the techniques document offers a useful
opportunity to point out relationships among guidelines and aspects of the
requirements which warrant clarification. Thus, where necessary, the
paragraph of the techniques document devoted to each checkpoint could be
followed by a further paragraph of explanation or clarification, in those
cases where no error has been found to exist in the guidelines themselves,
such as would need to be treated as an erratum, but there nonetheless
exists a subtlety that might be missed by the casual reader.
