rob>sorry, but i think "attentive and intelligent reader" is a small subset
of the overall audience, which includes artist, writers, editors, database
designers and administrators, programers, coders, system administrators,
line managers, supervisors, and senior managers (all of whom may or may not
have a web background).

but to answer, your question, yes.

have we identified the target audience?  maybe it is time to consider,
"guidelines for dummies"?  If we build it, they will come and embrace it.
