i think manager and developers that i encounter would brush off a document
with the word guideline.  This term is associated with a company or federal
agenct or office's guideline.  That is, everyone modifies a document to
build guidleines.

However, everyone understands the seriousness of standards and
specifications.

Jason, appreciate the good discussion.

Would it make sense at this time to conduct an survey to WAI-IG or others to
solicit their opinion on the guidelines and how they are being received?
