Rob pointed out that the use of priorities can be confusing, and Al
gave a very good defence of their use.

Further to this, the value in having the priorities spelled out for the
intelligent attentive readers is that errors in the document can be
readily identified by the large audience, and feedback given to the
working group. This relies on the reader being able to discover why the
checkpoint is there.

The purpose of having multiple conformance levels in a single document
is to provide some guidance to developers who are unable to implement
triple-A conformance straight away, and want to know what are the most
critical things, and to give an idea of the severity of the problem
addressed.
