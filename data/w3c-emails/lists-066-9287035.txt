JW:: "...it defines the conformance levels and provides a
gradation of requirements depending on their impact upon people with
disabilities."

WL: These are *GUIDElines* and the word "requirements" refers to the
application of some conformance ratings to particular instances.  The
same attitude as Jason expresses in "is there any aspect of the existing
definitions which would not be clear to an attentive and intelligent
reader?" should also apply to the authors' efforts to provide
accessibility reasonably, not as to whether they achieve a particular
grade. Having the guidelines followed blindly (pun intended) may not be
the goal - we are seeking accessibility, not compliance; advice for, not
control over. Even just E & O's quicktips card pointers, if heeded,
would make a huge difference.
