JC:: "This plainly does not help those with cognitive difficulties
why is the opposite not mentioned ie providing pictures and sounds?"

WL: It is "mentioned" but since there is no *widely useful, acceptable*
way to do it objectively there is nothing to do but hold these kinds of
discussions and hope that something useful develops - as of now there is
not universally understood graphical communication method - your
KFS/chopsticks example is almost enough proof of that.

JC:: "...are we just identifying what is possible?"

WL: Absolutely.  That may be unfortunate and deplorable but dealing in
the *not possible*(yet?) may get grants but it won't feed the bulldogs.
