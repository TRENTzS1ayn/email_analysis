RN:: "...maybe it is time to consider, "guidelines for dummies"? "

WL: There is probably nothing in copyright law to stop you from taking
that as an action item!  I'm sure it would have a much wider audience
than the *real* guidelines.  Go get 'em Rob. In fact when you are doing
the highly estimable job of talking to groups about this, it pretty much
is what used to be called "popularizing" for particular audiences.  It
is far too much to expect of those in the instant working groups to
desert our "ivory towers" but it's clear that it wants doing.
