At an early stage in the development of the guidelines it was decided that
examples should be contained either in the techniques document, or in a
sample web site that would be supposed to illustrate the techniques. The
techniques document has been well prepared by the editors, but to my
knowledge, no one has yet constructed a sample web site, and indeed it
lies entirely outside this group's charter (this is probably another
action item for EO).
