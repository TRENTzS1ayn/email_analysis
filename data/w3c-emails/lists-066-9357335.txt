I am not currently privy to decisions as to the method of communication
determined by w3c for their site.

However if you have tried flash3 it has an excellent interactive tutorial.
It is not impossible to provide text alternatives, however difficult.

SimCity as I remember, about 25 years ago was available as a text game.
Today it is used by city planners, the text version is not abandoned, just
less accessible to the majority.

The gl site does use < > and ^ someone decided these icons were acceptable.

Prefferred learning method is a user centred term referring to different
peoples chosen method of studying. Some like command line structure, others
prefer gui.
By only admitting one method wai is not accommodating a large part of the
community. It happens that non-readers are near one extreme.

It is evident that if this is to be actioned, much of the site would be
effected, including ig, gl and eo.
