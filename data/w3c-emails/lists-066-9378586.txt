JC:: "It is not impossible to provide text alternatives, however
difficult."

WL: How about "meaningful" or "widely understood" text alternatives? If
that's not "impossible" then please show an *EXAMPLE* using some
significant portion of the WAI site. We are not saying that we
*shouldn't* do it, but that we "can't" and there is still no evidence to
the contrary.  Even just using text there is a running thread about
misunderstandings in many checkpoints so that a "popularized" version
beyond the QuickTips cards has been bruted about - to go another step
and make the presentation simultaneously ideographic is, at least in
practical terms, in fact *impossible*. Please, prove me wrong.
