thread transferred from Education and Outreach Group...

In general it was felt that if a problem was easily handled by Lynx, which is
freely available for every platform I know of, then it could be regarded as
an improvement rather than an important barrier.

In light of the disucssion about non-readers in particular, I suspect that
decision should be reviewed.

  Robert,
  
  
  You may want to ask this question in the Web Content Guidelines Working
  Group. I recall they had very specific reasons for being able to
  downgrade the priority of 1.5, but can't articulate that well right now. 
  
  
  I've put it on the list of things to look over in revising the
  guidelines-- they're getting the list too.

  <excerpt>Do i see a disparity between the Web Content Accessibility
  Guidelines (WCAG) and Quicktips?
  
    
  
  WCAG 1.5 states, "Until user agents render text equivalents for
  client-side image map links, provide redundant text links for each active
  region of a client-side image map. [Priority 3] "
  
    
  
  Hmmm, why are image maps Priority 3?  When I turn graphics off, all i see
  is the main alt tag for the graphic.  Since text links are required, I
  would have thought a develpoer must require text links for image maps and
  therefore would be Priority 1.
  
    
  
  Quicktips state "Image maps. Use client-side MAP and text for hotspots." 
  Shouldnt we add text redundant links?  I was using this for a while and
  then re-realized that text links are needed - turn off graphics!
  
    
  
  comments?
  
    
  
  once we are finished reviwing this comment, can pass over to the GL.
