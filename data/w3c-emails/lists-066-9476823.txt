Jonathan,

currently the way we do our site is for the staff to include keeping it up to
date and workable as part of their workload. That seems to have problems
already in how much we can do.

Actually WAI is reviewing its site, but the forum is the education and
outreach group. If you have time to provide input there as well as gl it
would be appreciated, otherwise those of us on both groups will try to ensure
that the best thinking we have in GL is put into practise on our own site.

cheers

Charles

  However if you have tried flash3 it has an excellent interactive tutorial.
  It is not impossible to provide text alternatives, however difficult.
  
  SimCity as I remember, about 25 years ago was available as a text game.
  Today it is used by city planners, the text version is not abandoned, just
  less accessible to the majority.
  
  The gl site does use < > and ^ someone decided these icons were acceptable.
  
  Prefferred learning method is a user centred term referring to different
  peoples chosen method of studying. Some like command line structure, others
  prefer gui.
  By only admitting one method wai is not accommodating a large part of the
  community. It happens that non-readers are near one extreme.
  
  It is evident that if this is to be actioned, much of the site would be
  effected, including ig, gl and eo.
