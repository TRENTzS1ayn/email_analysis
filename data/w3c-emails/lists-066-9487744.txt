although the alternative text for client-side image maps links is not shown
in IE and Netscape - they are available if you tab to them.  Thus, as well
as being available in Lynx, HPR, etc., we decided it was not a problem.  As
Jim states, however, it is an issue for server-side image maps.

Charles - why do you feel the issue needs to be reviewed in regards to
non-readers?  It seems to me that a non-reader would be using IE or NS with
images loaded.  If they are using a screen reader, when they encounter a
client-side image map the alt-text for each region will be read to them as
they tab (we have tested this and it works). 

Am I wrong to assume that a non-reader would most likely rather view the
image map graphic than the alt-text or a redundant text link for each
active region?  

One bit of confusion is that  in IE the alt-text of the image map image is
displayed as the tooltip.
