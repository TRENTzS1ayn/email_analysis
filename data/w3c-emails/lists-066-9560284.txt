Wendy suggested that we needed concrete proposals rather than a continuing
discussion regarding accessibility for non readers.

It is clear that graphical representation will 'label' both machines and
individuals, however words such as blind are equally prejudicial.

My initial suggestion is to

    Split the guidlines into human and machine difficulties.
    Identify human disabilities and iconify, blind, paraplegic....
    Identify machine types and iconify, pager, telephone, b+w...

    Provide pages of nested information priority being towards the front.
    Mouseover or clicking providing further information down to the
    technical.

    Plan an interactive tutorial, and page assessment schema.

with care the storyline (images and text) will engage people emotionally and
they will learn without being aware of it.

For reasons that I hope are obvious I have labelled this treatment:

'The Ship of Fools'.

This is one treatment, I hope members will develop an other.
