I have used Jonathan's comments where he breaks out the checkpoints
according to people and machines and applied them to the excel spreadsheet

http://www.webspots.net/WCAG_Checklist/WCAG_Matrix.xls

This might put these into perspective.  please see the worksheet
"Applicability". Let me know if you need a HTML version and I can post it as
soon as I hear back form Jonathon on this question, "Checkpopint 2 as both
People and Machines.  Jonathon, is this correct?"
