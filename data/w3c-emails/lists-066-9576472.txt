There is an interactive set of tutorials being developed already by the
Education and Outreach Group, with the development being led by Chuck
LeTourneau (co-chair o the web content guidelines group) and Geoff Freed
(Director of the National Center for Accessible Multimedia based at the
television staion WGBH in Boston, USA, and internationally recognised as a
leading organisation in its field).

There has been an ongoing process of review by that working group - details
are available from http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-eo

  Wendy suggested that we needed concrete proposals rather than a continuing
  discussion regarding accessibility for non readers.
  
  It is clear that graphical representation will 'label' both machines and
  individuals, however words such as blind are equally prejudicial.
  
  My initial suggestion is to
  
      Split the guidlines into human and machine difficulties.
      Identify human disabilities and iconify, blind, paraplegic....
      Identify machine types and iconify, pager, telephone, b+w...
  
      Provide pages of nested information priority being towards the front.
      Mouseover or clicking providing further information down to the
      technical.
  
      Plan an interactive tutorial, and page assessment schema.
  
  with care the storyline (images and text) will engage people emotionally and
  they will learn without being aware of it.
  
  For reasons that I hope are obvious I have labelled this treatment:
  
  'The Ship of Fools'.
  
  This is one treatment, I hope members will develop an other.
