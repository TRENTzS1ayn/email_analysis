The GL group decided, after much discussion, not to use MAP as a way to
group text links because it is a non-standard use of the MAP element.
Please refer to the closed issue "grouping and bypassing links" at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wai-gl-tech-issues.html#group-bypass.  MAP is
defined in the HTML4 spec to create client-side image maps - refer to
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/objects.html#edef-MAP.  

If the group would like to reopen this for discussion based on the UA
action item, then we will.  However, we need to think very clearly about
the implications.  it seems like a kludge to me.
