Some members had difficulty understanding why speech to text software was
not a solution, though an aid.

Audio tapes are no replacement for what I know as Ant and Bee stories, the
ones with occassional pictures replacing words.

The idea is to provide a demanding but not impossible environment, as people
have a range of ability, a variety of approaches is essential.

Sorry this took a while to surface.
