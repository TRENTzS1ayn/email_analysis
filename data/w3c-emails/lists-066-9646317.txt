I'd like to open this as an action item to look carefully at the HTML spec
and see. It seems like a sensible, device-independent use of a structure to
me, although it may be that the authors created an appropriate structure and
then wrote about it in a way which made assumptions about the media devices
with which it might be used.

  Please refer to the closed issue "grouping and bypassing links" at
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wai-gl-tech-issues.html#group-bypass.  MAP is
  defined in the HTML4 spec to create client-side image maps - refer to
  http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/objects.html#edef-MAP.  
  
  If the group would like to reopen this for discussion based on the UA
  action item, then we will.  However, we need to think very clearly about
  the implications.  it seems like a kludge to me.
