Any other time I would agree with you, but as a minimum "requiring CSS"
should be Priority 3 and Triple A.  The federal government is expected to
require Double A

In Priority 2, I can still use Tables from HTML and no depracated fonts to
be Double A.  You do not realize how much tables are a part of the lifeblood
for desgin and browsers have not caught up, that is presentation and layout.
Maybe in several years when people have transitioned to newer browsers and
technology has caught up, but not yet..  CSS is not the solution - we must
deal with tables and HTML for a bit longer.

As Tables are heavily used AND given CSS is not trusted AND the CSS skill
set is not there, then what would you suggest?  This is the biggest
challenge we have in the conversion of new users to Double AA.  They want to
use tables for layout and want to resize their font or use font size in
browsers.
