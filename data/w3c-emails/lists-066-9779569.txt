"One has to distinguish objectives.

The accessibility guidelines are targeted to a scenario where the objective
is to inform, and one does not care if it is too easy to understand.  This
is not ideal, just actual."

"Inform" assumes that one is communicating, And that the knowledge is being
transferred. This means that it is intended to be pedagogical, although you
claim that the guidelines are not.

Perhaps you mean to say that the audience is atypical and that is precisely
what I am objecting to.

On a more positive note I have heard that the Education and Outreach Group
are developing an alternative approach.
