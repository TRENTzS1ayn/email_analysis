I know that one can call them both instruction, but there is still a
difference to be observed.

Let me try again.  Would you distinguish between subcategories of pedagogy
to impart facts or to cultivate skills?  To cultivate skills, you want to
challenge the learner some, but not more than they can ovecome.  To impart
facts, it is not so important to create challenges along the way.

You raised the "Ant and Bee stories" as an example of good pedagogical
literature.  Because they challenge the reader a little and not too much.
I am saying that for the guidelines as they stand now, that is too
sophisticated a criterion.  

The guidelines are quite simple, and aim to avoid the worst cases where
things get really difficult or impossible.  Applying a challenge that is
not too small as well as not too large is beyond the state of consensus
knowledge of the group as it published WCAG 1.0.  It is a very real
challenge for educational materials.  But that is art beyond the
contemporary state of knowledge of accessibility.

Not what I meant.  I was talking about what kind of knowledge is, and is
not, contained in the guidelines.  Knowledge of how not to be too difficult
is contained in these guidelines.  Knowledge of how to be just difficult
enough is not.

They are going to try to make the guidelines more understandable.  But not
to change what they mean.
