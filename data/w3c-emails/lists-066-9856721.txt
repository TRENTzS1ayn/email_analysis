I completely support Alan's position and would oppose any attempt to
reduce the priority of checkpoint 3.3. On the other hand, I would suggest
that the lack of a cross-reference from checkpoint 3.3 to checkpoint 5.3
should be treated as an erratum, as it clarifies the intended meaning
without changing it.
