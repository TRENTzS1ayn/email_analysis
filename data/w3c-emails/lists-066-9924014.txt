My point of view is that MSIE's are widely distributed, and if there is a
chance of a "disastrous result" that involves locking the user's browser or
system, then it shouldn't be "recommended" to provide web access to
disabled folks, unless you can be somewhat certain that MSIE 3 users don't
include disabled folks. Otherwise, it seems you defeat the purpose of the
guidelines.

I'm coming in late on this discussion, but shouldn't that have been done
before CSS was included in the guidelines? Or was CSS developed
specifically to incorporate all guidelines? Is CSS the only way to
incorporate all the guidelines, or, as Rob suggests, are there other ways
to achieve the same goal?
