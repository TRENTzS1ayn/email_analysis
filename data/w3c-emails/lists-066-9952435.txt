CONTROVERSY FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES?  

LIVE VIDEO WEBCAST ON THE ABLE CHANNEL AT: WWW.TVONTHEWEB.COM , Friday, July

for people with disabilities?  The webcast and interactive chat will take
place on Friday, July 13th at 11:00am-1:00pm ET.

While two provisions of the act focus entirely on access by persons with
disabilities: sections 255 and 713, the webcast forum will discuss the
adequacies and controversies of the following final rule on section 255,

manufacturers of telecommunications equipment and providers of
telecommunications services to ensure that such equipment and services are
designed and developed to be accessible to and usable by individuals with
disabilities, if readily achievable.
