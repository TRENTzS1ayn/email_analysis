Proposed changes include:

  In all the specs I've worked on, we've adoped the convention
  that element names are in caps and attributes in small letters
  (and quoted).

  The term "hotspots" never appears in WCAG. But the ideas are 
  the same:


      1.5 Until user agents render text equivalents for 
          client-side image map links, provide redundant 
          text links for each active region of a
          client-side image map.

      9.1 Provide client-side image maps instead of 
          server-side image maps except where the
          regions cannot be defined with an available 
          geometric shape.
