Unfortunately there is a significant degree of misunderstanding on the
part of some contributors to this discussion. If CSS is not supported by a
browser, the style sheet will not be downloaded or applied at all, and a
default rendering of the document will be provided, based on the HTML
markup (naturally this will not include the stylistic preferences
expressed in the style sheet but will nonetheless be quite acceptable).
There are inconsistencies in implementations of CSS, but no one has
suggested that these will cause system lock-up, crashes or any of the
other adverse consequences which have been mentioned. Also, it is a
principle of the guidelines that they should not take into account any
particular browser or browser version in formulating requirements (this is
part of W3C neutrality and an attempt to maintain the universality of the
guidelines).
