There has been no evidence provided in this discussion which would justify
the inclusion of an "until user agents" kind of qualification in
checkpoint 3.3. The requirement in checkpoint 6.1 that style sheets must
degrade gracefully should be sufficient (if authors comply with it) to
avoid the types of circumstances which have been discussed here.

Sample style sheets and instructions for adapting them to local needs,
should be provided, as Wendy suggested, to facilitate compliance with
checkpoint 3.3. Also, as I have already mentioned, the W3C itself has
developed a suite of style sheets which are known to be compatible across
different browser versions.
