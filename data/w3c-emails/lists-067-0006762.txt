Substantial changes made to the charter [1] since last week:

1.  the mission statement - it is much shorter and more "deliverables" 
focused as this is our primary reason for existence.

2.  the scope - i wanted to scope our work by our intended audience and 
point out that EO produces derivative work of ours.

3. release policy - it is less mechanical and simpler.

4. participants - some rewording, but also added a link to a form [2] that 
one fills out to request membership in the group.

I think the scope section still needs some work.  Judy will be sending some 
proposed changes as well.  I think Judy secured two reviewers from the 
management team.  They're ready as soon as we are.

thanks,
--wendy
