I think the "Mission Statement" should say something like: "The WCAG are
the cornerstone of the WAI effort and provide the basis on which all the
other Recommendations depend: AU, UA, and ER." although it's heavily
addressed in section 9, might deserve up-frontness?

2.2 "documented in the Techniques document" might enjoy a better verb.

4 Deliverables #s 3 and 4 are implicitly contained or necessary for #2
to have happened so might be better included in #2.

Still think 5 is UA job - let's avoid a "jurisdictional dispute"?

8 might also be considered an integral/indespensible part of 2?

7. Schedule has "Working Drafts are available to the public, but a call
for public review has not been issued." something grammatically grating?

9.1 "Once PF has identified or worked through an accessibility barrier
with a group, we need to update our deliverables as accordingly."
grammar?
