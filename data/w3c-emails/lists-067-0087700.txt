To:"GL - WAI Guidelines WG (E-mail)"<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>


We are starting to receive requests for membership in the new WCG group
--- but it doesn't exist yet.   We are still in the draft charter stage -
and it has to be completed, submitted and approved first.  (Before we can
start accepting members)

So...

1) If you want to join in the discussions of the current GL working group --
please just join in.  No need to submit for membership.

2) Please DO look over the draft charter and membership request form for the
new WCG group - and send in comments

3) Have a very happy (and safe!) holiday.


Gregg
