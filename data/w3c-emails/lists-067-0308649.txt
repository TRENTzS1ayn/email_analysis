Hi,

A limitation of HTML, as Tim Berners-Lee has pointed out, is that
it is hard for software to extract semantic information out of the HTML
once the HTML is created.  This means that any desired transformation
based on semantic information will be very difficult.

When you're saying that you believe "the opposite is true", I believe you
are thinking in terms of non-semantic transformations.  The problem is that
semantic-based transformations will often can give better results in
a number of situations.  However, since HTML often cannot be transformed
on a semantic basis, using HTML as for information representation
has its limitations.

I believe you might have misunderstood my point about buildings.  I'm saying
that user needs in architecture are often less at a conflict.  So, it
is easier to have a "one size fits all" in a building than in  a user
interface.

While I agree that the decoupling is a very useful tool, HTML is not the only
way to decouple.  A database of HTML fragments is another way to decouple.
XML is another way.  It is important to keep in mind the range of ways to
achieve decoupling.  (Abstracting is another term to call decoupling.)

Also, I'm more concerned about imposing the "one size fits all"
approach on such web pages like personalized web pages, search engine
results, etc, where the web pages are generated dynamically.
While the "one size fits all" approach has good technical reasoning for
stored web pages, there is not the same strength of reason for dynamically
generated web pages.
