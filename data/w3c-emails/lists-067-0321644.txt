Scott,

Can you please provide a reference to Tim's statement to which you keep
referring. It seems to me that the statement is not really correct, at least
in the context here. It is possible to extract sematic inormation from
properly-coded HTML, since it contains almost nothing but semantic
information.

I think you are misunderstanding my point about the web, which is that it is
not a good solution to meet one group of user's needs by providing a differnt
presentation and at the same time ignoring the needs of most users. There is
less conflict in user needs than you seem to be making out. The conflict is
between user needs and designers who are suficiently obdurate to ignore them
for the sake of what they think is visually appealing, which is another
matter entirely.

I am not arguing against pages that can be presented according to user
preferences, I am simply arguing that the approach which says it is alright
to have a page that is badly designed and then have an alternative page for
some people is not a good approach, and saying itis preferable is to say that
it is a good idea to keep something which prevents or reduces access. In
particular where there is a provsion for one group of disabled users biut
others are then comletely ignored, it does not seem to even be an effective
approach to accessibility.

Cheers

  Hi,
  
  A limitation of HTML, as Tim Berners-Lee has pointed out, is that
  it is hard for software to extract semantic information out of the HTML
  once the HTML is created.  This means that any desired transformation
  based on semantic information will be very difficult.
  
  When you're saying that you believe "the opposite is true", I believe you
  are thinking in terms of non-semantic transformations.  The problem is that
  semantic-based transformations will often can give better results in
  a number of situations.  However, since HTML often cannot be transformed
  on a semantic basis, using HTML as for information representation
  has its limitations.
  
  I believe you might have misunderstood my point about buildings.  I'm saying
  that user needs in architecture are often less at a conflict.  So, it
  is easier to have a "one size fits all" in a building than in  a user
  interface.
  
  While I agree that the decoupling is a very useful tool, HTML is not the only
  way to decouple.  A database of HTML fragments is another way to decouple.
  XML is another way.  It is important to keep in mind the range of ways to
  achieve decoupling.  (Abstracting is another term to call decoupling.)
  
  Also, I'm more concerned about imposing the "one size fits all"
  approach on such web pages like personalized web pages, search engine
  results, etc, where the web pages are generated dynamically.
  While the "one size fits all" approach has good technical reasoning for
  stored web pages, there is not the same strength of reason for dynamically
  generated web pages.
