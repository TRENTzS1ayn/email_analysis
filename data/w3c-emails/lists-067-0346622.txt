Hi, Charles

Read through the pages on the Semantic Web.  Why is the Semantic Web needed?

I believe you might be confusing strings of text with semantic information.
They are not the same.

For example, suppose that a web page is about Chicago.  Let's say that among
links there are:

    <A src="#chicago_cows.html"> Chicago Cows </A>
    <A src="#chicago_bulls.html"> Chicago Bulls </A>

The strings of text are "Chicago Cows" and "Chicago Bulls".  Now, suppose that
the web page user wants the links related to sports to be at the top of
the page.  If a user wanted his user agent to put the links related to
sports at the beginning of the page, how would the user agent know whether
the "Chicago Bulls" link or the "Chicago Cows" links are related to sports?
The semantic information is lost when the HTML is created.

For a personalized web page, information about the category of each link
can be stored in a database.  The links can be ordered according to
whether the link is sports related or not and then the HTML is created.


Are you objecting to personalized web pages?  Are you saying that it is a poor
solution for meeting user needs?

What is your definition of "badly designed"?  I believe a beautifully
graphic personalized web page can be a good design for a large number of
users.  Why should a personalized web page have to accomodate all
users?  The more important issue is that each user gets the information
he wants in the format most easy for him to use.  I think that what
Chuck posted from the CAST web site really makes a lot of sense.
