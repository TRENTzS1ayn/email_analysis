aloha, scott!

the argument isn't over content, it's over presentation...  you can have a
database driven site that creates what to the user appears to be straight HTML,
XHTML, or XML in an unlimited range of presentational options (provided, of
course, you can actually find a browser with full support for stylesheets),
thereby endowing the individual user with the ability to choose (or create) the
presentational mode that is most suitable for that individual in whatever
situation that individual happens to find his or her self at any particular
time in any particular place... 

i don't think that any of us who have been discussing this issue with you
support a "one size fits all" approach -- as a matter of fact, i know for a
fact that i, jason, bill, marja, chuck, and charles are adamantly opposed to
such an approach...  what we have been arguing against is the imposition of a
one size fits all solution to tailoring the presentation of content to a user
based upon a profile as generic as "blind", "low vision", "deaf blind", etc....

it is nearly as indiscriminate a way to tailor content as is browser sniffing
based on a Mozilla declaration...

you are correct, though, scott, in bringing up a subject close to al gilman and
len kasday's hearts -- the necessity of encouraging authors to use semantically
sensible class, file, and object names, so that semantic information can be
gleaned from even the most conservatively coded pages...

i wish you and everyone else on list a happy, healthy, and semantically
sensible new century!
        gregory.
