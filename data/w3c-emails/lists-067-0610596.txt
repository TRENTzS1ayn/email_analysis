The new 508 guidelines are out and they chose not to use the WCAG.   We
should talk about what the implications of this are.  There will now be two
different sets of guidelines for what constitutes accessible web sites or
pages.

We should take a close look at the similarities and differences between
them.
We should also see if there is anything that should be added or removed or
reworded in the 508 regs and get those in as comments.

Should be interesting.
