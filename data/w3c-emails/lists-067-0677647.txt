 i second that, vacation!

but i tend to agree.  this is an evolving area where we become engineers who
post a product but pull it back for redesign because techolgoy cahnged or
another idea was just added, but this idea did not have the technology
support yet.  so when do we stop designing and get something down and out
the door? this is the classic trap.

we can keep on desiging but we need to also have the ability to update and
get a recommendation out faster...time to market is going to really hurt us.

just brainstorming

> Importance: High
>
> Having taken a vacation this last week, both physically and
> from the net, I've had time to consider the issues related to
> accessibility for people with cognitive disabilities.
>
> One key question I've been wrestling with has been "is this
> different than enabling access for people with other
> disabilities (e.g. those with mobility/dexterity, vision,
> or hearing impairments), and if so, why is this different?"
>

>
> Here's what I concluded:
>
>      When creating a web page that can be used by people
>      with other disabilities, we are not making the page
>      -directly- accessible to them, we are making the page
>      accessible to their assistive technologies.
>
> For example, when I create a page that can be used by someone
> who is unable to see, I am not actually creating the sound
> files and sound-based navigation structure she needs in order
> to achieve accessibility; instead, I am ensuring that my page
> interacts properly with her screenreader and/or specialized
> web browser that can provide for her what she needs.
>
> To enable access for a user without mousing ability, I don't
> have to write a keyboard driver or explicitly program a
> javascript keyboard-based interface for my page; I simply need
> to make it compatible with the user's assistive technology.
>
> However, when dealing with people with cognitive disabilities,
> I'm not dealing with the assistive technology -- instead, I've
> got to make the page *directly accessible* to the user.
>
> This puts me in the position not of a web designer seeking to

>

>      * Identify long words and mark them up with either the
>        URI of an icon or a list of related words/concepts:
>
>        <span cog:uri="http://www.kynn.com/icons/tibmastiff.gif"
>          >Tibetan Mastiff</span>
>
>        <span cog:keywords="dog, fuzzy, black, large, guard,
>          pet">Tibetan Mastiff</span>
>
>        This allows CogWeb to either download and display the
>        icon (which must be 100 x 100 pixels in size), or to
>        choose the best icon from the graphics library that
>        matches the keyword -- for example, choosing a larger
>        black dog icon (say, a Newfoundland) instead of a
>        smaller, white dog (poodle).
>
>      * Designate at least one additional web-based dictionary
>        on pages that use complex language (dictionaries
>        defined in an XML-based markup syntax):
>
>        <link cog:lexicon="http://www.kynn.com/lexicons/lex01.xml" />
>
>        Identify words or phrases that might be problematic and
>        provide links to definitions; as well, list alternative
>        text definitions inline:
>
>        <span cog:lexicon="http://www.dogshow.com/vdslex.xml#catalog"
>          cog:def="pictures of dogs" >Catalog</span>
>
>
>      * Create pages where the navigation scheme is explicitly
>        designated in the markup; use the link elements and the
>        rel/rev attributes to designate relationships between
>        pages in a collection.  These relationships are displayed
>        on the tool bar -- see iCab for an idea of how this may

>
>      * Design pages which degrade gracefully when tables are
>        removed and which allow for linearization of content.
