HI Charles


Yes  we do have much of the markup.  (Nice summary)

And there are some cognitive browsers.

But have we exhausted out creativity in making browsers that take advantage
of  this markup?   I don't think so.  I think we could do much more.  (You
probably do to from your notes).

It would be interesting to create a new working group - I'll call it the
User Tools Group.  It would look at how special browsers or extensions to
existing browsers could be developed which would
make existing content more accessible.  This is beyond what we would expect
from all browsers (UA).

This could then be followed with more or better suggestions for markup.
Although Markup will have to take on a new meaning with the media and
content types we will be seeing in the future.

Gregg
