Hi Gregg,

yes, I think there is more that could be done. I would call a group for such
tools Evaluation and Reapiar Tools *grin*. And I would encourage them to work
with the RDF interest group - I think they have some of the key pieces
already.

Cheers

Charles

  HI Charles
  
  
  Yes  we do have much of the markup.  (Nice summary)
  
  And there are some cognitive browsers.
  
  But have we exhausted out creativity in making browsers that take advantage
  of  this markup?   I don't think so.  I think we could do much more.  (You
  probably do to from your notes).
  
  It would be interesting to create a new working group - I'll call it the
  User Tools Group.  It would look at how special browsers or extensions to
  existing browsers could be developed which would
  make existing content more accessible.  This is beyond what we would expect
  from all browsers (UA).
  
  This could then be followed with more or better suggestions for markup.
  Although Markup will have to take on a new meaning with the media and
  content types we will be seeing in the future.
