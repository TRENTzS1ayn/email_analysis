I believe Dan Brickley has done some work loking at this in a site-wide
context, but I assume it could as easily be applied to a single page.

  When listening to users problems about the common "where am I?" and "where

  Al pointed out that this is a broad subject and there is a lot that can be
  done. However a starting point could be simply to define a RDF page
  description or site description tag that describes in a natural language
  the navigation bars, the advertisements boxes, the frames, the search box
  etc. and their ids or other info that lets the user to jump to the
  components directly with the support of a user agent.
  
  Later we could have more exhaustive schemas of the components and ways how
  user agents could utilize them.
