I like your approach.
It seems clear that the idea of separating individual needs from assistive
technology will be central to our development and understanding.

Unfortunately the conclusions are not quite so palatable to me.

CD is not well understood, either by experts in the field or the polulation
at large.

However we can say with some certainty that whilst human designed pages are
a wonderful resource for CD clients,
current web based assistive technology is not of significant benefit in
browsing the average web page.
In particular screen readers are of very little use.

Your definition of a suitable browser is helpful and worth while.
Until it is implemented it is the responsibility of web authors to consider
whether they are excluding people with CD

I should add that I have built other browsers using VB to investigate their
potential.
I am currently in the process of transferring some of this knowledge into
javascript/css in order to try and reach a wider audience.

It mainly centers around offering clients options such as text/no text in
their face, rather than hidden.
Mild aphasia which is rather common even in the general population means
that other routes than mouse control will be central to this development.
Has anyone got a feely one working yet?
My two are still sitting in the wings.

Best wishes and thanks
