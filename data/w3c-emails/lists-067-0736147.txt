Kynn,

Hope you enjoyed your vacation. I can see you did a lot of thinking. There
are many good ideas that could be suggested to developers of browsers so
that a browser can be created to be used by those with the most
text-limited cognitive disabilities. But, in addressing this extreme end of
those in this category, you have neglected the very real and very
easily-do-able recommendation for web designers to illustrate their
pages/sites because many with disabilities in cognition, language, etc.,
need them. Your solutions still heavily depend on text which is the problem. 

It is much easier for everyone involved if web designers put some
attention to illustrating their sites, at least enough to allow effective
navigation of sites. The person designing the web is in a much better
position to know, locate, and connect what will illustrate the actual
theme/main idea of the page, than to set up some limited data base of icons
that won't likely be available to those who depend on tv web reception
anyway ... 

Incidently, providing support for tv web delivery (no choice of browser,
no speech) would be providing support for an "assistive technology" which
is used by folks I know with a CD. Not all of them, just as all visually
impaired folks don't use old comuters.
