I forgot to mention that I noticed that the linux version of netscape
navigator includes a show tool tips button.

I have only just installed it so am not sure if this would block alt text or

However I did find it within minutes of installing so its been given some

edit preferences tooltips

amazing, after a year or so I never found it in ie5.
