Jonathan

I don't understand.  Are you saying that sites like this
 http://www.peepo.com/drivethru5/) and woodcutter are what your talking
about as being what we should target?

For example:  Is this what you think the W3C WCAG website should look like
to be more accessible to people with cognitive disabilities?

I'm sure that's not what you mean - but I don't know what you do mean.
Could you help me.  I am confused as to what we are discussing.

perhaps if you prefer a less acidic experience
http://www.peepo.com/drivethru5/ fits the bill.
It's about a year old but still functions just.

The graphics leave rather a lot to the imagination.
