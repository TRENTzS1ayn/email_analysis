Do you mean when someone is really good in illustrating topics with
pictures it is also good for CD or are there some specific demands of how
it must be done?

I still don't exactly understand when that happens. Is it possible to
define it in more exact way?

A visual language needs to be learned also. Any user has problems with
icons that he hasn't learned, that's why it is usually a good idea to add
also text to the icon to give more hints. And still you need to guess or
learn it. I would think that people with CD have similar problems in
learning the icons or am I wrong? Would it make better sense to convert the
text to visual language such as Bliss etc. than to some set of images that
are selected randomly by each designer? The language users could learn
little by little and become more advanced. In addition, they could benefit
from the illustrative images created by visually more or less talented
designers. If every designer starts to create their own iconic languages I
would think that it would be confusing. But correct me if I'm wrong.
