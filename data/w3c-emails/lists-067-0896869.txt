To me a visual language is also a language and we do communicate a lot with
it. But it needs to be learned otherwise the communication is not easy as
so much need to be guessed.

This is because we very much share the same scripts. When you go to a store
or a restaurant it has pretty much the same features everywhere, which
helps the guessing enormously.

I once went to a Japanese restaurant in a little village and they didn't
speak any English, neither did they have those plastic models that they use
is turistic places. But everything went well as we shared the same script:
they showed as a table, we sat down, they gave us a written menu, we looked
puzzled but couldn't understand each other, finally I said in Finnish:
"just bring us something to eat", and they did, they looked what we seemed
to like and brought more of that, and then we got a bill and paid it.
Without the same script we would have been in trouble.

It is indeed possible if we have already learned something and we can guess
the rest. And I very much like to have visual images and use them myself.
We just need to understand that having them is not an instant cure and not
everybody understands them fluently as they don't share the same knowledge
and conventions. When films were first shown to some nothern tribes who had
never seen them before they couldn't understand them.

It will probably not be easy, some conventions are domain specific, other
conventions differ in different parts of the world. But I think writing
these down, discussing about them and reflecting them with the needs of CD
users does help. I wonder if we could use a better tool for this pondering
(something like C-SIL) so it would be easier to keep track of the ideas,
hypothesis, categories, and comments for and against etc.
