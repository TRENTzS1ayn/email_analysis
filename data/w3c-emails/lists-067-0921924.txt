Yes, communication only works if we are sharing some of the same script. But
we usually are - there is a lot of information on the web that is irrelevant
or meaningless to me, and I don't care if I have a way to understand it or
not. I do care if I have a way to know what something is about, so I can try
my scripts on it and see how to understand it.

I have a dyslexic relative who couldn't read a book in what we would call
real time until he was 25. At that age he could strip down and rebuild, with
the aid of a manual, any car engine he came across, and ran a number of large
nightclubs in Australia and China, developing training systems, management
procedures and manuals, etc.

I can stare at appropriately written Thai text for ever, but I will not have
any idea what it is about. If there are a few pictures, I will start to
understand whether this is something relevant to me, and if I want to do
something about finding out what this stuff is. It is not a perfect strategy,
but it is the difference between some level of access to the content and none
at all.

  To me a visual language is also a language and we do communicate a lot with
  it. But it needs to be learned otherwise the communication is not easy as
  so much need to be guessed.

  This is because we very much share the same scripts. When you go to a store
  or a restaurant it has pretty much the same features everywhere, which
  helps the guessing enormously.
