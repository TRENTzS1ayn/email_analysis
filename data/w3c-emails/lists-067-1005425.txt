Mozilla -- the "open-source" [sic] developed version of Netscape
which is supposed to be Netscape 6 or something -- includes something
called XUL.  XUL is a language for defining user interfaces, which
means that anyone who wants to take the trouble to learn XUL can
design custom interfaces for Mozilla, and distribute those to 
others as well.

I disagree that it's a P1.  By the UA definitions, as I understand
them, this would be a P3 or P2 at best.  However, it's an interesting
suggestion.
