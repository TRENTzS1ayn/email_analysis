Gregory,
The main issue that Scott seems to be raising, to me at least, is choosing
between one of the following choices as the main premise for the web
content guidelines:
1. Does every resource on a website need to be accessible?
or
2. Does the information on a website need to be available in at least one
accessible form?

Option 1 seems to be the current thinking of WAI in general (at least in my
mind)
Option 2 is acknowledged in Web Content with the provision of the text only
page option for complex pages and in User Agent in the documentation
section that says as least one version of the documentation must be accessible.

Do you think this is the central issue being raised by Scott?

Jon
