The answer to this question clearly depends on the scope of "need".
I don't think every Web site in the world "needs" to be accessible, 
although it would be a good thing if all Web sites were. Some 
Web sites may "need" to be accessible according to legislation or
policy.

Independent of the question of "need", according to the WCAG 1.0, all
information must be accessible. You can have 10 forms of the information
that offer the *equivalent* functionality, and 9 of them can be
inaccessible, 
as long as the 10th one is accessible (as you point out below).
