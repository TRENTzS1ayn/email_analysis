Gregory

your making me a little cross.
You are using your preconceptions about ordering to define a requirement you
know nothing about.

Links by their nature are not predictable.
That is in part the nature of story telling .

To demand that links should go to sound via text is self evidently
ridiculous for a non-readers.
You can work this much out on the fly.

I don't mean to be rude, I get driven to it.
your thinking is all too evidently that of a technician rather than a carer.
Try coding from the perspective of a non reader, and you'll realise that
LYNX is not a product they are likely to use.
In fact if they are browsing unaided its almost certain they must be using 5
or later else its not got enough multimedia to entertain.

OK we'd like our product to suit all needs, but there's precious little
suitable content about, and the great need is for product, cross
compatibility is not an issue.
