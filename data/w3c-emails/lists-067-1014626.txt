Have you looked into user interface standards (such as Apple's,
Microsoft's, etc.) enough to state that there is a lack here?

Okay...so how?

(You may encounter a lot of this from the people in this working
group -- people saying "okay...so how?"  That is because some of us
are pretty easy to convince that something is *right* and must be
done, but then we want to know *what* to do.  When you speak in
generalities you only encourage us to prod you for specifics, and
when those are not provided, some of us may get frustrated.)

Can you put it into pictures?

(This is only half tongue-in-cheek.  If you can't illustrate this
particular proposal, then there is a loss of credibility here --
if you are having problems with the words, perhaps we should look
beyond them, and if we can't do that, then it's hard to see a useful
solution ahead of us.)

Except, it's not a judgment call -to- use ALT text.  It's a judgment
call what that ALT text should be, although we have some pretty well-
defined procedures for generating ALT text from a given graphic.  (There
may be some disagreement about the specific "rules" to use, but that
itself should tell you there's a large enough body of knowledge regarding
ALT text for there to even *be* opposing views within the same camp!)

Wow, you seem pretty hung up on encountering a cat on a Virtual Dog
Show page.  Apart from your own quirkiness regarding this, can you
prove to me that it represents an accessibility hurdle for anyone?
I'd really like to know, and that's warring with my regret of ever
mentioning the VDS in this context, since you seem to have fixated
on it...

In the field of web accessibility, there are -real- accessibility
problems and there are -imagined- or -possible- or -theoretical-
accessibility problems.  For example, it's theoretically a problem
with accessibility if I don't label each language change on my
page.  (Gregory Rosmaita does a great job of labeling all his headers
as being "in latin" on his site.)  However, in practice, that 
presents few actual accessibility problems because there are few
(if any) browsers or screenreaders that deal with inline language
changes.  If he were being picky, Gregory could point out missing
labels for language changes on my web site -- but I would then ask
him, "is this just a theoretical problem or a real, tangible one?"

Likewise, I can find usability problems on web sites (something I'm
asked to do often) by claiming that some easily understood text word
could be taken for a second meaning.  Would anyone actually do that?
I may have no idea.  It may just be a -theoretical- problem in
usability.  In a usability setting, I would conduct user tests to
find out -- it's very easy, when picking nits, to fixate on something
as a usability guru that you're CONVINCED is a problem, and then find
out that the users never even considered your nitpicking!
