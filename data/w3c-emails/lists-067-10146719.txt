The very simple answer to this 'reasonable cost' argument is that not
everything needs to be available for cognitive diffficulties.

One transparent page in a thousand would be a huge advance.
Linking suitable sites, both actually as in webrings, and via meta tags will
provide more than a magnitude in improvement.


It would in the main benefit producers as it forces them to clarify their
objectives.
