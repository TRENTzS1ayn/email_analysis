Anne,

I think Gregory's point is that we should be looking for model pages/sites
that meet your and Jonathan's expectations that are *ALSO* P1 compliant.
There is not much virtue to addressing cognitive issues if such
accommodations break the pages for other users.

I would also point out that text equivalents (i.e., machine readability)
will still be important for the next- next-generation of browsers.  Those
products could incorporated significant artificial intelligence that
provides highlighting of salient points and selective self-voicing prompts,
hints, and guides.  The very thing you wrote about doing as a human looking
over the shoulder of one of your clients!  Those smart user agents will
gracefully handle text long before they can deal effectively with graphics.

If this discussion is going to be productive, someone who is a content
expert in this field (i.e., you or Jonathan) needs to lucidly address Gregg
V.'s last question:

> 2) encouraging the use of graphics on a page  and
