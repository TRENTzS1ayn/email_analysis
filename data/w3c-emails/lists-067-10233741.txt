aloha, bruce!

you are quite correct  in surmising that, quote
Gregory's point is that we should be looking for model pages/sites that 
meet your and Jonathan's expectations that are *ALSO* P1 compliant. There 
is not much virtue to addressing cognitive issues if such accommodations 
break the pages for other users.
unquote

we should also be lessoning with the EO group to ensure that when pages 
that meet the needs of one group, but fail to meet the needs of others, are 
identified, the maintainer or the page or site can be contacted and offered 
concrete advice on how to make the page more universally accessible -- 
perhaps using positive publicity, via the WAI's proposed gallery of 
accessible sites, as the carrot to dangle from the end of our stick!
