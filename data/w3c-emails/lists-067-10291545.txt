  I now have 2 feely mice, due to the kindness of the manufacturers.
  They have not yet been launched in the UK.
  I have also upgraded to windows 98.
  
  However USB is getting me down.
  I am not sure if my port never worked, if its the mice, the software, me or
  what.
  
  Has anyone out there got one of these blessed things to work?
  
  Its not just my clients who'd benefit from a feely web, spiders rely on it,
  and a few friends are desperate to have a go.

  just so you don't all think its off topic, when/where do the guidelines
  extol the necessities of providing feely sites for people (like me(oops))
  who prefer this form of comms.
