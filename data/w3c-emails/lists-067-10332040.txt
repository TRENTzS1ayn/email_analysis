A couple of extra points. 

The text-only version is not, in general, an accessible version - it is
another of the 9 variants that might be useful for some purposes. Which is
why WCAG says "an accessible alternative version", not a "text-only version".

Having ten versions introduces a potential level of complexity to navigating
a site (as a user) that could in itself provide a barrier to use.

  Independent of the question of "need", according to the WCAG 1.0, all
  information must be accessible. You can have 10 forms of the information
  that offer the *equivalent* functionality, and 9 of them can be
  inaccessible, 
  as long as the 10th one is accessible (as you point out below).
