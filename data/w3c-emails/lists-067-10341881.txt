Hi,

Observation:  A blind person starting to use a new page can have an
experience similar to entering an unknown room.  In each case, the blind
person has to kind of "grope" around to get a sense about what is there.
The problem with this exploration is that they can miss things or give
up too soon.

Javascript approach:  If the browser supports Javascript, have the web
page designed for blind users assign a key to displaying an alert box
listing the main semantic sections of the web page.  At the very
begining of the page there can be a brief note mentioning the key and
describing its purpose.  The advantage to using the key is that the
blind user can be looking at any place on the page and just pop up the
alert box without moving from the current location on the page.

Non-javascript approach:  If the browser does not support Javascript,
have the web page designed for blind users list the page's key semantic
sections at the beginning of the page.  An advantage to putting the list
at the beginning of the page is that the user knows where the location
without needing to search through the page.

Scott
