Hi, Charles

Maybe I'm missing something.  The web offers people much information and
various web pages are architected to help people make all kinds of
decisions.  The impression that you're giving is that there is
absolutely no way that a web page can help a person easily decide on the
optimum format for them.  We got some pretty smart grad students here at
Berkeley.  I'm sure one of them could come up with some clever ideas if
need be.
