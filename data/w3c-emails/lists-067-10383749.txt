I don't read that in Charles' comments. In fact, from what I understand
of Charles' statements in the past, the goal is precisely to design
Web pages that allow people to choose a format that's best for them,
by 'transforming gracefully'.

However, some information encoded in today's technologies transforms
less gracefully than others, so we provide alternative formats to
convey it to different audiences.
