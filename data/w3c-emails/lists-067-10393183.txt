Hi,

Observation:  Sighted users can easily jump back and forth on a web page.
They can note something they are interested in, continue reading/scanning
and then return back to the item of interest.  Forward and backward scanninf
on a web page can be more time consuming or frstrating for blind users.

Javascript approach:  Have the web page designed for blind users
provide a key-based mechanism for scrolling from semantic section
to semantic section.  The following functions should be provided
by the keys:

    1.  scroll to next semantic section

    2.  scroll to previous semantic section

    3.  scroll to first semantic section

    4.  scroll to last semantic section

    5.  scroll to beginning of the current semantic section



Non-javascript approach:  On the web page designed for blind users,
place a heading at the beginning of each semantic section.
After each heading provide these three links:

    1.  link to previous semantic section

    2.  link to next semantic section

    3.  link to the list of semantic sections at the beginning of the page

Also, make each entry in the list of semantic sections a link to that
specific semantic section.


Scott
