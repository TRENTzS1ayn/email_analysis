Hi,

Observation:  Blind users can have problems navigating in a group of
related radio buttons or a group of related checkboxes.

Approach:  On a web page designed for blind users, use a drop-down box
instead of a group of radio buttons or a group of checkboxes.
One advantage is that the blind user can more quickly move past the
drop-down box than the group.  Also, if the drop-down box is in
single choices mode, it can be easier to identify the current choice
without having to check out each radio button.  If the drop-down
box is in multiple choice mode in order to replace a group of checkboxes,
be sure to indicate in the label for the drop-down box that multiple
choices are allowed.

Note:  If the radio button or the checkbox are singlets, the drop-down
box is not needed.

Scott
