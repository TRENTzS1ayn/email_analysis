Hi, Rob

Actually, this isn't that bad.  The name of the key being used is
listed at the very beginning of the page so that it need not
be a standard key.

However, a standard key would be desirable if possible.  There are only
two browsers which support Javascript.  I've found that the ctrl-z key
works on both for this purpose.  It might mean doing some outreach
to the browser developers to ask that the ctrl-z key be kept free.

If this isn't possible, the second approach, though less desirable would be
to identify a particular key per browser.

PS  A trick I've used when coding keyboard events in Javascript is to use a
look-up table to convert keys into functions.  It makes the code much simpler to
change.  It also supports multiple versions of keyboard events.
