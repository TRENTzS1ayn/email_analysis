Scott,

not at all. I am sure there are plenty of people who can build good
decision-making support systems. The point is that without them people may
not be able to navigate the large range of choices available in a system of
the type being proposed. Not an insurmountable problem, just something to
bear in mind. The same issue arises with the ability to negotiate content
types, or to create personalised styling.

  Hi, Charles
  
  Maybe I'm missing something.  The web offers people much information and
  various web pages are architected to help people make all kinds of
  decisions.  The impression that you're giving is that there is
  absolutely no way that a web page can help a person easily decide on the
  optimum format for them.  We got some pretty smart grad students here at
  Berkeley.  I'm sure one of them could come up with some clever ideas if
  need be.
