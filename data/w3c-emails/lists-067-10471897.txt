If this is so, then the guidelines will remain seriously flawed and could
be easily overturned by a court challenge. (The cognitively disabled
population itself is not now overly litigious, but their
parents/families/guardians have achieved significant accommodations in the
schools through litigation. The lesson has been learned.) 

Can you provide examples of "others" which would not be aided by the
inclusion of non-text elements to aide comprehension? I have difficulty
imaging what they could be, or why there would be sufficient numbers of
such to render the suggestions "deeply flawed".
