Anne,

thank you for your comments. As these are more directly related to authoring
tools than to Web Content requirements per se, I have forwarded them to the
Authoring Tools Working group, and would request that further discussions
take place in that group.

cheers

  Your note announcing your role in the MS Office authoring tools caught my

  some suggestions to simplify user's ability to make compliant pages.
