Hi,

Observation:  If a form has more than one submit button, sometimes blind
users think they've reached the last submit button when they encounter
the reset button.  Sometimes, a web page designer may arrange the buttons
for visual effect and the reset button is not after the submit buttons.

Approach:  Always put the reset button after the submit buttons to indicate
end of submit buttons.

Scott
