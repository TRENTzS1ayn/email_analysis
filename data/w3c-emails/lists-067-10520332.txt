Hi,

Observation:  In some long forms, the web designer puts the submit buttons
in the middle of the form after the fields which are most frequently
used.  A blind user sometimes interpret the submit buttons as the end
of the form and stops there.

Approach:  On a web page designed for blind users, put some indication
that the form continues  after the submit buttons.  Also, at the end
of the form include a duplicate set of submit buttons so that the blind
user doesn't have to go back hunting for the submit buttons.

Scott
