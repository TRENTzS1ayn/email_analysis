Hi,

Observation:  On some web pages there are more than one form where
there are visual cues indicating different forms, e.g. horizontal
rules or different background colors.  The blind user can sometimes
interpret that there is one form instead of two.

Approach:  Be sure that there is enough text to indicate where one
form ends and the next begins.

Scott
