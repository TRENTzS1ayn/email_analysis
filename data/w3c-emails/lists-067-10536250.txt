Observation:  Some forms have labels to the right or below the field.
If a blind user is using a screen reader which doesn't understand the HTML
label tag, the blind user can have problems identifying the label.

Approach:  On web pages desiggned for blind users, always put the label
to the left of the field.  (In certain situations, a label for a
textarea could be above the textarea.)
