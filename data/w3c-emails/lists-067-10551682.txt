Hi,

Observation:  Forms often have blank space between lines with fields
to make them more visually appealing or readable.  For blind users,
this can increase the amount of scrolling.

Approach:  On web pages designed for blind users, try to reduce the amount of
space occupied by a form.  Using <BR> instead of <P> can help reduce
the amount of space needed.

Scott
