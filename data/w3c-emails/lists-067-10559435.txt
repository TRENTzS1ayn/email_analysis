Hi,

Observation:  Sigthed users can find fields with errors by scanning a
web page looking for error messages.  This type of scanning can be
less efficient for blind users.

Approach:  At the beginning of the web page with errors, put
a message with number of errors and a link to the first field with errors.
At each field with errors have a link to the next field with errors and
the previous fiel with errors.  Also include a notation about which
number of error field this is along with the total number of fields
with errors, e.g. (5/16) for the fifth field with errors out of
sixteen fields with errors.

Scott
