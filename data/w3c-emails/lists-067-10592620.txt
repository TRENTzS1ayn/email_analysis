Dear Anne,

I appreciated your post to Heather Swayne regarding FrontPage.  I hope she
responds.  Comments about your recent post to me are in line...

The percentage of pages that are P1 compliant that you find useless for your
needs is certainly no greater than the percentage of pages on the whole that
you find useless.  I don't think I see your point here.  I don't see a
conflict between the WCAG and needs of folks with cognitive disabilities.
The page you cited earlier as being appealing COULD very easily be made P1
compliant.  Are you publishing stuff somewhere that does meet your needs?  I
think this group would provide a great deal of help with making the pages P1
compliant without breaking their functionality from your perspective.

The appeal to "rich folks toys" is not a priority.  It is a way to reach out
to other markets that fail to appreciate how the WCAG effects more than
folks with disabilities.

This list has been very good about not giving preference to one group or
another, and I don't think it is fair to characterize it any other way.

Most of us are here as unpaid volunteers, motivated primarily by heartfelt
passion.  Your calling is not so unique.  Many of the active participants on
this list, myself included, won't be at the upcoming conference -- also
mostly for financial reasons!

I disagree with your characterization that the WCAG ignore the needs of the
cognitively challenged.  It addresses those needs as best as ANYONE has been
able articulate in writing!  He is too modest to bring it up here, but Dr.
Vanderheiden (just as one example of people on this list) has worked
directly with people with profound cognitive impairments FOR DECADES (sorry
if that makes you sound old Gregg).  He, and others, HAVE brought that
expertise and experience to their contributions on the WCAG.

Knowing what I know about "special education", I have found the sites that
you and Jonathan have put forward (PeePo included) to be somewhat
entertaining, but not generally useful -- except to a very specific
classroom for a very specific activity -- and only then with a considerable
amount of teacher/instructor/mentor intervention.  I have certainly seen
nothing that addresses in a generalizable way as to how to make sites useful
and meaningful for non-readers.

What anger have I displayed?  My apologies if I have offended you.  Please
let me know where and how.  I have not felt anger, so I don't know how I
would have conveyed that.  Like you, I am frustrated with this discussion,
but, from my perspective, that is because I don't feel like you are really
contributing anything concrete to move this particular dialog forward.

> I have, since you wrote, replied to Greg's points.

Yes, and in part you wrote (when asked to try your hand at drafting a
specific guideline or two):

I apologize if this sounds harsh, but that reads like a cop-out to me.

Would that I had the money to hire you.  I would like to be able to afford
to buy a hippopotamus too.  Of course, if I had that kind of money, I
probably wouldn't be spending it on zoo animals!

Complaining that the WCAG does not contain required sites to including
meaningful graphics is like very much like complaining the WCAG doe not
require sites to be well designed.  Sure, sites should do both things, but
that's not the point!  Site authors ARE ALREADY TRYING to include meaningful
graphics.  They ARE ALREADY TRYING to make their sites beautiful and
appealing and well designed.  THERE IS NO POINT is making
requirements/recommendations for this kind of thing UNLESS one can construct
specific tangible non-ambiguous rules, guidelines, standards or benchmarks.
The WCAG has a definite philosophy behind it (see "Themes of Accessible
Design"), but it is NOT an opinion piece.  It isn't a preachy "do the right
thing" feel-good white paper.  It is a rather mechanical and practical "how
to" (and even why) document.  It is paired with the techniques document
which is even more mechanical and technical and how-to!

If the WCAG had proposed a vague "make it accessible to all people with
disabilities" and "we don't know what exactly it is that we want, but we'll
let you know when we get it", what kind of credibility and utility would it
have?

Anne, your perspective on this issue is very valuable.  IMHO, however, your
recent posts on this thread have not been very constructive.  Please, try
drafting tangible checkpoints that address what you are looking for in a
style that is consistent with the language of the WCAG.  It doesn't have to
be perfect.

It is common knowledge that it is extremely difficult to convey in pictures
the semantic intent that is captured (usually quite well) by written
language.  This makes it quite impossible (and I hope you prove me wrong
about this) to create guidelines for achieving such a task!  Think about
Hieroglyphics as an example.  There is picture-writing for you!  Does the
use of graphics in this case make the meaning clear to someone who is
illiterate?

Having re-read this twice and edited it, I now post this.

Cheers,
Bruce
