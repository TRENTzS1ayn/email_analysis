Some would, some wouldn't. Same as sighted people. For example, some of my
blind friends are much more visually capable than I am, and some aren't. An
analgous question might be to ask whether a blind person is going to be able
to adequately describe an image - currently a P1 requirement in a number of
situations.

  Question:  Does a requirement to use graphics "when appropriate" --
  something that may not be easily done by users with visual
  disabilities -- mean that blind people are not going to be "good"
  web designers?
  
  Especially if we are going to expect them to be skilled in graphical
  user interface design and understand how to use images to communicate
  with people with cognitive disabilities?
  
  If we adopted a "use graphics" requirement as a P1, would a blind
  designer be able to meet that requirement effectively?
  
  Just thinking out loud -- don't mind me.
