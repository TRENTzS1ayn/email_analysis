Scott,

Thanks for the series of specific suggestions.

Thanks also for nicely placing each in a separate message.

Many of these look like good techniques for access rather than basic
guidelines.   Would these be for the guidelines doc? Or the Techniques doc
of the guidelines?

Thx
Gregg


PS (if you use different subject lines for different suggestions it will
facilitate discussions and threadings.  Thx.)
