RE: Paid invitation to attend.

I'd also love to attend and discuss the issue of cognitive disability.
I have mentioned this to many members, and state it once again.
The nature of the work, is that much is voluntary, and little well paid.

Yesterday we had a masseur for the day working around the staff and
students, a little perk.

I suspect Anne works rather more hours than me.
However we are basically in a similar situation, i only wish I could make
such forceful statements so well. I always seem to be in a rush.

I can, but I can't do the work of the whole group all by myself. I would
love to be able to attend the upcoming conference and address you in
person, but I would have to finance it myself and cannot do so.
