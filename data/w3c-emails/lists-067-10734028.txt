I am sorry that members have difficulty understanding what the needs of
people that are cognitively challenged are.
This is not a fault of Anne or mine.

Creating guidelines that solve this issue is a fantasy.
People are individuals and have individual abilities and needs.
If we could define the problem, we'd be out of a job.
Trying to create solutions is a job for all, and there is almost nothing
that can be said, that will help.

It's a case of action.

If you think you've created, or found a site that's of interest and
accessible, especially if it links to others similar, we'd love to know.

In the meantime the reality is that the Guidelines are a mile away from
meeting that need.
P1 compliance is not relevant currently.
