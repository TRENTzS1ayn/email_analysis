By Bruce's argument there's not much point in meeting P1 if its not
accessible to those with cognitive disability.

Which misses the point, that whilst it would be nice if every page was P1
compliant it would be even nicer, if members attempted to create cognitive
disability accessible pages as well as P1 compliant ones.
To do both would be great, however it shows little foresite to complain of
the one without at least attempting the other.
