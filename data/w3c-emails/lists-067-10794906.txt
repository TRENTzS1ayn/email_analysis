That is not a fair characterization of the members of this group.

You are not doing any better a job at articulating what the guidelines
should be (with regard to CD) than anyone else.

> Creating guidelines that solve this issue is a fantasy.

You may be correct about that, but if you feel that way, why continue this
thread on the GL list?

Another broad statement that, without context, is provably not true.

I assume you mean something like:
"P1 compliance is not relevant currently to addressing the needs the
cognitively challenged."
Which I also disagree with, but at least I don't find needlessly
provocative!

If you want to make P1 compliance [more] relevant [to the cognitively
challenged], try your hand at drafting appropriate checkpoints!

It is patently unfair to make complaints without suggesting something
tangible in the way of improvement!
