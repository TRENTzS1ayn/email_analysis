Greg and all,

I have been pretty cranky the past few days, and I apologize to the list
for being less than useful in my remarks/posts.

Illustrations (etc) as links, followed by the text link.   
An illustration on the opening screen of a page. This helps folks determine
if they want to tackle the text on the page or move on.

Hate to share the road with someone using a cell phone ... but, you are
right, and many cognitively disabled folks would probably also choose
telephone over computer, but TV also delivers the web, and TV is also
present in most homes (tho I've never seen anyone stand in the rain to see
a TV!<grin>)

If you will indulge me a "slice of life": An LD 10 yo I tutor after school
got a copy of Dragon, and began to set it up to accept her distinct
southern accent. It's not yet something that can be used "on the fly".

There seem to be no agreement on a universal symbolic "language" other than
international road signs. Perhaps this can't be accomplished until we have
the capicity to interpret languages "on the fly". But it is possible to ask
authors to illustrate opening screens and links separate from graphics used
for style and design.

My suggestions have come from observing how a (small) number of cognitively
disabled adults and children are using the web, and observing how a larger
number of mixed disabled and not young students are learning to use the
computer and the web. Not based on classification, but on observations of
folks I know, not the least of which is my darling husband. 

Hope I have been more specific.
