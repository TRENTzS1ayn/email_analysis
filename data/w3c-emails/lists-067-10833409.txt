I am curious why people who create pages dynamically misuse
HTML any more than people who create pages statically.

Yes.

Again, why is the case of dynamically generated pages different
than static pages?

What do you mean the HTML is going to "disappear"?

I don't understand this.

Yes. That's not inherent in the origin of the page, but in the
differing support of browsers.

Yes, you can "browser sniff" to tailor your content to a particular
browsers abilities. But you should still send well-structured content
and use style sheets.  Please refer also to W3C's work on CC/PP.

I think that people do a lot of work with just HTML anyway, and
scripting
languages, too. I wish it were easier and that CSS and the DOM were 
implemented well. That would reduce the author's work significantly.
But resorting to misused HTML will not solve the problem, only 
perpetuate it.

I don't understand this conclusion. I think tailoring content to the
capabilities of the device is a good thing, but that should be done
by machines, not humans. The principles of the guidelines are, in my
opinion, entirely separate from the issue of how content is produced.
