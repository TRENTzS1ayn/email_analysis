Hi, Gregory

Perhaps that's an problem.  The assumption you're making is that there
is no problem because the clients will be incorporating the user
agent guidelines.  First, where does that leave blind people these
days and in the near future?  Second, how many developers of user
agent technology are going to incoporate the standards?  For example,
what was the participation of Netscape/Mozilla in the process of
developing the standards?  I wonder how much Microsoft is willing
to actually implement in IE.

The guidelines should be inline with current technology.  If the technology
changes, the guidelines should also change.  However, setting up the
guidelines to work with technology which doesn't exist is creating
another technology gap into which disabled people will fall.


The technology I've developed is not transforming an existing web page
into another type of web page.  As I've said before, there is a technological
limit on transforming on the basis of semantic content.  The technology
I've developed allows for creating highly flexible, adaptable web pages which
are tailored to each user's needs.  This is the direction that sites
which are B2C or B2B are heading rather than forcing all users to use
the same web page.

PS  An interesting result I got from my experiment was that a couple of people
who sue and like JFW 3.5 still preferred using the web pages formatted for
blind users.  The organization of the web page designed for blind users
was easier to work with.
