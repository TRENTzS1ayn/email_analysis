Hi, Gregory

Let's hope you're right about the developers.  However, why
not as a safety net, include some features in the content guidelines
which can be reasonably easily implemented in web pages in case the
developers don't come through?  If they do address the UA guidelines
in their products, the content guidelines can be brought into line with the new
browsers.

I have looked at CC/PP .  There are some interesting ideas, but their
are certain holes also in terms of identifying needs of disabled
people.  As I've been taking on some endeavors outside the disabled
world, I've been limiting myself to the issue of dynamically
generated web pages in the disabled world.

In the ecommerce world, B2C is business to customer web site and B2B
is business to business customer web sites.

Scott

PS  I did answer your last three paragraphs.  I said there are certain
technological limitations on transforming on the basis of semantic
content.  In the past I have tried to explain these technological
limitations or boundaries.  Unless someone has struggled with these
software problems in natural language processing, language transformation
or artificial intelligence, it is hard to explain the pitfalls in
developing this type of software.  Controlling the web page generation
will give much more satisfactory results and it is consistent with
the direction ecommerce is going.  If you need me to respond more,
it might be better to discuss this off-line.  However, you might instead
start doing reading in the area of language recognition/processing.
Also, the area of linguistics which focuses on extracting concepts from
language could be useful background.
