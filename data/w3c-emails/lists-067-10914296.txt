In response to an offline request to try to help define how we might
progress...

'universal' accessibility and the drive to define it currently excudes
People with 'severe' CD by which I do not include Gregory and anyone who has
proceeded succesfully through secondary education, and this includes many
children. Many cannot read, and very few can follow the meaning of a
passage, unless it is part of a story, rather than say a dialectical
argument.

This group do not need 'every' page to be accessible, however it would be
very helpful if every site had a part for them.

For example these people need to know their legal, medical and educational
rights.

They need to be able to browse the web and find suitable pages....


Recently I have been getting such negative responses from WAI members that I
have briefly considered resigning.

It is a huge problem and affects the whole approach of WAI.
I am just not sure that WAI is the right place.
perhaps we need a CD working group that could format some guidelines in
'private'
before discussing them with the rest of the members.
