B2C is business to customer web site and B2B is business to business
customer web sites. these terms are no longer limited to the ecommerce world
and are now becoming mainstream and adapted for everyday use.  Basically,
everyone started with web sites that were brochureware.  that is a way to
post info about yourself or company and very little else.  as the web
evolved, the web became a marketing and cummunication arena.  the term the
internet is a medium, sales channel and service channel is now true.  Print
and other companies now use it as a medium to reduce costs in print, mail,
customer service and calls and it is very effective at that!.  sales channel
refers to e-commerce which started out as posting catalogues, printing an
order form and either calling it in or fax-ing it.  then came secure online
ordering.  service channel is frequently asked questions, search, email, and
customer service.

so B2C targets consumers and B2B target businesses.  examples of B2B are
extranets to businesses and campaigns targeted at businesses.  for example
the mint has one at http://www.usmint.gov/GoldenDollar/B2b/index.cfm
along the way came the term online community. this is where companies build
loyal followings of online visitors.

think of the life now as a company's way of conducting e-business, which is
internet, intranet, extranet, and e-commerce.  this now requires content,
operations business development, and site services.
