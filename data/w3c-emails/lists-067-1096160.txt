It's not the same, because a blind person can simply choose
to -not- use an image if they feel they can't reasonably
describe it...under the current guidelines.  (This changes
when images become a -requirement for accessibility-.)

You do bring up a good point, however, that many people who
can see are also not "visually capable" and may not be able
to provide graphics easily.  I'm not sure if -I- can provide
decent graphics for my sites -- and I refuse to believe that
I need to give up web design because people with CDs
(supposedly) need graphics...
