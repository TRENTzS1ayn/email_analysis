> Hi,

    I have a situation to navigate around the form for diffrent input text fields in
the order of request rather than the order of apearent (the TABINDEX feature).  Main
problem is I have to work it out with netscape 4.0 version and TABINDEX is supported
from netscape 5.0,  do you have any sugession.
Regards,
Bala
