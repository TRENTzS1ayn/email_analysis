Greg,
You did a nice job of pulling together where the problems remain. I can't
emphasize enough that the lack of graphics on pages not only makes the
information on the site unavailable to many (most?) folks with CD's, but
makes the web difficult to navigate as well. When those with limited
reading skills encounter an all-text page, they have to decide whether the
page is what they are looking for or not. A graphic on the opening page
would go a LONG way towards clueing them about the main idea or theme of
the page, so they know whether to tackle decoding the words or not. Even if
the text is written in simple language the graphic is the clue whether or
not the limited reader should invest the effort to apply decoding skills to
the text. 

I really would like to see a guideline that states that graphics are
essential to some disabled persons and should be present on every
page/site. It should be stated that the necessary graphics are illustrative
not just for style and design (although some graphics could suit both
purposes). It should also be stated that the illustrative graphic should be
viewable on the opening screen so that it can be used as a navigation tool.
