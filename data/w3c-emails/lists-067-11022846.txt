Read the minutes, and thanks to those who scribed and posted them. I
especially enjoyed reading the comments on cognitive disabilities. Of
special interest were comments by Mark Urban about the folks in NC who've
noticed web navigation is a first problem for the mentally retarded. I hope
we will hear more from him on this issue.
