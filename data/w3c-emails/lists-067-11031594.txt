From WCAG 1.0:
Checkpoint 14.2: Supplement text with graphic or auditory
                 presentations where they will facilitate
                 comprehension of the page. [Priority 3] 

It sounds to me like you are requesting that this requirement
have a higher priority. According to our priority scheme, if not
having graphics will make the page inaccessible to some users, then
this has to be a priority one checkpoint. I have two comments:

1) Will graphics address this issues? My sense is that we need further
   input on this thread and from additional sources demonstrating that
   such a requirement will actually improve accessibility. 

2) To make such a requirement palatable (and I think it's important that
   the document be palatable, even if the level of difficulty for the
   author does not figure into the present priority scheme), we need to
   define more clearly the cases when graphics are required.  Where do
you
   draw the line to decide what concepts require associated images? What
   if I, as an author, deem something obvious and therefore not
necessitating
   an illustrative image, but someone with a CD still doesn't
understand?
   How do I know when I've provided sufficient graphical alternatives?

I realize this is a difficult issue and I'm glad we're having this
discussion.
