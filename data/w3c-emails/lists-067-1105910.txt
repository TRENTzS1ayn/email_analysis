Hi Jon,

These paragraphs are from the final report of the external Advisory
Committee.   It isn't from the access board itself.     Now that the Access
board has released the NPRM this report is moot.    Or did I misunderstand
your question???

The NPRM is at

Gregg,
Section 5.3.3 of the Access Board Final Report references and appears to
require conformance to the WAI guidelines for HTML and XML applications.
Do you think that this was to narrow use of the guidelines by the access
board?
