To define graphics as essential, i'd go for pages that have small amounts of
text.

ie say 30 words.

There is very little point in providing graphics for concepts that cannot be
defined in a few words.

However Marvel have been doing a great job for years proving this wrong.
I draw your attention once again to the various pages at our home site.

manufacturers of symbol databases for CD will of course be interested in
providing more detail.
