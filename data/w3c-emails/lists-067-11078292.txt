Sean,

Thank you for making your site accessible! The problem you cite is
a browser issue (how they print) and a CSS support issue. The only
information I know of provided by this Working Group about user
agent support for style sheets is in the "User Agent Support 
for Accessibility" page [1]. In that page, there are some links
to resources where you may find more information about support
for style sheets.

Hope this helps,

 - Ian
