one of the suggestions was to break out the check points into sub groups ,
for example, 1.1.1, 1.1.2, etc.

an additional justiification would be this format would help countries or
states or provinces - as they implement or refer to guidleines - could:
1. specify which ones they require, or
2. use the format and modify the priorities to fit their needs.

i think this would encourage countries to utilize the WCAG more and make it
easier for them.
