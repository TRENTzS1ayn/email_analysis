One improvement you could make that should make Jaws work a lot better is to
label the form control labels - for example

  <br><input type="checkbox" name="noise" id="box1"><label for="#box1">some
  choice or other</label>

This is also in line with the Web Content Guidelines checkpoint 10.2 that
talks about associating form labels with controls (Although there is nothing
in WCAG currently saying that controls should be explicitly labelled. Is this
an omission?)

  I am not done with this one yet. We have just began the testing phase.

  When he accessed the following form, only the radio button id's were
  read to him. The text was not identified. Most of the tome the SS# field
  was called phone#. This form needs a lot of repair.
