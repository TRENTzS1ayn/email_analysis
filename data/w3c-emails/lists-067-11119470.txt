There are several browsers around that support print CSS (using an @media
rule to define a print style sheet). I am not sure of which they are, but I
belive that IE5, Opera 4, and Amaya 2.5 are in the list.

  Sean,
  
  Thank you for making your site accessible! The problem you cite is
  a browser issue (how they print) and a CSS support issue. The only
  information I know of provided by this Working Group about user
  agent support for style sheets is in the "User Agent Support 
  for Accessibility" page [1]. In that page, there are some links
  to resources where you may find more information about support
  for style sheets.
  
  Hope this helps,
  
   - Ian
