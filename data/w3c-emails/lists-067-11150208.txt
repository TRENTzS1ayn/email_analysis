Hmmmmmm

If adding graphics would make the page usable for some group of individuals
then it is P1.  Not P1 if it is just more usable.   Also if adding a graphic
would make that item usable but the page would still not be then....probably
not P1.   Sounds like Solomon's dilemma to me (giving access to half of the
page/baby).     Also it would have to apply to pages in general, not just
very simple pages.   Do we know how to do this to pages in general?

We should probably develop or identify a series of test pages (or a
technique for grabbing random pages form the net) which could be used to
test different ideas and strategies or theories.  (e.g. try the proposed
technique on these 10 pages...  and then see if it renders unusable pages
(to certain groups)  usable  (to that group).

So I concur.  It would be good to get some objective testing regarding
whether and where adding graphics would make a page accessible (where that
page would not already be accessible if it were read on request - and just
the parts requested.... E.g. by pointing).  This is an important area that
seems to have little documentation.

In fact, I think we need to really come up with a sampling of web pages from
the net ( say a dozen or so ) and test/demonstrate these ideas that are
being tossed around.   I really am not sure what exactly is being proposed
or if it is   reasonable or un-reasonable  - or even possible or impossible
to do on regular web pages.   I DO know that it could be done on specially
designed, specially targeted pages for this population.  But that is not
what these guidelines are for.

Anyone want to suggest how we create a collection of   12   "representative"
pages from the web that would show the diversity of function and content on
the web?  (is 12 enough? - should be I would think at least to get a good
idea of what is proposed and ideas for fulfilling it.)


Thx

Gregg

PS  Chuck Hitchcock,   are you aware of any research or researchers working
on this aspect?  This question?

>From WCAG 1.0:
Checkpoint 14.2: Supplement text with graphic or auditory
                 presentations where they will facilitate
                 comprehension of the page. [Priority 3]

It sounds to me like you are requesting that this requirement
have a higher priority. According to our priority scheme, if not
having graphics will make the page inaccessible to some users, then
this has to be a priority one checkpoint. I have two comments:

1) Will graphics address this issues? My sense is that we need further
   input on this thread and from additional sources demonstrating that
   such a requirement will actually improve accessibility.

2) To make such a requirement palatable (and I think it's important that
   the document be palatable, even if the level of difficulty for the
   author does not figure into the present priority scheme), we need to
   define more clearly the cases when graphics are required.  Where do
you
   draw the line to decide what concepts require associated images? What
   if I, as an author, deem something obvious and therefore not
necessitating
   an illustrative image, but someone with a CD still doesn't
understand?
   How do I know when I've provided sufficient graphical alternatives?

I realize this is a difficult issue and I'm glad we're having this
discussion.
