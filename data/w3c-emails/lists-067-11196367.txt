Kynn,

One of the basic jobs of a special ed teacher is making molehills out of
mountains... <grin>

Let me see if I can whittle down your mountain a bit...

Kynn, What is the topic of your page? Is it about cats, trains, airplane,
outer space? No, it's about dogs. More specifically, it's about a dog show.
Picturing a certain breed shown doesn't identify it as a site about that
breed. Dogs are dogs. But, the only picture on the opening screen is a pair
of cats....

Visited http://www.dog.com and there was a large graphic of the word "dog"
(which is word learned pretty early in reading), a picture of a dog by the
box to select a breed (it was of only one breed, of course), and an ad for
a dog screensaver that included a slide show of various breeds in the
center of the opening screen. (nice design!)

I know you are. I'm trying to avoid it. I don't understand why you perceive
it so onerous to illustrate your topic/theme, etc.   

Perhaps you can enlighten me on the obstacles to creating a graphical
navigation system. I'm new to it.

No, Kynn, one cannot just add a picture and ensure accessibility any more
than you can just add an alt tag and ensure accessibility. The picture has
to be illustrative, not merely there, just as an alt tag should say "photo
of jo blo" instead of "img004.jpg". Someone has to put some thought,
creativity, and sense of communication into the decision of what picture to
put, just as someone has to put some thought, creativity, and a sense of
communication to writing the text and the alt tag. 

Here's some that

The one the web designer feels best illustrates the site.

The picture should represent the page or the site. If the site is a the
show, then that's what should be illustrated.

As I said above, a dog is a dog. But a dog isn't a couple of kittens.

On the opening screen.

Now that the suggestion/recommendation has been made, it can be tested.
That's the next step.

It really doesn't matter if you are making artistic and creative changes to
a web site to accommodate the blind and some visually impaired, or if you
are accommodating the graphically dependent and those who need/rely on
graphics (which includes one legally blind person among my online
acquaintenances, and my husband who both visually impaired and dyslexic,
both of whom thoroughly enjoy receiving links to full page graphics which
have no alt tags or long descriptions). My assertions-without-proof are the
requests of folks I care about who cannot/will not join this discussion
themselves. If you would like to assert that Patt and Steve, Stacy, and
others aren't worthy of accommodations, please don't make it to me.

Sorry, it wouldn't for me ... but then I'd have probably put a picture of
the most recent winner in that top left corner from the git-go. But then,
what do I know about web design?

Kynn, as above, this was advice to you on *your* page, not the advice I'd
give to an unknown web designer. The guidelines should specify only that it
be on the opening screen.

Then, go back to my original word: Illustration. It doesn't necessitate
fancy multi-media to illustrate. 

>I am very, *very* worried about any guideline which seems to amount

The intended audience of a page or site is who you address. If you know
with some certainty that your audience will not and/or should not include
person with cognitive/reading/learning disabilities, you can skip it, since
the guidelines aren't intended to apply to "Mom and Pop" sites. But it
won't be an "accesssible site". 

The web pages I'm doing for the school are intended for the parents of
Southside students and the taxpayers of Dinwiddie County. I know with
certainty that there are no blind web users in that audience, so do I have
to put alt tags on the graphics? It also won't be an "accessible" site.
