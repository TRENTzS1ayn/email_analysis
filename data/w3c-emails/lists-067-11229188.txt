One serious problem is having enough suitable sites to link to to create a
functional icon based nav bar. Another is getting feedback from a known
source.
Every so often I get an incredible letter from someone saying WOW.
of course the maybe's, DK's and god what crap's, don't write.
I've attached two WOW's from the last month's post for those interested in
proof of concept verification.

It is possible to design icons or symbols that represent types rather than
particulars, it takes a little care.
If you visit www.peepo.com you'll see are link is a cat's face, now one
cannot define the breed of cat, though most would probably agree its
fictional.

I do have a dog logo Kynn could use, its probably a terrier, and that's
because I did not take nearly as much care over designing it.

Black and White really do help our clients to interpret.
Their main problems include difficulty making generalisations.
Try drawing a dog in B+W i.e. 2 bit not greyscale.
Already unless a Dalmatian has lost much of its type character.

I think Kynn wants a winner so perhaps focus on the collar and medallion.

The bottom line is its pointless to think that every site will be accessible
to all CD clients within the next five years. However we do need to create
navigable sites that are linked to others within that time frame. And they
need to cover all topics of interest.

How we are to help do this is our topic of discussion.

Refusing to try to create such a site, because one does not understand the
rational is hardly evidence of a progressive interest.

I'd like to thank Anne for pointing out that its important to use graphics
right from the homepage, and advise you all that I am attempting to create
an Icon based navigable site.
It is not easy, I have had three major crashes in the last week, and my
boffin has tried to install Linux (I love GIMP) over three days in the
previous weeks without success. Notebooks can be a drag. Mine has a save to
disk that won't shut off, so swapping hard drives and OS, can completely
confuse it when it starts overwriting stuff from one os to another....
I now have a little more teaching work and so I estimate weeks rather than
months before the icon nav bar is up.

Best wishes to you all.
