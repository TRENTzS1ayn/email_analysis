Please note: the next meeting of this working group will be held on
Thursday 6 April, to allow time for the first draft of the requirements
document pertaining to the next version of the guidelines to be drafted
and circulated. Please review this document when it is published and be
prepared to discuss it in the meeting. Also, and this is of special
relevance to those who did not attend the face to face meeting at CSUN,
please review the minutes, which have been made available at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/gl/meetings/20000320

It should be pointed out that no formal decisions were taken at the face
to face meeting. Rather, to the extent that consensus was achieved among
the participants, this will be reflected in the forthcoming draft of a
requirements document, which may then be further developed and, if
appropriate, approved by the working group. The initial draft, therefore,
does not purport to embody any consensus of the working group and should
be reviewed thoroughly during the coming weeks.
