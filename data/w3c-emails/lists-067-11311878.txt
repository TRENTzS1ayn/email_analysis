The Evaluation and Repair interest group has invited us to review and
comment upon the ER Techniques document, located at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/er/ig/ert/ ("Techniques for Evaluation and
Implementation of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines").

As the announcement indicates, this is an initial working draft. The
review period ends on Thursday, 6 April.

Please submit your comments individually to w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org

If you would prefer to discuss your comments before sending them to the ER
interest group, you may of course do so via the GL list.
