Dear Alan et al.,

You are quite correct that I am contrasting well-formatted HTML (a rarity)
with poorly (or merely average) formatted Word (etc.) documents.  The main
point that I am trying to make is that with HTML, at least, there are good
definitions (and easy automated tests no less) for validity and
accessibility.  It's not that Word (etc.) created better formatted (or more
accessible) RTF than the job it does with HTML -- it's just that with HTML
you have better mechanisms for judging the results!

It is probably just as easy to teach people to produce well-formatted HTML
as it is to get them to use Word styles in a powerful and appropriate
fashion.  So why not spend your time on the former than the latter?  As you
observe, getting them to understand the point -- and then to care, is the
harder problem.

Alan, do you agree with me that the "average" RTF document is NOT
accessible?

Thanks,
Bruce Bailey
