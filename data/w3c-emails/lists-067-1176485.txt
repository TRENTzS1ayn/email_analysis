I disagree, I think we need to start with users first to make sure
that we are dealing with -real- problems and not just -possible-
problems.  When we talk about access for people with CD, we need
to look at them, not look primarily at groups they intersect
with.

But we've been told repeatedly (why, I don't know) that screenreaders,
which compensate for inability to read text, are not a solution for
CD user.

See, to me, you're getting way to broad here.  This is like trying
to approach visual impairment by saying:

+ Not being able to visually recognize all objects that may be
   on a screen.

In my opinion, it's much more helpful to look at the different
types of visually impaired users -- those who are completely
blind, those who can see with the help of magnification software,
those who can't see colors -- and then proceed from there.  It
feels too much like trying to lump CD people together and then
extracting "commonalities" will abstract the humans out of this
equation.

>+ Not being able to comprehend abstract concepts without concrete examples

Wait, that sounds like this mailing list when dealing with CD
issues. :)
