I hope we can all perform an exercise similar to the one I'm posting
herein - propose versions of the "Principles". On balance I think these
are becoming general enough to apply to many forms of communication -
not just the Web (and certainly not just HTML!).

Convey semantics using content, structure, and markup (or data models) -
not presentation.

Permit user modifications of (recommended) default presentations.

Design user interfaces for device independence.

Assure content availability across sensory modalities.
