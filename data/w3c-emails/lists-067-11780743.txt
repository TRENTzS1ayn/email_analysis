Also, Charles questioned the need for having an "overlayer" of
"Principles" to which my answer is that if we make them sufficiently
general/abstract it will be almost mandatory that these be in a class of
their own with subsumed guidelines, checkpoints, and
techniques/examples.

Incidentally, I cannot find Jason's "Principles" from the GL home page?
I must reiterate that there should be some place we can all look at the
*latest* version under consideration - hopefully without all the
"boilerplate" of a W3C document. Just the Principles at this time,
please!
