I'm looking for some clarification on technique 1.3:

"1.3 Until user agents can automatically read aloud the text equivalent of a
visual track, provide an auditory description of the important information
of the visual track of a multimedia presentation. [Priority 1]"

Does this mean that an audio description is required only if there is a text
equivalent of a visual track? Or, when is an audio description required?

Thanks,
Chris
