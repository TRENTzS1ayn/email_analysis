OK. The requirement for an audio description is not dependant on the

An audio description is much more difficult to create than a text
description and the file size is much larger. So we need to be clear about
when it's required before telling the author to do all this work.

Do all important/significant/critical videos require an audio description?

Is an audio description necessary if there is a good text description?
