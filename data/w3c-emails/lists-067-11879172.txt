Information must not depend on any particular sense (vision, hearing,
etc) for presentation to the user. The information needs to be available in a
form or forms that allow presentation in whatever form is appropriate for the
user's needs.

Detail list of changes:

I created a unique number for each Guideline.  In the rest of this e-mail, 
the unique number for  a guidelines is  included in parentheses after each 
statement of the guideline in case people are comparing the previous 
version with this version.  For example "Guideline 1 under Principle 2 
(Guideline 1.2)."

Definitions of principles, guidelines and checkpoints.
- incorporated some of gregg's comments
- edited for clarity
- tried to simplify language

Edited the text of Principle 1 based on discussions.

Deleted the word "page" from Guideline 1 under Principle 1 (Guideline 1.1) 
to be component based rather than page based.

Deleted the phrase, "Until user agents can automatically read aloud the 
text equivalent of a visual track" from Guideline 2 under Principle 1 
(Guideline 1.2).  I think the "until user agents clause" only applies to 
SMIL-type of presentations where you have a synchronization file that pulls 
together text, audio and video.  Therefore, if you were only distributing a 
QuickTime file you would have to provide the auditory description in the 
QuickTime format.  However, if you wrapped the QuickTime with SMIL then, in 
the future, you could provide the description in text and have it 
synthesized.  The Evaluation and Repair tools working group has the 
following question, "when are auditory descriptions required?"  We need to 
make that clearer in some way.

Edited Principle 2 per Jason's proposal: 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2000JulSep/0053.html

Edited Guideline 2.1 to include the phrase "and data models."   While I 
agree with this in principle, I would like to find a less technical way to 
state this.

Edited Principle 3 to read, "Permit user modification of author-supplied
presentations, if any" per discussion.  However,  this wording makes it 
sound like a user-agent principle rather than something the author should 
do.  Does someone have further suggestions for how to edit this?

Deleted Guideline 3 under Principle 3 (Guideline 3.3) since it seems to be 
a checkpoint for style sheets.
It used to say:
<blockquote>
When using style languages which support a "cascade" of authors' and users' 
preferences, ensure that style sheets are designed in such a way as to 
operate gracefully if partially overridden by the user agent. For example, 
specify lengths in relative rather than absolute units of measure.
</blockquote>

I merged Guidelines 4 and 9 under principle 4 to read (as Guideline 4.4):
<blockquote>
4. Divide large blocks of information into groups where natural and 
appropriate.  This includes the use of headings, labels, and title to 
identify structural divisions within the content.
</blockquote>

They used to read:
<blockquote>
4. Divide large blocks of information into more manageable groups where 
natural and appropriate.
</blockquote>
and
<blockquote>
9. Use headings, labels and titles appropriately to identify structurally 
significant divisions within the content. Note that in addition to full, 
descriptive labels, it may also be appropriate, in designing complex 
structures such as tables and forms, to provide abbreviated labels which 
can be used when the content is rendered on small displays or via speech 
output.
</blockquote>

Is there a way to merge Guideline 8 under principle 4 (Guideline 4.8) and 
Guideline 2 under Principle 1 (Guideline 1.2).

Added a Glossary with a few terms, but no definitions yet.
