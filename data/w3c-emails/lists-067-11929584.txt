Information design is the study of how information can be organized and presented so that it can be easily accessed and understood. Information design is becoming an increasingly important discipline because information is so central to modern business and society. This interdisciplinary field has emerged in tandem with the growth of information technologies. Information design merges the fields of graphic design, interface design, media studies, linguistics, cartography, psychology, perception, and other fields.
