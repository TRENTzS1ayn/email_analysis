We are moving forward with holding a face2face meeting in Bristol, England 
5 and 6 October.
It has been proposed that the Authoring Tool Working Group join us to 
discuss the revision of WCAG on the afternoon of the 6th.

How do people feel about this opportunity to discuss the current state of 
the draft with another working group?  Do you feel we will need the full 
two days to work on the draft?

Thanks,
--wendy
