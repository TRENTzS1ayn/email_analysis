The regular working group meeting, scheduled for Thursday, has been
postponed to next week, in order to allow the following materials to be
circulated to the working group and reviewed. They will be discussed at
next week's meeting, prior to which, a more specific agenda will be
posted.

1. A new Techniques document draft, incorporating Andi's suggestions.

2. WCAG 1.0 errata, proposed by Wendy.

Please also review the latest internal working draft of the guidelines,
ready for discussion at next week's meeting. Meanwhile, as always, any
issues that come to mind should be raised on the mailing list.
