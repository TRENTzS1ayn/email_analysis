An Audio equivalent to video is necessary in the same situations that a text
equivalent is necessary (ignoring the question of whether it is OK to rely on
synthesising speech from the text equivalent), In My Humble Opinion.

I don't know of anyone doing a lot of audio description (but then I can point
to a lot of other access barriers that people haven't removed yet too).

just my personal thoughts on the topic

  Does anyone know of a site that provides audio descriptions for their
  multimedia?
  
  Wondering,
