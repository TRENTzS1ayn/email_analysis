Riiiiight, which is why identifing users must come before identifying
accessibility hurdles.  The same hurdle may be solved in different
ways for different people -- for example, a solution for a deaf user
may not be the same as a solution for a deaf-blind user!

Agreed.  But I think it's important that we -do- identify users
with CDs distinctly before proceeding, so we know that we are
indeed meeting their needs.  Jonathan and Anne seem to be indicating
that we have not, and that concerns me.

So, humor -me- for a while, as I try to figure out who exactly we
are talking about when we talk about CD users.
