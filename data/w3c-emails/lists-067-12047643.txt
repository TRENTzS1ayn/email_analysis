We have not begun registration, but it appears that the core WCAG members 
(those who have been attending teleconference calls regularly) will be able 
to attend the WCAG meetings on Thursday and Friday (5 & 6 October).  I'm 
not sure who from the Authoring Tool Working Group will join us on Friday 
afternoon.

>is there an agenda?

There is not yet a detailed agenda, although the main point of the meetings 
is to discuss the next revision of WCAG.

>would it be helpful, if I was present?

sure.

>with someone with learning difficulties?

even better.

>to demonstrate problems regarding web accessibility?

Sounds interesting!
