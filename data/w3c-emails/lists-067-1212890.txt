To: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>


A regular meeting of the Web Content Guidelines working group will be held
on Thursday, 6 April, 2000 UTC, on the W3C/MIT Longfellow bridge:
+1-617-252-1038.

Please note time zone changes: 4 PM Boston time is now 2000 UTC, 6 AM
(Friday morning) for Australian participants.

Agenda

1. Whether and how this working group should respond to the technical
differences, and the implications thereof, between the WCAG and guidelines
or requirements issued by governmental bodies. This question arises in the
context of the U.S. government's proposed Electronic and Information
Technology Accessibility Standards, regulations devised pursuant to s 508
of the Rehabilitation Act (as amended). The discussion will be limited to
30 minutes, and is intended to concentrate on issues relevant to our
Charter rather than general policy considerations which lie beyond the
working group's mandate.

2. The draft requirements document, soon to be made available to the
working group, for WCAG 2.0 and associated deliverables. Please review
this draft, if possible, prior to the teleconference, as it reflects
opinions expressed at the 20 March face to face meeting.
