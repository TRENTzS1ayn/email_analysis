CSS Techniques
Dividing the section on colors into 2 sections: "Color Contrast" and
     "Ensuring information is not in color alone"
Deleted references to checkpoint 11.3 from "Using style sheet
     positioning and markup to transform gracefully"

HTML Techniques
deleted all of the checkpoints except 13.2 from the list of checkpoints
     "in this section" at the beginning of the Metadata section.

Included a link to "Grouping and bypassing links" from the bulleted list
     under "Structural Grouping"
Divided the "Language Information" section into two sections:
     "Identifying changes in language" and "Indentifying the primary language."
Divided the "Tables of data" section into: "Providing summary
     information" and "Identifyin g rows and column information" and moved some
     of the info to the "Linearizing tables" section .

     text" section.
Deleted the suggestions to use "tabindex" in the "Grouping and bypassing
     links" section.

     image maps", "Redundant text links for client-side image maps",
     "Client-side versus server-side image maps ", and "Server-side image

     flickering", "Scripts that cause mo vement and blinking", "Directly
     accessible scripts", "Alternative presentation of scripts", " Page updates
     and new windows". A couple of these sections existed already, but there
     was  a lot of merging, separating, and merging.
