If I use a style to convey meaning how do I convey that to e.g. a Lynx
user?

The example I have in mind is that I use a style that puts something up
as a sidebar and my intent is that this represents the author's "voice"
in a document otherwise using others' materials. It is perhaps evident
to a sighted user that this is what's happening. What mechanism might we
recommend to communicate this?
