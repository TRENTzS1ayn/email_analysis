If you use style to convey meaning you are not seperating them appropriately.
The basic idea is that you shouldn't be doing it in style alone. For your
sidebar example you may be using a stylesheet on a div of a particular
class. Because Lynx does not implement style sheets you can't do a whole lot
more (beyond using emacs/W3 or something instead) for lynx. In your
particular example there is even an element designed for block quotations in
HTMl - blockquote. This has a default presentation in lynx, which your
stylesheet can then override to provide the presentation you would like to
present for user agents that can make use of it. (This is even a specific
checkpoint in WCAG10 - although I hope it won't be at the same level in
WCAG20 since only some languages have this element but many have a
possibility to provide an appropriate bit of structure and then style it as
you wish).

  The example I have in mind is that I use a style that puts something up
  as a sidebar and my intent is that this represents the author's "voice"
  in a document otherwise using others' materials. It is perhaps evident
  to a sighted user that this is what's happening. What mechanism might we
  recommend to communicate this?
