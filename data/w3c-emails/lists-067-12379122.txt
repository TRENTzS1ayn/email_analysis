I hate to harp on it, but it still bugs me to have to shift terminology in an
arbitrary way. And the checkpoints sound like they will be techniques, not
checkpoints.

I am not sure that Xforms makes a lot of difference to the interactivity
section - it presumably provides fgood ways to meet the requirements, but is
not the only possible technology (it is already feasible to build forms using
XML - some SVG and DOM stuff, for example, although that would be a crufde
way of doing it).

I would like to write about device-independent interaction methods - or at
least drag together the stuff I have written in several fora over the last
couple of years.

Cheers

Charles
