Section 3 should be split into 2 and 4.

3.2 - validate to formal grammars - is about using markup correctly (not the
same as using it according to specification , becuase it is possible to be
syntactically valid with doing what the specification says)

3.1 - - provide appropriate defulat presentations - is about producing
content for ease of comprehension.

For the same reason, the old 2.2 (currently homeless) belongs in 4.

And 4.8 - supplement text with graphics and audio, should just be "use
graphics and audio where it will facilitate comprehension", and should be in
1, where it will be clear that those on their own will not suffice.
