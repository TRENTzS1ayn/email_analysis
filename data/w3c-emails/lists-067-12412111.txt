David,

At the end of the HTML Techniques for WCAG document there is an Index of 
HTML elements
and attributes [1].  It is based on HTML 4.0.

The list of elements contains the following information for each element:
Element name
Which versions of HTML (other than 4.0) the element is defined in
Role
Techniques

Unfortunately, the Techniques column is empty.  I believe that we had 
intended to point to the places in the HTML Techniques document where the 
particular element is discussed.

The list of attributes contains the following information for each attribute:
Attribute name
Applies to elements
Role
Techniques

Again, the Techniques column is unfortunately empty.

If the techniques contained links to examples and discussion within the 
document, would this work for you?
