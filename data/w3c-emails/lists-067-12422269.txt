Benjamin,

Please be aware that an Erratum was issued on 23 November 1999 that says 
you do not need to use relative units on raster images. [1]

The full text of this erratum is:
<blockquote>
5. Relative units and sizing of images.
Added: 23 November 1999.
Type: Minor
Refers to: Checkpoint 3.4 of 5 May 1999 version
Description (and correction). The note for Checkpoint 3.3 should say
       something about the effect of proportional sizing on raster images as
       follows:  "Use relative rather than absolute units in markup language
       attribute values and style sheet property values. [Priority 2] For
       example, in CSS, use 'em' or percentage lengths rather than 'pt' or
       'cm', which are absolute units. If absolute units are used, validate
       that the rendered content is usable (refer to the section on
       validation). For example, do not proportionally size raster
     images."
</blockquote>

I do not understand your question about "hot spots."  Hot spots are usually 
regions of images used to define an image map.
