Please review the notes for a presentation given at SUNY/CUAD 2000 by Kynn 
Bartlett at: http://www.idyllmtn.com/papers/suny2000/notes.html

Each discussion is broken into the following 4 sections:

What It Means: A plain description of the checkpoint, and why it matters.

The Tricky Part: "Gotchas" or things that aren't obvious.  If WCAG were 
easy to understand, you wouldn't need me to help you!

How To Check: Practical information on how you can tell if your page passes 
muster.  In most of these, I refer to specific techniques or software in 
boldface; these are listed in the appendix at the back with download and 
reference links.

Sample Code: Examples of HTML highlighting the specific accommodations 
necessary to maintain accessibility.
