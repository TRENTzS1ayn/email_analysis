IBM Home Page Reader does not only rely on the lang attribute in the HTML
element,
but will also scan the page and determine the appropriate natural
language and switch to the installed language for the duration of the page.
This
is known as "auto language detection".  Also, when reading or switching
between
it's own controls, for example it's history list, HPR will speak the French
title
in French, the Italian title in Italian, and switch back to English on the
English
page.  HPR does not recognize the lang= attribute on other elements within
the page.

I still consider switching mid stream a translation issue, not
accessibility.
