Thanks for the link Wendy, and the hard work Kynn.

A greyscale image of a train map will have far more impact on the audience,
and a link there to an example would have been great. (Q.E.D.)
A b+w photocopy of the London tube map at a very large scale (~3 stations
per screen) appears to reproduce color as texture, though one needs good
sight to perceive this currently.

I have had a complaint that my contributions are repetitive and unhelpful,
so I'll not comment further, other than to say that the attempt to use plain
English, and the 4 sections are a great model.
