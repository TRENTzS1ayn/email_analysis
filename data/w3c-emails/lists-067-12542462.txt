I agree, it is important to know what is being missed. However, it would be 
nice to be able to point out these artistic visual effects so that users 
who want to concentrate on the actual content can do it more easily. With 
equivalent elements it is easy to use class or other semantic definitions 
for these, with equivalent attributes it is a bit more difficult. We also 
need to define some agreed vocabulary for these definitions so that user 
agents can provide means for users to skip equivalents when so wished.
