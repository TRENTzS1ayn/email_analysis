I also disagree with Wendy's suggestion of a variable priority:

WC: "Priority 1 if the  visual track of the multimedia is important for
understanding the surrounding content, otherwise Priority 2"

Instead I think that for practical reasons we should change this from a
priority 1 to a priority 2.

My backwards logic is: Almost all multimedia require an audio description (I
argue that the visual track is almost always necessary for understanding the
context). Almost no multimedia have an audio description (difficult to
create and sync). Therefore almost all sites that include multimedia will
fail the A rating. This can degrade the authority of the WAI guidelines.

If we keep this as a priority 1 it places a heavy burden on the content
creators. If we move it to priority 2 and perhaps move it to priority 1 in
the future then it may be more practical.

Chris
