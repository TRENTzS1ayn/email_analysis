Hmmm. I am absolutely opposed to this reasoning. If it is a requirement, it
is a requirement, and the fact that people don't solve the problems of
people with some kind of disability very often doesn't make it less of a
problem. Implementation of the requirements will of course take time to be
universal,  but i think we do a disservice if we produce guidelines that in
fact leave people out in the cold after all the absolute barriers have
supposedly been removed.

Otherwise we need to change the priority statement of the guidelines, which
would of course require ATAG to do a complete reassessment of how they use
WCAG - not impossible, but not to be undertaken lightly.

  I also disagree with Wendy's suggestion of a variable priority:
  
  WC: "Priority 1 if the  visual track of the multimedia is important for
  understanding the surrounding content, otherwise Priority 2"
  
  Instead I think that for practical reasons we should change this from a
  priority 1 to a priority 2.
  
  My backwards logic is: Almost all multimedia require an audio description (I
  argue that the visual track is almost always necessary for understanding the
  context). Almost no multimedia have an audio description (difficult to
  create and sync). Therefore almost all sites that include multimedia will
  fail the A rating. This can degrade the authority of the WAI guidelines.
  
  If we keep this as a priority 1 it places a heavy burden on the content
  creators. If we move it to priority 2 and perhaps move it to priority 1 in
  the future then it may be more practical.
