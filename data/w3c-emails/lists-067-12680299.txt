IJ:: "I don't think it's a good idea to redefine the terms Guidelines
and Checkpoints. I think doing so will create confusion and I don't
understand why it's necessary."

WL: I don't think the terms got redefined (because it would create
confusion and is not necessary).

IJ:: "Principles are nice, and they can help convey a model, but I don't
think that they are any more than further organization."

WL: So? Further organization might be helpful. The guidelines that
reflect adherence to the principles are still guidelines. The
checkpoints that illuminate/define the guidelines are still checkpoints.
Etc.

IMO (not so humble) the Principles are a nice way to be more general and
abstract - to speak to the what/why of the matter and leave the how for
Guidelines/Checkpoints. This avoids casting the document in terms of
technologies, rather in terms of human needs. Maybe they need to be
engraved in marble or something, but they need to be there to guide
creation of guidelines and other more mundane implementations of
whatever the purpose of all this is: making the Web accessible to
*everyone*.

In the past we've tended to deal with specifics before making it
absolutely clear what the underlying principles were - at least that's
how I've seen it.
