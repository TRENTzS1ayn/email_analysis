JW:: "...all involve some departures from past practices..."

WL: Good! That's the point. Or at least a point. The previous
manifestations of the document lacked a layer that was sufficiently
general and abstract. The new one has such a layer. It doesn't matter
what they are called. The top layer (called "principles" so far) is not
only not technology-specific it might not even refer exclusively to the
Web.

We need this and we're very close to it already.
