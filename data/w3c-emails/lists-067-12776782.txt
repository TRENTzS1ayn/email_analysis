I sound like I'm dead or something, Chaalz. :)

Hi everyone, by the way -- I had somehow lost my subscription, but
I'm back now and hope to start participating again.

In my experience the biggest disconnect when dealing with WCAG is
what we're talking about now -- how to make it understandable what
-exactly- is meant, and what people -must- do.  Because the WCAG
has been and will continue to be adopted as a legal or policy
requirement, we need to present a form of our guidelines that does
fill that need for "checkability" and "do-this"-ness.  Otherwise
the confusion will just continue to increase.

(PS:  Thanks for the kind words about the SUNY presentation.  If I
get some more time in the near future -- which is a faraway hope,
yes -- I hope to increase the usefulness of that particular
presentation with examples and graphical content.)
