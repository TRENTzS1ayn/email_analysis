I agree with you that the Principles are vitally important and
should be engraved in marble, but I think the name of that marble
is "a separate W3C Note" rather than letting these vague theoretical
guidelines detract from the focus of the WCAG document.

The purpose of the WCAG document _must_ be to tell the web
designer "how to do the right thing".  If they can't figure that
out from a read-through, even if they learn a lot about the very
valuable principles which we all cherish, then WCAG 2.0 will be
useless to them.

Audience, audience.  We have to put the audience first and their
SPECIFIC needs from this document.
