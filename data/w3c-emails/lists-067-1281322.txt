Re: graphics and use of Icons:

I'd like to add to anne's very well expressed concerns regarding the use of
photographs and the benefits.

Icons or symbols have been developing for tens of thousands of use both as
representation and abstraction.

Their use predates written language by a considerable time.
I would suggest that this probably is sufficient to indicate there essential
and innate qualities.

It is time that the WAI site made determined efforts to make the site
accessible to people more graphically inclined and thus show the way to
other academic or text based sites.

The issue of graphical rather than textual browsing has yet to be addressed,
and it is only once this issue of graphical pages is developed, that it can
be successfully achieved.
