'Principles', stated in reasonable, commonly understood terms should form
the basis from which to develop 'checkpoints', 'techniques' - whatever you
want to call them.
If you consider some future group trying to write techniques for
technologies we have not yet dreamed of the 'principles' should provide
their foundation.  It is really not very different from our complex legal
system which has developed from a few simple rules intended to govern
behavior among humans.
(and thats my 2 cents)
Could somebody repeat the current state of the 'principles' for those of
those who have fallen a bit behind on the reading?
