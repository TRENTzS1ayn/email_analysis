This is Wendy's strawman.  I'll try to tell you what I like, and
also what I don't like.

I've always hated "Ensure".  This is weak English construction
and doesn't stand alone.  I'd rather we state things in a more
direct manner.

Also, I suggest that this guideline alone is absurd, as it
places illogical implications on what should be provided.
 From reading that "guideline" I have no idea what is expected
of me, but it certainly sounds weighty.  Apparently I have to
provide my context in video, sound files, pictures, foreign
languages, and more, even if I'm just making a normal text
page.

Right?

If rewritten this might be what I would consider a "Principle" and
could be included in a Principles document.

Is this checkable?  Is it sufficient?  I worry about the use of
"checkpoints" when clearly _this_ is not intended to be the thing
checked.

>In the HTML techniques document:

>In HTML this means:

See, this is good, but _these_ are the actual checkpoint.  The vague
"checkpoint" above is not a real checkpoint.  It's not something
that you can check or not check, it's just a general rule to follow.

>1. [...] 5.

Those are checkable, kinda.

BTW, something went wacky with your return key, I think, the rest
of this reads as one huge paragraph.

>  Examples and Discussion for Checkpoint 1.1 HTML 1 ... Examples and Discussion for Checkpoint 1.1 HTML 2 ... It would be easier to refer to the technology specifics if we had something specific to call them. "Technology-specific checkpoints" seems long and it is a new term. However, I would prefer to add a new term to what will actually be new than renaming something that exists already.

I agree that renaming or reusing terminology is bad.

>In other words, I tend to agree that the proposed Principles are similar to the current WCAG 1.0 Guidelines.

Disagree on this.  The Guidelines as such aren't really Principles,
they're a meta-step down in the hierarchy of ideas.

>Therefore, perhaps we could focus naming the newest layer. I propose a. "Technology specific checkpoints" or b. "HTML-specific checkpoints" then "CSS-specific checkpoints" etc. or c. "HTML checks" "CSS checks" etc. or d. "HTML tests" "CSS tests" etc. thoughts? 

Oh dear.  Do now have at least 5 layers that we're talking about?
I think we need to consider everything as a whole -- and create
new terminology if necessary (without recycling old terms) --
and in that context it makes no sense to have both "checkpoints"
and something called "<X> check[points]".

In my opinion, before we start naming things, we need to define
things and come to a consensus on how many layers (and thus
complexity) we need to have, how many _documents_ we will produce,
and what each one should consist of.  Then we can launch into
terminology.
