Okay, let's start by examining what exists.  Here's what we
currently have in WCAG 1.0:

Themes -- very very broad (only 2 in WCAG 1.0)
Guideline Summary
Guideline Full Text
Guideline Rationale/Explanation
Checkpoints
Techniques Reference

Note that techniques are not actually organized by checkpoint
internally in the Techniques document; thus the use of
"reference" above.

Here's an XML representation of the WCAG document

<wcag>
   <themes>
     <theme>...</theme>
     <theme>...</theme>
   </themes>
   <guidelines>
     <guideline>
       <summary>...</summary>
       <full text>...</sumary>
       <rationale>
         <para>...</para>
         <para>...</para>
       </rationale>
       <checkpoints>
         <checkpoint priority="1" technique="wcag_tech#id">
           ...
         </checkpoint>
         <checkpoint priority="3" technique="wcag_tech#id">
           ...
         </checkpoint>
         <checkpoint priority="2" technique="wcag_tech#id">
           ...
         </checkpoint>
       </checkpoints>
     </guideline>
     <guideline>
       ...
     </guideline>
   </guidelines>
</wcag>

Does this look accurate to everyone?  (In other words, have I
correctly identified the structure of the WCAG 1.0 document?)
