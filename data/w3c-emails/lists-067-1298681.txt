Re: Why we do not need to describe how to illustrate our texts. But do need
to encourage use.

That is just not possible, I dont expect you to define the english grammar
you are going to use.
And we both agree that the guidelines would appear silly if they tried to.
We do not recommend people to use English.We can suggest that use of icons
symbols photographs aid comprehension...
In fact to work further in creating a detailed analysis, it is apparent to
me at least that WAI appears to need a professional.
I have already submitted a couple of wows indicating how well liked our site
is.
There are numerous links from the site bothe to graphical sites and
professional CD sites where graphics are extensively used.

The universal use of bliss symbols as you describe it is already here. Look
around you and I feel sure a billboard is not far away.

It takes time and trouble to create these images, and there is nothing to
stop us giving the use of appropriate graphics a P1 importance.
