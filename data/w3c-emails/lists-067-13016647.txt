Hello,

I have published the latest draft at: 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-20000815

This draft takes into account:
Gregg's suggestions made 11 August 2000 [1]
Ian's suggestions made 14 August 2000 [2]
Charles' suggestions made 26 July 2000 [3]

I did not make all of the suggestions that were made.  Some I will list as 
open issues, others I will address in response to Gregg's e-mail.

Major changes:
1. The text of principles 1 and 2 have been significantly reworded.
2. I have reworded several of the checkpoints in an attempt to make them 
easier to read.  I'm not sure that I have succeeded. <grin/>
3. I deleted the 3rd principal as Charles suggested and moved the previous 
3.1 into the new section 4.  I felt the old 3.2 was redundant with 2.1 and 
thus just deleted it. [3]
4. I moved the dangling WCAG 1.0 2.2 checkpoint to Principle 4 as suggested 
by a couple folks.
5. I added lots of examples as Gregg suggested. [1]
6. I incorporated the previous checkpoint 4.9 in with the new 3.3 as they 
seemed to fit well together.
7. I added a few @@'s to indicate where more work is needed.

Additionally
I did not change the terminology since that is an ongoing 
debate.  Therefore we still have principles, guidelines, and checkpoints. 
Although, i modified the definition of checkpoint per Gregg's suggestions. [1]

There is obviously much more work to be done.  There are several of the 
checkpoints that I did not edit that would benefit from simplification.

I look forward to discussion!
