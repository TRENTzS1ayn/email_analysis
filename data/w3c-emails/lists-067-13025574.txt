Note that under Principle 1 there are a couple of paragraphs.  The first I 
thought helped to clarify the principle, the second is an alternative wording.

There is also some clarification with Principle 2.

Part of this is to address Ian's comments about responsibilities, it is 
also partly to help clarify what is meant in the short Principle statement.

Principles 3 through 5 do not have clarifications.
