Gregg,

Good comments! I made most of these edits, a few I have marked as open 
issues and will be adding them to the open issues list.  I also have 
comments on a few of your suggestions.

ITEM 1
>WORDING IN THE INTRODUCTION
>
>3. A final point on this introduction is that we have to be careful not to
>imply that someone needs to follow all of the checkpoints in order to
>satisfy the guideline.  If the checkpoints give alternatives, we somehow
>should combine them and word them so that it's clear that when you do one of
>the two alternatives you have satisfied the issue.  Again, we can talk about
>this more when we talk about specific checkpoints.

I have documented this as an open issue.

>ITEM 2
>
>"Principle 1:  Ensure that all content can be presented through any single
>sensory channel or a combination of sensory channels that may be required by
>the user (e.g. all information only through vision or only through hearing,
>etc.)"

I did not take this wording since Marti had made the comment about the use 
of "sensory channel" and I agree that it can be a bit hard to 
understand.  Hopefully my proposed wording captures your ideas.

>ITEM 3
>
>Under Guideline 1.1 we talk about talking about a text equivalent for all
>non-text.  I would like to somehow get in here the idea that this needs to
>be electronic text.  Text by itself cannot be translated into any form but
>electronic text can.  Again, since we are talking about very general

>
>"1.1 provide (an electronically readable) text equivalent for every non-text
>(auditory or graphical) component or multi-media presentation".

I did not make this edit.  I would like to know more about the "wide 
variety of technologies in the future used to representative 
information."  I am concerned that these are all electrons and that 
"electronic text" is not the best clarification and actually may confuse 
people.
