agreed.  however, i did not make changes to terminology in this draft. This 
issue is a documented open issue.

Part 2 - responsibility.
Good comments. I added a couple sentences to the current draft, but 
primarily will document this as an open issue.

This is really interesting, but I wasn't sure how to use it in this 
draft.  Perhaps this would be used in the introduction?  In supplementary 
material?  I'm not sure, but it is interesting to group the ideas this 
way.  Perhaps these are actually the 3 main themes or principles and 
everything falls under them.  Not sure.

Thanks,
