The August 8th issue of Federal Computer Week cover story was on Section
508, on line version at URL:
http://www.fcw.com/fcw/articles/2000/0807/cov-access-08-07-00.asp
The "13 rules" was one of several nice sidebars.
I am sorry to report that the online version is missing a very good
photograph and a great cartoon which I will attempt to describe here:
A man and women dressed for a big game hunt safari are in thick woods.  The
woman is looking a poster of a ferocious tiger with the words "BEWARE --
SECTION 508".  Behind them, other placards read "DANGER" and "WARNING".  The
man is looking down at small house cat which is stroking his leg.  The cat's
stripes are similar to those of the animal pictured in the poster.
