I get a very strong feeling that we are all tacitly assuming that the
Web and all our Guidelines, etc. assume literacy on the part of a user?
Of course this is the basis of Jonathan's criticisms and also the
explanation of our emphasis on "text" as being fundamental.

I don't think this is "wrong" but perhaps just unremarked.
