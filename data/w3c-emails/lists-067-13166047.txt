AG:: "Comprehending the information shall not depend on something the
user can't do. ...add a parallel strategy addressing cognitive
barriers."

WL: We seem to assume that "cognitive barriers" is a way of saying that
their possessor *can't* "comprehend the information"? At any rate this
statement of principle seems spot on to me. Maybe de-negativization as:
"Make information availability independent of users' physical 
(sensory/motor) or device (user agent) capability"?
