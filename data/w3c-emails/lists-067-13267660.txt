Firstly I like this layout - it works for me. I think that it exemplifies 
the guidelines about pain English and making the point clear at the 
beginning of each paragraph. ?by stating the principle first, I know what 
its talking about before we get bogged down in details.

A few details:
I think it is good that each point is briefly made, because it help people 
link the concepts together, which clarifies them. However, unless you have 
read other WIA documents the information given will not always be enough. I 
think we could use information hiding to resolve this dichotomy, for 
example:
4.10 reads ?Define key terms, and provide expansions for abbreviations and 
acronyms, which should be identified using appropriate markup. ? ? this is 
good , but would need a ?show me how? link at the end of it that could lead 
to an example and more detail etc. (eg: use the tag <ABV> and use the name 
attribute to the full expansion.)

I think using the term X-Forms in 5 will make people assume that if they are 
not XHTM or XML this guideline can be ?beeped? over. Maybe clarify this in a 
checkpoint.
I think 5.2 and 5.2 could be part of 4 and then the rest of principal 5 
could be merged with principal 1.

I do not see the connection between 6.2 and 6.3 with principal 6.

Perhaps 6.3 can be moved to  principal 4, and 6.1 could be added to 5or to 
principal 1.
6..2 seems to be independent.
I think the less principals that there are the easier it will be to skim the 
document, and remember them.

Could Checkpoint 2.2 from WCAG 1.0  be added to principal 5 or 1.

Just some thoughts, but it is quite good.
