Throws us out of sync with the ATAG and UAAG, but doable.
Is this normative or informative?  (W3C recommendation or
W3C note?)

Normative, I assume?

This modular approach is in keeping with my suggestions for the
document as well, although the objections raised to my modular
approach would apply to yours as well.  I'd need to know more
about how you handle the issue of "normative" vs "informative"
which I think is the same as "W3C Rec" vs "W3C Note."
