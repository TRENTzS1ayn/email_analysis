From what I"ve heard, there's going to be out of synch-ness
anyway based on WCAG 2.0 requirements.

It should be a Rec.

I think that all the documents should be Recommendations.
But you only claim conformance to the technology-specific ones.
There is no requirement at W3C that a Recommendation have conformance
provisions, so we can publish a set of fairly abstract principles
that can be the basis for later technology specific profiles.
