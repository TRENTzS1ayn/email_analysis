Question:

Does this mean that I can _never_ provide a service that updates 
itself regularly?  For example, does this mean that self-updating
stock pages are always off-limits?

What if I provide the same content through an accessible version
as well?  A page that only refreshes when the user presses reload,
AND a page that autorefreshes?  What if the autorefresh page has
a large warning on the front?  What if the time between refreshes
is user-configurable?  What if the page also includes prominent
controls that say "halt autorefresh" and "resume autorefresh"?

The problem is with this checkpoint itself.  It is too absolute,
too negative, and too specific.  It provides only one alternative 
-- "rip it off the page" -- instead of telling how to do it correctly.

"If you create auto-refreshing web pages, make sure the user has
control over the refresh cycle."  And then the proposed comments
plus the quote about HTTP headers plus suggestions from my 
comments go into the techniques (or in 2.0, into the technology-
specific checkpoints and the techniques/examples).
