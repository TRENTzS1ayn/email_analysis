To ensure that users can interact with and understand content in a time frame suitable to their needs, do not cause automatic content changes at regular intervals (such as a page of stock quotes that is updated every 3 minutes).

Yes, that is what you should do, according to checkpoint 11.4.

For example.

That's a user agent capacity (that is not required by the UAAG 1.0,
by the way: we only say the UA has to allow the user to access
the new content manually).

Generalized:

 Until user agents do A, or unless you the author do A, etc.

However, if the author provides a mechanism that is not
interoperable, users are likely to lose.

My only fear is if the "making sure" part requires proprietary
technology, etc.
