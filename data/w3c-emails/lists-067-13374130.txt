<form>
   <p>
   The following page will autorefresh at a frequency you can choose.
   If you choose now and it's too fast or too slow, you can press
   the 'options' button to return to this menu.
   </p>
   <label for="secs">
     How many seconds should there be between each refresh?
     (Enter 0 or leave blank for no refresh.)
   </label>
   <input type="text" name="seconds" id="secs" value="0" />
   <input name="submit" value="Show the next page" />
</form>

Right, but it's possible to do this in a way that doesn't break
things.  For example, let's say I explicitly state up front "this
way of accessing the content requires javascript" (so that I can
use Javascript for this version of the interface), and then I
write a nice little javascript that waits <n> seconds -- as set
by the form above -- and then reloads the page.  But before I
do that, I check to see if the "halt autorefresh" button has
been pressed.  (This called another javascript which saved state
in some manner.)  If it has, then I don't go ahead with the
autorefresh.

That's just a trivial example, but assuming that I have a page
that's accessible to non-javascript browsers, I don't think I'm
introducing any additional accessibility errors.  Or am I?

Sometimes proprietary technologies, if used correctly, can be
enabling.  For example, there are more controls available to
the user in a Quicktime animation than in an animated gif.  You
can pause, stop, restart, back up, etc in Quicktime, and you
don't have that level of control in gif animation.
