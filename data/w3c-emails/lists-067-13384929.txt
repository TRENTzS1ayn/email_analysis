has anyone considered a master compliance matrix between the WCAG, User
Agent, Page Authoring and what else are we missing.  this would be used by
groups and manufacturers and would be for requirments management - that is
one could test complaince and record it and eventually post ti to the web.
this would be a rating sheet for all to see!

> create a document entitled "Applying WCAG 2.0 to HTML".
> In that document, each checkpoint explains what is required
> to satisfy it in HTML. People claim conformance to WCAG 2.0
> for HTML with a URI that designates this document. This document
> would mention HTML elements and attributes by name.
