Re: CD resources

I am stunned, a very lengthy and hopefully useful resource.

Did Gregory visit the sites?
Were they designed for use by clients or carers?
Did they use graphics, sound or text?

In my experience they will in the main be designed for academic staff,
parents and carers.

Publishing resources for CD is very time consuming. Many graphics packages
are copyright and the owners remain unwilling to allow their use on the web.

If you find sites that you have reason to believe would be of use to people
with CD, please forward them to me.

We will use them, they are a very rare commodity.
