I don't think we are defining meta-accessibility; it seems to me
that we have our task cut out for us with just plain accessibility.

In other words, I think that Markup Language Accessibility
Guidelines (MLAG) are another related activity just as Authoring
Tool Accessibility Guidelines are a separate document.  I think
there are enough issues unique to markup language creation and
a different enough audience that trying to force WCAG to have
too many "uses" will make this too complex.

(Of course, there can be interdependencies between WCAG and
MLAG, just as there are between WCAG and ATAG.)

I guess you are asking "if conformance is based on what we've
written as specific checkpoints, and nobody has written specific
checkpoints to cover this case, can conformance be claimed?"
I think the answer to this is self-evident but also a result
of the very process we're talking about.  I don't see if there's
any reasonable way to get around this, in other words, nor do I
see it as necessarily desirable to do so.

I'm not sure if that's the case here, but even if it is, I'm not
sure if that's undesirable either.  Usually for new W3C-approved
technologies, we have sufficient lead time (from public drafts
being released, P&F working group, etc) to at least consider the
issues of accessibility, especially if we (WAI) maintain contact
with people doing example implementations.

But it also will become harder to produce a nice "generic" document
that covers all categories, and which -- by nature of being
inspecific -- may allow people to claim accessibility inherent
in their products by assertion when in truth they have little to
support their claims.  A relatively vague set of "principles"
would allow a technology vendor to proudly display the "WCAG
approved" (or MLAG approved) banner without having met any specific
technical checkpoints.

<sarcasm>
Of course, no vendors would ever claim accessibility and standards
adherence without being able to prove it!

This sounds like MLAG.  Yes or no?  If this is part of what we're
setting out to do, I strongly recommend that we go through WAI
coordination group and consider the possibility of making this a
separate activity.

Well, I'm okay with this suggestion.  Thought I'd argue with
everything, eh? :)

I see it the other way around; I see WCAG remaining the group dealing
with content and authoring, and MLAG being the one that's up a meta
level.  I think we have too many references out there which say
"refer to WCAG" and if WCAG suddenly became a different document,
this would be a serious problem in terms of practicality and usability.

It's one thing to say "use our version 2.0 now", it's another thing
to say "well, we changed what WCAG is about and now we want you to
use a completely different document, oh yeah, and you probably won't
understand WCAG now unless you're writing markup languages."  We very
much risk the kind of "give up in disgust and frustration" scenario
which Gregg described, and so for practical reasons I think it makes
more sense to keep WCAG as what they've been advertised as extensively
in the media, in policy documents, in tutorials, and in congressional
hearings.

I think we're all going about the same place on this; I suspect that
most of our differences deal with terminology, perspective and
practicality rather than with philosophy or procedure.
