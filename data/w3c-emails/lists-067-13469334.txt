Charles,

Thanks for the clarification on what should go in the audio description.

My question though is: When is an audio description required?

For example, the following 2 sites have videos:

Movie trailers: http://www.apple.com/trailers/
TV clips:
http://webcenter.bigbrother2000.aol.com/entertainment/NON/video.html

Do all the videos at these sites require an audio description?

Can anyone suggest a video that does not require an audio description?

Chris
