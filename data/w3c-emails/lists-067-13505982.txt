Hello all,

I took an action item last week [1] to integrate some technology-specific 
checkpoints into our current "Reformulation" draft [2].  Rather than 
combining all of the information in one document I created a second called 
"Technology-specific Checkpoints." [3]

I tried to incorporate the technology-specific checkpoints that we wrote in 
May [4] into the current Reformulation draft.  It's not the smoothest 
approach because while they fit really well into the generalized checkpoint 
draft from April [5], they did not all fit as cleanly or easily into this 
draft.

Based on this experience, I think our current Guideline 2.1 should be 
worded as, "Use semantics and structure in accordance with the markup 
language being used" rather than, "Use markup languages and data models 
properly and in accordance with specification. "  I do not think we 
currently do not have a guidelines that clearly states that semantics and 
structure must be used.

I'm also concerned about how specific several of the current guidelines are 
and how hard they are to understand.  I would really like people to look at 
the work that we did in April and May compared to where we are at 
currently.  I think there are a few other good things from those drafts 
that we've left out in the current draft.

Note that I added links under Guideline 1 in the reformulation [2] to the 
technology-specific checkpoints in the checkpoint document [3].
