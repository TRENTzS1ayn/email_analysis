Not to be too sensational, however I have understood that this was the most
popular use of the web. My only web experience since '97 was in searching
for a domain name i came across http://www.puta.com
So they are not that universal.

I think we can agree that the text based versions are a little less popular?
Does anyone have any figures, not addresses please?
I'd guess ~10,000 visits to 1 perhaps you know better
