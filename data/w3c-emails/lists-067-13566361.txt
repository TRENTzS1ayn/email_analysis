I wanted to let everyone know that Donovan Hipke of MSN will start sitting
in on calls, possibly as early as today.
 
Donovan is a Web Design Engineer. He took over Cynthia Shelly's work on the
MSN home page when she left Microsoft earlier this summer.
 
Donovan said he likely will be mostly a lurker until he becomes more
familiar with the working group issues.
 
I'll continue to be a regular participant in the calls.
