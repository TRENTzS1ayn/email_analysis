AG2::

If the specification says "provide the ability for users to update pages
manually" then compliant browser behavior is:

The page updates when
 the user updates it manually, or
 the system updates it automatically,
whichever comes first.

Enabling manual update does not ipso_facto disable automatic update.  If
the automatic updating is required to be inhibited, we have to say so.

Sorry to be obscure.  The dated information I was thinking about is a
document or record that states "as of [date] we assessed the availability
of this function in browsers, and as of that data they don't do this enough
to remove the 'until user agents' contingency."  The idea is that
statements to the effect that "Browsers do X" or "Browser's don't do X"
that should have a data or validity date associated with them.
