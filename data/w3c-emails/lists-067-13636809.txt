ok.

ahhh yes.  The dream document...the holy grail. <grin/>

I agree that this info is totally necessary because without it authors keep 
recreating the wheel and taking a lot of time to make things work OR give 
up trying. We started to capture this info with the (sorely out of date and 
sparse) User Agent Accessibility Page [1] but it's a lot of 
work.  Hopefully we'll be able to glean info from the UA group or else a 
service like the HTML Compendium or WebReview will keep this info up to 
date so we can refer to it.  Unless....

Do we have volunteers who want to help document this stuff??  I'll help 
anyway I can if someone has the drive to shepherd this.  It really needs to 
be done. A lot of the info is out there but someone needs to fill in the 
missing accessibility bits.  I expect this person would be a good liaison 
between the UA working group and the WCAG working group.

thoughts? suggestions? volunteers?
