Hello all,

The 26 August 2000 Techniques for WCAG 1.0 is available for review 
[1].  This revision takes into account the comments received due to the WAI 
IG review that ended on 15 August 2000.

The change log has been updated to reflect these changes. [2]

Max, thank you for your very thorough comments!  [3]  Note that most of 
your comments have been included, but not all of them as I feel they need 
more discussion from the working group.  Once I am back from vacation I 
will document these open issues.

Cynthia, thank you for your valuable comments!! [4] I believe that all of 
your comments are open issues and will add them to the open issues list 
once I'm back on-line.

be well,
--wendy
