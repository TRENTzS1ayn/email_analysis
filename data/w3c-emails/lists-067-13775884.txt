Perhaps principal two could include
?Always use the appropriate  markup to emphasize the structure of the 
document. In other words, heading levels should never be used just format 
text that is not of that heading level. Conversely, do not emphasize 
structure and headings using online style information. Use the appropriate 
header tag instead.'
Needs a rewrite but I hope you get the idea,
