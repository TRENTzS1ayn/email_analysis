wendy, can you pls cross post this to the authoring and user agent groups.

here is my reply. in reference to the first comment on adding a datae
column.  this would be a neat feature, but i ran out of printable and
viewable space.  therefore, the intent of the sheet is to be a one time
check and modified by using another sheet.  of course this could be the
abridged version and someone could have another worksheet for a longer
version taht could be printed by reeduing the size in excel or making a leal
size sheet or 11 x 17 foldout out.

the other comments are great comments too!

thanks and i could see something like this for the other groups.

i have an open question for the companies that make the browsers and user
agents.  do they have any accessiblilty requiremetns matrixs for their
products?  if so i am wondering if they could post these. who can tackle
this one?

i am asking for two reasons, one is this could help us understand their
committment and learn how they incorporate these into the design process.
and two, if we could strive for one requiremetns document that is in an
acceptable format, thsi could be used by all manufactures for compliance.
in effect the guidelines are business rules and we would possibly need this
broken out into design requirements matrix.  can we at least intiate a
dialog or inquiry to the manaufactures to see how they do business?  this
would be an outreach to say hey, why is everyone reinventing the wheel and
all we need to do is work together.

i also think it should be mandatory that all authoring tools should have the
w3c html validator in their tool.  so far only alliare for cold fusion does.
i have suggested this to microdft in dallas.
