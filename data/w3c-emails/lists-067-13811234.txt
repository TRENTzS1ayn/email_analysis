CMN I will direct the Authoring Tool group to this discussion. Can you post
me an HTML table version of your spreadsheet?

RN:
  i also think it should be mandatory that all authoring tools should have the
  w3c html validator in their tool.  so far only alliare for cold fusion does.
  i have suggested this to microdft in dallas.

Actually there are a number of other validating editors - a couple that I
have used recently are asWedit and Amaya. XML editors also normally offer
validation, so creating valid XHTML is easy with such tools.
