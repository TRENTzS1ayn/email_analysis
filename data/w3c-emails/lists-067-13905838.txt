I inadvertently omitted the telephone number from the meeting agenda. The
teleconference is to be held, as usual, on the W3C/MIT Longfellow bridge:
+1-617-252-1038.

There were several other errors in the agenda, which was prepared in a
hurry, but none which should in any way affect the conduct of the meeting.
