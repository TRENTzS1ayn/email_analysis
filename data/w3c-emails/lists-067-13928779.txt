That is why we have information hiding. You have the easy to read stuff on
the page, and then at the bottom of each box, a link to 'techniques',
'complete W3C Guideline', and perhaps 'examples'.

In other words, keep the more complex information off these pages but have
easy and pointed access to them. It also lets people know, that just reading
this site does not give them all the possible information on the subject.
