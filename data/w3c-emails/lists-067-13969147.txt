To: Jason White<jasonw@ariel.ucs.unimelb.edu.au>, Web Content Accessibility Guidelines<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>

At the face to face meeting in March [1] we determined the need for an 
Executive Summary or some sort of short (2 page?) overview of the 
guidelines.  At the Steering Committee meeting in July(?) it was decided 
that this role was clearly ours and not EOs.  I believe that William's 
draft is the possible basis for this short, easy to read version.

There seem to be at least 2 main concepts to cover in an overview:
1. separation of content and structure from presentation
2. transform gracefully and device independence

Other major themes to cover?

I would love to see "WCAG in X points" similar to the "XML in 10 (7 really) 
points" [2].

>comprehension of the text (for example by avoiding long and repetitious
>explanatory clauses in sentences).

>Thus, writing on my own behalf and not in my capacity as co-chair, I would
