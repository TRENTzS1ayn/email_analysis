I think there could be a problem with the concept that the Executive
Summary is an Executive Summary of the Content Guidelines.  None of our
content-encoding strategies works unless the corresponding User Agent and
Authoring practices are in place.  The principles and core strategies fan
out into plans that place requirements on all these three areas.  So the
story we have to tell is a WAI story, not so much a WCAG story, at this
level.  The core strategies shared across the WAI are the logical
background for the more local, concrete provisions in the WCAG.  This
doesn't mean the WCA group can't develop of this resource, but it does
affect the goals and scope addressed.

A possible way to trace the logical origins of the guidelines are as follows:

1. Most general principle:  This is the Web Accessibility fusion of the
Hippocratic "First, do no harm," and the ADA concept of reasonable
accomodation.  It reads

  "First, leave no gratuitous barrier between the information and its
consumer."

2. This leads to a survey of variations in human performance, also known as
functional impairments, that we want to prevent from turning into the
dis-ability to access web-posted information.  Hence, 

  "Transform gracefully into various views, don't depend on any one device
or sense."

3. As an information engineering tactic to support the range of views
required above,

  "Separate the content that informs all views from the presentation that
is view specific."

Each of these is in turn, a more concrete, more specific, response to the
challenge posed in the one before it.

As you may be aware, I remain concerned that we not think the dividing line
between content and presentation is obvious, or subject to some a_priori
definition aside from the statisfaction of point 2. above.  Otherwise, we
will find that the web medium is growing in content that is outside our
"content" format.  We are already suffering mightily from the fact that
this has happened in the area of behavior.  Web object behavior is today
predominantly expressed in a script overlay outside the "document" medium.
Web object behavior involves very important _content_ that is not captured
in our de_jure "content" medium.

PS:  Technical note.  There is content structure and presentation
structure.  I have been looking at an example page -- I will post it
presently -- where there are sections that contentwise are FIELDSETs and
presentationwise are sub-regions in a TABLE.  The fact that we don't have
markup that can indicate both of these things at once is a deep W3C/PF
problem.  But you can't isolate 'structure' into the 'content' factor.  The
presentation view reflects content and structure from the deep content,
true, but it elaborates the presentation with yet more content and structure.

The tree structure we love in eyes-free navigation is often, at a relevant
level, view-specific; and the intrinsic structure of the information is
graph-shaped, not tree-shaped.

[note to self: need to post re: 2 pp. Executive summary has to tell the
story of the solution, not the content guidelines.  This involves that user
agents perform transforms based on the content model captured in the
markup, and that authors create content in a process where they review the
content through multiple views or presentations.  Introduce "markup
language is semi-formal" concept; success depends on the correlation
between native content and formal content.]
