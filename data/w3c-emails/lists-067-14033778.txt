[This message has been posted to the PF list earlier, but it is really in GL
territory.  This is a documented example of a page that sits astride the
make-or-break boundary on forms; it pretty much split the intended audience
down the middle as to who could and could not cope with it.  I am attaching a
rapid analysis of what is wrong slash could be better about it.  -Al]

Kelly Ford recently had a bad experience where a service he put up was
rejected
as not usable enough by a large fraction of his customers.? Now, his customers
for this particular football pool are predominantly screen-reader users.? That
makes it an interesting field assessment of forms usability.

His description of what happened is quoted below.

Reviewing the signup form 
<<http://www.sandbox.com/nflpropix/pub-bin/registration?ss_nflpp_left+12>ht
tp://www.sandbox.com/nflpropix/pub-bin/registration?ss_nflpp_left+12> 
that the users decided they couldn't bother with, several broad handwaves come
to mind:

The eyes-free user pretty much focuses on one field at a time.? Recollections
as to what the other fields were earlier in the sequence may linger, but the
visual form designer is likely to be relying on context to explain the fields
in a way which does not carry over into the eyes-free interaction domain.? So,
the eyes-free user needs each entry blank or form control to be at the center
of a multi-level explanation.? The default presentation can use a terse label
such as is used in the GUI interaction, but there needs to be a standard way
that the user can get a expansion of this into the full, pedantic explanation
of a) what is being asked?? What is the question?? b) any restrictions or
suggestions for what may be entered in this field and c) why the service
guarded by this form needs this information.? A simple example implementation
in HTML 2 would be by a hyperlink from the tax form to the related
paragraph in
the tax form instructions.

Two themes or dominant facts emerge:? (1) The eyes-free user requires
access to
a more verbose presentation of the form field than the GUI designer will
tolerate as the usual GUI layout. (2) Even the eyes-free user doesn't always
need this, as Scott Luebking found out with his experiements with tables.? The
approach that seems to hold the most promise is that there is user control of
level of detail filtering, but that enough detail and logical connectivity is
there so that the "instructions" level of detail is available whenever the
user
wishes it.

In structural navigation we are trying to make sure that a highly filtered
view
of the contents is available.? Here we have to be concerned that a
sufficiently
expanded, not filtered, view of the question is available.? This appears to
require some adjustability in the view, and user control of this
adjustability.

>Hi All,

>Earlier I made passing reference to the fact that my family's football pool

>After hunting around a bit I selected
<<http://www.sandbox.com/>http://www.sandbox.com> to host my

>In the pool I administer, most of the people use screen readers.? It has

>
>More than 10 people wrote me saying that they couldn't even complete the

>it too confusing to know what to enter.? This form can be found at 
><<http://www.sandbox.com/sandbox/pub-bin/registration?sb_home>http://www.s
andbox.com/sandbox/pub-bin/registration?sb_home>.

>With either JFW or Window-Eyes most of the prompts on this form speak

>I'm not commenting on whether the form meets accessibility

reader.

>I'm not offering this as any sort of scientific study or anything of that

>my family's pool, not a single person had so much trouble getting signed up 
>with Sandbox.com that he or she left the pool.? Yet of 28 people who

>trouble signing up to the point where they quit.
>
>I fully understand that being blind makes using some web sites, heck I'll 
>go out and say most, more of a challenge.? Yet I think there's more at play 
>here.? I suppose it would take a researcher to quantify and study the issue 
>in depth.? But I think that for some folks who are blind trying to use the 
>web is like putting a square peg through a round hole.? It does just 
>doesn't click in their minds and building a awareness of what's happening 
>on a web page just doesn't happen.
>
>Now I'm not speaking of knowing what's on the top of the page or the 
>bottom.? But rather just feeling comfortable in getting around and entering 
>information.? I don't know how to get people over that situation.? Training

>I know that when I teach people to use web pages for the first time where

>Please don't take any of this the wrong way.? I'm not implying that these

>I come back to the fact that at least 40 out of 40 people who are sighted

>people who are blind had serious trouble on the same web site.? I say 21

>By the way, for anyone who wants to join the football pool, you need to

>Pro Picks screen, indicate that you want to join a group by selecting the
