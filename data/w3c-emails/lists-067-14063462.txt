I know I have said this before, so maybe I'm missing the point, but I do not
see why there need be a conflict -  we need it all: academic highly defined
guidelines, concrete and common examples, and readable - if less
definitive - articles and guideline summaries.

We live in a hypertext environment, were the one can easily link to the
other, and by careful placement of these links and naming of each piece of
the puzzle, the reader can easily be guided to the level were s/he belongs.

We do not need to compromise on losing our audience, on clarity or the
thoroughness of the guidelines. It is called information hiding.
