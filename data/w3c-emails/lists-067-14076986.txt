I don't think there's any debate on that, but I do think that any
good document is not going to try to be "all things to all people"
and rely on hyperlinks to sort out the mess.  A well-written
technical document _does_ consider the audiences and doesn't try
to mix things too much, even if you -do- create links which
(supposedly) separate content.  (Actually, links serve to join
content, not separate it.)

Maybe the problem is that I'm expecting "well-written"?  Is this
actually a goal of the working group?  From seeing some of the
comments, I'm not sure that "readability", "understandability",
and "well-written" actually _are_ expectations of the revised
WCAG.
