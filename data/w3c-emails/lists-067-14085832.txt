I agree with Kynn. Our highest priority must be to provide guidelines on creating
accessible web content with existing languages. Accessibility considerations when
extending a language or designing a new language are a completely different topic.
Ever since we started trying to create one set of principles and guidelines that
addresses both of these diverse objectives, we have not been able to move forward in
the working group.
