aloha, jonathan!

i apologize for the length of the post, but i wanted to collate as many 
resources in one place as possible, so as to jump start the process...

jonathan asked quote Did Gregory visit the sites? unquote

i at least verified that the resources to which i pointed the WG still 
exist, and spent a bit of time dipping into each site, save for most of the 
individual schools' sites...

jonathan also asked, quote Did they use graphics, sound or text? unquote

most of the sites do incorporate graphics, but i was actually hoping that 
you might visit them, and give us an analysis as to whether or not any of 
the sites i referenced would actually be of use to the CD community 
(however nebulously defined that term remains within the WG) -- 
particularly those sites listed as "Resources"

jonathan asked, quote Were they designed for use by clients or carers? unquote

most -- if not all of the sites -- were designed and implemented by either 
care-givers, teachers, academics, or parents, but some of them have 
sections designed for use by children with quote learning disabilities unquote

the main point, however, in posting such an extensive list of resources, 
was not only to improve our understanding of the term cognitive 
disabilities, but to point us towards resources through whom, and with 
whom, we can work directly with individuals with cognitive disabilities, so 
as to solicit their individualized feedback as to what they need in order 
to access content on the web...  many of the resources listed -- including 
all of the schools -- i envision not as an end in themselves, but the means 
to an end -- basically a bridge between the GL WG and persons with 
cognitive disabilities -- especially those for whom access to the web is 
currently either unavailable or extremely difficult...  it is my earnest 
hope and desire that this WG ensure that any checkpoints and techniques 
relating to cognitive disabilities first be tested by persons with a wide 
range of what are generally classified as cognitive disabilities, in order 
to ensure that any checkpoints we require web content designers to 
implement are based firmly in reality, and do not rely upon the theories of 
a particular faction of care-givers or academics...

gregory.
