Hello,

It seems that we need consensus on the following issues:
audience
terminology
goals
layers
organization
voice and language (technical, academic, simple, or ??)

These are the types of concepts that we tried to document in the 
Requirements document [1]. Therefore, can we first get some consensus on 
the Requirements document?  We need to ensure that we are on the same page 
here.  I think most of us feel we have consensus but could every member of 
the list actually respond that they agree with everything in the 
Requirements document? Or suggest changes?  Note that there are two 
sections that are marked as needing work.  They are marked with @@.

Also, there is one open issue:
1. Stating assumptions of assistive technologies [REQ]
Issue
14 June 2000 - Phil Jenkins. We should document the assumptions of the 
assistive technology capabilities

We still need to send this on to the WAI interest group for review before 
publishing it as a note. I propose that  the working group take one more 
look at it over the next week before we send it on to the IG.

thoughts?
