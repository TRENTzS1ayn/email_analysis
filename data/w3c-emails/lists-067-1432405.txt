IJ: I think in the example below, the TITLE element might confuse people
since you talk about the "title" attribute.

IJ: I don't know that you need title. The lack of a name attribute
means that no image can use this map as a graphical image map. So
it's purpose could only be to contain some other navigation mechanism.

I'm not sure why identifying MAP elements that create navigation
mechanisms
is even an issue: MAP is only used for purposes of navigation. User
agents
could allow users to turn off the rendering of any MAP content while
still parsing and handling what is specified by that content (i.e.,
active
regions).

IJ: I recommend an additional technique for creating accessible
graphical and text image maps until user agents do this themselves:

 - Most older user agents render MAP content but not AREA content. If
you
   put both in today, the A elements will be rendered as text links and
   the AREA elements will produce the graphical image map.

 - Use "coords" on the A elements. User agents that support HTML 4.01
will 
   ignore the AREA elements when mixed with A elements. So in effect,
   the A elements do all the work, which was the goal of this change in 
   HTML 4.0 to begin with: get rid of AREA.

(This is all described in HTML 4.01).
