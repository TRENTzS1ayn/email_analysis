Fantastic.
I think one thing is missing and that is an short introduction that will
make the Guide to Guidelines make sence the first time around. - IE. Not
everyone is using the same input, output madiums, peaple can have touble
navigating, not everyone will be seeing the format, so confay stucture
information though markup.

Alteritvly, an explnitory sentece by each principal, would serve the same
end. Otherise peaple can be left asking "why"
