LL:: [referencing http://rdf.pair.com/guide.htm ] ...the animated graphics 
are a bad idea from a pure human factors perspective - they
are irritating and draw attention away from the information on the page 
(it's hard for people to keep their attention from being drawn to something 
moving).

WL: About my only "excuse" (rationalization?) for using the animated icons 
is to illustrate by example that their inclusion: a) doesn't break the 
guidelines; b) that the guidelines don't preclude use of absurd gimmicks.

Your point about their attracting attention is probably valid but I've 
chosen to take that risk because of some (misplaced, fanciful?) notion of 
subliminal communication.

The height of the backgrounds for the H2's being forced by the icon 
inclusions is something I'll address. What is of more interest to me at 
this time is the content and how well this "guide" could be used by someone 
to actually gain some understanding of and friendship with the guidelines. 
I hope to make the overall WCAG document less daunting, principally by 
presenting bits of it in lieu of its  overwhelming entirety.
