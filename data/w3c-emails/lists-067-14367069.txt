Looks Good William,
I like your choice of graphics. I would add a space between the graphics and
the text, to me it looks a little crowded. I like the additional commentary
provided by the alt text. But, I could not tell from the alt text where the
link would take me; when I looked at the status line, the url clued me in.
Maybe commentary, with link destination information. On the animation with
the arrow road sign the alt says "this way to the guidelines" but the link
takes you to the checklist.

A funny thing happened on my way to the Website. I decided to put in some
graphics because Jonathan thought it might help and others said it would
look better. I always thought that was just short of nonsensical. So I put
in some (supposedly appropriate) icon-like graphics and *ta-da* it not only
looked different, it sort of looked better. Then I thought they'd probably
be more useful if they were links. So I made them go places.

Now the "Guideline Guide" has over 20 links. Although many of them are to
the WCAG 1.0 and other WAI documents, several are to outside sources I've
found useful in this area. I could use lots more - it's kind of nice to
have resources pre-located and all in one place IMHO. I'd like some
feedback from some on the lists who try the site at
http://rdf.pair.com/guide.htm with the idea that it can be sort of like a
"concordance" for WCAG.
