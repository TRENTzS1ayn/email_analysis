Re: email for online resources?

I certainly think there is ample need for a study of current web resources.
Equally it would certainly be a benefit to evaluate their success for end
users.

It could be useful to make general suggestions regarding their commanalities
with pointers to specific examples.

I'd certainly be interested in (and am) contributing to this process.

 It is an ambitious project especially if you expect to author materials
from the guidelines produced, and check their suitability.

I think the first step, would be to assume that all resources that appeared
to be designed for CD were successful. Given teachers are busy, and why
would they be wasting time?

Secondly I would probably ignore material designed for carers, academics...
Unless specifically designed to help authoring.

I would estimate that we are already planning for us to look at 1000s of
pages, and I have a 56 connection which can be very slow state side.

Perhaps we could email CD colleges and institutions asking them to send us
links, given the group effort and make it a professional approach.
We'd then have to publish the results...
