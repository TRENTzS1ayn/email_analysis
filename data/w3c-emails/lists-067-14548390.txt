However, this illustrates a fundamental problem with the animation
itself -- if it _doesn't_ stand out, and if it _can't_ be noticed 
as animated, then it's not a good design element.  The purpose of
using animation, on the web, is to _make something stand out_.  If
an animation fails to do this, then it's clearly gratuitous!
