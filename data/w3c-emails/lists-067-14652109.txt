William,
Your experience with the W3C gives you a better understanding of
which group should best address these plain language
ideas.............but.............please don't give up your efforts.  I
appreciate the direction you had taken with your
"Accessibility for the Rest of Us" theme.
 I agree with Charles that a printable version is also needed, but it could
be  link at the top of your doc, 
that explains that the printer-friendly page would show and print the hidden
content.

Jason,
As to the agenda, I would add only one more document, the Executive
Summary, aimed at policy makers,managers,et al.  Another document, in
between William's pleasing Guide (if this is what you were calling an
overview), and the Technical Specification (b), that might still elude and
preclude, business, 
academic and government upper-management
individuals.................................................................
.......................Katie
