New, no; headache, yes.

If you start with the HTML specification (at least any version since HTML4)
and search on BIDI or bi-directional you should find that the
Recommendations from the W3C are squarely in favor of a standard logical
architecture which supports bi-directional lanaguages, and where
line-breaking is performed in rendering by the client and not in the
authoring.  And most or all the rest of what "logical Hebrew" has that
"visual Hebrew" doesn't that makes it superior for your needs.

This does not mean that the fully logicalized implementation is endemic.
There are varying levels of implementation of the W3C Recommendations in
the IT marketplace.

But this does emphasize that Internationalization and Accessibility are
frequently allies in wishing for a more logical view to be preserved in the
medium.

And that sometimes the problem is persuading people to use the logical
version.
