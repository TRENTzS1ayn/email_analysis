There is an irony here. Using BIDI logical architecture should make sites
more accessible. But it does not. This is because it is not supported by
most browsers. (Netscape and  I.E. 4 - unless the Hebrew version). The only
browser I have heard of that does properly support it is IE5. -  Not all
that accessible.
