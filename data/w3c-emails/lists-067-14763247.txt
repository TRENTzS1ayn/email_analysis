I think we may have a new issue, of making BIDI accessible. From what I
understand, and in fact have tried to do today, logical architecture, comes
out a mess on most browsers (except the latest I.E.). It may be the
recommendation, but it is just not supported.

 Unfortunately visual architecture  will probably be accessed backwoods by
disability orientated user agents.

The only solution I can think of is to use DHTML, and produce a page that
works with the browser or user agent.

Not good.

Even with this approach there are, oh so many problems, Browsers are not
limited to I.E. and Netscape, so if the "unknown browser" defaults to
logical architecture, and the user is just using a different browser that
does not support logical architecture, he will see a messy screen. We can
give him a button "click hear if your screen is backwards", but the web
designers will not like it , the 3 click rule, they may lose traffic.

BIDI web designers  seem to be using visual architecture. I think it may
take some lateral thinking to get this one cliched.
Any ideas?
