I think Jason's rewrite is a step in the right direction. Some specific
comments below....

AS: I like Jason's rewording of Principle 1. The previous wording "All
information must be available entirely...." made it sound like the web
author has to provide all
the different renderings. The rewording above conveys more of an enabling
spirit which is what I think we want.

AS: I feel just the opposite of William. I think the guideline is "Provide
text equivalents to auditory and graphical presentations." The rest of the
guideline is the
rationale for why you need to do this. BTW, I also prefer "text" to
"textual".

AS: Jason asked in another posting if this rewording incorporates my
suggestions for this guideline. I think Jason's rewording covers the ideas
in my suggestion but it
is more obtuse.

AS: "...and ensure that...are captured..." is passive. Suggest rewording as
"....and capture significant structural or semantic distinctions explicitly
in markup or in a
data model." I also wonder about the choice of the word "capture". To me,
capture implies that something exists somewhere else and you have somehow
acquired it
for your own use. Would "provide" or "define" convey the right meaning?

AS: The first sentence of this guideline is not understandable without the
explanation below. Further, the explanation expands to two requirements. I
still think this
would be simpler, but still accurate, if split into two guidelines:
2.1(a) Use standard markup languages and data models. Do not use
non-standard
extensions. For example, use XHTML that validates to the XHTML
specification.
2.1 (b) Use markup elements to identify the type of content being
presented,
not to control presentation. For example, use the HTML <blockquote> tag to
identify quotations, not to achieve paragraph indentation.

AS: I don't know if we have to "hide" it as William suggests but with the
proper HTML markup, the first sentence can be communicated as the terse
guideline and
the rest as backup explanation. For example, use <h3> or <h4> for the first
sentence. The rest is a followup paragraph. This comment applies to all of
the
guidelines.

AS: My earlier comment about passive voice applies here too; i.e.
"...ensure ... is captured..."

AS: A more positive wording of this would eliminate the need for the
disclaimer about discouraging the use of color or other style properties.
Suggest: "2.4 Use
presentation (e.g. color or font changes) to enhance semantic distinctions
but not as the only means to understand them.

AS: Another passively worded guideline: "Ensure ...is preserved..." Also, I
have the same problem with the word "preserved" as I do captured.
"Preserved" implies
that it exists already and you are maintaining it. Suggest " Use markup or
a data model to provide logical structure to the content, together with any
additional
semantic distinctions that facilitate rendering of the content visually,
auditorily, or tactually." BTW, I'm not sure what "additional semantic
distinctions" means.
