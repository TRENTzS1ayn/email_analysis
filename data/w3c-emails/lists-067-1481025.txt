To make it available to humans, use the title attribute. To do some kind of
semantic processing on it, use a class attribute.

And interesting idea is to use a URI as the value of the class attribute -
then if that points to some data that has expression in RDF we can make use
of it in all kinds of helpful ways.

  Resources may have more than one group of navigation links.  For example a
  site navigation bar (between URIs) and an internal table of contents (with
  a URI) it would be nice to have a mechanism to distiguish between the two
  groups of navigation links.
