Hey Wendy... Let me see if I can give you some answers, and begin a bit of a
discussion on the finer points of attaining accessibility with flash.

This is possible via several different methods... Some are fairly simple,
some are a bit more convoluted.. I would be interested in maybe making an
example site illustrating this, maybe with someone on the working group (Mr.
Neff?)...

We have tech notes available and several white papers documenting most, if
not all of these concerns.. but it would be great to get all of the concerns
together and shoot them into one central place... What steps do you
recommend to get this ball rolling?

> These were submitted by Rob Neff who used to work with the U.S. Mint.  Did

No I did not... I have only had a few conversations with Rob and none of
them concerned the U.S. Mint site.

I have a pretty strong web design and programming background... I worked at
Disney for the past 3 years doing backend systems design and research for
emerging Internet technologies. I have a strong knowledge of Flash and
various other "Multimedia" web technologies.
