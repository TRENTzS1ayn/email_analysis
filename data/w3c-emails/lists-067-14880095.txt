The question of which terminology to use in designating the different
types of requirements set forth in the guidelines document, remains
unresolved. This issue was introduced at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2000JulSep/0200.html
but did not achieve resolution either on the mailing list or in the
subsequent meeting.

The following proposals have been advanced:

1. Charles: the three types of requirements should be called "guidelines",
"checkpoints" and "techniques", respectively. This usage has strong
historical roots in the development of the guidelines.

2. Wendy: they should be called "guidelines", "checkpoints" and
"technology-specific checkpoints" (or "technology-specific checks"),
respectively.

3. Gregg: the requirements in the middle layer should be called
"strategies" because not every requirement at this level will be
applicable to every technology or situation.

4. William: it is of little consequence which terminology is chosen, so
long as it is used consistently.

I hope that I have represented your stated positions accurately. Please
correct the above summary if it is inadequate.

For the sake of full disclosure:

5. Jason: I agree with William, at least for the moment and thus have no
strong preference for or against any of the proposals, though I appreciate
that each of their proponents has made important and valid points.

Comments and proposals are welcome as we need to reach consensus in
connection with this issue.
