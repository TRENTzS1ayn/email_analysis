Yes, you have captured my proposal accurately.

In the wide scheme of things I agree that the terminology is of little
consequence so long as it is used consistently. Which for me includes doing
so across different versions, unless there is some very strong reason to
change. I do not see that we need to change to strategies - not every
checkpoint is applicable to every situation now, nor ever will be. (For
example look at the checklist).

  The question of which terminology to use in designating the different
  types of requirements set forth in the guidelines document, remains
  unresolved. This issue was introduced at
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2000JulSep/0200.html
  but did not achieve resolution either on the mailing list or in the
  subsequent meeting.
  
  The following proposals have been advanced:
  
  1. Charles: the three types of requirements should be called "guidelines",
  "checkpoints" and "techniques", respectively. This usage has strong
  historical roots in the development of the guidelines.
  
  2. Wendy: they should be called "guidelines", "checkpoints" and
  "technology-specific checkpoints" (or "technology-specific checks"),
  respectively.
  
  3. Gregg: the requirements in the middle layer should be called
  "strategies" because not every requirement at this level will be
  applicable to every technology or situation.
  
  4. William: it is of little consequence which terminology is chosen, so
  long as it is used consistently.
  
  I hope that I have represented your stated positions accurately. Please
  correct the above summary if it is inadequate.
  
  For the sake of full disclosure:
  
  5. Jason: I agree with William, at least for the moment and thus have no
  strong preference for or against any of the proposals, though I appreciate
  that each of their proponents has made important and valid points.
  
  Comments and proposals are welcome as we need to reach consensus in
  connection with this issue.
