There is another example of using positioning now in place at
http://www.w3.org/Style (where else <grin/>)

Also, I would say that yes, it is ok to use the sizes xx-small, x-small, etc
- they are designed to be relative although it would be nice if it were easy
to set their actual representation in a user agent - I think some of them
allow this and some don't. In the first specification of these they came up
with a particular set of suggested sizes, but it feels a bit like a
"one-size-doesn't-really-fit-anyone" solution - the differences are too great
for some people and too little for others.
