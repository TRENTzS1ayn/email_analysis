JRG: This was my thinking, using TITLE attribute is a simple way to provide
a human readable label for user agents that provide support for direct
navigation to links contained in a MAP element.  The use of TITLE is also
consistent with tooltips implemented in some user agents.

I don't think from a machine interpretation standpoint their needs to be
any markup.
