I think those are what we have called guidelines in WCAG 1.0

(I think that the checkpoints should express requirements, for things like
"ensure text equivalents are available for evrything", or "ensure that
structure is reflected in presentations supplied". Those things are
checkable, although it is helpful to have specific technique information for
a specific language...
