You mean like: "2.  Don't rely on color alone" or perhaps "10.  Use interim 
solutions" might be "general/abstract" guiding principles? I think we are 
unprincipled if we don't have a layer of "principles" under which the 
mundanities of guidelines, checkpoints, techniques, and exemplary 
realizations are presented. The guidelines do (more or less) fall into 
categories and Jason has presented some fairly "ringing" ones - but if it's 
a line in the sand...
