well,

I think 10. Use interim solutions is a guidelines, but 2. Don't rely on
colour alone is a checkpoint for the general principle of ensuring that
information can be understood in variuos modalities (colour is useful
visually for many people, but doesn't work aurally for example)

  You mean like: "2.  Don't rely on color alone" or perhaps "10.  Use interim 
  solutions" might be "general/abstract" guiding principles? I think we are 
  unprincipled if we don't have a layer of "principles" under which the 
  mundanities of guidelines, checkpoints, techniques, and exemplary 
  realizations are presented. The guidelines do (more or less) fall into 
  categories and Jason has presented some fairly "ringing" ones - but if it's 
  a line in the sand...
