Kynn,

   Kynn, this is like saying that music that doesn't rock the pictures
on the wall isn't music ....

There are times when you want an design element to blast out at the
user, but there are times when you want it to be subtle, noticed only
in the review of details ... William achieved this by embedding the
animations in a stationary bar that diminished the "flash" of the
animations so they didn't blast at you, but were there when you looked
back for details ... 

Kynn, sublety is NEVER bad design ...
