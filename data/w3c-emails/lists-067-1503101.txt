I agree that this is a good technique. However it will only be valid for HTML
4.01 - before that the content model of MAP did not allow area elements and
block content in a map - it had to be one or the other.

  IJ: I recommend an additional technique for creating accessible
  graphical and text image maps until user agents do this themselves:
  
   - Most older user agents render MAP content but not AREA content. If
  you
     put both in today, the A elements will be rendered as text links and
     the AREA elements will produce the graphical image map.
  
   - Use "coords" on the A elements. User agents that support HTML 4.01
  will 
     ignore the AREA elements when mixed with A elements. So in effect,
     the A elements do all the work, which was the goal of this change in 
     HTML 4.0 to begin with: get rid of AREA.
  
  (This is all described in HTML 4.01).
