Hi...

After performing an extensive web search in relation to making web pages more 
usable for people with psychiatric disabilities, I have found NO information. 
 I have latched onto the cognitive disabilities information in the hope that 
there would be some commonalities.  I found little information there.  Could 
anyone point me in the proper direction?  Please use my home email.

Thanks.

Mike Bradley
