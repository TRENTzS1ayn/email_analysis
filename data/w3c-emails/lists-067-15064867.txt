Hi,

During a rewrite of the Danish guidelines for creating accessable web pages,
made by the Statens Infomation, the agency that is responsible for the
Danish national information policies, we have found problems with the WAC
guideline concerning the use of the title tag used to identify frames.

In Denmark the only screenreader for blind is JAWS for Windos. We have found
that JFW does not recognize the title  tag when used on frames but it does
recognize the name tag. So we started out discussion weather we should
follow JFW or the WAI guidelines. One of the members in the group has
examined the html 4.01 specification and claims that there is no reference
to the title tag at all. Is there a reason why the title tag has been
preferred over the name tag when using frames? And will we degrade other
access issues if we stick to the html 4.01 and recommend the use of the name
tag when designing pages with frames?
