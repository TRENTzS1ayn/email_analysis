At http://rdf.pair.com/checker.htm is a first shot at what I hope will 
de-mystify the process of wading through a lot of documents for those 
reasonably Web-savvy authors who just want to get to the bottom line: "what 
must I do to achieve some level of conformance to the WCAG?" Ultimately I 
will embed links in the checklist items (beyond their current links back to 
the actual checkpoints) to materials that might be instructive, amusing, or 
otherwise useful.

I believe that the links from within this table back to the WCAG individual 
entries (which contain links to the techniques, as well as definitions, 
glossary links, references, etc.) will make the experience of dealing with 
the guidelines/checkpoints/techniques/samples a less daunting experience.

I would appreciate any feedback and suggestions for further enhancements.

I have purposely avoided explaining or trumpeting "only 15 checkpoints to 
Single-A Conformance!" based on the theory that if it's simple to use, one 
needn't say "simple to use." It 's interesting (at least to me) that there 
are only 65 total checkpoints - not that overwhelming an undertaking.

Because (despite any protestations we may make) a lot of people who might 
use this are trying to comply with some law, I look forward to including 
more specific policy references excerpted from the already-linked-to page 
(as "citizenship"<g> - alliteration, you know!).
