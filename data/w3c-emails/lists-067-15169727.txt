A regular meeting will be held on Thursday, at 20 Hours UTC (4 PM Boston,
10 PM France, 7 AM Friday Eastern Australia); W3C/MIT Longfellow bridge:
+1-617-252-1038

Agenda
To try to close as many open issues related to the guidelines as possible,
including:

1. Terminology (see recent mailing list thread).

2. Reorganization of items currently appearing under Principle 3 (see
Lisa's recent proposal on this subject).

3. Auditory descriptions: these are an interim measure, but they must be
provided by content creators until such time as user agents can
synchronize synthetic speech with the audio track of a multimedia
presentation. How should they be treated in the guidelines? (Issue raised
by Gregg during last week's teleconference).

4. Qualifications attached to Principles 3 and 4: do they need further
clarification? Should any of them be dropped (e.g. the limitation
regarding structured data bases, as discussed by Charles at last week's
meeting)?

Gregg and Wendy have both sent regrets in connection with this week's
meeting.
