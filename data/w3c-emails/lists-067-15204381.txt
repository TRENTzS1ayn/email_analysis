The current working draft of the generalized guidelines is my latest
version as distributed on the mailing list and linked to the home page.
The latest draft of the technology-specific requirements is Wendy's
version, which was integrated into an earlier draft of the guidelines.

The technology-specific material has not been reworked and incorporated
into the latest draft, as none of the editors has found time this week to
undertake this work. However, a structurally complete draft should be
prepared in time for the face to face meeting in October.
