I suspect that with the way WCAG 1.0 is structured, your questions
above are moot; however, I believe it _is_ an issue of discussion
regarding those for WCAG 2.0.  I expect that with WCAG 2.0 on the
way (from us), that efforts would be better spent on that (and techniques
or checkpoints or whatever) rather than trying to retrofit them onto
1.0.

So kinda yes, kinda no, as my understanding of the working group's
direction.
