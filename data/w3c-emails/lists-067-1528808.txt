aloha, love!

your observations, as  usual, are on-target and cut to the heart of the 
matter...

as i have repeatedly stated, what we as a working group need to do is work 
directly with the persons in whose name, and for whose ostensive benefit, 
we are re-examining the web content guidelines...

i'm searching for bridges to that community that will allow us to bypass 
the rancorous debates that rage over the quote proper unquote methods for 
classifying, teaching, and communicating with the cognitively disabled, 
both in academia and in the oft-ossified world of organizations for, and 
not of, those with whom we are attempting to establish a dialog...

anyone who doubts the veracity of love's rhetoric as regards agencies and 
the tradition of warehousing the quote cognitively disabled unquote and 
isolating them from direct dialog with the world in general, would do well 
to read Stephen Jay Gould's book, "The Mismeasure of Man", which was last 
revised in 1996...  the publisher is W W Norton & Co and the ISBN numbers 
for the book are: 0393039722 (hardcover) and 0393314251 (paperback)

an audio recording of an earlier edition (the original, published by Norton 
in 1981) is available from the National Library Service for the Blind & 
Physically Handicapped (NLS) here in the states -- a brief citation follows:

Main Entry: Gould, Stephen Jay.
Title: The mismeasure of man [sound recording]
Book Number: RC 17413
Holding Agency: DLC-B NLS/BPH
Format: Audio Cassette Book

the full citation for the NLS audio book can be found at:
<http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?bphp:14:./temp/~bphp_MfDo::>
note the two terminal colons at the end of the URI -- it won't work without 
them!

i apologize for the U.S.-centric nature of the above citation, but the book 
is probably pretty widely available in alternative formats from libraries 
for the blind and physically handicapped around the world -- not to mention 
local libraries, as well -- for stephen jay gould's work tends to be quite 
popular, as well as best-selling, despite the oft-complex nature of the 
subjects about which he writes...

he's also a very readable, and, more often than not, quite an entertaining, 
author...

I am principled, you are stubborn, he is pigheaded.
