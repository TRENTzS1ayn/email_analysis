Gene,

both behaviours are specified as possible for Accesskey by the HTML
specification for it. Although I cannot speak for Microsoft, and you should
really direct the question to them, I imagine the reason for the change was
based on testing or user feedback suggesting that the newer implementation
was better.

cheers

  Could you tell me why IE4.0 works with accesskey's and IE5.0 and above do
  not?   With IE5.0 if I hit the accesskey it will select that item but not
  process it (i.e. a link).   Is there a patch for IE?   Any help would be
  appreciated.
  
  Thank you,
