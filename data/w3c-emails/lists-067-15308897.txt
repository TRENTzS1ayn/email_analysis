Can you refer me to this?  I found one linked which is dated
August 23 http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20 and Wendy sent a URI
to the list on the 15th titled "Jason's latest draft" 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/wcag20-reformulation21.html

However, both of these only go up to guideline/section #5.  In
the teleconference there were multiple questions about whether
or not something should go in "section three or section six"
and this is confusing because I can't find where section six
is defined.

Is there anything in specific that I can do to help?  I'm a fair
editor and writer, and I love doing things like reshuffling and
rewriting guidelines.
