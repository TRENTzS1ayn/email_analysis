The situation is more complicated that this.  The 'name' attribute was
there first, so it is not fair to say that implementations which display
the 'name' attribute are not "good implementation."  It is also bad format
design to tell the machine one thing and the user something else.  

So there needs to be a more graceful migration strategy defined than that.

Agreed.  On the author side this is the only safe approach at present.  Do
both.  Similarly for areas in MAPs, IIRC.

This kind of migration problem is evident in variations in the
implementation of ALT and TITLE in the past, and will be far more common if
we try to reform HTML at all in the XHTML 2.0 and later releases.
