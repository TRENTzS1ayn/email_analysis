Hello,

I am trying to make the WCAG WG home page easier to use.

Please keep in mind that the intro page for the actual guidelines should be 
through: http://www.w3.org/WAI/gettingstarted or through the list of 
resources on the WAI home page: http://www.w3.org/WAI/#Resources

The working group home page is to help keep the working group focused and 
moving forwards.  Check it out and let me know what you think. Please be 
aware that I have not linked to all of the possible documents yet.  
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/working-group.html

I have divided our work into 3 major categories:
1. Revising WCAG1.0;
2. Developing Techniques for WCAG 1.0;
3. Clarifying WCAG 1.0

Comments welcome,
