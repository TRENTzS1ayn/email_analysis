I think this should be asked of WCAG - so I have forwarded it to them and
request it be discussed at the earliest possible opportunity on the agenda.

  Checkpoint 10.3
  Checkpoint text:
  Until user agents (including assistive technologies) render side-by-side 
  text correctly, provide a linear text alternative (on the current page or 
  some other) for all tables that lay out text in parallel, word-wrapped columns.
  Status: IBM's Home Page Reader in combination with Netscape Navigator (4.5, 
  Win98) and Henter Joyce's JAWS in combination with Microsoft Internet 
  Explorer (4.0 and higher, Win98) are instances of a browser and assistive 
  technology combination that can linearize a table. Opera (3.6, Win98) 
  allows a user to linearize tables. Lynx (2.81, Unix) renders tables by row. 
  Silas' Gateway and other tools being developed by the ER Working Group 
  [ER-IG] allow users to linearize tables. However, only Microsoft Internet 
  Explorer (4.0 and higher, Win98) with HelpDB and WWW with EmacsSpeak allow 
  a user to navigate within and between the cells of a table.
  
  
  Does this mean that we no longer need at linear text alternative?
