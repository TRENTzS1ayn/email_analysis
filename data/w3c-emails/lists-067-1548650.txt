Jonathan, do you really mean to be insulting to me?  We may be
having a comprehension problem, but if you're going to react in
a way that seems to question my "loyalty to cause" -- despite
being willing to take the time needed to work through this 
issue, as my repeated email messages haven proven that I'm
willing to do -- then you're likely to turn away even MORE
people who could be your strongest allies.

Perhaps this is just a communication error -- your "style" of
writing is vastly different from mine, and I certainly see how
confusion could result.
