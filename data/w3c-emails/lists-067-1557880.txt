I agree with this.

This "apologize" attitude, though, is bullsh*t.  For god's sake,
man, quit insulting those of us who are trying to work with you
on a solution, and stop harping on the idea that there's an
intentional attempt to disenfranchise people.

The -only- disenfranchisement that I've seen on this issue have
been the number of people who your attitude has turned off, and are
thus unwilling to work with you on this, and are waiting for a
better spokesman for the needs of CD users to come along.  I'm not
in that category myself (yet?), but little tricks such as suggesting
an "apology" should be made contribute very little to solving
this problem.
