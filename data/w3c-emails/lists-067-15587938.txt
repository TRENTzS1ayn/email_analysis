Do "pages" get ratings or does "content" get rating?  It's entirely
possible to have a specific _page_ which is not "double-A accessible"
but the _content_ is still accessible.

(I make this point now as a reminder that the bigger picture may
be whether or not the information is accessible, and not whether
one particular component is accessible.  A "page" is just one
component of the "content" just as a specific section of a page or
an applet is a component.  Of course, remember my perspective --
Edapta is all about making adaptive user interfaces. *grin*)
