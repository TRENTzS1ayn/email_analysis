How about "a text-only site doesn't take into account what we
_know_ to be the advantages of good visual design"?

We have to be careful that we do not forget that visual design
_is_ a useful and enhancing endeavor.  When done correctly, the
content _is_ made easier to comprehend through good design.  If
we deny this then we are being less than honest.

The fact that there are many examples of _poor_ visual design
should not discount the fact that _good_ visual design has
numerous benefits for visually-oriented audiences.  If we dismiss
this too easily then we risk alienating anyone who does rightly
understand the benefits of visual design.

This, I think, is a better statement of the "boring" sentiment --
a visually uninteresting presentation _does_ detract from the
ability of visual users to experience the content.
