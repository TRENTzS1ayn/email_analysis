If it is pieces of text, seperateed into different images, and put together
in a table, and teh alternative is likewise seperated (I can think of a piece
of software that does something like this :-(, then it may fall foul of the
requirements for tables, and it dfoes not in fact provide a useful
alternative (the "words":   HE L LOW OR L D are not really the same as "hello
world"...)

  I don't think it satisfies the user requirements for people with some 
  degree of low vision, especially if the font size is relatively small.
  
  As for formatting alternatives in existing user agents:
  
  If it's simply text inside an image, you can always piece it together using 
  a table and image fragments. Some such images get ugly when the font size 
  gets bigger, or when font color and background are changed, but that's 
  better than not being able to change font size  or color at all.  (also, 
  this technique breaks down if there's pictorial detail immediately behind 
  the image, but we should avoid that anyway since it decreases legibility)
  
  There are some buttons that can't be formatted this way, e.g. if the text 
  is written around the circumference of a circle.  But in that case the page 
  can't get a double A rating, IMHO.
  
  Of course when once we can count on browsers implementing CSS positioning, 
  we can  simply position the text in front of any image we please.  And once 
  we have good suport for SVG and accessibility thereof, we'll have much more 
  flexibility.
