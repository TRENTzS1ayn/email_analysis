Not all people with disabilities use magnifiers and assistive 
technology.  The main issues from a user agent perspective on images with 
text used for buttons are:

1. The user cannot configure the user agent to change the size of the text

2. The user cannot configure the user agent to change the color of the text

3. The user should be able to configure the user agent to turn images off, 
and the resize and change the color of the text equivalent for the image.

Resources designed in this way will force some users to turn off images for 
access to the content.
