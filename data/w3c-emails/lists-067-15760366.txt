There is another issue here, the issue of branding, i.e. creating a 
distinctive, memorable look that a person associates with a particular 
brand.  I understand the importance of branding.

I'd really like to hear from graphical designers if there are cases where 
branding requires non-standard fonts... instead of e.g. using a few small 
images for logos, bullets, and other decorations.. or even having a large 
image... and relying on text with a coordinated font and background color 
for the rest of the page.
