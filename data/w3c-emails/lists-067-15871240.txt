Lisa,

I've looked at the LD site a few times now, and wonder how it would work
for someone with a learning disability who was seeking the information
provided. There are no graphics on the page to assist with understanding,
and the scrambled letters that make up the headings are difficult to read.
Some of the short descriptions have significant grammar errors that make
understanding even more difficult. The first description indicates that LD
can be prevented in "children", but looking further, indicates the
prevention program is only for infants and toddlers, not "children" in the
typical sense of the word. A graphic of a toddler or infant could go a long
way to make it clear before the user click uselessly, that the prevention
is only for pre-schoolers. 

Seems to me the first concern in designing a web page should be to the
intended audience. Reading the page suggests that the intended audience is
those with learning disabilities, and the page doesn't accommodate those
needs at all. It's fine to decide, after your intended audience's needs are
met, to expand the audience to those with other types of disabilities, but
if doing so shuts out your intended audience, I don't see how it can
"expand" your readership so much as limits it. Many reading/learning
disabilities are characterized by the fact that words and letters that are
properly presented are scrambled when they get inside the head of the one
with the LD, and it's enough of a problem for them to re-space them to
understand them without someone deliberately scrambling and unscrambling
them.  The scrambling words are a cute idea, but, at least in my opinion,
they are inappropriate on a page for people who already have problems with
words scrambling. 

The two lines of small text at the top are easily overlooked by a sighted
user, are probably too small and indistinct to be read by someone with
dyslexia, but if they are replaced by a graphic that can be tagged as "The
association addresses 30 areas of mild disabilities" rather than the
specifics of the text, the real intent is for no one to read this text.
Hence, why is it there at all?

Likewise, why talk about a product that isn't ready for market yet, e.g.
the LD spell checker? Does anyone really believe people bookmark such pages
and come back weeks and months later to see if it has happened yet? If
someone is actually looking for such a product, its more likely they will
look elsewhere and terminate the search if nothing exists yet. 

My two-cents worth...

Anne
