Claus,

name is important - each frame has to have a name (so it can be a
target). But the title is what should be presented to the user (if it is
there) and where the author should give a real title of a few well-chosen
words. Having the option, or behaviour like that described for Home Page
Reader, is a good implementation solution (in my opinion).

cheers

  Hi,
  
  I am glad to see that we are not the only people who can disagree on this
  issue. The Danish approach to guidelines is very simple, we want to   follow
  both html and wai guidelines. On the other hand we have a very special
  situation in Denmark. With only  one screenreader, and a screenreader that
  supports WAI. In this situation it makes sense to try an influence Freedom
  Scientific to change the behavior of JFw, but we have to be 100 percent sure
  that we try to push Freedom in the right direction.
  
  My understanding of the previous mails is  as follows: for the future use
  title because in general the title tag is used to supply information about
  the contents of different elements. The name is an older more or less
  outdated tag that should insure backwards compatibility. If this is correct,
  and I hope someone more knowledgable of html than I will give a clear anser
  on this, then we can ask Freedom to change the way Ie5 and JFW behaves when
  incountering frames with either title or name or both. One idea that would
  be in line with JFW would be to make it an option like many other things so
  the user can choose wich information should be spoken.
  
  Regards
