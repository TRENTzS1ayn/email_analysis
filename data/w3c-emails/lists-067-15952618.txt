I think that there is a market requirement to be able to have fairly reliable
presentation of content. If there wasn't, I don't think we would have such a
profusion of techniques and methods, some of them really quite expensive and
difficult, used to provide it on a web that hasn't really been built to
support it.
 
(By reliable I mean won't change in the majority of browsers used by the
majority of people, where the term majority is being misused to mean
perceived majority)

There is an accessibility need to be able to read content.

I think these two constraints are going to stay with us, and we have to work
out how to make as much intersection as possible. 

It is worth clarifying that in some cases a presentation will need to be
changed, for example because a person who can't distinguish red from green
may not be able to distinguish the company logo from the background unless
they make a change to the presentation. But there is inherent value in (good)
presentation design, and branding promotes easy recognition which can be
valuable to people with certain types of disability. This applies as much to
the use of a little house icon to mean a home page as it does to the use of a
large yellow "m" to mean hamburgers in soft buns.

  There's a discussion on this under the title "[WW] Use of Textual Graphics 
  on Web Pages" which was on the er list, but which I asked to be moved to 
  WAI-IG.  The title change came after I asked for opinions from web 
  designers and Kynn took the question to a designers list.. and got some 
  very helpful feedback.
  
  My personal opinion is that we need to distinguish between sites that are 
  fundamentally informational (e.g. a posting of zoning regulations on a 
  township web site) vs. those that are fundamentally artistic.  There's also 
  the category of commercial sites in which integrated text and graphics play 
  a strong branding role.   I realize this can all be very subjective.  On 
  the other hand, the law is full of subjective criteria.
  
  Like I say, I trying to put the discussion on the WAI-IG list.  Lets see 
  what comes up there.  I'll report back with my own take on it if you-all 
  would like.
  
  This may eventually be best put into the techniques document or some other 
  note.  I think will be hard to make crisp guidelines out of  this aspect of it.
