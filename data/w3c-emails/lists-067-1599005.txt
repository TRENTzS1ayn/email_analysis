That's not a version of the page I requested -- the page I requested
(the one you SEEMED to be talking about) was the home page of the
Web Accessibility Initiative.  Here's the URL:

     http://www.w3.org/WAI/

Can you show me how to make that page accessible?  Are you trying
to say that the principles are:

1.  Break it down into smaller pages, and
2.  Use graphical icons?

--Kynn, has no idea why he's bothering with Jonathan anymore, but
        hey, I'll give it the old college try
