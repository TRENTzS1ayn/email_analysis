Mike,

a major problem with flash (as I understand it) is that flash players are not
accessible to assistive technologies. I may be working on outdated
information here (I would be really pleased to know that I am), but until
this problem is solved there will be a requirement for a non-flash
alternative.

Cheers

Charles McCN

  I would also like to work with the group on updating the current examples of
  Flash on the site, which definitely could use a lot of work.
