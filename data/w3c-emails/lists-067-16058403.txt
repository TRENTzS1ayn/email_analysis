Marshall,

Thank you for writing this up!

Based on all of this information, do you think there is anything missing 
from the current draft of the reformulation?  Is there something else we 
need to add?

Do you know how this changes as the eye is less able to distinguish between 
colors or shapes?

What about people with Attention Deficit Disorder?  Does the delay in 
movement apply to them as well?  It is my understanding that it doesn't, 
that any movement will continue to distract them. Lisa, can you comment on 
this?

Thanks,
--wendy
