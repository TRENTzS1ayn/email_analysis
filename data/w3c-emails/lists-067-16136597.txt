A regular Web Content Guidelines working group meeting will be held on
Thursday, 20 hours UTC (4 PM Boston, 10 PM France, 7 AM Friday Eastern
Australia) on the W3C/MIT Longfellow bridge: +1-617-252-1038, with the
following agenda:

The purpose of this teleconference is to establish the agenda for the face
to face meeting next week. Please review the list of open issues at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/gl/wcag20-issues.html
and consider these questions:

a. Which of the open issues would you like to discuss at the face to face
meeting?

b. Are there additional issues, not included in the current list, which
you would like to discuss at the meeting? If so, please raise them via the
mailing list, with specific reference, if possible, to the guidelines
and/or checkpoints from the 2.0 draft to which they apply. This will help
to ensure that the items to be considered for inclusion in the agenda of
the face to face meeting are as clear and specific as practicable.

c. In respect of each open issue that you would like to raise at the face
to face meeting, can you propose a resolution which you think should be
considered and, potentially, voted upon by the working group?

As always, it would be advantageous to discuss the foregoing questions on
the mailing list prior to the teleconference tomorrow.
