The issue that deals with the possible requirement of knowing the 
capabillities of assistive technologies is a bit troubling since we are big 
on Device Independence. There's some "ivory tower" in me that wants to 
believe that there's some idealized way to deal with any "device" - even 
one that hasn't even been designed or built yet. Failing that I guess we 
have to try to be as abstract/general as we can without being totally 
ridiculous. This issue is also included in #6. Sounds like a task for Al 
Gilman!

The issue that proposes (Ian Jacobs #7) categorizing the principles into 
perception/senses, meaning, usability.

And #14 (usability testing) rounds out my top choices.

I've no concrete proposals for any of these, but that's why we're having a 
meeting?
