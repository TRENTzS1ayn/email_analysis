I put up  a draft of the table format up at
http://special-needs.org/tablecheckp1.html It is a draft, just to see if we
think techniques are clearer in a table format.
Before anyone gets upset, I have not even tried edit (typos? me?) ....This
is just to see if we like the general format.
I have only done the first three checkpoints.

Things to note:
The first checkpoint has (I think) the most techniques, so it makes it the
hardest to present in this form.
I left out examples, The table was just getting too big. We could link them
in, or just add them (as with the original techniques document).

I do not know if this type of presentation is an improvement -
Your comments......
