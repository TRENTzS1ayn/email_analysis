Based on the version of the issues list served today (I assume it changes
from time to time) I think that Issues 1 and 6 are more or less the same
(documenting base requirements and how we arrive at them, and whose
responsibility it is to solve each problem).

I would like to add the issue of how to make sure that multimedia content is
accessible directly (i.e. to people who can see or hear it, rather than to
people who will rely on an alternative form of the content).

  A regular Web Content Guidelines working group meeting will be held on
  Thursday, 20 hours UTC (4 PM Boston, 10 PM France, 7 AM Friday Eastern
  Australia) on the W3C/MIT Longfellow bridge: +1-617-252-1038, with the
  following agenda:
  
  The purpose of this teleconference is to establish the agenda for the face
  to face meeting next week. Please review the list of open issues at
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/gl/wcag20-issues.html
  and consider these questions:
  
  a. Which of the open issues would you like to discuss at the face to face
  meeting?
  
  b. Are there additional issues, not included in the current list, which
  you would like to discuss at the meeting? If so, please raise them via the
  mailing list, with specific reference, if possible, to the guidelines
  and/or checkpoints from the 2.0 draft to which they apply. This will help
  to ensure that the items to be considered for inclusion in the agenda of
  the face to face meeting are as clear and specific as practicable.
  
  c. In respect of each open issue that you would like to raise at the face
  to face meeting, can you propose a resolution which you think should be
  considered and, potentially, voted upon by the working group?
  
  As always, it would be advantageous to discuss the foregoing questions on
  the mailing list prior to the teleconference tomorrow.
