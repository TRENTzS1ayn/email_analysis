I may have missed the point, but saying no text on images would disqualify
our WAI accessibility (priority level) logo.

  Nope. Everyone's missing the "point" - there is no such entity as "image
text". When an image is made of <em><strong>anything </em></strong>it
becomes "image" and must endure the same requirements whether it is an image
of text or an image showing apples vs. oranges. It requires a textual
equivalent.

  KB::  "I don't think anyone is claiming it's not, so I'm not sure you need
to make this point so forcefully. :)"

  WL: The reason I'm sure that I do need to make the point "forcefully" is
that somehow it has been allowed to slip by that images of text are a
special case of images. They are not. IMO this also goes for PDF. The clear
purpose of the guidelines applicable to this entire genre is that if there's
any semantics in there it must be teased out. If not, then...
