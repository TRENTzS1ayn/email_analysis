Of course it is not an improvement visually, that was not the point, and as
I said in the email I am not even trying to get it done right.
Let me explain the exercise. People were concerned that have techniques
guideline and other material in different documents, make it hard for some
of us orientate with in the guidelines,- what belongs with what, to know
when have we done every thing etc.
So it was suggested that a table may help. That way you can see that you
have done the checkpoints with the suggested techniques, in one shot - Maybe
helpful and maybe not.
Now I am not going to rewrite the guidelines, (and I am assuming that there
would be a lot of sound objections if I were to try) into sound bites. This
table is  just a demonstration of an idea. An idea that if followed though
would require agreement on a lot of points - what to do with the examples,
whether to drop the "don't use ..." part etc...
Personally I feel if we are to drop the "don't use ..." part, then the table
becomes useless. You do not have all the information in one place.
So Ignoring visual problems and stuff like that, having seen a table format,
do we still think that it will aid comprehension? Or is putting so much info
in one table, a lost course?
That is the question.

Lisa,

Visually, this isn't an improvement, it's a disaster. When using tables
like this, the text in each cell of the table should be succinct not
rambling. You should be able to view *at least* one full row of the table
on a "typical" screenfull. For example, in the first item in HTML prsented
on the table, the text first says dont use ..." " ... then says, but if you
use it ... " " ... One or the other should be prsented in the table, not
both. It would be better to drop the "don't use ..." part and just present
the solution. Too much information is put in each cell and the result is
that the information is too chopped up to be usable. If the information is
to be presented in a table, it needs to be re-written so that only the "do"
is presented, not the why's and wherefor's.
