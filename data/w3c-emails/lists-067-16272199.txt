It might be a valuable editing tool - we can easily see where there are gaps
in the techniques, as we move across different technologies.

(We can't tell if there are checkpoints missing, but that's another, seperate
task...)

If it is easy, keep with it. But if it takes much work, we can probably find
another way and use your brain power at a higher level...

cheers

  Let me explain the exercise. People were concerned that have techniques
  guideline and other material in different documents, make it hard for some
  of us orientate with in the guidelines,- what belongs with what, to know
  when have we done every thing etc.
  So it was suggested that a table may help. That way you can see that you
  have done the checkpoints with the suggested techniques, in one shot - Maybe
  helpful and maybe not.
  Now I am not going to rewrite the guidelines, (and I am assuming that there
  would be a lot of sound objections if I were to try) into sound bites. This
  table is  just a demonstration of an idea. An idea that if followed though
  would require agreement on a lot of points - what to do with the examples,
  whether to drop the "don't use ..." part etc...
  Personally I feel if we are to drop the "don't use ..." part, then the table
  becomes useless. You do not have all the information in one place.
  So Ignoring visual problems and stuff like that, having seen a table format,
  do we still think that it will aid comprehension? Or is putting so much info
  in one table, a lost course?
  That is the question.

  Lisa,
  
  Visually, this isn't an improvement, it's a disaster. When using tables
  like this, the text in each cell of the table should be succinct not
  rambling. You should be able to view *at least* one full row of the table
  on a "typical" screenfull. For example, in the first item in HTML prsented
  on the table, the text first says dont use ..." " ... then says, but if you
  use it ... " " ... One or the other should be prsented in the table, not
  both. It would be better to drop the "don't use ..." part and just present
  the solution. Too much information is put in each cell and the result is
  that the information is too chopped up to be usable. If the information is
  to be presented in a table, it needs to be re-written so that only the "do"
  is presented, not the why's and wherefor's.
