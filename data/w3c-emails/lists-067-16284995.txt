> with the techniques for that checkpoint. In IBM, we have found that the best
> approach is to have a separate checklist for each technology. For example, we
> could have added techniques for developing accessible Lotus Notes applications
> to the software checklist. But, when someone is creating a form in Lotus Notes,
> they just want to know what they have to do to make that form accessible. They
> don't really care about the original principle from which the techniques were
> derived. So rather than make them wade through checkpoints that don't apply and
> techniques for a technology they are not currently using, we chose to develop
> separate checklists for Lotus Notes developers.
