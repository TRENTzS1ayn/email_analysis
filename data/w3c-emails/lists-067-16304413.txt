A new draft of "WCAG 2.0" is available at: 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-20000928.html

The list of changes is at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/change-history.html

The issues for WCAG 2.0 are at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wcag20-issues.html

Note that there is an open issue for Lisa's suggested edits [1] as well as 
one for Andi's suggested edits [2].  I think we need consensus that their 
proposals have been adequately incorporated into the draft. Therefore, I 
have put 3 options as "Proposals" for each issue:
Approve of these edits and keep.
Disprove of these edits.
Approve of these edits with changes.

If you "approve edits with changes" you need to propose the wording for the 
changes.
