In today's teleconference Gregory suggested that from the home page we link 
to all of the test pges that we have created.  Good suggestion! I had 
forgotten about how many we've done over the last year!  Many more to do, 
but I have linked to the 11 that we currently have at: 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/Overview.html#techniques-tests

I hope this inspires people to create more!

Enjoy!
