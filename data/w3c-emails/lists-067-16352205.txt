This implies that we will only look at the "edits" and that we will only 
make decisions about them. This is unrealistic. We must go through the 
whole thing."to determine if we should keep as is or ? modify and try 
again" - IMHO. Not proposing that we make edits at F2F, only that we 
isolate what needs editing. And not just from the latest changes.
