Hi folks,

I agree with Kynn that we are here to meet the needs of 
all users with disabilities. If we have not done so to date, 
it is certainly not out of ill will, and therefore I don't 
think apologies are required. It is more likely that other 
constraints, including human resources, time, and 
understanding the problems, have prevented us
from doing more (and more is clearly required). 

I personally cannot apologize for being busy trying to 
produce three Recommendations to promote the accessibility
of the Web. I am convinced that all of us here are just
as dedicated and just as busy. There is more work to be
done, notably on CD, and the WG has been expending considerable
energy and bandwidth to improve the situation.

Please continue to use the list to promote and exchange
ideas so that more can be done for the communities we
are trying to serve. If you want to address extra-professional
issues, please do so off the list with the Chairs or the 
W3C Team members in this Working Group.

Thank you,

 - Ian
