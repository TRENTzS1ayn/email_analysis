Because of a "senior moment" I had sent this with a  wrong subject line. I 
think that checkpoint 1.1 and 1.2 under guideline 1 could be consolidated as:

Provide textual equivalents to auditory and graphical presentations 
(synchronized where appropriate) so that every component of a document, web 
page or multimedia presentation can be rendered as text in a standard 
character set.

The explanatory material beneath the 2 current checkpoints would still be 
needed in some form.

************************************
The overall document could be used as a self-reflexive example of what 
guideline 2 is about. We are using three (at least) "looks" to emphasize 
the structure of our document. This information about the structure should 
be explained in our text.

The Guidelines are blue, the checkpoints bold, the explanations "normal". 
This is done so that a blindless reader can read faster. In order to give a 
similar advantage to an "eyes-free" user (how's that as a euphemism for 
"blind guy"?) this structural presentation needs to be available to the 
screen reader so that its user can perform a similar skim.

If anyone can come up with an appropriate illustrative icon, that too could 
be a symbol for the structure - and so on. We should use what we're doing 
as an example of why and how we are doing it. It's not just prettification 
- it's (possibly undocumented) structure. So the document itself can be its 
own example of a technique.

This is the World Wide Web and we are claiming that it need not be 
dishwater dull - so where's the elephants and dancing girls? Icons and 
sounds aren't just sensual artifacts, they're structural (via presentation) 
elements and critics (correctly?) contend that we're demanding that they 
create sites as boring as ours.
