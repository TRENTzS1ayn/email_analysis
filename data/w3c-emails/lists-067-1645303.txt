aloha, judy!

on the list of upcoming meetings contained on the EO home page
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/#Meetings>
there is a meeting scheduled for 4pm on Thursday, April 13, which conflicts 
with the regularly scheduled Web Contents Guidelines (GL) working group's 
teleconference (Thursdays at 4pm, Boston time -- check
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/#UpcomingMeetings> for further details)

this, i fear, will prove problematic, as the alternate Thursday telecons 
for the EO WG were expressly set up for the benefit of those who can't 
participate in the regularly scheduled EO meetings due to the hour -- 
8:30am Boston time -- at which they are held...  in particular, it was 
deemed an appropriate time to facillitate participation in the EO WG for 
individuals living on slash in the Pacific Rim...

the problem with the conflict, therefore, is that the GL working group is 
what one might call deeply Aussie-fied -- as it is co-chaired by an 
Australian, and has several other key Australian members (namely Charles 
and Tim) who participate regularly in the GL call...

one last point -- given that the U.S. and Europe have turned their clocks 
forward, whilst others have turned theirs back, 4pm boston time is now 
awfully early for people living in the pacific rim -- according to my 
calculations, it translates into 8am in New Zealand (Auckland time), 6am in 
Australia (Melbourne time), and 5am in Japan (Tokyo time), which defeats 
the purpose of having an alternate meeting time...  would it, therefore, be 
possible to reschedule the alternate EO meeting at a later time -- perhaps 
8pm Boston time?

is this as big a problem as i anticipate it might prove to be?  i know that 
i would prefer to participate in a Thursday meeting myself, as i have a 
recurring conflict with the Friday meeting time...  if. however, i have to 
choose between GL and EO, i will opt for the former...  i'd rather not be 
faced with an either-or choice, but if -- for logistical reasons -- the 
alternate call is locked into a 4pm Boston time slot, then i will only be 
able to participate in EO via the list...
