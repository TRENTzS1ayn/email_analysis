Kynn, Nice web site. Didn't see it in it's previous colors.  Interesting
use of style sheets to change the seasons on one's web site! Reminds me, I
need to update my Halloween page and hang it on our site soon!

Well said, Kynn. In an earlier note to Alan I mentioned Flash which
provides a presentation in which text and graphics are displayed while a
sound file duplicates the text ... What else is needed for this to be

instead of the problem?
