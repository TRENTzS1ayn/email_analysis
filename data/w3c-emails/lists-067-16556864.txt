On the issue of branding...
I am aware of a company that has as a part of its branding the use of a
particular font for headings in documents.  This font treatment predates the
Web, and is used in a variety of paper-based branding materials.  Millions
of dollars have been spent building this brand.  The font in question is not
installed on many systems, and is not likely to be for a variety of
non-technical reasons.  Part of the branding requirement is that the font
appear in an anti-aliased form.  As a result of all of this, there are
headings created in gifs (with alt text) on some of this company's Web
sites.  

The Web developers and designers would actually prefer not to do this, since
it's a lot of extra work and makes automated creation of content difficult. 
 
But, there really isn't a good alternative.  

So, they do it.

There is another issue here, the issue of branding, i.e. creating a 
distinctive, memorable look that a person associates with a particular 
brand.  I understand the importance of branding.

I'd really like to hear from graphical designers if there are cases where 
branding requires non-standard fonts... instead of e.g. using a few small 
images for logos, bullets, and other decorations.. or even having a large 
image... and relying on text with a coordinated font and background color 
for the rest of the page.
