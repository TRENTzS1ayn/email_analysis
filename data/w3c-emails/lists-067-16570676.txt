Hi Wendy and everyone else --

I had some spare time today and so I converted the WCAG 2.0
document into XML -- http://kynn.com/working/wcag2/wcag2.xml
-- and wrote an XSLT stylesheet -- 
http://kynn.com/working/wcag2/wcag2base.xsl -- to recreate
the current page -- http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/ -- using
XSLT -- http://kynn.com/working/wcag2/wcag2.html

Once that was done, I wrote a few "demo stylesheets" to show
how we can extract specific things from the XML document using
specific stylesheets:

1.  Stylesheet http://kynn.com/working/wcag2/wcag2checkpoints.xsl
     creates a linear list of checkpoints
     http://kynn.com/working/wcag2/checkpoints.html

2.  Stylesheet http://kynn.com/working/wcag2/wcag2glossary.xsl
     creates a glossary listing as a separate file
     http://kynn.com/working/wcag2/glossary.html

FOR MY NEXT TRICK

Next of course I will need to add the technology-specific
checkpoints to the XML file (once we have some of those written
up!), and write appropriate XSLT stylesheets to extract that 
information -- inline with the "base" document, sorted by technology
type, etc.

I might do that on the plane on Sunday.

I'll make sure to bring copies on disk of all these XML, XSLT, and
HTML files mentioned.
