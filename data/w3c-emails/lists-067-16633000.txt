There is something that is targeted to be something better in the
development pipeline.  This is the scalable vector graphics format or SVG.

Buttons in this format will look just the way you want them to (it says
here).  They don't require ALT text because their text content is present
as text right there in the XML that defines the graphic.  The main question
is browser implementation so we can then push authors to use it.
