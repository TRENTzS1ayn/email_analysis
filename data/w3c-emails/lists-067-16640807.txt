Add JavaScript/ECMAScript, HTTP, CGI ?

As I head for Bristol I'll try to ponder some of this. I think it's well 
worth dealing with. The part that caught my eye most was:

"1.1.3 (HTML4, XHTML):
Use the longdesc attribute on the img tag to specify long descriptions of 
complex images"

The integration of the techniques with the changes in the underlying 
technology hasn't been addressed specifically enough IMO. Why bother 
someone's pretty little head about when/how to use CSS if they're merely 
going to be severely frustrated by results when they try to use it 
inappropriately?

Etc.
