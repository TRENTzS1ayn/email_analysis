Members might like to contact one of these CD colleagues.
They have all done extensive research in the area of graphics, communication
and IT.
I have found them very helpful and encouraging.

Sally and Richard are both promoting the use of graphics with emails for CD.
They also are keen to promote the use of powerpoint presentations.
Members will readily recognise that ppp use few words and concentrates on
the synopsis and presentation.

Chris is promoting the means of communication, including the web for CD
