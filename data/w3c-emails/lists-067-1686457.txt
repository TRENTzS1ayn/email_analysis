Somebody asked me about C-sile. Here is the information also for others who
are interested:

It is actually C-SILE. Here is more information

http://csile.oise.on.ca/

It is an example of a computer supported learning environment. It helps to
gather information, categorize it and find questions, hypothesis, arguments
and counterarguments. There are also others like it.

I just thought that a tool like that might be helpful in gathering our
questions, resources and hypothesis together when trying to understand and
solve this problem. But ofcourse it is not the only way.
