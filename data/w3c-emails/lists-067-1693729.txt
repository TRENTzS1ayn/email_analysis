Dear Charles,

Thanks for forwarding this concern.  I would agree that it is a major bug
(with HTML 4.01) and puts the WCAG in an awkward position since the linked
technique document now recommends code fragments which are not valid HTML.

Wish I had spotted this before 4.01 was released!  Oh well, there is always
4.02!

Please keep me posted with your progress on bringing this oversight to the
attention of the powers that be...

Cheers,
Bruce Bailey
