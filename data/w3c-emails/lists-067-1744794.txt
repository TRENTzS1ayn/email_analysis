Jon,
No these are not out of scope.

The following requirement does not mention scripting specifically, but I 
believe it covers it, "eneralized across technologies: WCAG 1.0 primarily 
addresses the needs of an accessible HTML page. WCAG 2.0 needs to encompass 
emerging technologies such as XML-based languages (e.g., SVG, SMIL, MathML, 
etc.)."

we are dealing with improved navigation markup now. I sent a proposal to 
the UA and WCAG mailing lists on Tuesday.

Also, I believe those issues are covered by the following open issues cited 
in the requirements draft document:
"-Accurately identify what works, what may not, and why - test techniques, 
give results. ideas should be verified in some way. usability testing as we 
draft. how collect data? Deal with the "until user agents" clause which 
causes confusion.
-specify user needs. even if we don't have an answer, we still need to 
describe the problem and whether the need is being met.?
-Guidance to create pages for people with cognivite and learning 
disabilities, primarily navigation issues."
