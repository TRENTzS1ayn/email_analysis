I was working on this problem last year.  The work-around that I created 
used style sheets and scripting.

When scripts are on, the submenu would appear after a mouse click (rather 
than mouse over) or a keyboard event (pressing the enter key).  This event 
caused the submenu, as defined as a style sheet "layer," to be displayed.

When scripts are off style sheets are also not loaded and the submenus 
appear with the menu bar in an outline.

refer to http://sun.trace.wisc.edu/mwc

an outdated write up is available at: 
http://sun.trace.wisc.edu/~chisholm/dhtml/  note that it has not been 
touched in over a year <wendy blushes from embarrasment>.  I have been 
hoping to get back to it for a while but have not.

comments?  anyone want to play with it? help me bring it up to date?
