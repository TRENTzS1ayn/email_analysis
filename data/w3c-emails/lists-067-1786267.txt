Interesting quotes:
1. From the initial opening of The Learning Centre we found that, in common 
with the majority of our 16-19 year old students, a number of students with 
mild to moderate learning difficulties and disabilities from the School of 
Learning Support were eager to explore our new IT facilities and make use 
of the available on-hand IT support. The Learning Centre can act as an 
effective motivator for students who want to be involved in this exciting 
and attractive development. We soon found that The Learning Centre offered 
an excellent opportunity for SLDD students to integrate with mainstream 
students in a relatively non-threatening environment. Our experience showed 
that students from the School of Learning Support were often quiet and 
withdrawn when initially entering the Centre, but that their confidence 
generally increased as their IT skills improved.

2. Firstly, students with poor Literacy skills were attracted to the high 
pictorial content of many web-sites and enjoyed being able use of a 
facility which is still widely considered to be at the cutting edge of 
technology In addition, the students were able to recognise icons for 
navigating the Web and, in doing so, were able to direct their own learning.
