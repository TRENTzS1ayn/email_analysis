It seems that we have at least 3 approaches that can all be explored at the
same time and that can support each other when we gather the results
together. 1) Learn about the various groups of CD users, 2) learn about the
problems that individual CD users have and create sample scenarios for
them, 3) think about what makes the use of web easy in general as even if
that is not always enough that probably also helps CD users.

Charles's suggestions go to the last category and I tried to brainstorm
couple of more very drafty visual guidelines from this point of view with
no connection to any disabilities yet but for general usability:

GL: Think carefully what are the main points you want to communicate.
Provide images and diagrams highlighting the main points in your
presentation. It is good practice if users can get an idea of the content
by browsing through the images.

GL: Try to simplify complicated explanations by providing examples and
outlines that help the users to see the structure as a whole before going
into details. Support the explanation with images and do simplify them too
so that the message is clear.

GL: Provide visual diagrams of data that help to understand the context and
compare and relate the data. Provide visual outlines of architectures or
other structures.

GL: Use several graphical means to relate visual object (- this is actually
don't use color alone GL) e.g. gestalt rules. Actually we never mentioned
interaction of colors in the GL = a little patch of color surrounded by
other color can look totally different when the surrounding color changes.

GL: Try to disambiguate the images so that there are no hidden pictures
e.g. some see white object on black and others black object on white. No
not use black stripes or color that interfere e.g. all the psychological
stuff that you see in textbooks.

GL: When you want to communicate a difference make it clear in the image.
E.g. not lines that are almost the same lenght but clearly have a clear
difference in lenght.

etc.
