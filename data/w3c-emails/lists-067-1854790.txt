This looks like a good starting point for improving the likelihood that a
greater number of individuals will obtain meaning from images and visual
layout.  I especially like the "whole to part" suggestion although we will
also need to consider the needs of those who must construct their own "whole
from the parts" along with those who must extract the "parts from the whole"
in order to make information meaningful.  That's why this CD stuff can be so
difficult.  One persons support can become another's barrier.

With regard to more in-depth use of images to convey meaning, I know of no
better source than that works of Edward R. Tufte.  His works from Grpahics
Press are:

1. The Visual Display of Quantitative Information
2. Envisioning Information
3. Visual Explanations

If anyone has the time and inclination to dig deeply into this topic, these
are useful resources.
