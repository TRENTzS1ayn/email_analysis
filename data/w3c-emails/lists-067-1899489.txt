Another thing that seems pretty concrete (and was first proposed by Jonathan
months ago):

Designate an image as a link for a website. For many companies this is easy-
they already use a logo graphic throughout their site as a link to the front
of it.

  This looks like a good starting point for improving the likelihood that a
  greater number of individuals will obtain meaning from images and visual
  layout.  I especially like the "whole to part" suggestion although we will
  also need to consider the needs of those who must construct their own "whole
  from the parts" along with those who must extract the "parts from the whole"
  in order to make information meaningful.  That's why this CD stuff can be so
  difficult.  One persons support can become another's barrier.
  
  With regard to more in-depth use of images to convey meaning, I know of no
  better source than that works of Edward R. Tufte.  His works from Grpahics
  Press are:
  
  1. The Visual Display of Quantitative Information
  2. Envisioning Information
  3. Visual Explanations
  
  If anyone has the time and inclination to dig deeply into this topic, these
  are useful resources.
