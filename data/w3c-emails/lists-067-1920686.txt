Jonathan, can you help me understand how translating to a standardized
iconographic language with a vocabulary of 1000 words is different than
translating to an English vocabulary of similar size (my guess on 3rd grade
reading level)?

I am not sure quite what the question refers to, however.

red bus is very different to the icon red bus.

If the bus icon is single or double deck it will effect the meaning.

we don't need to know the word deck to recognise the difference in life or
icon.

the nuances in icons are ver much finer than in words. hence the user will
be more prone to possible confusion. words allow of generalisation, and this
is just where CD clients have problems.
They tend to take the meanings very literally.

You or I will accept a cambell soup can as a place holder for can as in am
able, this is just not possible for many CD clients.
