WL: We're eagerly looking forward to see your development of this
graphical representation.

I have tried to indicate to everyone on this list that it is a group effort
that is required.
I have already produced http://www.peepo.com/access
If members are happy with this then I am happy to assign copyright to W3C
In another case I am awaiting someone or more peoples attempts to improve on
it.

We do need a symbolic site as well
However it is well recognised that it is first important to create the ideal
text before translation.

I have yet to recieve any indication that this has been achieved.

discussions about what is being tried are not that helpful, what I need is
someone elses attempt to improve or meet between or aside the current and
proposed.

I shall look forward to furthering this on receipt of anothers attempt and
do not appreciate continuous suggestions that nothing has been done.

Sourcing graphics is very labour intensive.
