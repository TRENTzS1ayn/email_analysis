The ideal would be to attach images selected by the user to match-patterns
in the structure graph of the site.  So the icon would recur when the
navigation structure pattern is detected on another site.

Links covering a neighborhood of where you are now is a navigation resource.

Indented table of contents bar is best current presentation of this on Web
