Logic: (information model)

TradeMarks, ServiceMarks, and corporate Logos are directly related to a)
the principal topic of a sub-site and/or b) the corporate author/sponsor of
a whole site by which I mean the namepace
<http://www.yourdomainmnemonic.suffix/*>.  So a little processing is
suggested.  If the page does not bind directly to an icon as the button for
linking to this page, the metadata for ancestors in the URL path to the
page is searched and the least ancestor defining a button icon is used as
the [nomination for] button definition.

Client-side application is as one saves references to sites one wants to
visit again.

See the search results at infind.com for a related technique.
