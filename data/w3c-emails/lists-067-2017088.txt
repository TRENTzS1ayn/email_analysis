Sorry, now I see that this was actually meant to be a TOC with Yahoo style
hierarchy. I didn't read the headings so carefully (as is actually quite
common with many users) and after several selections ended up to
http://www.peepo.com/access/examples/alt.html with no info at all of where
I was.

What is confusing to me is that the headings are currently not consistently
keeping the navigation bar information on top (e.g.
http://www.peepo.com/access/alt_tags.html or
http://www.peepo.com/access/examples/alt.html) or using the exact words in
the user selected link on the bar  (e.g. http://www.peepo.com/access/ ->
http://www.peepo.com/access/contents.html, or
http://www.peepo.com/access/contents.html ->
http://www.peepo.com/access/design.html).

Has someone tested these kinds of step by step TOCs with CD users? Are they
better than other alternatives?
