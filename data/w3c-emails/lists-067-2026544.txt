This thread started (I had hoped) to lead to the creation of "a symbolic
WAI homepage" and Jonathan's site, although providing some provocation
and suggesting some methods has nothing to do with the WAI homepage.

Would it be possible to try to utilize some of Marja's (and others')
efforts to address the real world? I made a rather feeble essay last
year: http://dicomp.pair.com/wai.htm but didn't get (or really expect?)
much response.

As we generalize it might be helpful to maintain some particularization
as well? What works/fails in the area of making a largely symbolic
"portal" to the WAI?
