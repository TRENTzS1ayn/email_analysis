That's the basic idea. (Even people can provide an icon though - for example,
a photograph of me might mean me, whereas a drawing of a person probably
wouldn't).

  Do you mean that companies can provide the image as metadata for their
  site? Then the search engines or browsers showing links as text to the
  sites could alternative provide the image? And that could be controlled by
  the user settings?
  
  Companies who provide the image would have the benefit of being more easily
  spotted from a long list of links. So they probably would like to do that.
