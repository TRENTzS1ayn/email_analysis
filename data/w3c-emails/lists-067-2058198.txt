There is work on turning RDF into SVG and VRML - have a look at the rdf
interest group archives for discussions about GraphViz (for example
http://lists.w3.org/Archive/public/www-rdf-interest/2000Apr/0008 although
there are others), a tool that does this.

Danbri and Dan Connolly (within W3C) and others have worked on extracting
navigation information into RDF.

I have worked (in another context) on adding dictionaries to things (and
there are plenty of other people who have too).

So a lot of the tools stuff can be done, if we can bring together the right
pieces. Likewise, we need to work collaboratively to prduce results in the
form of examples - if one person had the answers we wouldn't need a working
group in the first place.

cheers

  The ideal would be to attach images selected by the user to match-patterns
  in the structure graph of the site.  So the icon would recur when the
  navigation structure pattern is detected on another site.

  Links covering a neighborhood of where you are now is a navigation resource.
  
  Indented table of contents bar is best current presentation of this on Web
  today.
  
  VRML of where you are in a Jungle Gym abstraction of the site is perhaps a
  yet more compelling metaphor.
