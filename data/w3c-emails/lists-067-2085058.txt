To understand how offensive I find this comment from Kynn please consider:

ASL is currently as I understand it provided for the benefit of deaf viewers
for some TV programs.

To suggest this is a supposed need is clearly not PC..

I do have published books with parallel text running to 90 pages that have
one page symbols and text with the opposite page having ASL diagrams and the
same text.

This is very helpful as when reading the client can try the sign diagram if
she does not 'get' the symbol, and thus has two bites at the cherry.

This is particularly useful for abstract containers such as 'name' and
'where'
The gesture offers an alternate and often public clue. Indeed many symbols
are in fact gestures as diagram.

consider: happy sad come go sit good stop no hello goodbye shh

the list goes on.

I do hope we can all accept that a significant proportion of people with CD
benefit from a multimodal experience. Particularly one that includes
pictures and gesture with words, perhaps that's why they like soaps.
