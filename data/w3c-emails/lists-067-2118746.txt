Jonathan,

Thank you very much for this writeup.   (I clipped it off for length but you
all know which one I mean.  The lengthly one about the WAI home page.)

I have a lot of questions but I wanted to first say that I got a lot out of
it - and it was a good example of how pages can be made accessible to more
than just people with CD.  In fact - so I don't muddy up this thank you for
taking the time to write it,  I am going to post my questions in another
message.

Thanks for taking the time to go through the page.   Lots of good ideas

Gregg
