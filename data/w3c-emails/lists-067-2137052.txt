I recieved an unsolicited catalogue from this company at work on friday, it
contained an advertisement for the wingman mouse with the "feel those icons"
tag. They had purchased my name from a mailing company. It is the first time
I have seen this product advertised in the UK, or indeed anywhere.
They clearly only supply to disability clients.
