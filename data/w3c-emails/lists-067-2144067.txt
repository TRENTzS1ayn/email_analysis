What is an ASL diagram? Do you have an example of one?

Could you explain a bit more or do you have an example on the web? I
understood this so that the user tries to read the text and when having
difficulties looks corresponding paragraph of symbolic images or
alternatively a paragraph with ASL diagrams?

Does this mean that we could have the text on the computer and a special
browser that toggles the selected text to symbols or asl diagrams when
needed (if it can be done automatically).

Do you mean abstract concept in general?

Many users in general benefit from multimodal experience, especially if
they have control to turn off/on selected modalities. So I don't think
there is much disagreement.

The discussion is probably more about priorities but there is so many
things for everybody to try to understand and learn from each other first
so I would worry about that discussion a bit later.
