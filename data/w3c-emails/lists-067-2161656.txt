Jonathan, I will agree with you that it is not well designed, but
I am not certain that I would consider all of these problems to
be -accessibility- issues as much as -usability- issues.  In other
words, I think the problems are of a different type than access
to the disabled; I feel that in many ways the problems are simply
with being usable by -anyone-, disability or not.

Okay, my problem here is that many people, myself included, use
the WAI home page as a starting point to locate resources.  I don't
want to have a straight linear "flip book" style for navigating
through the site, as I feel that will decrease overall usability.

A flip book -can- exist but if it is the only means of access to
the site, then there's a problem.

I think the audience needs to be defined.  Before we start looking
at redesigning any site, we need to consider who our audience is
going to be and what technical level we expect them to have.

Open question:  I've considered commissioning a logo for the HTML
Writers Guild's AWARE Center (http://www.awarecenter.org/) but I
have not been able to decide what correctly symbolizes "web
accessibility."  Can Jonathan or anyone else define what an
-appropriate- symbol would be?

(No, I don't consider a globe with a keyhole on it to be anything
other than arbitrary in this case...)

This assumption holds if we expect the majority of our audience to
be first time visitors.  I don't think we've established that.

Or, on the other hand, we could have a prominent "Is this your first
time?  Go here for an intro to WAI!" link before the navigation.  That
could lead into your proposed flip book.

Once more, I'm not sure we -are- looking for the first-time visitor.
The WAI site has to be a resource for WAI participants, and that may
be more important than meeting the needs of first time visitors, who
may be better served on a site like -- tooting my own horn -- the
AWARE Center, which -is- designed for non-technical web designers.

I don't think this is "internal" news, this is clearly external
news.

Question:  Why would a picture or photograph of Tim increase the
comprehension of this page?  Especially since the huge majority
of people don't know him by sight; I can't see how this helps
apart from arbitrary decoration.

Now, as far as arbitrary decoration goes, this isn't that bad,
and it does add a humanizing factor to the page -- but I see that
as general usability and not accessibility for people with
disabilities.

What do you mean about where the page ran out?

Again, this may not be a bad thing...

This is a good point but not, as I see it, a usability issue
again.  When you start making lists like this, you probably
should follow through on them later, as it shows a default
structure for the content of the page.  The WAI pages are not
very good on information structure.

Agreed.  The use of acronyms makes this hard to understand; I
would say that they need to be spelled out whenever possible,
which is to say, nearly all the time, and inline acronym notation
(IAN) should be used constantly.

Not sure I understand this comment.

I agree with you on the location here, and in fact I might move them
up one.  Actually, I'd scrap the whole WAI home page and redo it
from the start, myself. :)

Can you explain how to "engage in it"?
