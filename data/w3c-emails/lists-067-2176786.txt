I guess the first question is who do we target with this page and if I
understood right you want it to be more for ordinary users and designers
with not much knowledge of WAI but interested in making their pages
accessible? So it would not be a home page where technical users would
frequently return to find out what is new, or would it?

When looking for easy material there is the getting started page in
http://www.w3.org/WAI/gettingstarted and WAI intro slides
http://www.w3.org/Talks/WAI-Intro/Overview.html. Maybe these and other easy
introductions (like the quicktips you suggested) should be more visible on
the main page and the long lists of stuff or more technical stuff divided
to their own pages (I guess you suggested this as well). At least the
historical stuff could be behind an extra link.

In my opinion, concrete, helpful suggestions (like yours) are always more
than wellcome. I agree that there is a lot that can be improved when the
resourses give in to do it.
