This chap taplin or somesuch (Chuck might know, and I will find out soon)
made it clear to me that it is only by working
with a client(cd) group that one can make valid judgements.

To this extent I believe it is vital that WAI immediately employs somone
computer illiterate, (or me as nearly so :-)
because we will all benfit AND techies visiting will get a tighter line on
the drift.

It is kind of part of the QED argument.
By showing what you are doing people understand.
The analysis of method is beyond most.
Imagine if whilst drawing in an art class, I had to explain the physical
forces, color theory etc.
with CD this would be pointless, but when I draw the student can enjoy, and
gain confidence.

The WAI site is full of good intent and methodology, but vitally lacking in
example.

It currently shows almost no examples of gentle degredation and that is just
not helpful.

The way I learnt HTML  and immediately dropped, front page dream weaver, hot
sausage and a host of others I still have in the cupboard was by copy and
paste.
Where can you copy and paste HTML at WAI?


Of course there is lots that's great about WAI and it is you kind folks, so
sorry if I seem to be doing the whole thing down.

It really is hard to see where to start with the WAI homepage, there is just
so much of it.
visit microsoft, HP or anyone else, I have never seen anything like it and
truly believe it has gone off the rails....
