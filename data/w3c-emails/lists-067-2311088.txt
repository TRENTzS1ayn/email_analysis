I'm not convinced it's been tested on -anyone-.  I don't find this
site acceptable for most people who could be considered the core
audience for the WAI site -- and I'm also not convinced that the
WAI has -defined- that core audience.

However, I'd better stop here, as our goal is to find a good
example site rather than beat up on whoever has responsibility for
the WAI site.  Whether or not I find it acceptable (and I don't),
we need to remember that our purpose is understanding issues of
accessibility for people with disabilities, and not critiquing
the WAI site. :)
