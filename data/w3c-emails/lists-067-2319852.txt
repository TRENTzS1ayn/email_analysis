A regular working group meeting will be held on Thursday, 13 April, 2000
UTC, on the W3C/MIT Longfellow bridge: +1-617-252-1038

Agenda

There is broad agreement that the guidelines and checkpoints need to be
expressed in more general terms, to take account of the full diversity and
potential of current and forthcoming web-related standards and
technologies. In last week's teleconference, all members of the group were
invited to identify guidelines and checkpoints requiring generalization.
It is proposed to devote the entire meeting to this task, by working
systematically, so far as possible, through the guidelines and proposing
changes that would increase the generality of the requirements, whilst
enabling concrete implementation in the design of web content.
