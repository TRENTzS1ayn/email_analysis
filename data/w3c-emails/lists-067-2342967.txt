An important point to remember is that what is usability for a large group of
people may amount to accessibilty for a smaller group. THink of curb-cuts in
the physical world...

  Jonathan, I will agree with you that it is not well designed, but
  I am not certain that I would consider all of these problems to
  be -accessibility- issues as much as -usability- issues.  In other
  words, I think the problems are of a different type than access
  to the disabled; I feel that in many ways the problems are simply
  with being usable by -anyone-, disability or not.
