Although Guuideline 5 is the only one that actaully directly references a
'technique' - table use is the point that I generally have most problem
explaining to designers. Perhaps this needs to be clarified in Guideline
3 -(proper use of Markup) and 5 should deal with data presentation methods.
Regrets for todays meeting.
