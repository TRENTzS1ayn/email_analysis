Some additional thoughts:

There are several checkpoints that could be expressed collectively as mark up
semantics according the specification. For example, HTML provides markup for
various kind of semantic differences. Tables are one class of this (as well
as being one possible presentation of 2-dimensional data).

  In terms of generalization I've always had trouble with the selection of

  largely designed for ease of use by eyeballs. There is no singularity
  separating tables from bar charts, pie graphs, or any X-Y presentation
  of data that lends itself to that. In short the important consideration
  is that the content (raw data points) is separable from its
  presentation. I believe that the guidelines at their highest level of
  abstraction should deal with that and not with tables used as format vs.
  tables used as "tables". The latter are just a means of presenting
  underlying data to people of the retinal persuasion. Deal with all such
  issues in some technique/example space but the focus needs to be on
  maintaining access to the content, never mind what the author thinks is
  best for the reader.
