But it's also to remember that not all usability problems faced by
people with disabilities are automatically accessibility problems.

For example, the user interface to the HWG's online education program
is generally pretty poor -- it confuses people (blind and non-blind
students alike) but when someone who is blind asked me if our
interface is accessible, I answered, yes, it is -accessible-, because
it's equally unusable by people with or without disabilities!

So while I agree that there are some areas of overlap between
"usability for a larger group and accessibility for a smaller group,"
I caution us to remember that this is not a general rule.
