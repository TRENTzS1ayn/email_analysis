So if we would make tall enough barriers instead of curb-cuts they would be
accessible because everybody would suffer or not accessible if there could
still be couple of very athletic people jumping over?

I think that especially when we start thinking about CD, usability becomes
a greater issue for accessibility. In  my opinion a non-usable site (for
generic users) cannot be very accessible for disabled. Usually the site is
designed for some purpose and if no-one can achieve their goals does not
help users with special needs at all.

Ofcourse usability can be defined and measured in many ways so there might
be some cases were I agree with you. For instance, it might be that users
not relying on visual information might find an otherwise non-usable
graphic site accessible. But I wouldn't call the site generally accessible
(or usable) in that case. It would just be accessible for that user group,
in that context for achieving certain goals.
