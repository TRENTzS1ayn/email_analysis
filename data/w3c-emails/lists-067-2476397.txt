Len,

As you pointed out, HTML provides a simple way of marking up a set of headers
along the top and another along one side of a table. Using this would meet
the requirements of the checkpoint

[first issue snipped]    
  Another issue is that the proposed regulations require that
  
  "Markup shall be used to associate data cells and header cells for data 
  tables that have two or more logical levels of row or column headers."
  
  This is indeed a Priority 1 in the guidelines (checkpoint 5.2).  However, 
  for the simple, common case of nested headings along the top and left side 
  of a table, no additional markup is needed since HTML 4 provides an 
  algorithm http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/tables.html#h-11.4.3 which 
  identifies the proper headers. So I'd like to allow an exception for this 
  case, because
  - in general, we're best off asking only for what is really needed
  - Someone else is bound to notice the same thing and point out that we're 
  asking for something that's not needed, thereby opening the guidelines to 
  attack--e.g. court.
