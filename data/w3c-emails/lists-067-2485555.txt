Hi Charles,

I don't know if we're saying the same thing.  I'm saying that nested 
headers do not require

headers=idrefs

in any <TH> or <TD>

nor do you need axis or scope for that matter,

when the algorithm 
http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/tables.html#h-11.4.3  applies.

Is that what you're also saying?

Len
