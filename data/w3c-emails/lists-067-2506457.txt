Can anyone explain why <tab> is not HTML?

It is understood and used by nearly everyone.
It is part of the standard keyboard and ascii.

This seems to me to be the type of issue that accessibility should be
concerned with.
We all use keyboards, but cannot use the tab key.
<pre> as you will know does not tab correctly.
it is also not known to most people.

HTML 'lists' as used extensively on the WAI homepage cannot be said to have
these benefits
