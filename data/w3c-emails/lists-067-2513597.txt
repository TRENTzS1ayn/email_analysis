I'm not sure what you mean. Do you mean that people
should be able to mark up HTML documents with a <tab> element?
What would that do? Do you mean to accomplish the same
thing as the "tabindex" attribute?

In general, HTML does not include specify element types
for characters. That's the role of the document character
set, in this case Unicode 3.0.
