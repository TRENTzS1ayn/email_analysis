The user agent working group had an issue raised during last call stating 
that the ability to turn OFF the rendering of images (Checkpoint 3.9) was 
more important than a priority 3 requirement for people with cognitive 
disabilities.  We are looking for comments or situations from people with 
cognitive disabilities or people that work with people with cognitive 
disabilities that would indicate that this is a priority 2 or priority 1 
requirement.  Definitions of priorities used by the UA working are at the 
end of this message.

Please post any comments on this issue to the User Agent working group 
along with your suggested rating of the priority:
w3c-wai-ua@w3.org

Definitions of priorities:

[Priority 1]
This checkpoint must be satisfied by user agents, otherwise one or more 
groups of users with disabilities will find it impossible to access the 
Web. Satisfying this checkpoint is a basic requirement for enabling some 
people to access the Web.

[Priority 2]
This checkpoint should be satisfied by user agents, otherwise one or more 
groups of users with disabilities will find it difficult to access the Web. 
Satisfying this checkpoint will remove significant barriers to Web access 
for some people.

[Priority 3]
This checkpoint may be satisfied by user agents to make it easier for one 
or more groups of users with disabilities to access information. Satisfying 
this checkpoint will improve access to the Web for some people.
