Issue #1: The use of MAP for marking groups of links.
A. Conventions for accessible usage
B. Labeling the group of links (i.e. use title?, class?, name? or block 
element labels...)
C. Can map be used for more than indicating groups of links?

Recent proposal for MAP techniques by Wendy Chisholm :

=====================
Issue #2: Marking up blocks (chunks) of information
Problem: Many sites have navigation bars, advertising, search forms and 
then a changing content area(s).  For people using speech when they move 
between pages in these sites they often think they have not gone anywhere, 
since the pages all sound the same at the beginning.

My questions are:
A. What ways (if any) are there to mark up blocks of information for 
improved navigation
B. What can be done by authors (using some type of navigation links like MAP)?
C. What markup will be required to be recognized and processed by user agents?

================
The techniques for the following checkpoints in the User Agent Guidelines 
relate to navigation:

7.3 Allow the user to navigate all active elements. [Priority 1]

7.4 Allow the user to choose to navigate only active elements. [Priority 2]

7.6 Allow the user to navigate according to structure. [Priority 2]

7.7 Allow the user to configure structured navigation. [Priority 3]

8.4 To help the user decide whether to follow a link, make available link 
information supplied by the author and computed by the user agent. [Priority 3]

IMPACT: The results of this discussion could affect the minimum 
requirements for satisfying one or more these checkpoints.
