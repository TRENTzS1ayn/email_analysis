Jon,

I believe the statement "Clearly specify how content that is tailored 
according to client or user capabilities may conform (dynamic content or 
database driven)." applies to scripting issues.

This is found in the second section called "Ensure that the minimal 
conformance requirements are clear"

If this does not cover your needs please be more specific.
