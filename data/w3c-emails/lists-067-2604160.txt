To: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>

Some rambles to ponder plus my regrets for the meeting itself. Hope we
can address all these:

Guideline 1:
Provide the semantics (meaning) of the content in a form that readily
transforms into any mode of communication/language. 

What this is intended to cover is that if your presentation is written
text it can be transformed into spoken text; if it is in graphics it
must be explained in written text; if it is spoken or described it must
be (at least) in written text. The issue of whether if it is in text it
must be author-translated or illustrated in graphics is still under
discussion because of the difficulties/impossibilities of that. We might
leave open the possibility of translation in its usual sense.

Guideline 2:
I can't get over the feeling that this should somehow be subsumed in
GL1. Color used semantically is still semantics and might fit in there.

Guideline 3:
At the most abstract level we should be saying: maintain separate
semantic content, structure, and presentation. Style sheets is just a
means of handling part of this task as are the various markup languages.
The fundamental thing is the semantics to be conveyed. Emphasis on this
core separate maintenance issue should pervade the whole document. This
GL is probably actually a technique for all this.

Guideline 4:
Again we are into the details of how markup languages are used to
enhance communication of the semantics of the content. All this matters
but it is at a lower (techniques) level.

Guideline 5:
This is an even lower level issue. Tables are just markups for content
that make conceptual sense, especially to visually-oriented users but
they don't merit inclusion at this level.

Guideline 6:
Here we are dealing with both effects, interactive gizmos, and eye
candy. This concept is fairly central but it seems that *mostly* it
deals with how semantics are handled. When the "newer technologies" are
used to convey information, that is what has to matter. The devil in the
details are best served as techniques.

Guideline 7:
Ensure user control of *everything* - this is just one of those things.

Guideline 8:
Same comment as 7.

Guideline 9:
Folds into 7/8.

Guideline 10:
Requires more attention than I can give it here. It fits in with a bunch
of UI stuff and is most important.

Guideline 11:
Just about perfect. Interoperability and Standards are the handmaidens
of success in what we're undertaking.

Guideline 12:
This will be as much help to the designer as to the user and deserves
inclusion at this level.

Guideline 13:
Excellent inclusion.

Guideline 14:
If we could but ensure this, none of the rest would matter.
