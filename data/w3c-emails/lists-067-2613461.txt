The DOM, and its usage in client-side scripts, are explicitly within the
working group's scope. However, it should be noted that the DOM is
intended to be neutral in respect of the script language which is used;
our guidelines will probably be the same, as what maters for access
purposes is not so much which script langauge is used, but whether the
author has taken advantage of the capabilities provided by the DOM.
Indeed, scripts and applets are equivalent from this perspective (we
should perhaps refer to "programmatic objects", as is already done in the
guidelines).
