One interesting angle that has come up in PF is the way header nesting is
enforced in ISO HTML.


http://purl.org/NET/ISO+IEC.15445/Users-Guide.html#h1

This is a schematron-like scenario where a tree transform is performed to
insert virtual DIVs corresponding to the headers, as an instrumetality or
mechanism for making the proper nesting of headings DIVs easy to describe
and check.

ISO HTML documents are supposed to be checked by this rule, with its
implications of authoring-session evaluation processing, and
virtual-container structure in the document, even 'though the associated
virtual containers are _not_ included in the markup as shipped.

One side effect of this related to the session on Apr 27 on structural
navigation is that if we want to say that a UA should provide hierarchical
navigation corresponding to the headers in the document, then there is
already in the ISO literature a reference algorithm defining what these
structural scopes are.
