thanks greg, what a lot of work. phew!
A working example is a vast improvement on any amount of theory, though it
is very important to plan and define where we are going....

This is a useful resource.
I would not include this:
"There is a general agreement that it would be unrealistic to require Web
designers to include accommodations for every aspect of cognitive
disabilities."
Whilst true it is far too negative.
 We need to decide what is possible, and create resources, including style
sheets and guidelines that all government, health and educational sites can
follow, then commerce and individuals and we, ourselves will be better
advised, and better able to accommodate needs.
The following quote means something quite different out of context.
"The graphical representation of text should be discouraged."

could i recommend that navigation arrows be at the top of the page?
I could not visit this whole site as I had to use the slide bar on every
page to visit the next. see http://www.signbrowser.org.uk/camitalk for an
example.

I really enjoyed this site:
http://snow.utoronto.ca/Learn2/introll.html
I could not find the area that dealt with what might well be called severe
learning difficulty, anyway an area for non readers.
I downloaded the development learning to learn plug-ins.
The site ran but I got 3 error messages:

Error downloading content file.
Attempt to violate security mode:ActiveX.x32

file on server is missing or has wrong length:

Unable to display icon "getcarl4" because the following error has
occurred:Xtra not found.
