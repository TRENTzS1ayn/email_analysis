AL,

I agree with your analysis, but the biggest problem the UA group has is 
that our only specified reference tree is the W3C DOM.  The DOM represents 
a DTD structure of a document, which typically  is not useful in its native 
form for the human navigation needs you describe.  The current HTML 
specifications are weak or silent on information related to how content 
should be rendered to users or structured for human use.  XML is even 
worse.  We have tried to expand on the interpretation of your analysis in 
the UA techniques document and make the types of features you outline 
possible through access to the DOM by assistive technologies.
