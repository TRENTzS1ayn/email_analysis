Hi Ian,

That text is pretty clear, but I'm thinking more about the people who skip
right to the guidelines themselves (without reading the introductory
material). Could we add a link or icon or something to each instance of
example text, so even the skip 'n' skim crowd would notice?

Cynthia,

Section 3 says that for each checkpoint there are:

  "Optional informative notes, clarifying examples, 
   and cross references to related guidelines or checkpoints. "

The "informative" is supposed to distribute to the whole sentence.
