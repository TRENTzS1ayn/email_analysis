Hello Group,

The first draft is available from review at http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/gen-check

Status

This document is prepared by the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 
Working Group (WCAG WG) to show how more generalized (less HTML-specific) 
WCAG checkpoints might read. This draft is not based on consensus of the 
working group nor has it gone through W3C process thus it in no way 
supercedes the checkpoints in WCAG 1.0. This draft is based on the 
discussions from the last two WCAG WG teleconferences held on 13 April and 
20 April 2000.

Based on feedback about the application of WCAG 1.0 to emerging XML 
applications and other Web trends the WCAG WG wants to investigate how more 
generalized checkpoints might read. Therefore, this draft has been produced.

This is a draft document and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by 
other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use W3C Working Drafts 
as reference material or to cite them as other than "work in progress". A 
list of current W3C Recommendations and other technical documents can be 
found at http://www.w3.org/TR/.
