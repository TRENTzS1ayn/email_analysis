Subject:  CfP W3C/WAP Web Device Independent Authoring workshop




Dear All,

This message to inform you about the workshop on "Web Device
Independent Authoring" to be held in Los Angeles, California, USA,
June 22-23 2000.

This workshop is jointly organized by the W3C (WAI specifically) and
the WAP Forum.

The primary areas of interest for this workshop are the issues related
to developing a common set of Web content guidelines which would
facilitate transformation/navigation of generic Web content on non-PC
devices and at the same time ensure accessibility of this content for
people with disabilities.

For more information, see the Call for Participation which has just
been posted at http://www.w3.org/WAI/2000/06/wapwaicfp.htm

Daniel Dardailler

Workshop Chair
