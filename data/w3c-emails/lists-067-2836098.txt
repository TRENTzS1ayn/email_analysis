aloha, jason!

in regards your point on your proposed checkpoint E

quote
There should be a general requirement (and I am not sure how best to 
express it) that rich visual, auditory and tactile presentations be readily 
derivable from the content, and that they accurately reflect the structural 
and semantic distinctions captured by the markup. To some extent, this will 
require the assistance of style sheets (and this concern is a partial 
motivation for the checkpoint proposed above regarding style sheets); but 
the basic intention here is that an effective and consistent presentation 
be available in whatever happens to be the user's preferred medium (or 
combination of media)

this is where the possible interaction of CC/PP [1], XSLT [2], namespaces 
[3], and RDF [4] could, and should, be stressed...

a really great start, jason --- you may be speaking merely as a WG member, 
but it is clear why you are co-chair!
