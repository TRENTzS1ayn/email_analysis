  There appears to be general consensus within the working group regarding
  the content of the WCAG 2.0 requirements document:
  http://www.w3.orgWAI/gl/wcag20-req-20000419.html
  
  Please review the document and send any final comments or objections to
  the mailing list, prior to the working group meeting on Thursday 4 May. In
  the absence of substantive opposition, the requirements document will be
  published as a W3C note shortly thereafter. You therefore have
  approximately one week in which to review it and suggest changes.
