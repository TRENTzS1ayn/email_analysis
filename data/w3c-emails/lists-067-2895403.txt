Is there a reason this is being published as a Note rather than
as a Working Draft? The other requirements documents currently
in development are Working Drafts, including:

http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-reusable-dialog-reqs-20000426
http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-DOM-Requirements-20000412
http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xhtml-forms-req-20000329
http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xmlquery-req-20000131
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-voice-tts-reqs-19991223

While there's nothing that prevents the Working Group
from requesting publication as a Note, I recommend that
you request publication as a Working Draft since this
is a work in progress. The requirements will certainly
evolve as the Working Group continues to work. 

There is no requirement that a Working Draft advance
to Recommendation. At a later date, the WG may choose,
to incorporate the requirements as an appendix to
the WCAG 2.0 Recommendation. Or the Working Group can
request publication of the final requirements as a 
Note. But for now, I recommend requesting Working
Draft status.
