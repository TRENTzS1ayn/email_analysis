I would like to see "JavaScript" under the added requirements in the 
following section:

1. Add requirements beyond HTML and CSS

I know that scripting is alluded to in the following statement:
"Clearly specify how content that is tailored according to client or user 
capabilities may conform (dynamic content or database driven)"

But I think it should have its own section for some of the following reasons:

1. What is the "standard" or "recommended" way to support the DOM. 
Currently IE and NN support different models for access the DOM with scripting.

2. Designing for device independence.

3. Identifying open versus proprietary scripting markup techniques
