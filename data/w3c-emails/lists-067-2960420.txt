Greg Gay,

The "good surprise" when I got back to e-mail after a week at the beach,
was your analysis of the problems of accommodating the needs of those with
cognitive disabilities, especially learning disabilities! I would like to
learn more about your model for special ed teachers. I look forward to your
input into this knotty issue, and agree with much of what you suggest. But,
I have a concern. 

It seems you seem rely on TTS as a major accommodation for these users. In
my many years teaching learning disabled high schoolers, I spent a lot of
time emphasizing the use of "visual aids" in reading material, such as
pictures, photos, maps, graphs, tables, as well as titles, subtitles, bold
and italicized text, etc, teaching poor readers to comprehend paragraph
style writing by using non-paragraph elements to get to the meat of the
information. Since TTS devices seem to divorce the visual elements from the
text, and do a lousy job with tables that include boxed (non-linear)
information, I don't see TTS as an appropriate accommodation for this
population, or at least those parts of it with whom I've had experiences
both professionally and personally. My professional experiences in rural
schools, with poor medical services during early childhood, resulted in
many learning disabled students who were unable to use auditory input in
lieu of reading, so I question the ability of TTS to provide adequate
accommodation by itself. Perhaps you are working with a more advanced TTS
device? 

Anne
