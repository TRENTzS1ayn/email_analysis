AP:: "I question the ability of TTS to provide adequate accommodation by
itself. Perhaps you are working with a more advanced TTS device?"

WL: If the idealized text-to-speech "device" were a human reader would
it qualify? In cases where communication via spoken language is
ineffective how can we learn what works? Are we trying for a
"text-to-thought" system? In fact is language itself in question in some
cases?
