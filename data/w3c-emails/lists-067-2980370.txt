I think the problem is that in some cases text itself is difficult. (Anyone
been to a lecture where the presenter just spoke, with no  visual aids, and
found it difficult to access the content of the lecture?

On the other hand, I think text to speech is a valuable aid to
comprehension in many cases, although often not an answer by itself.

fortunately it is becoming cheaper.

cheers

  it qualify? In cases where communication via spoken language is
  ineffective how can we learn what works? Are we trying for a
  "text-to-thought" system? In fact is language itself in question in some
  cases?
