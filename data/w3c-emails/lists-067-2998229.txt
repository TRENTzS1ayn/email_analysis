Certainly. I think the group has made relatively good rpogress on dealing
with the need for describing visual (and to some extent aural) information in
text formats. SO i always assume that this is understood. I guess I
shouldn't.

  WL: Although Gregory can answer this a little better than I, the answer
  is that *unexplained* visual aids might be as confusing (difficult) and
  frustrating. Retinal input is unarguably effective but it requires
  enormous training that is often ignored in discussions of this kind.
  Just as unillustrated speech might be "difficult", so undefined (I think
  that implies, even requires something like "text") visual communication
  might be confusing/ineffective/diversive. Although it may be true that
  we are what we eat, it is not clear that the world *is* what we see.
