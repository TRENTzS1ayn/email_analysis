My personal preference would be to specify the DOM as the relevant
technology and to develop the techniques and strategies in a way that is
independent of the particular language (ecmascript, Java, or whatever)
that may be used. Of course, examples would be provided in specific
programming languages, but the requirement would be stated as a generic
one.
