I agree with you.  TTS is not the answer to accommodating all  learning or cognitive
disabililities. The focus of the point I am trying to make is that
alternative/multiple formats are  the single most effective way to accommodate those
with learning disabilities, and likely those with other more severe cognitive
disabilities. Auditory output from a TTS program  is one of those alternative formats.

Providing alternative formats is already a central thread throughout the guidelines,
though I think it should be given more emphasis, perhaps  its own  theme at the
beginning of the guidelines with the other general themes. One issue that should be
addressed is the emphasis the guidelines place on  accomodating adaptive technology
users, with little emphasis placed on accommodating those who would benefit more from
adaptive behaviour. Adaptive behaviours are accomodated by providing alternative
formats, so that if one format presents a barrier for a particular user (say print),
then an alternative format could be adapted  to circumvent that barrier (say images).
I can't think of anything that doesn't have an alternative format, though how far we
go in asking designers to include alternative formats remains to be seen.

Yes indeed. This is my primary reason for arguing that avoiding text in side by side
table cells should be given a higher priority. I suppose it could be argued that
adaptive technology developers should be responsible for making their products deal
with tables. TextHelp's "Read and Write" does reasonably well with tables, and it
reads ALT text if set in screen reader mode. It is the only one I know of that deals
with these issues. None of the freebees or cheap TTS programs currently available work

well with table or read alt text, the last time I checked.

TTS isn't for everyone with a cognitive impairment, though there are currently  few
other adaptive technologies used by those with learning disbiailites to access
information on the web. I know a number of people with learning disabilities that live

by TTS. The "... use of visual aids in reading material, such as pictures, photos,
maps, graphs, tables, as well as titles, subtitles, bold and italicized text, etc,"
all accomodate adaptive behaviour rather than adaptive technology. This leads back to
the design issue of including alternative formats.

I can't find who said it, but someone earlier ask if web designers were in effect
developing the adaptive technology themselves to accomodate those with cognitive
disabilities. I think that this may be the case, though attention to accommodations
for those with cognitive disabilities also make sites more usable for those without
such
a disability.
