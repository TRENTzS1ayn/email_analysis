Greg,

I appreciate your explanation of "adaptive behavior", since I was unsure
what you meant, and I agree enthusiastically that alternative/multiple
formats are going to be most effective in accommodating those with the wide
range of disabilities associated with LD and CD. Those alternative/multiple
format must include standard needs of those with LD/CD, for adequate or
better illustration I've previously suggested that guideline one specify
that graphics be required as an alternate to text. I'd like to see a
minimum requirement of one illustration be included on a page and that
illustration should be placed so that it is seen when the user first opens
the page. It's only a start of what needs to be addressed regarding
inclusion of graphics so they can aide comprehension of text.

If web designers are already accommodating the cognitively disabled, why is
it that so many pages that are designed to be accommodative according to
the guidelines are too frequently devoid of graphics, color, and boxed
text/tables, the very structures that those with LD/CD must depend on if
their behavior is to be adaptive? The guidelines as they are currently
presented, discourage use of the very tools that these people need to use. 

Regarding TTS, as long as it doesn't properly render boxed text/tables,
doesn't allow visual access to graphics/text while the text is read, and
remains too hard for folks with normal hearing to understand, it shouldn't
be considered a significant accommodation for LD/CD folks. Citing TTS
suggests the problem has been solved, when in fact it does no such thing.
