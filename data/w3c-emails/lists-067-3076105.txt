Subject:Definitions

I had to jump off the line quickly but I did want to say that both our
discussion and various 'user' comments I have encountered recently point to
a real need to look at and modify the glossary.
User comments I have heard recently range from "Huh!" to "could you please
put that in English".
Our group also seems to spend a fair amount of time and effort just agreeing
on terms. Perhaps the real starting point is not
Guidelines/Checkpoints/Techniques but Terms.
(I recently spoke to a group of 'web designers' that had no idea what was
meant by structural element markup - they actually thought that <h1> etc.
was there to easily adjust fonts because that is what they has been told by
'instructors')
Maybe we should have some suggested 'prerequiste reading' or link all terms
to an expanded glossary.
