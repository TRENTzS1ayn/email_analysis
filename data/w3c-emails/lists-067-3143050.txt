Marti's comment got me thinking about drawing parallels to other
disabilities and what we do there.

Adding visual descriptions of pictures is adding something to a page that
was not there.  Could something equivalent be done for cognitive access?
Two things that are true for LONGDESCs  (and ALT) are
1)it doesn't affect the appearance of the page for mass users
2)it is fairly easy to describe how to do it (though quality will obviously
vary)
3)it takes 1% to 5% of the effort (or less) to put the page/site together
to do it.


so putting these together let me coin a term  ALTCOGPRES  (Alternative
Cognitive Presentation)
is there a way we can come up with a  *straightforward*,  *easy to describe*
and *easy to do* technique for presenting information on a page in an
alternate form that
1)doesn't affect the appearance of the page for mass users
2)is fairly easy to describe how to do it
3)takes 1% to 5% of the effort (or less) to put the page/site together to
do it.
