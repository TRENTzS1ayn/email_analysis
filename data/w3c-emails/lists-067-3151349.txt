Some more brainstorming:

SMIL already has an abstract attribute for some elements. Maybe that could
be one way of adding information of major components of content as well as
the whole page. Short simple text could help also users with small screen
devices.

If I have interpreted the demands right, the TTS should work with these
alternative attributes (If they don't has anyone told the TTS developers
that?) or there should be also an audio version of them. Then similar info
should be also presented with images. Or maybe the abstract should always
contain a clarifying image?

Then it would be nice also to have a simple explanation of the navigational
structure of the site that could be attached to each page. This could help
many other users too.
