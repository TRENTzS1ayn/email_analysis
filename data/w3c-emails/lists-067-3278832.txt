It would be more accurate to say that the access techniques relate to the
DOM, rather than to any particular programming language, scripting or
otherwise. Essentially, when a user agent executes a script or applet, it
is the DOM interface which is used to manipulate the document and to
ascertain the properties thereof. What is important is not the programming
language being used, but the interfaces which are being relied upon that
expose the structure and content of the document, and allow manipulation.

Thus I would argue that the DOM is the relevant technology, and that the
relevant programming languages (Java, Ecmascript, etc.), may be cited in
examples.

If there exist interfaces to the document that are not available across
multiple programming languages (and I have not been informed of any), then
these may be relevant independently of the DOM, though if they are
non-standard then there may be limits to the extent to which we should
address them in any case.
