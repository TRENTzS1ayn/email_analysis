I tend to agree with Jon that people will be looking for JavaScript or DHTML
rather than DOM.  Could we solve this by calling the section DOM and adding
the other related non-W3C technologies in parens?  Something like:

Section 12.8 DOM (Includes JavaScript, DHTML, blah, foo, and stuff)

That way a visual scan or text search for one of these technologies would
get people to the right place.

Wendy,
It seems to me that JavaScript is what people would more likely be looking 
for accessibility information on, than a topic called the DOM.
