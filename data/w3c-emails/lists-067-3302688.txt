We could perhaps say: techniques for client-side programming using the
DOM, with examples in Java, Ecmascript, etc. This should explain the scope
of the work item with sufficient clarity. DOM level 0 could then be
considered, though naturally, most attention would be paid to DOM levels 1
and 2 (especially level 2 with its new, more generic, event set that
offers real opportunities for device-independence and makes accessible
client-side interactive applications feasible).
