At our regular meeting time, on Thursday, 4 May, 20 hours UTC, there will
be a joint teleconference of the Web Content and User Agent working groups
to consider issues surrounding orientation in, and navigation of
structured documents. In particular, the relevant markup strategies will
be explored, to determine what guidance should be included in the WCG
techniques document, and which questions demand further examination in
developing the next version of the guidelines.

Background

A message from Jon Gunderson:

The thread started by Al Gilman at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2000AprJun/0205.html

Note in particular his differentiation between the XML document hierarchy,
which is available via the DOM, and the structures that facilitate human
browsing, orientation and navigation of the document, which are not
necessarily isomorphic to the parse tree.
