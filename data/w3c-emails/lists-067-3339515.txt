Subject:RE: Reason Magazine: Access Excess

This article was so provoking, I just had to reply to its author:

Dear Mr. Olson,

I've read your article on web accessibility, and find
it superficial, wrongheaded, and incorrect.

I'm a practitioner of accessible technology; my clients
are mostly information and telecommunications
companies.  My experience shows that the kind of
changes needed to improve access are usually logical
and easy.  Access features most often improve the
usability of the information for all -- no spin, just fact.

It's been a while since I debated anyone formally, but
I offer you this challenge: if you really believe what
you wrote, you should be willing to defend it on a
public stage.  I will come prepared to defend my
position.  If we can agree on a resolution, a location,
and a protocol, we can do our part to raise the level
of political debate on this topic.  Of course, accessible
formats will be mandatory.

I eagerly await your reply.
