Thanks Michael, yes  there are ways to use stylesheets to avoid this 
problem.  That of course is exactly the point:  it's not enough to simply 
use "relative units" as specified in WCAG 1.0.    Additional guidelines are 
needed.  The EM is not enough.

BTW, another way to write the guideline is to require that layout features 
of style sheets be used only in ways that duplicate the semantics of tables 
used for layout... a situation in which this overlap problem can't 
arise.    This is perhaps overly restrictive though.
