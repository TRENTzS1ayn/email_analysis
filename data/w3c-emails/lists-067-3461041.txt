I had posted this to two lists... so my reply to this didn't get over here.

So here it is again,,

Michael... thanks for that example of what to do to avoid overlapping 
text.  That's a good illustration of the point I was trying to make: that 
it isn't enough to use relative units, like EM.  More is needed.

One way to write the guidelines is to restrict use of CSS layout to those 
features that duplicate table layout... although this may well be too 
restrictive a use of CSS.

Everyone... please follow up any more discussion on this on the guidelines 
list.  I'll do the same.
