>Many web pages are supported by the advertisements (ADVTS) they deliver.
>The delivered ADVTS should have ALT-text. Those ADVTS may be provided by a 
>consolidator selecting from many sources. Possibly the particular 
>delivered ADVTS are shaped by user actions. Make sure that alt-text comes 
>along
>with those ADVTS.
>
>This request is a result of the joint UA/WG meeting 2000-05-04, where
>Gregory Rosmaita suggested that EO should encourage the advertising
>service providers to include appropriate alt-text with their ADVTS,
>and to require their sources of those ADVTS to provide them. Most ADVTS
>are highly visual now, and miss a significant part of their audience
>if those alt-text are lost, or made meaningless when the alt-text value
>is derived from their filenames, or is the generic "click here".
>
>[HB: It may also be appropriate to encourage longdesc to be delivered,
>in anticipation that someday browsers will support following the longdesc.]
