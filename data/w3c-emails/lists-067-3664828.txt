Greg,

There are many points on which we agree, and I feel your refinements of
the guidelines 14.1, 14.2, and 14.4 are excellent. But I'd like to revisit
a point I made in mid March about guideline 1. Guideline 1 says "Provide
equivalent alternatives to auditory and visual content." The guideline
should say "Provide equivalent alternatives to auditory, visual, and text
content." This makes it clear that there are indeed two distinct types of
"visual" content, and that text is a stumbling block for some disabled
folks, just as auditory content is for some and graphical "visual" content
is for others. 

Personally, I suspect some who criticize the guidelines know at gut level
that there are many with disabilities who aren't accommodated by the
current guidelines. I also feel web designers will be less resistent to
guidelines that acknowledge the needs of the graphically-visually dependent
as well as those who are flummoxed by graphics.
