Do you know if there are any guidelines to do a visual alternative for text?

I understand from the discussion that have been going on that we don't yet 
have a clear picture of how this should be done and need to figure it out 
first to be able to explain what the visual alternatives mean. For text 
alternatives there exist guidelines how an image should be described, such 
as the NBA guidelines and it is pretty clear what objects should have the 
explanation i.g. image element or captions for audio and description for 
video (with SVG we probably need a bit more guidelines as now we can attach 
explanations about parts of the image too). However, at least I don't know 
yet how to explain what parts of text or document (and there are different 
kinds of texts) should have pictures and what kinds of pictures, what is 
the minimum requirement and what is extra help?

If you have some ideas to add to the brainstorming, it would be very 
helpful at least to me.
