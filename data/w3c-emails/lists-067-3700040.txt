Marja, 

If there are such guidelines, other than in book/magazine/newspaper
publishing, I'm not aware of them. Textbooks, early reading books and many
hardbound books for any age seem to follow guidelines that dictate the
amount of text and/or visuals per page. Magazines and newspapers seem to
follow guidelines, perhaps ones common in their field/for a similar
audience. Encyclopedia are typically well illustrated, and are most
hard-bound dictionaries include drawings for words that are specific, such
as a type of animal or object. Publication guidelines probably do not
address "cogntive disabilities" as such, but tend to include these folks in
their attempt to reach their widest audience.

Of course, television has visuals for almost everything they broadcast no
matter how abstract.
