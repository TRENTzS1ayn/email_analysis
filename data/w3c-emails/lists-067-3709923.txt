Hello, WCAG chairs and working group members!

I'm probably familiar to most of you from past interactions with the
WAI and the WCAG working group.  My "new job" -- now over a month
old! -- is with Edapta, Inc., a San Diego startup that is developing
adaptive user interfaces that provide optimized access web sites
(and more).  My role at Edapta is Director of Accessibility, and as
such, I'm one of our primary liaisons with the W3C's Web Accessibility
Initiative.

With regards to the WCAG work, Edapta is working on using the
technology of customized web pages -- personalization -- to effect
customized user interfaces, not just content, as way of implementing
the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and increasing overall
usability and accessibility.  I'm pleased to send this request now
as Edapta's official rep to the WCAG working group, and look forward
to (continuing) working with all of you.

--Kynn
