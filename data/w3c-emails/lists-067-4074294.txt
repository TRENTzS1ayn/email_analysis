Just a comment. I appreciate all the comments I have been reading about
Bobby and its "daunting output." I am in the process of completing a masters
in ed technology and curriculum and development and since I began learning
about dissability issues I have tried to ask people to run Bobby when they
prepare a website because then they will know that the site may be accessed
by people with dissabilities. Every single person that has tried Bobby tells
me it is just too hard to get it to certify their sites. It has been very
hard for me too; unless I am doing a very simple page. I say this because
many people in education are not technologically proficient and the easiest
the tool, the most likely people will be to use it.
Thanks,
Ana
