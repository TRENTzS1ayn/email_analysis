Bruce,

I, too, haven't complained to the list about Bobby. I just stopped using
it! At present, I am feeling pretty discouraged about the whole issue of
web assessability. Even tho the guidelines do mention the use of graphics,
it isn't a high priority, lack of graphics causes no outcries, and Bobby
doesn't even note the non-existance of them (at least last time I tried
it). In fact, in training the teachers at my school to create web pages,
I've only mentioned the accessibility issues to the special ed teachers (as
a curiosity) but not to the others because it is still a struggle to get
them to create web pages in the first place, let alone put a lot of issues
in front of them. The web site we are using doesn't make it possible to put
ALT tags on the one-graphic-per page it allows under "simple" pages, and
the graphics they provide are only clip art - not very illustrative. Before
any teachers are doing pages where the issue becomes significant, they must
learn a lot more about making web pages then they are currently anxious to
learn. The audience for the school web pages is well-known: teachers,
parents & students in the county, who do NOT include any blind persons at
all ... and taxpayers in the county, who do NOT include any blind computer
users. Anyone else who visits the web pages, will have to accept them as
they are. ( http://myschoolonline.com/va/dinwiddie , click on schools,
click on Southside Elementary)

To add to my dismay (which is compounded by the usual
end-of-schoolyear-scambles), a friend who has been a strong advocate of
accessibility for the disabled/blind online for many years, has been
equally frustrated by the reluctance/refusal of blind web page creators to
make their web pages usable by sighted people. I remain very sympathetic to
the critics of accessibility who point out that pages that comply aren't
inviting to those who are visually-dependent, visually-oriented, or simply
strong right hemispheric. Even the recent post from Greg V. puts the need
for graphics on page at the beginning of the list of needs for the
cognitively disabled. But it isn't a front-burner issue for the guidelines
that are supposed to be accommodating ALL with disabilities. It is a sad
reality. 

As I see it, the issue should be to FIX the equipment used by those who
cannot see graphics, cannot used side-by-side coluns, and cannot read
tables of information properly. It's probably unnecessary to say these
tools were badly designed from the outset, but reality seems to suggest
that the fix belongs there, not in developing endless fixes that reduce
usability of web pages to visual users including those with disabilities
that make them dependent on vision. 

Well, this note has turned out to be more honest and straightforward than
I had set out to write. I'll temper the flames it generates.

Anne
