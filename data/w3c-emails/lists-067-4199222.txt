My understanding is that rather than a speech reader, the product in the ad
was the Encarta encyclopedia with the read text option turned on.

Folks,

Last night as hubby was playing "flick a channel" on the tv, I
caught an
ad by Microsoft, advertising a speech reader designed for learning diabled
folks. Has anyone else heard anything about this? Is it usable? Does it
work with Explorer?
