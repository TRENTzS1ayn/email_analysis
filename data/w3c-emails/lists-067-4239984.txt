Hello all,

after consultation with the WAP/W3C coordination group and as chair of
the WAP/W3C Device Independent Workshop, I've decided to postpone it.

To main reasons:
 - the deadline for Position paper submission is passed (24/05) and
 I only have received 4 or 5 position papers. That's obviously
 not enough.

 - during the past 2 weeks being in Amsterdam (WWW9, W3C AC meeting),
 I met with a several groups/people that are doing exactly the kind of work 
 in the area (content transformation) I've been looking feeback from,
 and they weren't aware of the workshop at all (and it's too late for
 them to go there).

This calls for more outreach, more networking and therefore a delay.

The next WAP Forum f2f dates are September in Honk Kong and December
in Munich. I encourage people to send me feedback on their preferences
and I will announce the new venue in due time.

Daniel Dardailler
