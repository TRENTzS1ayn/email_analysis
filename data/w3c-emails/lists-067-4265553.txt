There is a large body of work on graphic communication - people use it in
places like airports, space stations, instruction manuals, and so
forth. I have not looked for this kind of work on the Web, but Art Libraries
often have heaps of books on it (I read a very nice one recently, from the
60's but well thought-out, clearly and helpfully illustrated, and mostly
relevant today - these things change, just as verbal alnguage does).

  Marja, 
  
  If there are such guidelines, other than in book/magazine/newspaper
  publishing, I'm not aware of them. Textbooks, early reading books and many
  hardbound books for any age seem to follow guidelines that dictate the
  amount of text and/or visuals per page. Magazines and newspapers seem to
  follow guidelines, perhaps ones common in their field/for a similar
  audience. Encyclopedia are typically well illustrated, and are most
  hard-bound dictionaries include drawings for words that are specific, such
  as a type of animal or object. Publication guidelines probably do not
  address "cogntive disabilities" as such, but tend to include these folks in
  their attempt to reach their widest audience.
  
  Of course, television has visuals for almost everything they broadcast no
  matter how abstract.
