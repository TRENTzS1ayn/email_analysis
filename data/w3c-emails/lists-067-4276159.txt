Hello, 
 
If Your site gets found on a major search engine you could
suddenly find 1,000 visitors per day dropping by your web
site.  That's some powerful free promotion that might 
otherwise cost you plenty.
 
A recent study of Internet traffic patterns revealed that nearly
half (43.5%) of all search engine referrals are coming from 
Yahoo.com. That means that Yahoo.com can be a very 
powerful force in Your marketing strategy.
 
Yahoo is notoriously slow in adding new submissions to their 
directory, and it can take as long as six months to a year
to see your site listed in the Yahoo.com search directory. 
And just because you submit your link to Yahoo.com, doesn't
guarantee that your site will even appear in their directory.
 
I have discovered the incredible solution for You. And one that 
until now has been kept a secret. This information can easily
bring you thousands of new visitors. And more visitors means 
more money for you.
 
With my information your site will be found on Yahoo.com. PERIOD.
