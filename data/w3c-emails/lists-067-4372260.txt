Greg,

I wish you luck.  A JavaScript heavy tele-course out of George Washington
University is making full participation by the staff I support who are blind
impossible.  The site has massive usability problems in general, so support
of sited staff involved in the program is merely very difficult.  I wish
there was an accreditation process for online courses.

The prohibition against JavaScript is appropriately P1 because its use
pretty much make access impossible for some people.  The only possible
exception is when JavaScript is used in an intranet and you have fine
control (including version numbers) over the computer, the operating system,
the browser, and the screen reader.  Is this your setting or do you expect
people to access the system from home?

You are applying the test for "undue hardship" at the wrong place in the
timeline.  We do not allow architects to create buildings without ramps and
then claim that the cost of retrofitting wheelchair access to be too high!

With regard to the supposed obsolescence of Lynx, can you offer a better
"litmus test" for ensuring compatibility with PDA's, Cell Phones, Web TV,
car dashboard browsers, not to mention screen readers?

The first manifestation of JavaScript may predate the WCAG, but where are
the standards for it?  How do you *KNOW* that your JavaScript is formally
valid?  You can't!  This is still the tail wagging the dog.  The issues of
electronic accommodations for the disabled predates both by decades!  The
ADA, the culmination of many years of discussion and civil rights action,
was passed in 1990!  Microsoft Windows '95 was delayed six months because it
was not accessible!  This is OLD news.  When did your software developers
start work on this project?  Was it more than ten years ago?  Was it more
than five years ago?  If not, they have no excuse for having their heads in
the sand!

Yes, mistakes are costly and expensive.  I don't see what choice you have
but to bite the bullet.

Cheers,
Bruce Bailey
