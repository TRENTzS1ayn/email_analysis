Although the "market for" English versions of assistive technologies may be
lower in other countries, [not everyone reads or wants English] most if not
all assistive technologies available in the U.S. are also available world
wide, just not available in the national language.   So where are the
guidelines for assistive technology developers to "translate" their
offerings?  Wouldn't it be more practical to "translate" the assistive
technologies than to write guidelines that get added to legislation
requiring all pages to be usable without such technologies in the national
language?  The "making accessible" of existing governments web pages alone
in each country could probably pay for the translation costs.
