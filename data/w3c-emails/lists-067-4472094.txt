DRAFT - 2 Checkpoints for HTML, XML, SMIL, and CSS

I only considered two checkpoints in an attempt to create technology 
specific checkpoints. It is interesting that in each of these cases, the 
technology-specifics are highlighted. I think what we will find is that we 
will have general principles but that those are principles of design and 
not markup language. Each markup language has a strength and not all design 
principles will apply to each of those strengths. For example, separating 
presentation and content means that two languages may be employed for the 
desired effect. Therefore, if we do have technology-specific checks they 
will be tied to other technology-specific checks. For example, XML and 
style sheets.

The draft is available at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2000/05/wcag-techs.html

Note that it is very rough. This is a first pass.
