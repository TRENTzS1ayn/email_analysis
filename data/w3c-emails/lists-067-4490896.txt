  Proposal For SVG:
  
  1.1 
  
  Ensure each svg element and each g element that is a part of a graphic
  has a title and a desc. Defined symbols must have a desc, and should also
  have a title.
  
  3.1 ....
  
  + Group pieces of the graphic into a g element. (for example, table legs, a
  table, a chair, a plate, a cup, and the table setting are all meaningful
  parts of a picture that shows a table laid out for dinner). 
  
  + Where there are more complex relationships between components, use metadata
  to describe these.
  
  + Use font and text elements rather than simple paths for including text.
  
  + Use "shortcuts" - rectangle, straight lines, circles, rather than curved
  paths, where they adequately reflect the lines being described.

    DRAFT - 2 Checkpoints for HTML, XML, SMIL, and CSS
    
    I only considered two checkpoints in an attempt to create technology 
    specific checkpoints. It is interesting that in each of these cases, the 
    technology-specifics are highlighted. I think what we will find is that we 
    will have general principles but that those are principles of design and 
    not markup language. Each markup language has a strength and not all design 
    principles will apply to each of those strengths. For example, separating 
    presentation and content means that two languages may be employed for the 
    desired effect. Therefore, if we do have technology-specific checks they 
    will be tied to other technology-specific checks. For example, XML and 
    style sheets.
    
    The draft is available at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2000/05/wcag-techs.html
    
    Note that it is very rough. This is a first pass.
