7. Since XML parsers are permitted to silently remove the contents of 
comments, the historical practice of hiding scripts and style sheets within 
comments to make the documents backward compatible is highly unlikely to 
work as expected in XML-based implementations.

For maximum backwards compatibility, use external style sheets,  especially 
if your style sheet uses any of the following characters
      < (less-than)
      & (ampersand)
      ]]> (double-right bracket greater-than)
      -- (double-dash)
unquote

obviously--if you think about it, which i equally as obviously did not--i 
meant _forwards_ and not _backwards_ compatibility...

at least i think i think that's what i think i think,

CARTESIAN, adj.  Relating to Descartes, a famous philosopher, author of
the celebrated dictum, _Cogito ergo sum_--whereby he was pleased to
suppose he demonstrated the reality of human existence.  The dictum
might be improved, however, thus:  Cogito cogito ergo cogito sum--"I
think that I think, therefore I think that I am;" as close an approach
to certainty as any philosopher has yet made.
