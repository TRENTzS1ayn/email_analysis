Hello,

I've formatted the requirements document draft [1] to look like a W3C 
working draft, added a status section, and added a 6th section called, 
<Q>Ensure that the revision is "backwards compatible"</Q>.  This is not the 
best wording but tries to address some people's concern that those who have 
conformed with WCAG 1.0 will have to overhaul their sites to conform with 
WCAG 2.0 or that the existence of two sets of WAI content guidelines will 
confuse or frustrate people.  This is a rough first pass. Suggestions are 
welcome!

I have one question embedded in the status section that I think we need to 
answer: "Do we want to say something about when we expect to have an 
initial working draft of the revision published? (i.e., when are we aiming 
to publish the first public working draft?)"

Thanks,
--wendy
