Jim,

We can direct you to the XML language created for the real estate industry 
[http://www.xml.com/pub/r/Real_Estate_Listing_Markup_Language_(RELML)]. 
However, this is not a language that this working group works with.  Our 
primary goal is to determine the most accessible methods of using W3C 
Technologies.

Are you concerned about the accessiblity to people with disabilities of 
applications created with RELML?
