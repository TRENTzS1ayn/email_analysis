Hello,

I apologize for not responding to this sooner, but the first time I read 
this I thought, "yes. sure. the WCAG should have a better glossary."  After 
rereading the proposal, I am wondering if the terms should be defined 
across the WAI working groups and would therefore be an EO piece.  It would 
be something that all of the groups would point to, a central glossary or 
information piece. Something along the lines of the draft started by EO 
called, "How People with Disabilities Use the Web" found at 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/profiles-19990930.html
