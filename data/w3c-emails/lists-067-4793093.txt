There are still open issues listed for the Techniques document [1].  I 
received an action item last week to begin discussions on those that are 
truly open.  As I am going through them, I believe some have been 
resolved.  I will do more digging around to confirm and then send what 
seems to be resolution.  Other issues never seem to have been touched and I 
will send along as is.

I look forward to discussion.  More messages to follow...
