 From the issues list:

<blockquote>
Issue raised by: Philip Newton - 7 May 1999
Issue:
If the author specifies a background color, they should also specify the 
foreground color (and vice versa), otherwise if the user has selected a 
particular foreground color that does not contrast well with the author's 
background color, the page will be unreadable.

Proposed Resolution
While the user should be able to adjust preferences on the user agent, it 
is good design. Therefore, it seems to make sense to discuss in techniques doc.
</blockquote>

Even if the author selects both a background and text color, if the user 
selects a foreground color that does not contrast well with the author's 
background color then what can you do?  If the user only selects one color 
but the author has selected both foreground and background, the user agent 
will not automatically use colors that contrast well, will it?

I agree this is good practice but I am not sure that this increases 
accessibility.

Thoughts?  Do people have experiences that support the proposal?  Does 
someone have a good test page for this?
