3. With respect to the XHTML requirements, how many of these are simply 
needed to ensure validity, and how many are truly access-related? Consider 
combining HTML and XHTML, noting their differences where relevant, instead 
of creating two lists of checkpoints.

i'd be glad to work on combining the 2 -- especially as it fits in with one 
of the action items wendy assigned me a few weeks ago...  i do think that 
validity needs to be stressed, especially in light of the understandable 
urge to integrate discussion of HTML, XHTML, and CSS -- true, a valid 
document isn't necessarily an accessible document, but accessibility does 
begin with validity -- especially when stylesheets are to be applied and 
when XHTML documents are parsed by XML-based implementations...  plus, the 
examples provide us with a bully pulpit to stress use of attributes such as 
"title" for horizontal rules, "longdesc" and the like...
