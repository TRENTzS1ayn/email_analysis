Content negotiation and links to alt versions
Issue raised by:  Nir Dagan - 17 March 1998

I think one should use both content negotiation and include links to 
alternative versions. Content negotiation determines the default format 
served, but:
a user may prefer French to English, but may still prefer to have access to 
both versions.
User agents may not support content negotiation well and the format served 
to the user may be not the optimal one.

Resolutions
None at this time.
