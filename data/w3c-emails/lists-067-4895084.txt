I have two questions in relation to this issue:
1. will user agents automatically make adjustments for background or 
foreground color if the author specifies a good combination but the user 
only specifies one or the other (foreground or background but not 
both)?  It is my experience that user agents do not.

2. I intend to include this in the techniques document, but would like a 
rationale.  It seems that the rationale is good design rather than an 
accessibility issue since the answer to the first question seems to be "no."

If there is no disagreement, I propose editing section 5 (Colors) of the 
CSS techniques module to read:
<blockquote>
Use these CSS properties to specify colors:
'color', for foreground text color.
'background-color', for background colors.
'border-color', 'outline-color' for border colors.
For link colors, refer to the :link, :visited, and :active pseudo-classes.

Note that when a background color is specified, specify a high-contrast 
foreground color and vice-versa.

Ensure that information is not conveyed through color alone. For example, 
when asking for input from users, do not write "Please select an item from 
those listed in green." Instead, ensure that information is available 
through other style effects (e.g., a font effect) and through context 
(e.g,. comprehensive text links).
For instance, in this document, examples are styled by default (through 
style sheets) as follows:
They are surrounded by a border.
They use a different background color and also specify a high-contrast 
foreground color.
They begin with the word "Example" (or "Deprecated Example".
They also end with the phrase "End example", but that phrase is hidden by 
default with 'display: none'. For user agents that don't support style 
sheets or when style sheets are turned off, this text helps delineate the 
end of an example for readers who may not be able to see the border around 
the example.
