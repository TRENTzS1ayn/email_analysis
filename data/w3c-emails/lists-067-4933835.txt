I agree with Nir - content negotiotiation is the best strategy for working
out what is desired, but there also needs to be an explicit way of doing
this in the web content - some people are unable to configure either their
server or client, others may need to swap content types frequently.

This is the sort of question that is brought up by negotiated delivery of the
type that Scott Luebking talked about a lot recently - without being able to
know what the options are users may be left in the dark, missing what is in
fact available.

  Content negotiation and links to alt versions
  Issue raised by:  Nir Dagan - 17 March 1998
  
  I think one should use both content negotiation and include links to 
  alternative versions. Content negotiation determines the default format 
  served, but:
  a user may prefer French to English, but may still prefer to have access to 
  both versions.
  User agents may not support content negotiation well and the format served 
  to the user may be not the optimal one.
  
  Resolutions
  None at this time.
  
  thoughts?
