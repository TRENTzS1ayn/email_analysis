My understanding from the previous discussion of this point is that
ACCESSKEY specifies a Unicode character, which the author should choose as
a mnemonic (as in a good menu system).

The key or key sequence to be used in entering the access character is (or
should be) implementation-dependent, as should the highlighting, voice
quality or other style property which serves to identify it in the user
interface.

I agree with Charles that there are dependencies here involving thg UA and
PF, but that the relevant authoring technique is to choose a mnemonic
character with which to identify the form control, link, etc., which
should then be provided as the value of ACCESSKEY. Do not use the same
value twice in a single document.

I don't think ACCESSKEY is inherently problematic. It might better be
called MNEMONICCHARACTER, a name which would undercut the implication that
there exists (or should exist) a direct correspondence between the
character and a keyboard.
