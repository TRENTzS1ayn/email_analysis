The inherent problem is that if the K key is reassigned on me, then I can no
longer find out what the commands available to me are in lynx. The
alternative of specifying the ctrl-w key means that in netscape on linux my
browser quits (or can no longer be quit). And so on.

  My understanding from the previous discussion of this point is that
  ACCESSKEY specifies a Unicode character, which the author should choose as
  a mnemonic (as in a good menu system).
  
  The key or key sequence to be used in entering the access character is (or
  should be) implementation-dependent, as should the highlighting, voice
  quality or other style property which serves to identify it in the user
  interface.
  
  I agree with Charles that there are dependencies here involving thg UA and
  PF, but that the relevant authoring technique is to choose a mnemonic
  character with which to identify the form control, link, etc., which
  should then be provided as the value of ACCESSKEY. Do not use the same
  value twice in a single document.
  
  I don't think ACCESSKEY is inherently problematic. It might better be
  called MNEMONICCHARACTER, a name which would undercut the implication that
  there exists (or should exist) a direct correspondence between the
  character and a keyboard.
