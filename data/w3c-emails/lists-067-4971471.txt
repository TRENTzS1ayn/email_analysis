Assuming a particular colour combination is a user's default and that
therefore it is only necessary to specify colours for things that are not the
default is a mistake. (particularly for accessiblity reasons they may choose
something else, although there may be other reasons. I don't know that it is
a reason not to include the technique, as the way to specify thinigs
correctly.)

Maybe we should ask the ER or UA groups to look in more detail at the issue
of ensuring contrast? Most User Agents allow a choice of colours, although
most do not automatically pick a contrasting colour where there is a conflict
or semi-specified colour scheme.

  I have two questions in relation to this issue:
  1. will user agents automatically make adjustments for background or 
  foreground color if the author specifies a good combination but the user 
  only specifies one or the other (foreground or background but not 
  both)?  It is my experience that user agents do not.
  
  2. I intend to include this in the techniques document, but would like a 
  rationale.  It seems that the rationale is good design rather than an 
  accessibility issue since the answer to the first question seems to be "no."
  
  If there is no disagreement, I propose editing section 5 (Colors) of the 
  CSS techniques module to read:
  <blockquote>
  Use these CSS properties to specify colors:
  'color', for foreground text color.
  'background-color', for background colors.
  'border-color', 'outline-color' for border colors.
  For link colors, refer to the :link, :visited, and :active pseudo-classes.
  
  Note that when a background color is specified, specify a high-contrast 
  foreground color and vice-versa.
  
  Ensure that information is not conveyed through color alone. For example, 
  when asking for input from users, do not write "Please select an item from 
  those listed in green." Instead, ensure that information is available 
  through other style effects (e.g., a font effect) and through context 
  (e.g,. comprehensive text links).
  For instance, in this document, examples are styled by default (through 
  style sheets) as follows:
  They are surrounded by a border.
  They use a different background color and also specify a high-contrast 
  foreground color.
  They begin with the word "Example" (or "Deprecated Example".
  They also end with the phrase "End example", but that phrase is hidden by 
  default with 'display: none'. For user agents that don't support style 
  sheets or when style sheets are turned off, this text helps delineate the 
  end of an example for readers who may not be able to see the border around 
  the example.
