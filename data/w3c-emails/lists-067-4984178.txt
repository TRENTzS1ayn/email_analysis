When we start attaching external RDF to documents e.g. alternative 
equivalents provided some someone else or annotations (comments, 
explanations, corrections etc.) it would be nice to have IDs in the main 
objects of the document. This helps to keep the outside pointers as 
accurate and stable as possible.

Would it be possible to add this requirement to our guidelines?
