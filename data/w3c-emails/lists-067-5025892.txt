Charles,

Are you suggesting something along the lines of <P 
class="http://foo.bar/definition.htm"> ?

That does not seem to be the most elegant way to do things.  Isn't there 
some way to use RDF?  Namespaces?  something else?  I agree that the URI is 
helpful for the person who want to find out about the semantics, but how 
would this be machine-understandable?

I like Marja's original idea of include ID's on elements.  ID's could be 
arbitrary and automatically generated for block elements.  Then, 
annotations could be attached to any element in the document.
