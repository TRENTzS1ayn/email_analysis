Yes, although I need to check more carefully the syntax of CSS selectors to
see whether these are in fact legal values. (I have a nasty suspision that
there are URIs that are not, but if the characters : (colon) and / (slash)
are not allowed there is a bit of a problem. The character . (period) is not
allowed, in effect, but is not required for creating a URI.

RDF makes assertions about URIs. So if there is a URI that we can refer to,
it can create assertions in RDF. We can't create RDF about class="nav",
however.

If every element has an id then we can create information about it directly.
But that means that class information becomes an out-of-band collection of
statements about individual items, and I am not sure if that is a good thing
or not - it may be fine in the long run, but in the short term it would be a
problem for the general web. So it depends on the implementation and
acceptance..

  Charles,
  
  Are you suggesting something along the lines of <P 
  class="http://foo.bar/definition.htm"> ?
  
  That does not seem to be the most elegant way to do things.  Isn't there 
  some way to use RDF?  Namespaces?  something else?  I agree that the URI is 
  helpful for the person who want to find out about the semantics, but how 
  would this be machine-understandable?
  
  I like Marja's original idea of include ID's on elements.  ID's could be 
  arbitrary and automatically generated for block elements.  Then, 
  annotations could be attached to any element in the document.
