The bad news is that, based on the discussion that just went on about URIs
in XML on the xml-uri@w3.org mailing list, I would estimate the chance that
the XML implementers would buy the dodge that Charles suggested (putting a
URI-reference to the definition of "what I mean by this class" as the value
of the class attribute) as being roughly comparable to the chances of a
snowball surviving in hell.

The good news is that they are beginning to come arond to the idea that
they need to come up with some plan that fills this functional gap if they
aren't going to have W3C cram something they don't like down their throats.

What we have in HTML is the html.profile parameter.  This is by definition
a reference to data description for the usage in the META element.  

I continue to claim that if the resource linked to via the html.profile
parameter contained a data dictionary for CLASS values as well, it wouldn't
break anything and would be the maximally HTML-backward-compatible way to
introduce additional knowledge keyed to CLASS marks.  This is [my current
working estimate of the best way] to introduce user-defined markup in the
HTML context.

As far as IDs are concerned, they are good from a legacy perspective
because they are already in XML 1.0.  On the other hand, XML processors in
future will comprehend XPath and we will be able to generate third-party
information for documents where the IDs are not provided on the items or
ranges we wish to annotate.  The match-patterns for more-info rules can be
a mix of stuff the author put in the document and generic  relationships
from the DTD or schema that they were using.
