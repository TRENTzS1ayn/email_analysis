This week's meeting is scheduled at the usual time of Thursday, 15 June,
20 hours UTC, on the W3C/MIT Longfellow bridge (+1-617-252-1038).

Prior to the meeting, a list of open issues relevant to the guidelines and
techniques documents will be published. Please consider the following
questions, which shall be discussed at the meeting:

1. Which, if any, of the issues on the list can now properly be regarded
as closed?

2. Are there additional issues, not included on the list, surrounding the
working group's deliverables, which should be added?

3. With respect to the techniques document modules:

Further work is needed to document techniques appropriate to certain
specific formats and interfaces, for example SMIL and the DOM.

a. How should these tasks be assigned within the working group? If you are
willing to accept action items related to any of these technologies,
please volunteer (details will be discussed at the meeting)?

b. We need to prepare the Techniques for distribution as a public working
draft. Which aspects of the required work would it be most important to
complete prior to publication?

4. Integration of guidelines and technology-specific checklists, together
with other administrative considerations and working group activities,
will also be discussed.
