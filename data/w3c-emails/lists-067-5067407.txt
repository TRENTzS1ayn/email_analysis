Unfortunately I will not make the call this week.

I think that one important thing is to publish a new draft of the techniques
- according to W3C process groups should publish work at least every 3
months. But I would suggest that for the techniques document, providing
checkpoint by checkpoint techniques grouped by technology is the best
approach. It will also enable people to see why we are interested in
generalising the top level of the work, since there is redundancy in there.

Cheers

  This week's meeting is scheduled at the usual time of Thursday, 15 June,
  20 hours UTC, on the W3C/MIT Longfellow bridge (+1-617-252-1038).
  
  Prior to the meeting, a list of open issues relevant to the guidelines and
  techniques documents will be published. Please consider the following
  questions, which shall be discussed at the meeting:
  
  1. Which, if any, of the issues on the list can now properly be regarded
  as closed?
  
  2. Are there additional issues, not included on the list, surrounding the
  working group's deliverables, which should be added?
  
  3. With respect to the techniques document modules:
  
  Further work is needed to document techniques appropriate to certain
  specific formats and interfaces, for example SMIL and the DOM.
  
  a. How should these tasks be assigned within the working group? If you are
  willing to accept action items related to any of these technologies,
  please volunteer (details will be discussed at the meeting)?
  
  b. We need to prepare the Techniques for distribution as a public working
  draft. Which aspects of the required work would it be most important to
  complete prior to publication?
  
  4. Integration of guidelines and technology-specific checklists, together
  with other administrative considerations and working group activities,
  will also be discussed.
