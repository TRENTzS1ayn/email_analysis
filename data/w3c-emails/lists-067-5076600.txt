My main question is not "should we include this as a technique."

Rather, my question is, "what is the accessibility rationale for this 
technique."  I did not see any, thus did not include any in my proposal.

I think the rationale is "good design."  Regardless of whether I choose a 
high-contrast background and foreground color combination (white and dark 
red), if the user only selects a foreground color (white) current user 
agents will not select a high contrast background color.  They will display 
the author set background color (white) and the user set foreground color 
(white).  The user will have to select a foreground color as well.  In some 
browsers, the user could select "high-contrast mode" where the browser 
selects both the foreground and background colors.  For example, yellow 
text on a black background.

I think this is a UA issue and have CC'ed the UA working group.  Chris 
Ridpath recently published results of a color study, so I have CC'ed ER as 
well.  Refer to the techniques for Checkpoint 2.2 in the 26 April 2000 
working draft of AERT [1].

Since there do not appear to be any objections to my proposed edit of the 
CSS techniques module, I will make the appropriate changes.
