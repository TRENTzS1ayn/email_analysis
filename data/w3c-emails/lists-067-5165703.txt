Why can't we just suggest a new block element <nav>?  The element could
contain layout tables, maps, or lists for example.  UA could then treat
<nav> as "chucks" or blocks of information that the user could skip over if
desired.  Authors could then apply style to <nav> etc.

Thinking in the "structure vs "presentation" vain, are not <nav> an object
that is really part of the structure?

<nav> might be a useful addition for the new wireless mobile pervasive
devices as well.
