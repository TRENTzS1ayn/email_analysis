This is <map>, isn't it? We changed HTML 4.01 to make it clearer
that this was the purpose of <map> [1]:

     The MAP element specifies a client-side image map   
     (or other navigation mechanism) that may be associated
     with another elements (IMG, OBJECT, or INPUT). An image map 
     is associated with an element via the element's
     usemap attribute. The MAP element may be used without an 
     associated image for general navigation mechanisms.
