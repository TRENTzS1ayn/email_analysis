AG:: "The small interpretation is that only issues you wouldn't care
about except you undertand the impact on people with disabilities.  This
interpretation holds that general good practice is out of scope and
shouldn't be mentioned."

WL: If this interpretation holds it would sure be a drag. If there were
a supergroup dealing with usability of which accessibility became a
component then it might make sense but as it is if there is such a W3C
group it's not well-known here. 

Even though "pure" usability issues are a superset of accessibility
issues, the latter must demand attention to the former because they
affect PWDs' access to the Web, albeit not specifically. If a person
can't *really* use the Web because of some unsound authoring practice
then the mere fact that she is not singled out for exclusion doesn't
make it any more posssible to use the Web?
