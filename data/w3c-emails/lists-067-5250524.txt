Hello,

I just updated the list of to-do's in the techniques open issues list [1]

I think we'll want to have a scripting section for each technology with a 
DOM implementation.  For example, I thought about moving scripting from the 
HTML module to the non-w3c technologies module.  I don't think that will 
work since the current scripting techniques are tied to the HTML DOM.

After I published the draft today I realized that I did not link to the 
non-w3c module from the various checkpoints within the main module.  e.g., 
after checkpoint 6.3 we currently link to:
HTML Techniques: Text and non-text equivalents for applets and programmatic 
objects
HTML Techniques: Graceful transformation of scripts

We ought to add something along the lines of:
Non-W3C Techniques: Flash
