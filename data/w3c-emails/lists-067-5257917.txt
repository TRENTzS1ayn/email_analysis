Is there a list of issues or topics still being discussed with requirements
document?  Or is it on the list serve under various topic threads? For
example, it was mentioned on the list that we should document the
assumptions of the assistive technology capabilities, but that [documenting
the capability assumptions] is not in the requirements document. [2].

Another question I have is - are we [the GL working group editors] planning
to "move" all the JavaScript techniques into a separate document or view as
a way to address the requirements document 1.0 item - Non-W3C technologies
such as JavaScript, PDF, and Flash? I saw a place in [3] for PDF and Flash,
but not JavaScirpt ... JavaScript seems to be intertwined with the HTML and
CSS techniques as in [4]. Making Java applets directly accessible would be
a good candidate though.
