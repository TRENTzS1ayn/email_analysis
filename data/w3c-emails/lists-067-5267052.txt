I was under the impression, but apparently mistaken, that the "current
version" [1] of the document had in fact incorporated the errata [2] as
they came in and were posted.  In other words, why have a 5 May 1999
version and a "current version" if they are still the same?  Can't we
integrate the errata without changing the level of the recommendation?

I reviewed the W3C process [3] and found no mention of "how" to manage
errata.
