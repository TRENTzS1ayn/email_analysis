Thus far, there has not been much feedback or many issues to track.  Since 
we will be passing this to 6 other groups and you have raised a good point, 
I created an issue tracking page. [1]

Onto the issue you raise:
Documenting the assumptions we make about assistive technology capabilities 
seems to fall under the category of requirement 2 "Ensure that the minimal 
conformance requirements are clear."  It seems to me that making the 
minimal requirements clear means we have incorporated our knowledge of 
specific user agents/assistive technology into technology-specific tests 
that will be developed to help authors determine if they have met the 
minimal conformance requirements.

Are there undocumented assumptions in WCAG 1.0 or are they undocumented 
facts?  I think there are undocumented facts, such as "which browsers 
support which aspects of the various technologies?"  The answers to this 
question are not assumptions.  My sense is that since these are not 
documented and there are ambiguities in some of the statements, people have 
made assumptions to fill in the gaps.  I think the goal with 2.0 is to be 
less ambiguous to prevent the assumptions.

Note that the current version of the Requirements document is at [2]  [I 
just updated the dated link on the WCAG WG home page to point to this 
non-dated link.]

As for your question about JavaScript and non-W3C Technologies refer to the 
thread that I started called, "Scripting and links to non-w3c technology 
techniques (to do's)" [3]

Thanks,
