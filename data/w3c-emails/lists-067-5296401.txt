I think there are also undocumented assumptions. For example, it is assumed
that anyone can get and use lynx, so the fact that something works in lynx is
enough for it ito be available. It is assumed that not everyone has access
to a javascript-capable browser. I think it is assumed that people can use
forms, but not necessarily tables. These kind of assumptions (what is the
minimum technology we are supporting?) are extremely important to the
priority of checkpoints (and we made changes at various stages in the
process, as our assumptions shifted with the "state of the art".

I think that it should be very clearly explicit that we need to document
these assumptions.

  Are there undocumented assumptions in WCAG 1.0 or are they undocumented 
  facts?  I think there are undocumented facts, such as "which browsers 
  support which aspects of the various technologies?"  The answers to this 
  question are not assumptions.  My sense is that since these are not 
  documented and there are ambiguities in some of the statements, people have 
  made assumptions to fill in the gaps.  I think the goal with 2.0 is to be 
  less ambiguous to prevent the assumptions.
  
  Note that the current version of the Requirements document is at [2]  [I 
  just updated the dated link on the WCAG WG home page to point to this 
  non-dated link.]
  
  As for your question about JavaScript and non-W3C Technologies refer to the 
  thread that I started called, "Scripting and links to non-w3c technology 
  techniques (to do's)" [3]
