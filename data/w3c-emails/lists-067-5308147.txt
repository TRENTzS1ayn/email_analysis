What is the common adage about assuming?  when you assume something you 
make an ASS out of U and ME?  <grin/>

We should try to collect as much evidence as possible before making 
assumptions.  A "no-brainer" yet something that I don't think we did enough 
of for WCAG 1.0.  For the next revision I would like to see the group 
surveying users, collaborating with usability engineers, and testing ideas 
by working with the Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group to implement 
them.

Even with this data, we will still be making assumptions about the sampled 
population, the robustness and correctness of the data collection process, 
etc..

I learned some interesting lessons from the "User survey: browsers and 
scripting" that I sent to several lists a couple weeks ago.  I think only 
the people who understood what scripting was responded.  On one list we 
discussed how to write the survey in non-technical terms.  I resubmitted it 
to that list and got several more responses.  I will be tallying the 
results from the survey over the weekend and it will be interesting to see 
the responses.  However, to make good assumptions I think I will have to 
send the "easier to understand" version to get a more realistic sample 
population.

The lesson was "how to write an easier to answer survey."  I know there are 
books about this topic and I'm interested to learn more.  I think this type 
of exercise will be very beneficial over the course of revising the 
guidelines.  I'll also be anxious to see people with these expertise more 
involved in the revision process.

Therefore, yes - we have assumptions to document.

I propose adding a 4th bullet to the 2nd requirement (Ensure that the 
minimal conformance requirements are clear) that would read:
Document the assumptions that underly the minimum requirements.

thoughts?
