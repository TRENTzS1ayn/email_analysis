As I remember, most of these assumptions were discussed in teleconferences
during the development of the 1.0 guidelines and have been partially
documented in minutes. For example, we made an explicit decision (which I
consider to be entirely justified) that if an access problem results from
a shortcoming in user agent implementations, and can be remedied by means
of a repair tool which has been or will soon become freely available, then
the guidelines should not recommend that the author take steps, in the
design of the content, to circumvent the problem. This was applied to
checkpoint 5.3, but similar reasoning was also employed in other cases.

I agree that it would be helpful to document these assumptions, for
instance by mentioning them in an introductory section of the guidelines.

We also discussed, on an earlier occasion, the presupposition underlying
the guidelines, to the effect that every person who uses the web, can be
expected to gain access to a user agent which supports, at a minimum,
some version of HTTP and HTML, including form submission capabilities.

The question of user agent profiling and minimal requirements needs to be
considered further however. For example, one can assume that every user
agent which supports generic XML content, will also support a style
language, or that every user agent which supports client-side programmatic
objects will provide at least DOM level 0, and probably DOM level 1.
