Hello all,

This was my first solo experiment using the scripts to generate all of the 
modules and it appears something has gone awry.  Gregory has  reported that 
links to some of the alternative versions of the documents are broken. For 
example, the link to the text version and the zipped archive version of the 
HTML techniques module are broken.  Also, the link to the "latest version" 
doesn't go to the latest version of techniques but to the guidelines in 
general.

I will not be able to release a fixed version until next week since I am on 
the road today through next Wednesday.

Thank you for your patience,
--wendy
