For things that are pretty much like web pages, people are so far as I know
thinking of embedding things like MathML and SVG in XMTLM wrappers.  To
that extent it is reusable.  XML Schema also provides an attribute for a
schema location <http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/#xsi:schemaLocation>.

It would be nice to have a consistent solution.  It would be good to have
any workable solution.
