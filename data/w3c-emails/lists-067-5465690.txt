PJ:
I agree that "frames" does not belong in 1.1.  There are more, but I'll
keep these comments to the subject of FRAMES.  By the way (BTW), I believe
the term "non-text element" used in 1.1 is undefined and open to private
interpretation.  What does the term "element" here mean?

PJ:
We need to consider adding a "layout order" checkpoint that cover both
tables, frames, and even CSS so that the "serial" rendering is as
accessible as the graphical visual rendering of the content.  This is a
common checkpoint in software guidelines, for example in the IBM Java
Accessibility checklist.  Again, most of the responsibility is on the user
agent, except that occasionally there are tools and / or programmers that
do not realize that "content" of the page is rendered serial in the way the
HTML code is entered in the file.  "Serial rendering" will also need to be
considered when using JavaScript.

PJ:
I agree, except that NOFRAMES are not a recommend way to provide
accessibility to framesets that do not make sense when linerarized - a
better guidelines is to design a better ordered frameset.  NOFRAMES are
really for non-accessibility reasons, such as when frames are turned off or
are not supported by the user agent/assistive technology.

PJ:
I agree it is preferable to avoid an alternative duplicated page and to
make the frameset accessible directly. In some cases, a well design
frameset is more accessible than using complex layout tables, but still has
the non-accessibility disadvantage of not being able to bookmark a specific
frame, which is most of the reason for recommending against the use of
FRAMES.
