What do you mean by "not selected"? What causes the coordinates to
be sent to the server?

Whether they generate it or whether they should are, as usual,
distinct questions. From the HTML 4.01 specification, section 13.6.2
[1]:

   User agents that do not offer the user a means to select 
   specific coordinates (e.g., non-graphical user agents that rely on 
   keyboard input, speech-based user agents, etc.) should send the 
   coordinates "0,0" to the server when the link is activated.

Is this your goal?
