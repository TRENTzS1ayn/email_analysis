Here's some discussion on this topic from June 1999, starting
with a suggested clarification [1]:

      | I think the WG should strengthen a statement
      | in the guidelines that any important 
      | content inserted by a style sheet be available in the 
      | document source as well (rationale: device-independence,
      | users can override styles, etc.)

The example given in that email is that W3C Recommendations use
a background image in the upper left hand corner to indicate
that they are Recommendations. This sounds like your issue.
