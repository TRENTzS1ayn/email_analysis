The Web Content Guidelines working group meeting has been postponed, and
will be held next week (Thursday, 29 June), by which time we hope to have
more drafts ready for review.

Meanwhile, please discuss open issues related to the Techniques document
on the mailing list, so that we can attempt to close them as quickly as is
practicable.
