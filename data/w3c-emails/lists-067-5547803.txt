This seems to highlight the problem with providing substantial amounts of
exemplary material in the guidelines-  people assume that it is
comprehensive. There is a literal requirement in checkpoint 1.1: "Provide a
text equivalent for every non-text element." A background image is a non-text
element (clearly this depends on the definition, and it may be worth
providing an explicit definition that makes clear why a paragraph element
with text content and an image element providing a representation of text
content are different).

  Here's some discussion on this topic from June 1999, starting
  with a suggested clarification [1]:
  
        | I think the WG should strengthen a statement
        | in the guidelines that any important 
        | content inserted by a style sheet be available in the 
        | document source as well (rationale: device-independence,
        | users can override styles, etc.)
  
  The example given in that email is that W3C Recommendations use
  a background image in the upper left hand corner to indicate
  that they are Recommendations. This sounds like your issue.
