I agree that we need to cover this potential problem - using images that
contain information as backgrounds.  I would recommend that we add
"backgrounds" to the WCAG checkpoint 1.1 wording and an HTML/CSS technique
be added to something to the effect of the following:

WCAG 1.1: ...This includes: images, images of text and symbols, image map
regions, backgrounds, animations ...

Technique
     If the background includes information in an image
     <body background="image.gif"> or <table background="image.gif"> etc.
     and the information is important
     then insure the information is found elsewhere on the foreground of
the page

Rationale
     Background images can be turned off
          people with low-vision and cognitive disabilities may turn off
background images for improved readability

Testing
     Using a graphical browser:
          Turn off background images - is the information still available
on the foreground of the page?
     Using a non-graphical browser (text-only, voice, etc.)
          Load the page - is the information still available?
