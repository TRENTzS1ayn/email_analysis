There are a few checkpoints that push at this issue - the one about style
sheets, and some of the stuff about tables. We should look at the list we
worked on a couple of months ago where we tried to consolidate the
checkpoints, and see how this is refelcted in that.

Cheers

  We need to consider adding a "layout order" checkpoint that cover both
  tables, frames, and even CSS so that the "serial" rendering is as
  accessible as the graphical visual rendering of the content.  This is a
  common checkpoint in software guidelines, for example in the IBM Java
  Accessibility checklist.  Again, most of the responsibility is on the user
  agent, except that occasionally there are tools and / or programmers that
  do not realize that "content" of the page is rendered serial in the way the
  HTML code is entered in the file.  "Serial rendering" will also need to be
  considered when using JavaScript.
