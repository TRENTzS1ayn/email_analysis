1. Revised draft of the Techniques document.

2. Draft of combined guidelines and technology-specific checklists.

3. Identification of requirements which are common to WCAG and to broader
conceptions of device independence.

4. Requirements document: identification and classification of
technologies to be addressed in the working group's deliverables (issue
raised by Wendy).

5. Any other items that you wish to add to the agenda--please send a

discuss at the meeting.
