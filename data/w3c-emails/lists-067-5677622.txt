Please be prepared to discuss any action items which you accepted at the
last meeting, during the call tomorrow. Reviewing the list, several of
these action items have been satisfied (for example, Dick's undertaking
regarding server-side image maps, and Wendy's promise of a revised
Techniques document), but it is unclear how others are progressing (for
instance, William's investigation of bidirectional tables and
CSS-generated text for the Techniques document, Cynthia's intention to
post a clarifying message to the list concerning content generation,
etc.). I understand that Katie's initial draft of the combined guidelines
and technology-specific checklists is close to being ready.

Note that it is not strictly necessary to close all open action items this
week, but merely to report progress (or lack thereof), as appropriate.
