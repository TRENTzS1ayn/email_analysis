Hi, Charles

OK  Sounds like you might agree that in the case of dynamically
generated web pages, that probably less than 5% of blind web users would
go through the effort of creating user-defined CSS sheets.  Would you
agree to this?

So, in the general situation of dynamically generated web page where
user-defined CSS sheets are not reasonable options, a reasonable choice
seems to be providing a variety of options which will direct how
dynamically web pages can be created to meet user needs/preferences in
terms of accessibility.  (This approach is probably not feasible for stored
or static web pages.)  Tailored web pages will probably be more efficient
and easier to use than general web pages.

Does this make sense?

Scott


PS  Do you understand how I'm using the terms "semantic information"
and "semantic content"?  What are your explanations of these terms?
