Hi, Charles

I'm not sure I would totally agree with the areas you listed in agreement.
If someting is good, that doesn't necessarily mean it should be everywhere.

If at one point of time, it is possible to meet people's needs with one
item, that doesn't necessarily mean it is the best solution.  One
possibility is cutting download time with smaller versions rather
than one big version.  Also, if the needs change over time, early preparation
may be easier with multiple versions.

Shared experience is only one aspect.  What are people willing to give
up in order to have a shared experience?

Scott
