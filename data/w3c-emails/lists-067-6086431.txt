Ricardo,

thanks for the suggestion.

I have re-posted this to w3c-wai-gl@w3.org because that is the list for the
WCAG group, and I think it is a better place for the topic. Please delete
w3c-wai-ig from responses.

This may be a good technique, but then it becomes difficult to access the
navigation bar. It depends a bit on where the focus goes after the things
that have a tabindex.

I think it would be more useful if there was a split level of tabindex, so
that you could move through a structure like a tree. We have tried to get
something like this by using the mapo element to group sets of links. But I
am not certain and would like to have more opinions and testing.

Do people have examples of pages that use tabindex well? (I have made one
now, at http://www.w3.org/2000/01/tabindex-test if people want to tell me
what works and how).

  Hello,
  
  I think is a good idea to includa a TABINDEX 1 in
  the begining of the page that allows jumping the
  navigation bar.
  
  However, I would like make it without a link
  (skip over navigation bar) in the top of the page
  appears.
  
  The users are well informed enough because the 
  navigation bar -only text- is repating in the bottom
  and the tab order is explaining in a help file.
  
  I am waiting your opinions.
  
  Thanks in advance.
  
  Ricardo
