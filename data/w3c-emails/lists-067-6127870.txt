In replying privately to a query, it came to my attention that whilst
cognitive disability occupies me professionally, having a three year old
daughter also is a concern.

Surely we must recognise that children require significantly different
material?

What efforts is wai making to meets this need?
As it is likely that currently these pages would need to be in a separate
area, does this not answer the "one size fits all" personalized web page?
query?
