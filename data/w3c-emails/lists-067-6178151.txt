Apparently TIFLOWIN is a ewidely-used program in Spain becuase it is
cheap. And it is in SPanish. And almost anything that moves seems to hang hte
page up :-(

I will try to find out more about it.

On the positive side, I found that Netscape 4.5 under Windows has a stop
option that will stop animations as well as stopping a page loading, and
there is a stop animations option for Netscape 4.6 on the macintosh (from
clicking on the screen. I'm not sure how to get to it otherwise though).

  I have been looking over various sets of guidelines recently, to see what
  other people are saying.
  
  A particular point is with animation. We recommed not using them until they
  can b turned off, and the browser support page notes that it is possible to
  turn off images. It is also possible in Netscape 4.61 (Linux) to stop
  animations (press the ESC key, or right click on the page for a menu that
  offers it as an option. This feture is not available in Netscape 4.5 for
  win95. Amaya does not support animated gifs. There is an applet which creates
  a wobbly reflection of an image - there is an example of it at
  http://www.wendyrule.com - but if you click on the applet it stops moving
  (and click again to start it). I believe this is open source (I once ased the
  page designer) and if so I will look for the source for the techniques
  document.
  
  At http://www.sidar.org/anima.htm there is a suggestion to use the LOWSRC
  attribute for an img to point to a non-moving version. (This was to get
  around a technical problem with a Screenreader). lowsrc isn't part of the
  HTML spec, but it may be innteresting to ask WAI-PF to look at this approach
  as part of the work on XHTML 1.1. If you don't read spanish the babelfish
  translation more or less makes sense - go to http://babelfish.altavista.com
  and you can supply the other URI for translating.
  
  Does anyone have other test cases? What do screen readers do when there is a
  scrolling message in the status bar - does anyone know?
  
  Cheers
