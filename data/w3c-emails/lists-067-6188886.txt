Hi Jonathan,

If you are asking  " Is the WAI looking at how pages can be made more
accessible to children in general?"
 Then I think the answer would be that that is out of scope.  Our charge is
limited to looking at issues that cause accessibility problems for people
with disabilities (of all ages) but not problems that have to do with
children in general, or different languages, or mobile computer users etc.

That having been said, there are many of our recommendations that would make
it easier for children or people using different languages or mobile
computer users to access the web.  We like to point those out wherever
possible because they add additional incentive for technologies that
"Transform Gracefully".   But we don't have efforts or guidelines targeted
specifically at solving problems that are not related to accessibility.   I
believe that would be called mission creep and would be outside of our
charter in WAI.

Let me know if I misread you message.

Gregg

Subject:Children: was Re: A "one size fits all" personalized web page?

In replying privately to a query, it came to my attention that whilst
cognitive disability occupies me professionally, having a three year old
daughter also is a concern.

Surely we must recognise that children require significantly different
material?

What efforts is wai making to meets this need?
As it is likely that currently these pages would need to be in a separate
area, does this not answer the "one size fits all" personalized web page?
query?
