Dear folks, I have been pondering navigating the web using shortcuts -
tabindex, accesskey, and other strategies, and I have set up some test pages
to find out what happens at the moment and how useful that is.

http://www.w3.org/2000/01/tabindex-test has normal links and some which have
tabindex 

http://www.w3.org/2000/01/tabindex/tabindex-test2 has two forms and some
links,
,
http://www.w3.org/2000/01/tabindex/tabindex-test3 has tabindexes in reverse
order (and a negative tabindex) 

I will try to collect results and link further test pages and any resulting
email threads from http://www.w3.org/2000/01/tabindex/

Cheers

Charles
