Jonathan,

W3C recognizes the general need for less technical materials
for the general public. This applies not just to WAI but to all
of the work we do. We are looking for technical writers (although
we don't yet have the job descriptions ready) for this type of
work.

The Accessibility Notes (on SMIL, CSS, and HTML, and upcoming
on XML and SVG) are a step in this direction. 

I suspect that this discussion belongs on EO, so I am adding them
to the thread. I am also cc'ing your comments to the W3C
Communications Team.

Thank you,

 - Ian
