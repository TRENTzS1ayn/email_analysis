I agree with Gregg. The transformation implied by the definition in the
WCAG is one in which the table-related elements are eliminated and the
content of each TD element (TH elements being excluded by the stipulation
that TD cells alone can appear in a table which is used for layout
purposes) is placed in a separate paragraph. XSL experts in the ER group
could no doubt write a transformation that would achieve this effect,
without difficulty.
