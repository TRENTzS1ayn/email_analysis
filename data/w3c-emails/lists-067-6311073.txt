Hi, Charles

Here's an announcement on adaptive web-based systems.  It might
be helpful for you to get a better understanding on why web
pages being generated dynamically can benefit users by having
a wide range of ability to adapt to users instead of the limited
variations offered by stylesheet technology.

Scott

PS  Or if you are extremely confident in your analyses, you might
send the organizers of the conference a note explaining
that they need not expend the effort for this type of conference
since adaptive web-based technology needs only style sheets.  (smile)

                  INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE

                             ON

      ADAPTIVE HYPERMEDIA AND ADAPTIVE WEB-BASED  SYSTEMS

                          (AH2000)



                        28-30 August 2000

                      ITC/IRST Trento, Italy

               Sponsored by the European Commission:

            "High Level Scientific Conference Program"

Web-based application systems,  as well  as other  complex  hypermedia

systems  with a large  variety of users,   suffer from an inability to

satisfy heterogeneous needs.  A  Web course  presents the  same static

explanation of a  concept to students  with widely differing knowledge

of the   subject. A  Web   bookstore  offers  the same   selection  of

bestsellers  to customers with  different  reading preferences. A  Web

museum  offers  the  same  "guided  tour" and  the  same  narration to

visitors with  very different goals   and interests.

A   remedy     for the     negative    effects of     the  traditional

"one-size-fits-all" approach is to enhance a system's ability to adapt

its own  behaviour to the  goals, tasks, interests, and other features

of individual users. Starting in the  1990s, many research teams began

to  investigate ways of modelling  features of the users of hypermedia

systems. This has led to a number of interesting adaptation techniques

and  adaptive hypermedia systems. The  Web, with  its clear demand for

personalization,  served as a   real booster  for this  research area,

providing both a challenge and an attractive platform.
