Sccott, it is clear what you are talking about.

Programmers may prefer to change the information for different users. I have
argued that in attempting to provide different people with the same
information that is a bad appraoch to information management.

Servers have nothing to do with CSS, and the andling does not change.

Web designers need to know how web standards are imlemented. CSS and HTML are
in the same bag hereBut using CSS provides for sound underlying semantics
(that you keep asking for and then claim aren't there) while using remodelled
HTML obscures those semantics.

Changing the types of content requires reprogramming ofd a customised
presentation whether it is done in HTML, XML, CSS, RTF, or anything else, and
then generated. THe point is that it is not relevant (incidentally it isn't
relevant whether the content is dynamic or not - the principles apply
anyway).

The case where users are customising for themselves is a different kettle of
fish, The work trhat Dan Brickley has done is a good place to investigate the
state of the art here. But even that begins from a common basis with the same
starting point being there for all to return to. There is an important
difference between customised information (I read the sprots section and you
read the business section of the newspaper) and customised presentation (I
get the broadsheet and spread it out on the table, you browse it
electronically with a palm pilot). This discussion is only relevant to the
latter case, obviously.

  Hi, Charles
  
  I may not have been making myself very clear.  The situation I'm talking
  about is where web pages are being generated dynamically, e.g. results
  from search engines, personalized web pages, etc.  The contents of the
  web pages will vary from user to user.  This means that a goal
  of each user getting the same content is probably in conflict with
  why web pages are being generated dynamically.
  
  I believe that your analysis of style sheets is not taking in consideration
  the programmers who will do the programming of the software which will
  be creating the web pages.  How will the approach you are proposing
  of using style sheets make their work easier?
  
  First, style sheets require that the web pages be written with enough
  information for classes, etc, to be able to be used in different formats.
  Why would the programmer not prefer just to have the software just
  write out different formats instead of doing all the works of classes, etc?
  
  The second problem for programmers is what to do if new content requires
  new forms.  That means that new classes have to be developed.  The
  style sheets have to be changed.  There can be version skews with
  style sheets.  The style sheets have to be tested with each browser.
  Sounds like a lot of extra work with minimal benefit.
  
  I don't see a lot of benefit to server-side style sheets for dynamically
  generated web pages.  You have to figure out the server's implementation
  of style sheets, etc.  What happens if a new type of server is brought in?
  The style sheet handling can break.  Again, what is the advantage
  to the programmer?
  
  Each fall I help with teaching the New Product Development course in
  Berkeley's business school.  One of the principles I strongly recommend
  is "user empathy".  Students often come in with what they believe
  to be the correct technological solution to something and have
  a hard time not understanding why users would not want the
  technological solution.  I tell them that they need to step out
  of who they are and into the shoes of various types of users
  and also the people who are developing or maintaining the technology.
  The ability to empathize with the various people who will be
  involved with the technology gives better insight into when the
  technology may or may not be useful.
