As per the discussion of the 13 January 200 telecon [1], I have updated the 
errata to reflect Gregg's suggestion.

item 6 now reads:
<blockquote>
6. Placement of labels for form controls.
Added: 23 November 1999.
Modified: 20 January 2000.
Type: Error
Refers to: Checkpoint 10.2 in 5 May 1999 version.
Description (and correction).  The note for checkpoint 10.2 should be 
reworded to say, "A label for a text area, a text input control or group of 
controls (e.g., a group of checkboxes) must immediately precede its control 
(or group of controls) on the same line (if there is only one control or 
group)  or be in the line preceding the control (or group of 
controls).  Refer also to checkpoint 12.4."
</blockquote>

the change was to add the phrase "(if there is only one control or group)" 
to cover the following example:
(The capital Os on the second line are radio buttons)
Hot Cold Off
   O     O     O
