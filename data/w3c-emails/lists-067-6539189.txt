I do not think that we need special guidelines for a page generated 
dynamically by XSL transformation. The guidelines that we have for 
markup of the "content document" and the guidelines for 
"stylesheets" do the job. Transforming the page by XSL is applying 
a stylesheet to the page.

One thing that is needed is to extend XHTML to include markup for 
webbish constructes such as navigation bars. This will allow authors 
to mark the content well and users may use various transforming 
stylesheets, according to their needs/preferences.

This type of addition to XHTML seems as a better solution than
requiring content providers to study in detail the needs of every user.

The author of a page will have only to know what he is trying to say. 
The designer of the stylesheet, that may be the user or his browser, will
have 
to know how he wants to read the page. Did someone say "separate
content/structure 
from presentastion?" XML and XSLT allow for this separation to higher level
than HTML and CSS.

In general, it is desirable that WAI will actively work on other 
specifications of W3C, rather than passively create guidelines how 
to use the "given" specifications. (I am not saying that WAI doesn't do 
as I propose) Clearly, when WAI started the latter 
was of greater urgency, but I think priorities may change.

Nir.
