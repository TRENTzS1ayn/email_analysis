Hi, Nir

The professional work I've done in human-computer interaction
is strongly based on observing users.  Therefore, I've been watching
blind people using web pages.  There are some fairly predictable
problems which can be avoided if the pages are designed for blind users.

While there has been a strong drive towards "universal design" in many areas,
dynamic web page generation is a technology which does not benefit
from that approach.  Technology like XML/XSL/XSTL allows each web page
to be created for each user's needs.  This means that there need not be
any compromises made for one user in order to avoid inconvenience
for another.

I can get my dynamically web pages with rich visual design.  Blind web
page users can get their web pages without the visual aspects which
makes it harder to navigate with access technology.

As an experiment, observe a blind person navigating through the two
different web pages at my demo site at:

     http://members.aol.com/criptrip/dynamic_web_pages/demo.html

Which is easier for them to use?  I happen to prefer the more visually
interesting format which is harder for blind people to navigate.
Why shouldn't I get that type of web page?  Why should the type of
dynamically generate web page I like be compromised?

The content guidelines forces certain styles of writing web pages and
certain compromises which are important for stored web pages but
really are not needed for dynamically generated web pages.

I'm sorry to say, but your suggestion of extending XHTML for webbish
constructs is rather simplistic.  My suggestion would be to observe
blind users working with web pages.  Keep track of amount of time
and effort.  Observe how long it takes to find something on a web page and how
often they get lost.

I don't quite understand your comment on it being preferable that WAI
not create guidelines for using given specifications.  It would seem that
the guidelines/techniques do just that, e.g. recommending use of the LABEL
tag, not using TABLE for layout, etc.
