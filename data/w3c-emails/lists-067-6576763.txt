Hi, Nir

The reason I said that the suggestion about extending XHTML is
simplistic is that there needs to be more research into what problems
blind people have using web pages.  The issue of navigation bars is
actually a specific example of a more general problem that blind people
have in navigating through web pages.  In general, blind people will
work more efficiently when web pages are organized along lines of the
importance of semantic information.  In the case of navigation bars,
navigation bars are of less semantic importance and it would be better
to put them after the more important information of the dynamically
generated web page.

Please remember that the discussion is about dynamically generated web
pages.  This almost automatically implies that some level of programming
is involved.


Since there has been little discussion on what is needed for web pages
designed for blind users, it is not very easy to conclude how much
effort is needed in developing them.  Also, having a separate web page
for blind users might simplify development of web pages for sighted
users.  So, it might be that a larger, complex problem of developing
dynamically generated web pages for both blind and sighted user could be
replaced by two smaller, simpler problems.


I would agree that the guidelines should stick to principles or axioms.
The question to be resolved is whether there is the same of set of
axioms for stored pages as there is for dynamically generated web pages.
This cannot be answered until there is better understanding about what
is needed in web pages dynamically generated for blind users in order
that they can can be both efficient and accurate when using the web
pages.


In terms of dynamic web pages for blind users, it is irrelevant whether
the HTML was generated from XML, databases or any other data source.
The more important aspect is that the resulting HTML has the appropriate
information and structure needed by blind people using the dynamically
generated web pages in order to be efficient and accurate when using the
web pages.
