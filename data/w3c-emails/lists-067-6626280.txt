Hi, Charles

I believe the analysis is incomplete.  Is the issue to skip over links
in the navigation bar or is the issue to get to the most important
information on the page?  Why do users want to jump over navigation
bars?  Also, why would people with upper arm limitations need to jump
over navigation bar links?  Is the issue then that there needs to be mechanisms
to help people who tab sequentially through links to be more efficient?
