This is a very good issue, but having all URIs refer to static resources is
not the solution.

The last time this one went around on www-talk can be found in a thread
indexed at

 <http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1999MayJun/thread.html#38>

The thread carries over into the following July-August archive, too.

I am not saying that the present technology is perfect. or that the
industry is in consensus on how the system should work in this area.  The
semantics of URIs generate heated conflicts among people of deep knowledge
and general good intentions.  The lack of a clear roadmap for application
of schemas and namespaces is coupled to this disunion in the community.

Many of the references [call them bookmarks, favorites, links or whatever]
that one wants to save are to services that tell one new things on each visit.

The general semantics of a URI-reference is that it is a handle or
representation of a query;  Depending on the query the response to the
query may be uniquely determined no matter when the query is asked, or it
may change as time rolls on.  This is not always discernable from the text
of the URI-reference itself, and particularly not from the scheme and
syntax of the URI-reference itself.

Pedantic point:  There is a class of URI schemes known as URNs.  Some of
these are specifically designed as an attempt to have better understanding
of the stability of the information identified from the reference itself.
On the other hand, this technology has not won widespread use yet.  Hence
it is not clear that our issue of interoperating people with different data
views (GUI and speech, for example) is going to be solved by the universal
adoption of URNs.

The need to be able to synchronize between people who are accessing
information is very real, but forcing all URLs to refer to static
information is overkill and would accomplish a total disconnect between our
set of rules and the Web run by money.

The distinction between the "data date" and "report date" in accounting
printouts is pretty widely understood.  What we need to be working with is
a similar distinction.  We need a way for people to be able to be sure that
they are accessing the same information, even when it is presented
differently.


One interesting fact is that although one does not necessarily know from
the URI-reference in the referring document whether the resource identified
is static or dynamic, if HTTP is used to its best, you do know from the
response how dynamic the response is.  There are effectivity metadata
fields defined for the HTTP headers that can make this clear.

The blind discussant and the sighted discussant need to compare identifying
attributes of the documents they hold, not the links they exercised.

The response of the system should be predictable; but not necessarily static.
