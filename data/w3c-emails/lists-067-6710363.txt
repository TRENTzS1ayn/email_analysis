Emmanuelle's response forwarded with permission.

Anyone have a good way to move fowards? Possibilities seem to include:

asking the Protocols and Formats group to look at the issue in regards to
XHTML, changing our approach to validity, producing a DTD that includes
features we are missing, but are supported by browsers, sticking to our
recommendation and not worryinbg about it...

  Dear Charles:

  Thank you for the copy of this message.

  I find the recommendation of not using animations not very realistic, the
  fact is that the webmaster loves to use animations, so if we seek that
they
  follow the rules of accessibility it is necessary to offer them an
  alternative.

  The problem with TIFLOWIN persists because it is a very cheap program, so,
  although many blind men and people with visual deficiencies JAWS uses,
many
  others continue using TIFLOWIN because it is a program in Spanish and
  because it is within reach of its economy. At this time the JAWS is
  translating to Spanish and I know that the ONCE (National Organization of
  Blind of Spain) it will reach an agreement to distribute this program to
its
  members. Then, when the people stops to be used the TIFLOWIN definitively
  there will no longer be problems with the animations, but at the moment it
  is necessary to offer a solution, although this thwarts the
recommendations
  of the WAI.

  But also, because TIFLOWIN hangs the computer when he/she finds something
  that moves in the screen, this affects to the use of menus or any other
  element that moves in the screen, or when CSS is used and it is used
  A:hover. That makes indispensable to only offer a version text of the
pages.
  For it, although I am not in favor of the specific versions for a certain
  community, it has been necessary to enable a version text of the pages of
  the SIDAR.

  Thank you for your interest.

  Greetings,
