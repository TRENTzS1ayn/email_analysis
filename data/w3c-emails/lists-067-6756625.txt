Hi, Jonathan

I think that the issue of blind people and sighted people needing to share
the same web page for communication is actually rather minor.  As I've
talked with blind users, I asked them how often is it that they settle
down with some sighted friend and spend their time web surfing together.
You know what?  For some unknown reason, web surfing with a buddy was not
high on their lists of frequent or preferred activities.

As one blind person pointed out, there's no reason why the sighted friend
couldn't use the web pages designed for blind users.
