Hi, Jonathan

User needs assessment is a rather complicated topic.  The issues of
ethnography, interviewing, observation, user profiling, story boarding,
simulations, usability can all get involved.  What kind of references
would you like?  Ben Shneiderman out of University of Maryland has done
some nice work on the ethnography stuff which is probably the most current
trend in user needs analysis.
