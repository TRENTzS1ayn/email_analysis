So long as the user is choosing the presentation to  be applied o the
underlying information, and have access to that underlying information, then
tthey can be sure they are all getting the same thing. Jonathan's point, that
presentation can carry semantics is important - the auhor neeeds to sort this
one out forr each case.

It is when the underlying information given to users is different that the
problem arises.

  This just cannot make sense, the presentation DOES affect the meaning.

  It is all very well Al not wishing  a "total disconnect between our
  set of rules and the Web run by money."
  Who is the code being written for the end users or the middle men?
  If accessibility is just a sop to salve the conscience of the money men
  count me out.
