Scott, I find your tone both patronising and unpleasant.
It maybe that blind and sighted people conferring over pages is a minor
issue.

My clients have learning or cognitive disabilities.
They almost always require some kind of advice.
The opportunity the web offers already to provide precis or summaries is
woderful. However we need to bear in mind that should different versions of
the same text be offered they remain so.
