I have yet again to disagree.
I understand that historically WAI may have come from the initiatives that
you outline.
I should perhaps add that, people with cognitive disabilities, because of
their circumstance rarely have need to engage in purchasing. Not that this
is ideal.

As I imagine it in the future, and possibly presently the vast bulk of links
are from individuals. Not necessarily partaking of commercial content rather
social interaction. There is also a centre third of small business and
academics who have no need or requirement for the latest technologies.

The ability to author pages easily would effect the balance considerably.

It is these non commercial sites that the vast majority of hits by people
with disabilities  relate to.
It is by enabling the average person to author accessible pages that much is
to be achieved.

A superb and accessible leading edge site may raise the profile of WAI, but
if it is near impossible for any individual to imitate, it will not have the
desired trickle down.

Dynamic pages are one of these technologies they would be better accessible,
but jo doe will not be able to use (ie pass on) the accessibility, more
especially if he cannot find it again.
