In case member would like some stats to back up my arguments about private
non commercial browsing.

www.peepo.com which is completely non commercial averages 1450 hits per
week, and has highs of 8000 hits per week and 500 user sessions per week.

I work hard but there is no way I can visit that many sites commercial or
no.
