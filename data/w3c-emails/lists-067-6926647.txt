And I agree with Scott in this. This is actually one issue in the UA group
that often comes up, because we want to be able to offer users with
different disabilities means that best support their access to the pages.
That often means that the user tailors the UI of the browser according to
her needs. To do that well we need to know what best supports the users.
Usability and other human-computer interaction research is valuable in
finding new approaches that can better help users and in seeing the
problems with old approaches. And there is a lot of work in that area that
can be done.
