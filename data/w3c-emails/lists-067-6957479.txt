Hi, Jonathan

Here's a URL for a paper by Shneiderman about applying ethnography
to redesigning interfaces.  The URL is:

    ftp://ftp.cs.umd.edu/pub/hcil/Reports-Abstracts-Bibliography/95-07html/95-07.html

(Please notice that the URL starts with ftp: rather than the usual http:.)


A list of Shneiderman's papers can be found at URL:

    http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/members/bshneiderman/umlpapers/articles.html

He has written on many aspects of human-computer interaction.


Scott
