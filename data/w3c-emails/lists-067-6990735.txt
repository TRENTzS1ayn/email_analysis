Hi,

Here are some links which refer to user-centered design which is related to
user needs analysis.

    http://inf2.pira.co.uk/use-bck.htm
    http://sims.berkeley.edu/courses/is213/s99/Lectures.html


These are links to pages on usability testing which is also related to
user needs analysis.  Some of the techniques are similar.
