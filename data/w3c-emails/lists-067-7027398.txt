Scott,
A sighted person could use web pages designed for blind user only to the
same extent that blind persons can use web pages designed for "average"
users. Blind persons *can* use web pages loaded with graphics and missing
alt tags as long as there is some text or sound. Likewise, sighted users
*can* use web pages without graphics and visual formatting. But neither
user is well served. The blind users can't access the information in the
graphics, and the sighted users can't access graphics that aren't there. I
suspect that the blind person who made this statement is mis-informed on
the prevelence of sighted users who depend on the visual elements as surely
as blind users depend on their speech synthesizers. A blind user without
speech equipment would find an all-text presentation as useless as a
cognitively impaired person would.
