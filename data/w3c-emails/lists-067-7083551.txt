If this is a problem with dealing with the collections and the collections 
are all about how to make things usable, then perhaps you ought to point 
that out to the people who maintain the collections. <grin>

Scott, why don't you pull together all of the URLs that you've been sending 
to the list and post them in one place with a bit of annotation for each 
one?  We can point to this list from the WCAG Techniques document.

Looking at the collections, i think you will find that they have tried to 
address the issue of overwhelming people with information.  of the two 
sources that marja cited, the first, the HCI Bibliography, links to a list 
of "recommended readings" divided into several categories [available at 
http://www.acm.org/~perlman/readings.html]

Jakob Nielsen also tries to do some filtering by highlighting seven of his 
"alert box" columns.  He also provides a "hot list" for reading that seems 
categorized in easy to understand categories [available at 
http://www.useit.com/hotlist/].

Another site to point out, one that Jakob refers to, is "usable web" 
maintained by Keith Instone.  He has a category called "Accessibility" 
[available at http://usableweb.com/items/access.html].  Perhaps someone 
could work with him to massage this into a list that is most appropriate to 
our needs.
