Hi, Anne

The context in which the statement was made was when a blind person and
a sighted person might need to reference the same dynamically
generated web page.  In this situation, it is probably easier for
a sighted person to use a web page designed for a blind user than it
is for a blind person to use a web page designed for a sighted user.

If they need not be referencing the same dynamically web page, then your
comments are reasonable.
