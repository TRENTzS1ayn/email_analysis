The additional issues to be discussed at the meeting include:

a. Clarification of SUMMARY and TITLE attributes and CAPTION element for
techniques document.

b. Checkpoint 11.1 (this issue was not completely resolved last week)

c. Tracking levels of CSS implementation and inconsistencies among
different implementations for user agent support page and techniques
document (is this already being carried out externally, E.G. by the W3C
style activity or other organisations)?

d. Flicker (issues for user agent support page and techniques document?)

e. Checkpoint 14.2: interpretation, priority, verification, etc.
