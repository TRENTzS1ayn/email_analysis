Hi, Wendy

We might not be seeing the purpose of the information in the same way.
The original request for information came from a mailing list member.
The purpose of the URL's that I sent out was to provide background
information to list members about user-centered design and
usability testing.  I was thinking that as more list members became
familiar with these fields, there would be greater understanding about
how various techniques from these fields could be useful in the
process of developing guidelines.

Perhaps, there needs to be a web page related to the guidelines working
group which lists suggested background information materials for people
involved with the guidelines.  List members could make suggestions about
pages which have good online introductory materials for people who want
basic familiarity with the various subjects.  For those people who want
more background information, there could be links to various collections
of online/offline materials.
