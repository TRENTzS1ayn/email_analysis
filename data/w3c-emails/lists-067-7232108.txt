Hi, Anne

The comment was a general solution to a problem.  There are of course
situations where it may not always be true.  I'm also very dependent on
visual information, but I believed that bringing up the issues of people
who are dependent on visual information would have been distracting from the
main point I was making.  My goal was not to solve all possible conflicts.
