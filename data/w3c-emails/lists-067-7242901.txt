Scott,

My response to you was, "great!  create it and we'll use it!"  I agree, if 
participants on this list were more familiar with user centered design, 
that would be great.  It would also be great if all participants in the 
working group had a general understanding of business practices, the latest 
Web technologies, professional Web design, professional Web development, 
assistive technology tool development, etc.

This is why we try to invite participants with a variety of expertise so 
that not everyone has to learn everything about everything.  Perhaps we 
ought to have "suggested reading lists" for each of the topics that we need 
expertise in.  We also need to invite experts in each of these topics.

Since we have just rechartered and released a call for participation, in a 
sense we can "begin anew."  If people have suggestions of companies or 
people that the chairs and I can target to get involved in the group, I 
welcome all of your suggestions.

So, let's create a reading resource!  This will be helpful for new 
participants who are not familiar with our work.  I don't currently have 
the resources to do this myself.  Scott and Jonathan, you both seem 
interested. If you create a resource, the group can review it, and we'll 
link to it once it's in shape.

thanks,
--wendy
