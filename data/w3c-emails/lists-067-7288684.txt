Hi all,

I tried cleaning up our home page so it is a bit easier to find 
things.  Let me know if it helps.  Note that i update it *at least* weekly, 
usually right after meetings.  I link to the day's minutes right after I 
post them. I hope y'all get into the habit of checking this page often!

thanks,
--wendy
