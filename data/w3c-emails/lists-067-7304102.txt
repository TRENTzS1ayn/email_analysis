Anne and myself have been raising the fact that the WAI site is inaccessible
to non-techy readers, and that the guidelines are far too biased towards
blind disabilities, for a number of months.
There is little evidence of any action being taken.

I realise that present members may not have the necessary skills.
However burying oneself in the current deluge of 3.1, 3.1a, 3.1aa etc is not
helpful or indicative of an intention to change.
It may be essential, but is not addressing what we see as the main problem.

Thanking you all for your good intentions and willingness to change.
What changes are being proposed, for discussion?
