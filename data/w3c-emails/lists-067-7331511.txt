>Provide a few word description of the table with the "title" attribute.

PJ: I don't agree with also adding a "title" attribute, it is too redundant
and there are no examples of why it would be needed.  We are asking the
author, tools, and browser to do too much and loose them in the process.
Even if a browser rendered the "title" attribute, what would it add as far
as accessibility in addition to the surrounding text, caption, summary, and
table itself? "Title" attribute was not in the original techniques [1], why
add it now?
