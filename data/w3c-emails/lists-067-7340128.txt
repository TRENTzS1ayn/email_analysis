Hi, Wendy

I probably wasn't very clear in my message about what people would be
using the references.  What confused me was that you mentioned about
putting a link in the techniques document.  I thought you were thinking
of the references as being used by people who read the techniques
document rather than people working on the guidelines.  It looks like
we both have the same view of who would be using the references.

I'd like to see the reading list web page as part of the web site
for WAI-GL.  It would seem more integrated and would have more
recognition as part of the process of developing the guidelines.
Is there a format from W3 which should be followed for a uniform
appearance?

Scott
