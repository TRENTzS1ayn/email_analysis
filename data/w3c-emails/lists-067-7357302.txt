TITLE is useful as an aid to structural navigation. For example, a
speaking browser that is traversing the document structurally could
announce the title of the table. However, I agree that TITLE is redundent
if CAPTION is present, and would recommend using one or the other (at the
author's discretion), but not both. Also, it should be recalled that in
the guidelines, this entire matter (of table summaries etc.) is a priority
3 item, in which case the argument that the author is being required to do
too much, relative to the access advantages, carries less weight.
