 i concur with phil.  i had used the title early on and it wrecked havoc on
pwWebSPeak and other tools as I would get the alt and title spoken so it
provided  redundant words. I also would be concerned that this would
convolute implementation.

i have not used title since and have avoided it.  unless i am missing the
point, i do not see any value added.  what does title bring to the table?
