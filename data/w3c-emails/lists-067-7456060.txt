I have spent a lot of time making our web accessible site using CSS. I
found out late in the game that the pages do not print properly except in
NS4.6 on a MAC. All other browsers/OS'es really jumble the pages when sent
to the printer. Is there a fix for this? Has anyone else ever asked the
same question?

thank you
