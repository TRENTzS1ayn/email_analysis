Hi, Wendy

I've gotten comments from a couple more of people on the mailing list
about my demo and have made a slight change based on a suggestion
from one of them.  I'm not sure if other people are still looking at
the demo.

What happens now?  Will a discussion on the demo be scheduled?
Also, I was thinking it might be good to schedule a discussion
on the group's using observation as a methodology to get more
understanding of the needs of disabled people when using web p.
