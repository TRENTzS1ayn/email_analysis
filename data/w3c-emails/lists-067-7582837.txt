PNG in its full specification is a superset of both GIF and JPG: Anything that can be done in either can be done in PNG, and done better. Browser support for all the features of PNG, however, is still spotty.

Hmm. THere are graphics such as photographs which I believe are better
expressed as JPG than as PNG (I will check this with CHris Lilley, or someone
else who knows more than me). But JPG is not a W3C recommendation.

THere is also WebCGM that could be in that list, although we have not really
looked at how it is used.

What should we do about HTML and XHTML? SHould we be recommending the use of
XHTML instead of HTML? And similarly CSS1 and CSS2 have important differences
in their cascade, and we need to know (more particularly in the User Agent
case I guess) which is being used.

  Hi,
  
  The "Techniques for checkpoint 11.1" used to link to the "Browser
  Support" section in the Techniques document.  This talks about the User
  Agent support page and that not all W3C technologies are currently
  supported.  That didn't seem to satisfy what needed to be done for 11.1
  (Use w3c technologies...).  Therefore, I created a new section since
  I couldn't figure out how to either reword the title of "Browser
  support" and combine the two ideas.  Thus, I propose the following new
  section:
  
  <blockquote>
  
  4.13 Accessibility Reviewed Technologies
  
            Checkpoints in this section: 11.1.
  
            WCAG 1.0 suggests using W3C Technologies since they have been
  reviewed for
            accessibility issues and therefore have accessibility features
  built-in. The latest
            W3C technologies are available from the W3C Technical Reports
  and Publications
            page.
  
            Breif overview of current W3C technologies:
                  MathML for mathematical equations
                  HTML, XHTML, XML for structured documents
                  RDF for meta data
                  SMIL to create multimedia presentations
                  CSS and XSL to define style sheets
                  XSLT to create style transformations
                  PNG for graphics
