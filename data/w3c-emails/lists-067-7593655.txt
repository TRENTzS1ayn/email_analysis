Then it is surprising that the PNG's own introduction makes no
such claim, indeed it states:

 The Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format was designed to replace
 the older and simpler GIF format and, to some extent, the much more
 complex TIFF format.

and

 Note that for transmission of finished truecolor
 images--especially photographic ones--JPEG is almost always a better
 choice. Although JPEG's lossy compression can introduce visible
 artifacts, these can be minimized, and the savings in file size even
 at high quality levels is much better than is generally possible with
 a lossless format like PNG.
