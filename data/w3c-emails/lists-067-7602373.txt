Both of these groups will be effected.
It is important to recognise that literacy and comprehension have
definitions that are more limited than the people that are referred to.
These disabilities represent a continuum.

It is at least as important to realise that the response must also be
suitable.
Google scores well here too.
Many query responses come with massive banner ads that require the user to
scroll to find the desired answer.
This is clearly not helpful or accessible.
Some people have great difficulty using a scroll bar.
