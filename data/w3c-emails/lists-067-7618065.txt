I am currently looking for a www dictionary that produces a one sentence
'My first dictionary' response without banner ads, frames.. and not
childish.

No phonetics, no alternate meanings except gross ie
mine:     belonging to me
mine:    a deep hole

Possibly providing a short list of similar sounding words eg
dear:    a loved one
deer:    a four legged animal with antlers

Surely in a civilised society this is a simple and popular necessity.
Ideally this should be incorporated in the current page without a refresh.

http://dictionary.com                                              Too many
banner ads, and a little too verbose
http://www.goldendome.net/Tools/WebSter            No banner ads, much too
verbose

If you think you have seen something suitable please forward to me.
