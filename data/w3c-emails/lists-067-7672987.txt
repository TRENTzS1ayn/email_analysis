I don't disagree that cause of blindness or illiteracy is immaterial.

But I guess my question is more bottom-line: How can site owners (such as
the WAI) represent large amounts of text (such as guidelines) so that it is
accessible to non-readers? How can the many concepts in those guidelines be
represented in non-text form?

Likewise, what can the online version of the New York Times do to make it
possible for non-readers to get all of the day's news? Is it enough that an
audio summary is available via Audible.com?

Do sighted non-readers ever use screen reader software so they can listen to
the text on a Web page?

Dick, a person isn't judged worth or unworthy blind  by whether their
blindness is a result of birth or degenrative disease, or whether it was
caused by carelessness or accident. Likewise, people who can't use text
include those who were unable to learn to read either because of cognitive
differences or lack of opportunity. It's also immaterial if the non-reader
will someday be able to accomodate text, but not yet, as in the case of
children. 

As long as those involved with addressing web design, continue to point out
graphic-less, text-only pages as "accomdating disabilities", many folks
with life-limiting disabilities will continue to be "left out" of the
movement to make the web assessable to all. If Yahoo's pages are promoted
as the best example of how to make the web accessible to "all", the critics
have a wide-open door to disregard the initiative's guidelines since they
aren't really inclusive of this large subgroup of the disabled "all".
