aloha, wendy!

fine job, as usual, but (there's always a but, isn't there, especially when a
smoker's involved) one small nitpick...  in the minutes located at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/meetings/20000203.html

i am recorded as stating:

quote
GR rather than break down by technology, but "meta" by W3C activity. e.g., meta
- rdf, png, etc.
unquote

when what i (at least intended) to say:

quote
GR rather than break down by technology, break down first on a "meta" level by
W3C activity. e.g., graphics would include PNG, GIF, JPEG; style would include
CSS, XSL, and XSLT; metadata would include meta data, schemas, rdf; etc.
unquote

thanks, er, sorry, er, thanks!
        g.
