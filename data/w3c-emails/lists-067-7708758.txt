I am very glad to have the opportunity to than you publicly for raising many
important issues that are worthy of attention.
We need to discuss these topics in order to produce valid results.

My main concern is with surfing rather than page content.
ie how can one enable non-readers and those with cognitive disabilites to
gain the most from their experience with the web.

In a broad sense we may be sure that those things which cannot be stated in
a well phrased sentence are few and far between.
That is the purpose of news headlines, and photos.
(No-one except a pedant gets all the days news, we flick through and pick
out that which concerns us, surfing the page.)
It is more a question of ensuring that one can find suitable media,
and that one is not consumed by irrelevant detail.

Accessibility is thus concerned with the formatting of the information, and
it is important to provide evidence of good practice.
WAI has some way to go. Currently the site is very text heavy and provides
very little of benefit not only to those we discuss, but the mass
population. http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/Gallery.html represents a
change in direction that could benefit everyone.

Photographs are of enormous benefit, as are symbols.

----

There is a natural divide between illiteracy and cognitive disabilities.
People with cognitive disabilities would certainly not benefit from streams
of spoken text at high speed.
Equally whilst the blind currently have few objections, the illiterate might
not wish to confront their disability so directly.
Would you consider this approach in their best interest?

--

It is not merely that we should seek to create executive summaries of
everything.
We need to consider in what way that information is to be accessed.
Most of our students have expert skills in some areas, they suffer due to
their weaknesses in others.

How are non-readers to be enabled to gain access to the expert areas that
are their concerns and at the same time be enabled in those areas that are
their weakness?
