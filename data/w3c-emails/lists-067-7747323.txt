Jonathon has made suggestions for this previously. Large amounts of text
will pose the same problem as large numbers of graphics. The blind person
will lose comprehension of a page of graphics, even if tagged, just as a
severely cognitively/reading disabled person will lose comprehension of a
page of text even if it is marked with eye-catching fonts in titles and
subtitles, and the use of color to mark items of note in the text.

Let Jonathon answer definitively for his end of the population, but the
folks I've worked with would enjoy an audio summary on something that can
be installed free, such as real player.

The PC's just delivered for my computer lab at a K-2nd grade school do NOT
include any screen reader software. Nor have I been given a budget to
purchase software even tho this is a change from MAC's to PC's (Actually,
the only software tha came with it is Windows NT with Paint, Notepad and
Wordpad... if this  were the place to do it, I'd be soliciting software
donations!)
