I thnk there is more than a resource problem here. It is genuinely difficult
to absorb large amounts of information aurally, as anyone who has sat through
an lecture knows. There are people who are very skilled at making it seem
effortless, but for most of us as authors that is a very challenging part of
the task. It is also a very important part.

There are extremely good, free, screen reader solutions available today,
but they will not solve the problem. The bottom line question that Dick asks
is one that primary school teachers, parents, and older siblings ask
themselves many times each day. Intuitively we understand that this can be
done, but the challenge for the working group is to extend that everyday
activity to the way we produce web content, and to understand how to express
it in our guidelines and techniques.

  I think anne has really centred on the problem.
  mostly our students rely on the cast off computers from admin.
  naturally they do not have specialist software, and are a few years old.
