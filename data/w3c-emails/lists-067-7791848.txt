Dear WAI-GL mailing list subscribers:

As you may know, the Charter of the Web Content Guidelines working group
has recently been renewed.   The old working group is therefore being
dissolved.

All members of the old working group are invited to join the new one.
You should do this by
1) reading over the new charter for the working group
2) filling out the application to join the new working group

You can get to information on both by going to:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/gl/howto-join-wg.html

So if you are interested in continuing with the new working group, please
read the new charter and fill out the application for the new group


Thanks much

Jason and Gregg
GL Working Group Chairs
