For those who already signed up for the New GL group just recently -  AND
filled out the form   ? you do not need to fill out another one now.

All those who have been in the old GL but have not filled out the form for
the new one  -- you need to sign up for the new group if you would like to
continue. (and we welcome you)


Thanks

Gregg
