Hi, Gregory

Your response is kind of unexpected.  First, the use of text-only versions
means that the NY Times is out of compliance with the guidelines.

Another interesting aspect is that your comment supports what I've been
saying about the usefulness of multiple versions of dynamically
generated web pages.  It also points out that the guidelines may need
to have different requirements depending on whether the web pages are
created dynamically or not.
