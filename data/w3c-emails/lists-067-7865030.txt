aloha, scott!

extending my complimentary comments on a text-only version of a site that 
is comprehensively updated every 24 hours to a text-only version of a more 
static site mis-characterizes my comments...

my response represents a gut-level reaction that is (a) common amongst 
blind users because they have no better alternatives; (b) is an example of 
a well-thought-out alternative to the full-blown graphical version of the 
site; (c) a solution which not only pre-dates WCAG; but which was not 
intended to be a quote accessibility-oriented unquote implementation; and 
(d) is specific to a particular site which is conscientiously updated to be 
in sync with the full-blown graphical version of the site...

furthermore, whilst i am philosophically opposed to the maintenance of 
parallel text-only sites, the new york times' text-only slash low bandwidth 
site does not strike me as an incidence of cyber-ghettoization, as it is 
not a static parallel, but is as dynamically updated as the high-bandwidth 
version of the site...  and, i'd hardly be surprised if the content 
contained in both versions comes from one central source and is then dumped 
into the appropriate template...

the text-only slash low-bandwidth version of the new york times site is 
simply an example of providing a much needed service -- making the content 
of the site available to the broadest range of users possible...  the 
text-only version wasn't created with accessibility in mind, but with 
convenience, general usability, and (most importantly from the service 
providers' point of view) maximum market penetration in mind -- you may 
recall that the online version of the new york times was not originally 
intended to be free forever, but was originally intended as a pilot program 
to ascertain demand for an online version of the newspaper, which the times 
originally envisioned as a fee-for-service site, out of fear of undermining 
sales of the print edition, but which proved so popular that no-fee access 
to the content of the newspaper continues today...  in summation, it is an 
example of something that works for a lot of disabled users by 
happenstance, and not design, which bolsters the argument that 
accessibility issues aren't quote special case unquote  issues, but general 
usability issues...
