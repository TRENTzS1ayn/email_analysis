Except that in the area of cognitive disabilities, having multiple versions
of what is allegedly the same function, that does not behave in a predictable
way, is probably a reasonably serious problem.

Also, we have three levels of priority. P1 is clearly basic access. P2 is
useful access, which is stepping into the area of usability. P3, as I
understand it, is essentially useability. And that is becuase there isn't a
hard dividing line. I think the idea of having P3 requirements is a good one,
in part becuase the usability stuff is important, and in part becuase it
shows developers where to aim for.

  Hi John,
  
  Hmmmmm    it is a toss up whether these are good web design issues or
  Disability Access Issues.
  We try to limit the guidelines to just ACCESS issues.
  I'll float them to the list though (unless WAI@tommy does that already)

  Hello WAI people,
  I have two questions: one concerning the web content guidelines, and one
  concerning user agent design.
  1.Web content guidelines
  
  The visitor is often confused when the web designer adds a button labelled
  "back" on the page.  The user has no idea whether this has the same effect
  as the "back" button on the browser, and, if not, what the difference is.
  As a general principle, I suggest:
  "Leave the browser to do the functions it can do, and have the web
  applications only to do the functions which the browser cannot do."
  Should this principle be embodded in the content guidelines?
  
  2.User agent design
  
  Even little efforts by the web designer to "help" the user in navigation can
  be problematical.  For example I have seen a "top" button at the bottom of a
  page, designed to make it easier for the user to get to the top of the page.
  After pressing "top", the next press of the browser's "back" button may take
  you to the bottom of the page, but I believe that with most browsers it will
  not take you back to the previous page you visited, as you probably wanted
  it to.
  What _should_ the browser do in this case?
  As a general rule, should the browser put links _within_ a page on the
  return stack or not?
  Do the user agent guidelines have anything to say on this?
  Cheers,
  John
