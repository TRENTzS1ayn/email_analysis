aloha, kynn!

in response to scott, you observed:

"absolutely necessary" is hard to define.
Note, also, that it doesn't forbid the creation of text-only sites for 
_non-disability-access_ reasons.  For example, it's possible that they 
think a text-only site is the best way to convey their information or 
they're trying to cater to a Lynx crowd.

which was part of my original point -- the alternate slash parallel version 
of the site was created with anything but accessibility in mind -- maximum 
market penetration is what the times was and is after, and their text only 
version not only caters to the text-only market, but may someday become the 
basis for a fee based dial in phone service...
