Hi, Gregory

Suppose that you were appearing before a congressional sub-committee.
How would you argue before them why no functionality provided on
web pages should be labelled as being appropriate for blind users?
Why would this be of benefit to most blind web users of various levels
of computer/web sophistication?

Scott
