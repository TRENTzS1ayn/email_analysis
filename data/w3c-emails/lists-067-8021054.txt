Hi Scott,

I would like to encourage you to initiate discussions like this
on the w3c-wai-ig list rather than the w3c-wai-gl list. I believe
that the IG list is more appropriate for general discussions, while
the GL list is more appropriate for concrete discussions about
the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. Due to the amount of
mail I receive and must process, I count on exchanges on this
list to be as lean as possible.

I don't mean to discourage discussion, but to encourage it
in the appropriate forum. If this question has a direct bearing
on the WCAG, it belongs here. It was not clear to me from
your questions that they had a direct bearing on the Working
Group's chartered work.

Thank you for understanding,

 - Ian
