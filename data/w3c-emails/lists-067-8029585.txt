I wasn't endorsing the design consideration, only trying to explain
a possible (valid) design consideration.

As long as you allow access for -everyone-, it -is- a valid design
decision to create pages optimized for a particular browser or
set of browsers.  (Doing this correctly is difficult, which is why
information ghettoization is a problem.)

I don't personally -agree- with this design decision and I would
argue against it, but I would not argue that it's an invalid thing
for someone to want to do.
