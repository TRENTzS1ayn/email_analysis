Scott,

I think this a complex question. And it should be remembered that the primary
role of this group is not to stand up and argue at congress or parliament or
court, but to find the best ways to make the web accessible.

I think that to label something as "appropriate for blind users" in general
is to ignore the varying skill levels, operating methods, and other
differing user needs within the group of people who might expect to use such
features. It is more helpful, in my estimation, to describe functionalities
available. In addition, this will alert people who are not blind, but who
have similar needs, to the fact that they can use them.

(This is still not a full answer, but I hope gives some idea of what a full
answer would be.)

  Hi, Gregory
  
  Suppose that you were appearing before a congressional sub-committee.
  How would you argue before them why no functionality provided on
  web pages should be labelled as being appropriate for blind users?
  Why would this be of benefit to most blind web users of various levels
  of computer/web sophistication?
