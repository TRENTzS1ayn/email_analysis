This might be a casefor making use of tabindex, to increase the prominence of
the site links in the tabbing order while maintaining the graphics of some
navigation (letter) links above and some below.

Thoughts?

  An unashamed plug: www.peepo.com
  our site recently upgraded to allow users to browse with keystrokes.
  ie use your keyboard rather than mouse.
  it is not finished but works in IE5, it currently uses frames and
  javascript, sorry...
  
  However as this has a direct effect on accessibility for people who have
  difficulty navigating with a mouse, take a look.
  tabbing is available.
  Please send me your comments, (probably offline).
  As non of my clients are blind I'd really appreciate if some blind members
  sent me their critiques.
  
  There still remains the issue of navigating to external sites?
  ideas please!
