Hello,

Information about the March WAI meetings and links to the registration 
forms  are available at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/2000/03/agenda.html

Note the following schedule:
WCAG WG meeting March 20
CSUN conference March 21-25
IG WG meeting March 25
AU and EO WG meetings March 26.

Thus, there are 2 registration forms, one for the WCAG WG meeting before 
CSUN and a second one to let you select which of the other meetings (IG, 
AU, and EO) you would like to attend after CSUN.

Please register as soon as possible.  The main topic of discussion for the 
WCAG WG will be the requirements for the next version of the 
Guidelines.  We will also be discussing the Techniques document.  The full 
agenda is available from the general information page cited above.

I look forward to seeing as many of you there as possible.  Hopefully we'll 
see some new faces as well.
