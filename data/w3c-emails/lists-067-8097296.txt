The article Flash and Shockwave Explored, by Josh Smith discusses the 
backwards compatibility issues of Flash and Shockwave, the differences 
between the two, and good authoring practices for creating these 2 file 
types.  There is supposedly a flash and shockwave compatibility table, but 
the link did not work when I tried it. Note that the article is not hosted 
by the most accessible site, there are many images with out alt-text.  It 
was published 7 January 2000 and is available at 
http://webreview.com/pub/2000/01/07/feature/index2.html.

Four bits that I found interesting;

1. <blockquote>
According to Macromedia's own research, 90% of users have the Flash plug-in 
installed; meanwhile 52% of users have the Shockwave plug-in.
</blockquote>

2. <blockquote>
Slocombe, however, is a little less enamoured with Flash. "Almost every 
Flash demonstration I've ever seen has involved a little dot in the middle 
of the screen getting bigger and bigger. How exactly does that add to the 
user experience? It doesn't. "
</blockquote>

3. <blockquote>
many customers have seen sales and hits increase two or three-fold by using 
Shockwave or Flash, which makes the number of visitors lost by using a 
plug-in insignificant in comparison.</blockquote>

4. <blockquote>
The safest answer is to ensure that your site, if it does feature embedded 
files that require plug-ins, doesn't exclusively rely on them. Have a 
simple HTML version of the same content. That way, you're keeping everyone 
happy.
