  On Thursday 17 February, at 2100 UTC, 4 PM Boston time, 10 PM France, 8 AM
  (Friday 18 Feb.) Eastern Australia, there will be a Web Content Guidelines
  working group teleconference, as advertised last week. It will be held on
  the W3C/MIT "Longfellow bridge", as usual, for which the telephone number
  is +1-617-252-1038.
  
  Agenda items:
  
  A review of the internal working draft of the revised Techniques document.
  Participants are encouraged to read the document and bring issues to the
  meeting. The following areas have been identified as requiring particular
  attention:
  
  1. An update to the existing CSS techniques, taking into account recent
  and upcoming user agent releases, without overlooking legacy compatibility
  problems. External resources describing the current state of CSS
  implementation, some of which are listed in the existing Techniques
  document and collected on the W3C Style page (http://www.w3.org/Style/),
  may be useful. Also, the WAI has prepared a note on the access-related
  features of CSS, which may be consulted in the revision of the Techniques:
  see http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS-access
  
  2. Techniques for the creation of accessible multimedia, using the
  Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL): see the SMIL access
  note at 
  
  3. The treatment of non-W3C technologies in the Techniques document.
  
  Note: it is anticipated that the meeting will provide the opportunity to
  discuss the general nature of the proposed work in each of these areas and
  that action items will be assigned to working group members with relevant
  interests.
