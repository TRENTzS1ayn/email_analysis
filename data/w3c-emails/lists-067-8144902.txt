Could you point me to some Web pages
that are for the visual imparied?

I was looking on your Web site and I might
have overlook any examples.

I'm trying to make our Web pages that way.
I do not know anything about Style sheets,
but if I could see some examples  it would really
help.  I'm currently using Tables in my Web page.

Thanks.
