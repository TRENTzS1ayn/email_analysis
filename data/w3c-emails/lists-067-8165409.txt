Hi, Al

I was taking a hypothetical stance.  Basically, I was asking how
would he explain to the world why some features/options designed for
blind users should not be labelled so.

Have you looked at the control panel for windows 95/98?  There is
an icon marked accessibility options.  From my experience as a disabled
person and from comments I've heard from various blind people,
marking features as being appropriate makes it much easier to find
the features which would be of greater interest.  As one blind man
told me, it can be hard for a blind person to find things.  Anything
which helps to simply the searching process would seem to be of benefit.
(Watch blind people trying to find things on a web page.)

Indicating some feature as being of interest to a blind user is
more informative than not doing that and there is not equivalent.

A question to ask is whether it is more important to make a process easier
for a blind person by appropriate labelling or let them waste work/study
time in order not to single them out.  Using a dog or cane already
singles them out.  Maybe it's just the blind people I know, but
the feedback I'm getting is that ease of use would seem to be more
important.
