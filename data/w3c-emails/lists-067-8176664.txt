Some links off the top of my head...

http://www.mitchelton.com.au/ is designed to be accessible to people with
visual impairments. It uses style sheets rather than tables for layout.

http://www.rachelmello.com is partially designed to work for people with
visual impairments. It does use tables for layout (sigh) but does some
sensible things with frames and descriptive text.

http://www.metabusca.com is a search engine that is designed to work well or
people with disabilities. Although it is in Spanish.

The Royal National Institute for the Blind (in the United Kingdom) is
designed for the visually impaired - http://www.rnib.org.uk and also has a
section where they provide links to more pages that are accessible for people
with visual impairments.

to learn more about style sheets visit http://www.w3.org/Style where you will
find links to tools, tutorials, specifications, information, etc.

cheers

  I was looking on your Web site and I might
  have overlook any examples.
  
  I'm trying to make our Web pages that way.
  I do not know anything about Style sheets,
  but if I could see some examples  it would really
  help.  I'm currently using Tables in my Web page.
  
  Thanks.
