Hi, Gregory

For the past five years I've worked with graduate students in understanding
how to evaluate designs of new products.  One of the techniques is called
"scenario analysis".  Basically, it's seeing whether an appproach
or design will work with various characters in differing situations.

I believe that part of the problem is that you have been looking at
what you would like, i.e. adjusting web pages via style sheets.
Look at how other blind people would respond in various web surfing
situations.  Given the option of selecting a button which gives
a more-tailored web page or using style sheets, how many blind people,
besides yourself, would prefer style sheets?  How many blind people
would prefer selecting a button and getting web pages which are
much easier to use, even if not exactly what they want?  Would these
blind users be willing to accept that web pages are "good enough"
match for their needs and avoid the work of fine tuning?

A number of blind users are like you in that they liked the approach
that I took in redesigning the web page.  It may not be exactly
what they would like.  However, given the amount of work they
would had to put in, hitting a link or a button, and the significant
improvement in the web page's ease of use, my impression was that they seemed
satisfied.  Again, from the feedback I got, this would seem to be a success
story in meeting users needs of improved ease of use with little
additional effort on the user's part.
