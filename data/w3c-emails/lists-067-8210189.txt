going through older mail...

Charles, part of your list of what scripts should _not_ be used for is 
already included in the HTML module of the techniques document.  refer to 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#scripts-gt

What is not included I will add.

I would disagree that all browser sniffing by scripts is a bad thing.  An 
example that I heard yesterday is that Netscape 4.0 and 4.01 have very bad 
support of style sheets.  Therefore, an author can determine that those 
browsers should receive the base style sheet while other browsers, such as 
Netscape 4.5, receive a more complicated style sheet.

What I do agree should be avoided is sniffing for only the most recent 
browser and telling everyone else, "you need to upgrade."  especially when 
they only sniff for Microsoft and Netscape leaving Opera and other recent 
browers out of the fun.

The other techniques you asked about:
1. Dancing or scrolling status lines
2. "rollover" scripts - providing a highlight for a mouse rollover.

 From what I remember, older screen readers used to have a problem with 
scrolling status lines.  Text in marquees, whether created with a MARQUEE 
element, a script or a Java applet, was read as text appeared on the screen 
whether in the status line or in the main window it was read.  We need to 
recreate these tests with today's browser and screen reader configurations.

For people who read slowly, if there is important information that scrolls 
they may not be able to read it in time.  Also, as I understand it, for 
some people with attention disorders they may be so drawn to the movement 
that the rest of the page almost becomes invisible.

Rollover scripts can be a problem if they pop up additional information.  I 
have not heard of problems if they just change the appearance of a link, 
unless new information is being provided that is not obvious.

I think the general statement of scripts is "use them with care."

Last year I worked on scripts and style sheets for a while and wrote up 
some thoughts which are available at: 
http://sun.trace.wisc.edu/~chisholm/dhtml/
This is not completely up to date with where i left off, nor is the work 
completed. I will be returning to this work in the near future.
