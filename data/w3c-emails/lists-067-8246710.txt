wow, i thought this would be more complicated. <grin>

Does this mean that someone would use the following markup to claim 
conformance to Level A (for example):

<rdf:RDF  xmlns:wcag="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/wai-conform-rdf#levelA">
</rdf:RDF>

or is there more to it?

I was expecting to make some sort of <wcag:property .... > statement, but 
maybe it's not needed?  version of wcag that we're claiming conformance to?
