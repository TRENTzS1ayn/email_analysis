rather than numbers OR make the headings more specific.

WL go through CSS note to determine what should be incorporated into theCSS 
module.

Resolution: in techniques document e.g., under checkpoint 1.1 where it 
says, "provide alt-text for image" (in HTML module) say "where can include 
multimedia, allow author to provide text equivalent" (in XML module).
