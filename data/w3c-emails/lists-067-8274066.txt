Marja is closer to it... (no, this isn't supposed to be a guessing game!)

you say something like

<rdf:Description rdf:resource="http://my.com/somepage">
  <waiConform:meets>
    <rdf:Bag>
      <li resource="some checkpoint URI"/>
      <li resource="some different checkpoint URI"/>
      <li resource="some other checkpoint URI"/>
    </rdf:Bag>
  </waiConform:meets>
</rdf:Description>

to describe the checkpoints that something meets. This allows you to make
some inferences, one of which can also be expressed using the scheme (if I
have the syntax correct, which is not a very high likelihood) as

<rdf:Description about="http://my.com/somepage">
  <waiConform:levelA
rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505"/>
</rdf:Description>

  So what does this actually say? How is <wcag:levelA> used? It needs to be
  attached to a URI of the conforming document somehow.
  
  I also wasn't sure how you use wcag:meets, wcag:fails etc.? Don't we at
  least need the checkpoints e.g. wcag:chp1.1="fails", or maybe they are
  defined specific to each guideline doc? Can you write some examples?
  
  In our schema for annotations we did define Classes and Properties as follows
  http://www.w3.org/2000/02/collaboration/annotation/annotationschema.htm.
