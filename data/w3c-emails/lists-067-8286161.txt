Actually I wouldn't use the rdf:Bag construct as it overcomplicates the
model for no immediate gain. It also makes querying / inference fiddlier.

I'd use the following (note that I'm web: instead of rdf: for the RDF
namespace; i reckon this reads better...)

 <web:Description web:about="http://my.com/somepage">
   <waiConform:meets web:resource="some checkpoint URI"/>
   <waiConform:meets web:resource="some different checkpoint URI"/>
   <waiConform:meets web:resource="some other checkpoint URI"/>
 </web:Description>

Not sure what this says, but looks plausible :-)
