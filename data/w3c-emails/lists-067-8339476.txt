I have a similar experience to Tim, except I am obviously not as
disciplined. When faced with 3 or 4 links to different places for the
information I am unsure which ones to follow, and I find it distracting to
have jumped back and forth so much.

The net result is that I actually have a very poor mental catalog of what is
in the techniques documents. If there were some information provided inline,
along with the links, it would be easier to get a feeling for what is in
there by reading it through. I realise there is a risk that then some people
won't follow the links at all, but I think it would be worth trying it.

 Having some summary information inine
would reduce the difficulty I have in understanding what material is in the
techniques document, although at the possible risk of people not following
the links.

  For me, the overal length of the document isn't a concern, nor is moving to
  different sections of the same document to get additional information. - for
  me, same page links don't cause me problems, but having to jump to lots of
  separate documents do have the potential to reduce my effective reading -
  unless I'm online.
  
  I realise this is somewhat ironic, considering the nature of the subject
  under discussion - name hypertext - but the guidelines and techniques need
  to be "out there" in the hands of developers and that may mean keeping some
  focus on relative self-containment.
