Hi,

As I've been looking at dynamically generated web pages and what would
be helpful for screen readers, I've been basically following these steps:

    1.  gather information by observing screen reader users work with web pages
and interviewing them

    2.  extract key aspects from the information gathered

    3.  develop a prototype

    4.  have people use the prototype and get feed back.

    5.  refine prototype and get more feedback.  repeat as needed.

    6.  demonstrate technical feasibility

Software / product development generally follow steps similar to this.
I'm wondering if there is something about these steps which are
not compatible with developing the guidelines?

Scott
