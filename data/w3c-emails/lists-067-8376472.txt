Deployment of Advanced Telecommunications Capability to All Americans.

A few sample paragraphs.



15. Persons with Disabilities. We seek comment on whether persons with
disabilities have the same access to advanced telecommunications capability
as other persons. Do the broadband technologies being deployed pose any
special access barriers to persons with disabilities? What needs to be done
to ensure that new broadband technologies have accessibility features built
into their initial designs in order for people with disabilities to have the
reasonable and timely access contemplated by section 706? We seek data on
this issue, and on the extent to which universal and inclusive design
practices are being incorporated into emerging broadband networks,
equipment, and services. What are trends in deployment of both built-in
accessibility and compatibility features affecting access by consumers with
visual, hearing, speech, mobility, cognitive, or other disabilities?


 16. We recently released rules implementing section 255 of the 1996 Act
that require manufacturers of customer premises equipment and
telecommunications equipment and providers of telecommunications services to
design, develop and fabricate products that are accessible to, and usable
by, persons with disabilities if readily achievable. How can we ensure that
broadband services and equipment are designed, developed and fabricated to
be accessible to and compatible with assistive technology? In particular,
what is needed to assure that video telephony standards will support
simultaneous video, text, and voice for applications such as video relay
interpreting with captions? What different or additional factors distinguish
delivery of such broadband applications by wireline and wireless
technologies?
