A regular meeting of the Web Content Guidelines working group is scheduled
for Thursday, 2100 UTC, 4 PM Boston, 10 PM France, 8 AM (Friday morning)
Australian summer time, on the W3C/MIT Longfellow bridge: +1-617-252-1038.

Agenda:

Members of the working group who accepted action items at the last meeting
are encouraged to bring relevant issues, questions and proposals to the
teleconference for further discussion. A list of actions follows
(extracted from the meeting minutes):

     * WC add "title" to checkpoints, use this in the "checkpoints in
       thissection" rather than numbers OR make the headings more
       specific.
     * WL go through CSS note to determine what should be incorporated
       into the CSS module.
     * CMN go through checkpoints to see where they apply to SVG.
     * WC go through SMIL note to see what we want to incorporate into
       the techniques document.
     * MM work on PDF issues and techniques.
     * WC follow-up on Flash techniques with Rob Neff.

If time permits, techniques relevant to the accessibility of
custom-designed XML document formats should also be discussed (see Daniel
Dardailler's note on the subject, as cited in Wendy's recent message to
the list).

Reminder:

Those participants who have not formalised their membership of the working
group under its new Charter, but who are nonetheless subscribed to the
mailing list, are encouraged to reveiw the material at
