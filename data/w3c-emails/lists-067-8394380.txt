Charles,

The way I understand it is somewhat analogous to d-tag/longdesc. The content
may, in fact, be elsewhere in the doc, but the only way to verify 1-to-1
correspondence is by having it an alt.

Subject: alt for applets

Reading through the current draft of the ERT (since that's all that is
available) iI noticed that it requires "alt" for applet even when there is
alternative content provided as content for the element. I'm not sure this
is
a good requirement.

What do people think?
