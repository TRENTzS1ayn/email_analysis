Yes, I am too...

As I remember the issue, there are two scenarios:

1. modern browsers who know the APPLET tag and therefore can render the ALT
appropriately
2. legacy browsers who do not recognize the APPLET tag at all

I don't think so. The situation I am thinking of is

<applet class="something" ...>
  Some useful text tht can be rendered when the applet doesn't appear
</applet>

not the situtation where the stuff is somewhere else (on that account I
agree
with you)

cheers

  Charles,

  The way I understand it is somewhat analogous to d-tag/longdesc. The
content
  may, in fact, be elsewhere in the doc, but the only way to verify 1-to-1
  correspondence is by having it an alt.

  Reading through the current draft of the ERT (since that's all that is
  available) iI noticed that it requires "alt" for applet even when there is
  alternative content provided as content for the element. I'm not sure this
  is
  a good requirement.

  What do people think?
