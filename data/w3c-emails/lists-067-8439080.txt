hello,

In the general techniques document in the section on audio and video it says:
<blockquote>
Equivalents for sounds can be provided in the form of a text phrase on the 
page that links to a text transcript or description of the sound file. The 
link to the transcript should appear in a highly visible location such as 
at the top of the page. However, if a script is automatically loading a 
sound, it should also be able to automatically load a visual indication 
that the sound is currently being played and provide a description or 
transcript of the sound.
</blockquote>

This implies that the text equivalent of a multimedia clip can *only* 
appear on a separate page.  What if someone provides in on the same 
page?  This question has come up in ER as we are trying to determine what 
to ask the author if we find multimedia on a page.

I thought we had discussed this already on this list, but I did not see any 
mention of it in the archives nor in minutes.  Either I missed it or I'm 
thinking of an ER thread.
