Why not give an actual example:

<object data="some_film" type="video/x-my-private-format">
<h2><a href="some_film" title="link to download the example movie">Example
2.7 is a movie:</a></h2>
<p>In scene one, Charles and John are talking on the balcony.</p>
<object data="scene_one_pic" type="image/x-my-other-forat">
</object>
<p>John says <q>well chuckles, how goes it?</q></p>
<p>Charles shakes his head slowly.</p>
</object>

Which makes it clear that the transcript can be included directly, if
desired.

(Please edit the example to taste. It would be nice to give an XHTML example
which used namespaces to add a bit of SMIL in places, but I guess that's
jumping the gun for the moment)

  hello,
  
  In the general techniques document in the section on audio and video it says:
  <blockquote>
  Equivalents for sounds can be provided in the form of a text phrase on the 
  page that links to a text transcript or description of the sound file. The 
  link to the transcript should appear in a highly visible location such as 
  at the top of the page. However, if a script is automatically loading a 
  sound, it should also be able to automatically load a visual indication 
  that the sound is currently being played and provide a description or 
  transcript of the sound.
  </blockquote>
  
  This implies that the text equivalent of a multimedia clip can *only* 
  appear on a separate page.  What if someone provides in on the same 
  page?  This question has come up in ER as we are trying to determine what 
  to ask the author if we find multimedia on a page.
  
  I thought we had discussed this already on this list, but I did not see any 
  mention of it in the archives nor in minutes.  Either I missed it or I'm 
  thinking of an ER thread.
