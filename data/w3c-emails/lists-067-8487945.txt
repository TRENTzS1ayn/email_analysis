Geoff,

If people agree that this is an o.k. thing to do, then we would include it 
in the techniques document.  The current phrase that I pointed out would 
probably be reworded to something like:
<blockquote>
Equivalents for sounds can be provided on the same page as the sound or in 
a separate file.  If in a separate file, provide a short text equivalent 
(like an "alt-text") in the text of the link to the text transcript or 
description of the sound file. The link to the transcript should appear in 
a highly visible location such as at the top of the page. However, if a 
script is automatically loading a sound, it should also be able to 
automatically load a visual indication that the sound is currently being 
played and provide a description or transcript of the sound.
  </blockquote>

thoughts?
