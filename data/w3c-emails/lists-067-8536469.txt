The focus on only testing with screenreaders leads to a potential for
following a dead-end path too easily, since the guidelines are required to
provide solutions tht work for people with all disabilities. The prototype
development should take account of other accessibility requirements.

Otherwise, this is indeed a sensible approach.

  Hi,
  
  As I've been looking at dynamically generated web pages and what would
  be helpful for screen readers, I've been basically following these steps:
  
      1.  gather information by observing screen reader users work with web pages
  and interviewing them
  
      2.  extract key aspects from the information gathered
  
      3.  develop a prototype
  
      4.  have people use the prototype and get feed back.
  
      5.  refine prototype and get more feedback.  repeat as needed.
  
      6.  demonstrate technical feasibility
  
  Software / product development generally follow steps similar to this.
  I'm wondering if there is something about these steps which are
  not compatible with developing the guidelines?
