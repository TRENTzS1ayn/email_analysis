ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE

I understand the value of that statemant, but how far does a site have to go
to accomodate such a small percentage of the population.  I support disabled
rights, that is why I am on this list.  But some developers are worried
about the limiting of their site look/feel/usability if they are confined to
rules that it must be placed in a certain format.  Upgrading text and sites
is a time consuming process.  How can we asure their right to publish what
they want, and keep our promise to help diabled people surf around the web?
