JH:: "But some developers are worried about the limiting of their site
look/feel/usability if they are confined to rules that it must be placed
in a certain format."

WL: I'm organizing/moderating a panel at WWW9 in Amsterdam entitled "Can
'Cool' Be Accessible?" which addresses this particular worry. The fact
that I think this is a misguided fear doesn't mean it shouldn't be
addressed. The guidelines aren't actually "confining". Incidentally that
word is a thorn to people who are sometimes in the media referred to as
"confined to a wheelchair" when they can easily outrun people who are on
foot! 

JH:: "Upgrading text and sites is a time consuming process."

WL: I'm not sure how the guidelines call for upgrading text. The main
point is that retrofitting is a bitch but designing with accessibility
in mind in the first place isn't that big a burden - it MIGHT even make
a site more usable ($$$).
