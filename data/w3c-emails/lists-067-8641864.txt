Hi,

A blind person is having problems using the voting form on my demo page
with JFW 3.5 and Explorer 5.  It seems that the tab key is only jumping
to the first radio button in a group of radio buttons.  I tried using
tabindex, but it was ignored for radio buttons other than the first in a
group of radio buttons.  Any suggestions about what I should tell this person
or any changes I need to make to the form?

Thanks,
Scott
