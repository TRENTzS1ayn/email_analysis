Jonathan,

most of the mencap site is under construction. I could not find any 
information about their user group.  if there is something on their site 
that I have missed, please let me know.

also, could you provide the URL in the WAI list archives of the e-mail from 
1998 that you were reading?

thanks,
--wendy
