Hello,

The chairs and I have been discussing a "Reviewer" role for the working 
group.  I thought that this had been discussed at one of the telecons, but 
I don't see it represented in any of the minutes since January.

I have drafted a new "how to join" that includes information about the 
reviewer role.  it is available at 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/howto-join-wg-reviewer.html

here is an excerpt:
<blockquote>
How to become a WCAG WG Reviewer

We realize that many people are unable to commit 4 hours per week to a 
voluntary project. To encourage participation by a wide variety of people, 
we have created a "Reviewer" role for this working group.

Reviewers will be sent materials for review based on their particular 
interests and expertise.  These materials will have specific questions for 
the reviewer to consider. We anticipate that a reviewer could go for a 
couple of months without hearing from us or hear from us a couple times in 
one month depending on which issues are under discussion.

Please fill out a request to join as suggested above along with the 
following information:
[ ] I would like to join the working group as a Reviewer.

My specific areas of interest are:
[ ] Issues for people with visual disabilities
[ ] Issues for people with cognitive, learning, and intellectual disabilities
[ ] Issues for people with hearing disabilities
[ ] Issues for people with physical disabilities
[ ] Assistive technology
[ ] Authoring Tools
[ ] User Agents
[ ] Graphic Design
[ ] Non-W3C technologies (Flash, PDF, ECMA/JavaScript, Java, etc.)
[ ] Usability testing
[ ] Other.  Please explain.
</blockquote>

are there other specific areas of interest we ought to include in the list?
do people agree that a reviewer role would be beneficial?
should we more clearly define the commitment or expectations?

other thoughts? questions? comments?

thanks,
--wendy
