One way to do this might be to divide along members vs. subscribers:

- working group members: commit, complete assigned action items, vote

- subscribers to the group list: read, comment

This is almost like the WG/IG roles in e.g. DOM.

People who don't want the list mail but are willing to be resources and be
asked occasional questions might be able to so indicate, but this doesn't
sound all that realistic to me.  Ususally these people you have to chase;
they don't step forward voluntarily.
