Hi,

So far, about 24 screen reader users have sent in votes.  One person
didn't like the screen reader version because of the long links.
What he didn't realize was that the links were the same for both versions.
He just hadn't run into them in the standard version before trying the
version for screen reader users.  Two other users forgot to make a choice.
The remaining 21 users preferred the version formatted for screen readers
over the standard version.  A couple of people commented that they would want
some more text on the screen reader version.

Scott
