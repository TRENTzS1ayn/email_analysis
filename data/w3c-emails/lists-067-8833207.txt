Hi. I found the link that was a question mark confusing - I expected it to
provide some kind of help but it just sent me to the top of the page. Since I
suffer from an over-use injury I would prefer not to have so many links
included that do not do anything obviously useful. I could not submit the
form so don't know what happens if you do. This is a case where dynamically
generating a response (and having a client side script perform the
validation where they are supported) could be a good answer.

As a separate comment, the table of availability was quite difficult to use.

Cheers

  Hi,
  
  I can't remember if I ever sent this out.  It's an example of a form
  with error messages.  The trick is that there are links between the
  errors.  It actually is an example of an "electronic curb cut"
  where the design was originally to help blind users to more
  quickly correct errors on a form, but sighted users have also found
  it helpful too.  The URL is:
