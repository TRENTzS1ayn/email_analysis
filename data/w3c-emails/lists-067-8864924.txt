Scott,

I would think that the problem with your solution is that a single
prototype isn't going to include ALL members of the addressed group. When
developing a product, somewhere along the line, a decision is made as to
the people who will and will not be served by the product, and the
prototype follows this mission. Guidelines cannot be restricted to a small
definition of the prototype of a disabled person, no matter which, or how
many disabilities they are affected by. "Common wisdom" of what the
visually impaired folks, those with limited vision "need", yet I know some
online "visually impaired" folks who would be bored if the web were limited
to their presumed "needs". Another presumption is that "learning disabled"
folks are accommodated by including more white space and omitting
animations, yet despite the fact that I've a career full and family full of
LD folks, not a one of them is drawn to web pages with "more white
space"... yuck!.. and several seek out the animations as the reason the web
is worth $20 a month! If a prototype is clearly impossible for the learning
disabled and the visually impaired, is there a group of disabled persons
for which is IS possible?

Even tho there are many blind folks who use screen readers with
synthesized speech, how many more blind folks would come online if they
could access natural human speech instead of synthesized???
