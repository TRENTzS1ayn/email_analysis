I really think after two years WAI and EO could be more proactive.
Web accessibility for cognitive disabilities has a way to go.

Providing a service for industry is great, but if we wish people to believe
our good intentions are more than just that, we need to publish some
evidence.

Anne's project is one of many that needs supporting.
I have been wanting to publish a weekly newsletter for about 18 months.
It is dauntingly difficult, if the clients are to create the product.

I responded to a recent research request via the WAI lists, this was their
response:

The next generation of **** ****  Reader will address the requirements of
blind and visually impaired users.  At this time it will not address the
needs of cognitive impaired users.  You may wish to contact Judy Brewer of
the W3C to start a
discussion on web requirements for your audience.
