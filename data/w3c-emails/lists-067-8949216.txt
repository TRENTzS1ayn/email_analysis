Gee it's nice to give good news ;-)

SMIL works with streaming AND non-streaming formats. SMIL will allow you to
put together images, short sound files, pretty much anything your SMIL player
can handle. For mor information on what players are out there (there are a
number) and what they can handle, try http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo - the SMIL
working Group's home page. (Perhaps the best known example of SMIL promoting
accessibility is the WGBH/NCAM car movie - a short presentation designed for
the G2 player that uses movies, audio and text captions, but there are plenty
of other possiblities.

There are also several SMIL authoring tools available, for different prices
(including free) and different platforms. Again details are avaiable from the
SMIL page given above.

Given that she is in any case downloading the sound files, creating a SMIL
presentation that adds captions will not significantly increase the bandwidth
requirements. (It is possible to have the sound come from somewhere else and
keep the captions locally).
