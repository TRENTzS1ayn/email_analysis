Hi, Ann

I didn't mean to convey the idea that a single prototype will include
all members of an addressed group.  The strategies can vary and depend on
the purpose of protyping.  Prototyping can be helpful to point out holes
in guidelines.

I believe that you are jumping to conclusions.  There is a difference
between "Common wisdom" and asking blind users what they need.
