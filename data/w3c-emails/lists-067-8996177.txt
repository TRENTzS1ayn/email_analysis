Charles, Thanks.

Now, next question is where does one goe to learn to use SMIL, and can the
code be developed by either Word or Front Page. I, personally, have no
knowledge of SMIL other than to know it describes coding that works similar
to HTML. 

I will need to be able to tell other teachers, some people who haven't a
clue about HTML let alone any other coding languges, on how to do pages
that are primarily there to display what children have accomplished and to
communicate these accomplishments to parents, community members, other
schools, and any one else interested. 

Can this be accomplished? 

Anne
