Anne,

if you are going to go the full SMIL solution, the place to start is
http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo - the Home page for the SMIL working group. It
includes links to tutorials, authoring tools (You can use Word as a text
editor to make SMIL code, but as far as I know FrontPage does not support
it) and players.

There is also a note by Marja-Riitta Koivunen and Ian Jacobs specifically
covering the accessibility features of SMIL - at
http://www.w3.org/TR/SMIL-access

The Magpie tool being developed by WGBH National Center for Accessible
Multimedia (NCAM) is specifically designed to allow you to add captions. I
know that it is being beta tested, but I am not sure if it is more generally
available yet.

One problem with SMIL (like multimedia in general on the web) is that
different formats are supported by different players. For example writing a
Java players that supports GIF images, and .AU format sound files, and plain
text, is very simple. The most widespread player is probably the RealPlayer
series, although they are only available for a few platforms. I believe that
it also handles the widest range of formats - the Quicktime player may also
handle a wide range of formats.

What you want can be accomplished, but it is currently at the bleeding edge
of technology. This only changes when people take the plunge - good luck, and
if I can help I will.

Cheers

Charles McCN

  Charles, Thanks.
  
  Now, next question is where does one goe to learn to use SMIL, and can the
  code be developed by either Word or Front Page. I, personally, have no
  knowledge of SMIL other than to know it describes coding that works similar
  to HTML. 
  
  I will need to be able to tell other teachers, some people who haven't a
  clue about HTML let alone any other coding languges, on how to do pages
  that are primarily there to display what children have accomplished and to
  communicate these accomplishments to parents, community members, other
  schools, and any one else interested. 
  
  Can this be accomplished? 
  
  Anne
