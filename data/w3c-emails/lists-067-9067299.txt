Re MAGPie:  NCAM is planning a release of the final version prior to CSUN.  It will be available for free from the NCAM and Trace Web sites.  Watch the list for an announcement.  MAGPie allows you to write captions once and output them in SMIL/RealPlayer, SAMI and QuickTime formats.

By the way, QuickTime 4.1, released a few weeks ago, supports SMIL 1.0.  The caption text file must be written in QText, which is not compatible with RealPlayer's implementation of SMIL (you must use a RealText file for captions w/RealPlayer).
