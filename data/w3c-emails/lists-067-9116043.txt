The main purpose of our working group meeting on Thursday, 2100 UTC, on
the W3C/MIT Longfellow bridge (+1-617-252-1038), will be to collect and
discuss agenda items for our upcoming face to face meeting (March 20, held
in cooperation with the CSUN Conference: see the working group home page
for registration details).

Also, there may be a revised draft of the techniques document ready to
be reviewed prior to the meeting.
