Hello,

I have published a new draft of the techniques document 
[http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WCAG10-TECHS-20000309/].  The revisions are 
minor.  I realized that I didn't have enough information from the group to 
move forwards with restructuring it in a way that would satisfy everyone's 
needs.  Therefore, I hope we will talk about this more at today's 
call.  Particularly, Tim's comments from 21 February 
[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2000JanMar/0263.html]

The revisions I did make:
1. I updated the "status of this document"
2. added links to the HTML and CSS modules at the top of the main 
techniques document. (there are now 3 links one to the contents of the main 
techniques doc, one to the HTML doc, and one to the CSS doc).
3.  included checkpoint text in the HTML module where it says, "Checkpoints 
in this section."  previously it was only the checkpoint number.  the 
checkpoint number is the link and the entire text of the checkpoint is 
included after it.  i only did this in HTML techniques because I wanted to 
see if i was on the right track.

I still have the rest of charles' comments from 15 february to finish 
[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2000JanMar/0244.html]. 
These are mostly editorial, but there are a few that warrant further 
discussion.
