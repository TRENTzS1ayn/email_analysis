hello,

i drafted an initial "non-w3c technologies techniques" module at [1].

Not much info there yet, but thanks to Robert for some interesting info for 
Flash. [2]  I have not tested these techniques yet, but assume Rob has.  I 
figure we could include screen shots from the Flash Generator tool.

There is more info to include from Robert and the PDF Info from Tim and 
Marti (once it's ready).

It is definitely rough and needs to be cleaned up, but i wanted to take an 
initial pass.

thoughts?
