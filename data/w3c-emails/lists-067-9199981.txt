There are a number of guidelines such as "mark up headers as headers",
"mark up lists as lists", etc. My initial response to trying to use
these in several contexts was that they all meant "mark up semantics
and structure of content according to specification", and that would
provide for various situations not adequately covered in the current
guidelines like well-structured graphics.

Just some first thoughts.
