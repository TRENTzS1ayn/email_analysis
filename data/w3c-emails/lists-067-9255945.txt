Hi,

I'd like to propose that guidelines be modified to allow web page
developers who are using technology to create web pages dynamically to
take better advantage of the opportunities offered by this technology.

I'm not quite sure what the best structure would be, but the general
direction would be something along the lines of creating two main groupings
of guidelines.  If a user cannot choose the format of the page being
presented, there would be one grouping of guidelines for that page.  If
a user can choose in what format a web page would be presented and have
the information be the same in each format, there would be a different
grouping of guidelines for that page.

The "single page format" grouping of guidelines would be pretty much the
same as the current guidelines.  (In this case, the universal design is
being provided by a single web page format which is appropriately
designed.)

The "multiple page format" grouping of guidelines would have some of the
same guidelines as are in the "single page format" but would provide
more flexibility in addressing accessibility.  (In this case, the
uiversal design is being provided by the collection of formats for a web
page instead of a single format.)

A reason I'm thinking of two different groupings is that I think it will
be easier for developers to follow rather than trying to identify for
each guideline whether it applies to the single format pages,
the multiple format pages or to both types of pages.

Scott
