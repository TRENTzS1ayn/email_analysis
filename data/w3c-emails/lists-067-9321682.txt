as usual, my wish list is to see examples and glossary and instant
satisfaction - everywhere.  make it easy to use and back up the text with
examples.  you can possibly link examples to test files.

as a process oriented type personality, i like to see the flow.  this can be
done either in one document or two, i prefer one with links or bookmarks.
