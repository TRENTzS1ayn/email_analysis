Gregg,

Speaking for those who would prefer the pages with heavy graphics, perhaps
even heavier than most pages are now (or at least more meat in the
graphics!), I agree with your concerns. The graphics form must convey the
fullness of the information, even tho it is sometimes difficult to assemble
sufficient graphics to convey the whole story. The goal of dynamically
created pages should be to make the whole presentation: graphics, sound,
multi-media, text, and mixes tailored to the user, all convey the same
story. I suspect that before this can become realistic, authoriting tools
will have to be able to generate the parts from the whole, and flag the
author when a page has insuffucient graphics and/or text. Is this possible?

Anne
