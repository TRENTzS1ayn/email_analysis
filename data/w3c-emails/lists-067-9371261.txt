Dear Mr. Thomas -

Optavia Corporation (information below) does some pro-bono web design work
(and all of our work is as accessible as possible!); however, I believe our
pro-bono docket is full at least through the middle of 2000.

I will call you soon to discuss this further.

- Shawn

Dear W3C:  I have a question and was hoping that you all may be able to
help.

I'm developing a disabilities advocacy organization in Washington, DC
and am looking for good web-tech support for designing, building, and
operating an accessible web-site.  Do you all know of any particularly
good companies or individuals who do such work?  And are there any that
you know of who would be interested in doing pro-bono work along these
lines?

Thank you for any assistance you can provide.
