while i agree with scott, we cannot dictate the technical approach as long
as the user is covered.  with personalization and content management, you
could visit a site and select all content be delivered to you in a
particular format.  Universal Design is a good concept, but hi-end marketing
requires personalization and your ad revenue and catalog sales are what keep
you a float.  Therefore, I can use a database to push the content that you
desire.  Many sights already do this and you may or may not be aware.  A
most excellent tool is Vignette Story server.  The objective is to turn hits
into revenue and database driven web sites support this.  they also support
ease of use with content maangement tools.  Remember, the commercial market
and print newspapers and magazines are going to be the toughest to convince.

i also must caution the use of database driven web sites if they are going
to see a lot of useage.  this is an operations issue and would hope that the
operation folks are up to speed on caching and scalability and running a
hi-end site.  Depending on the operating system, middleware and dataabse, a
methodology could be used to generate the page and cache it so it does not
get hit.

One thing that bothers me with validators, bobby and other tools is they
always tell you when you need <noScript>, but they do not take into account
if the user has turned javascript off on the client side then the server
side validation kicks in and the information is processed.

there is so much testing to be done to rally quantufy how each tool and
browser work with agents.  all this in the time to market that uses internet
time.

i do not think the WCAG guidelines have deifned their target audience.  Is
it PWD or developers - it should be both!  They have a simbiotic
relationship, yet each have different subgroups.  Hence different
requriements and needs.  Universal Design is supposed to be a cure all, but
when?  three years?  thisnk we need to putn the marketing caps on and use
the soft sale appraoch...hook the developers with a nibbel and then when
authpring tools are on board, then use the net!

see y'all next monday in los angelos.
