until the user agents and authoring tools are up to speed for a rapid
application environment, i think database driven sites are the answer to
push information.  this would use personalization and content management.
If you want a CSS e-comemrce web site, you get it.  most of your high-end
web sites use these tools.  its the mid-level and mom and pop shops that
cannot not afford these tools.  we are going to need to look at audience
segmentation.
