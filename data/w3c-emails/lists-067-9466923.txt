aloha, scott!

in a reply to charles, you wrote, quote:
Your statement about a "user impact matrix" is kind of interesting.Your 
argument can also be applied to the guidelines.  Don't the guidelines 
themselves make certain generalizations about particular groups.  For 
example, I can point out a number of areas of access problems that the 
guidelines don't address that cause trouble for users. These areas are not 
generally known because there has been very little research based on 
observation on what kinds of problems blind users can run into.  By 
ignoring the problems, the guidelines are assuming they are not issues that 
affect users very much.

if you are aware of any issues which WCAG does not address, you should post 
them to this list, so that they can be officially added to the issues list...

accessibility is in the eye, ear, and/or fingertip (to name but a few 
facilities) of the beholder -- and if the guidelines working group isn't 
aware of entire classes of access problems, we need to be alerted, and the 
best way to do so would be to post a problem statement and proposed 
checkpoint (and techniques) to cover each issue that we've missed...

that, to a great extent, is how the WAI guidelines are created...  they're 
not created in ivory tower isolation, but have consistently, and 
persistently, sought the input of the widest possible audience, but there 
are, inevitably, many from whom we were unable to hear, because they, by 
virtue of being offline, are unable to hear us...

so, if you can provide us with specific cases, scenarios, and solutions, 
please do so, and we will fill as many holes as possible,
         gregory.
