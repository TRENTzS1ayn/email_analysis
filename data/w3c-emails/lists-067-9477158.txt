Charles,
I noticed the template
(http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WAI-AUTOOLS-TECHS/templates/cmnMain.html) does
not use the MAP element to indicate the navigation bar, but instead it uses
a DIV with a CLASS="navbar".  In the past you have argued that this was the
wrong technique, that MAP was the most appropriate markup, even though MAP
did not render ALT text in main stream browsers like Explorer and Navigator
when images were turned off.  

Are you now advocating for using CLASS="navbar" or do you think MAP is
still the right technique?

Jon
