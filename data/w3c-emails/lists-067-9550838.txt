I think that we should work hard to get exposure of the guidelines in other
languages, and to get feedback on their usability in other countries. Are
there unmet requirements in French, or Danish, or Chinese, or Vietnamese? In
particular for small languages, what is the relationship between what is
implemented and available and what is accessible (more a philosophical
question perhaps, but important if you happen to only speak Arabic, or
Russian, or whatever).

I realise this is not a very concrete suggestion, but I think it may be an
important issue. And given the difficulties faced by anyone who is not a
fluent english speaker in participating I think it is one that takes some
careful thought.

  We are beginning to just run in circles with opinions and general concepts.
  I think that this stage is essential, but we also need to move on to the
  next one as well.  At least we need to see what the options might look like
  if they were implemented.      There are always problems with any approach.
  The question is, would an alternate approach be a better than what we have.
  To determine that we need to start looking at specifics as well as the
  general concepts.
  
  
  Specific ideas or suggestions for the guidelines or techniques doc anyone?
