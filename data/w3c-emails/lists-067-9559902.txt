I think one issue that is critical for the web content group to address in
the next version and has dependencies with other WAI working groups is
developing standard markup techniques that can be used to generate
navigational cues to the content of  a web page.  There are alot of
internal links in the current web content techniques document to the
navigation section of the document[1], but there are no concrete examples
(at least that I saw in that section) of how to include navigation
information in an HTML document.  I think there needs to be some consensus
of the technique (or techniques) to mark navigation bars and other logical
units commonly found on www pages.  I think some of the templates published
by charles [2] for the authoring tools working group is attempting to do
this, but I there needs to be guidiance in the web content documents so
that authors are all using the same markup techniques.
