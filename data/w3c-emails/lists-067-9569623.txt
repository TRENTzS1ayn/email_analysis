The templates are intended to follow WCAG rather than lead it. (Which is why
we would like review from this group as to whether we are following WCAG and
whether the templates are accessible).

  I think one issue that is critical for the web content group to address in
  the next version and has dependencies with other WAI working groups is
  developing standard markup techniques that can be used to generate
  navigational cues to the content of  a web page.  There are alot of
  internal links in the current web content techniques document to the
  navigation section of the document[1], but there are no concrete examples
  (at least that I saw in that section) of how to include navigation
  information in an HTML document.  I think there needs to be some consensus
  of the technique (or techniques) to mark navigation bars and other logical
  units commonly found on www pages.  I think some of the templates published
  by charles [2] for the authoring tools working group is attempting to do
  this, but I there needs to be guidiance in the web content documents so
  that authors are all using the same markup techniques.
