Hi Len, I don't necessarily disagree that it should be priority 1 to make
tables understandable when linearized, but I don't like the example: "a form
laid out in a table with field labels on the top row and corresponding
fields on the bottom row."

I believe that complies with the guideline that requires the table to make
sense when linearized. It is normal table behavior for the first row to
label the entire columns, so from the standpoint of the guideline regarding
linearization it should be OK to create a table whose first row contained
labels for the form controls in lower rows. The responsibility then is on
the agent doing the linearization to clearly express the labeling
relationship between the column header and the cell contents. That's equally
true whether the cell contains a control or any other content. Therefore I
don't see the example as violating this guideline.

However, the example would violate a second guideline, which is to ensure
that implicitly-associated labels are properly positioned. That is Pri 2
because it's assumed that the author will comply with the third guideline,
that of providing explicitly-associated labels. 

Greg
