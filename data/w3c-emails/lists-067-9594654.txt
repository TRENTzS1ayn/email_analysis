Has the WAI PF done a review of XLink and the possibilities it
offers for identifying navigation mechanisms? The 21 Feb draft [1]
is in last call until 20 March 2000. In particular, section 3.5 on 
semantic attributes [2]. I am woefully uninformed on what features
of XLink might help UAs identify navigation bars, etc.
