WAI PF has looked at Xlink.

extended XLinks will (at some point in the not-too-distant unless you are
waiting for it future) provide a very good mechanism. Also a good way of
including multimedia along with various types of alternatives.

  Has the WAI PF done a review of XLink and the possibilities it
  offers for identifying navigation mechanisms? The 21 Feb draft [1]
  is in last call until 20 March 2000. In particular, section 3.5 on 
  semantic attributes [2]. I am woefully uninformed on what features
  of XLink might help UAs identify navigation bars, etc.
