Hi, Charles

I'm really sorry, but you are missing the benefit of dynamically generated
web pages which is to allow tailoring to the user.

What is your definition of "generally accessible"?  For example,
in my demo the page formatted for screen readers is easier to use
for many of the blind people who tested it out.  The guidelines do not
cause the web pages to have similar formats.  Therefore the preferences
of blind users could be seen as being ignored in order to have the
illusion of a "universally designed" web page.

Also, I've been told that the concept of universally designed could
easily incorporate multiple formats.  The more relevant issue is whether
everyone's needs are being address, if possible.

Scott

PS  Look at the examples to see what areas aren't being addressed in the
guidelines.
