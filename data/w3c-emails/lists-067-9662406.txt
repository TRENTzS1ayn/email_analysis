Scott,

There is nothing you can do in dynamically generated pages that cannot be
done by hand coding (although one may be easier than the other) just as there
is nothing that can be done with a WYSIWYG tool that cannot be done by hand
coding.

In the case of tailored content, what is important is to ensure that a user
is not served an inappropriate version, and even more important is to ensure
that there is an appropriate version available. In your specific example, as
a sighted user, I found the "screen reader" version much better than the
other version.

I have argued several times that there is benefit in being able to tailor
content, but there is a risk of missing out on some groups by making too few
versions available, and to a lesser extent by poorly describing the benefits
of tailored versions that are available so that people do not use them.

  Hi, Charles
  
  I'm really sorry, but you are missing the benefit of dynamically generated
  web pages which is to allow tailoring to the user.
  
  What is your definition of "generally accessible"?  For example,
  in my demo the page formatted for screen readers is easier to use
  for many of the blind people who tested it out.  The guidelines do not
  cause the web pages to have similar formats.  Therefore the preferences
  of blind users could be seen as being ignored in order to have the
  illusion of a "universally designed" web page.
  
  Also, I've been told that the concept of universally designed could
  easily incorporate multiple formats.  The more relevant issue is whether
  everyone's needs are being address, if possible.

  PS  Look at the examples to see what areas aren't being addressed in the
  guidelines.
