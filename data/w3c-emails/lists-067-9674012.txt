Hi, Rob

I may not have been clear in what I was proposing.  Basically,
if a web site is interested in supporting multiple formats,
I think the guidelines need to be structured to take advantage
of that choice in order to improve the usability and accessibility
of the web pages.  If the site is not going to support multiple
formats, I don't think the guidelines should force them into that.

I very much agree that the guidelines should be written with both
the disabled person and the developer in mind.  Both groups have to
live with the guidelines.

I believe that while many disabled people have climbed on the Universal
Design bandwagon, there needs to be more research about the limits
of Universal Design.  For example, does the concept of Universal Design
allow for multiple formats or not?  There seems to be different
opinions on this.  I think it is important to remember that the
end goal is not Universal Design but rather accessibility.  Universal
Design is only a means to an end, but it is not necessarily the only
means.
