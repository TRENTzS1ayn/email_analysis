Hello,

A recent email [1] included some inflammatory language in response
to spam sent to the WCAG mailing list. To address this problem,
I propose the following actions.

1) We cease that thread immediately. Please do not continue discussions
   either about the original spam or the response to it. Continuing
   discussion will only cost us time and energy.

2) We change the list mechanics at W3C so that only people 
   subscribed to it can post to it. Subscription will be open to all.
   Mail sent by someone who is not subscribed is bounced to the list 
   maintainer(s) who can add the person or request that they   
   subscribe and resend their message.

If there are no objections before the next teleconference on 16
March, I suggest that the Chairs authorize the change in list policy.

Comments welcome,

 - Ian
