Hi Greg,

I think the problem is that most programs linearize by listing the items in
the order they are appear in the HTML.  So labels above items would not
linearize in any very usable fashion.

This is not a problem with tables that present tabular information.  In that
case - the column headers across the top (If appropriately marked) would be
the proper way to lay out a table.  (especially since there are usually
labels down the side too.)  Not that the linearization rule does not apply
to tables used for tabular information.

It WOULD be a good idea for programs that linearize tables to give the user
the option to flip it top-for-side to see if it were easier to understand or
use in that manner.  I don't know which ones do that though.   Anyone know
of table linearizers with a flip layout function?

Gregg

Subject:RE: linearized tables

Hi Len, I don't necessarily disagree that it should be priority 1 to make
tables understandable when linearized, but I don't like the example: "a form
laid out in a table with field labels on the top row and corresponding
fields on the bottom row."

I believe that complies with the guideline that requires the table to make
sense when linearized. It is normal table behavior for the first row to
label the entire columns, so from the standpoint of the guideline regarding
linearization it should be OK to create a table whose first row contained
labels for the form controls in lower rows. The responsibility then is on
the agent doing the linearization to clearly express the labeling
relationship between the column header and the cell contents. That's equally
true whether the cell contains a control or any other content. Therefore I
don't see the example as violating this guideline.

However, the example would violate a second guideline, which is to ensure
that implicitly-associated labels are properly positioned. That is Pri 2
because it's assumed that the author will comply with the third guideline,
that of providing explicitly-associated labels.

Greg
