if we throw out the reference to law and focus on what is implementable and
reachable.  Case in point the Software Engineering Institute's Capabilty
Maturity Model is a metric for how well your company meets their
requirements.  the rating level is zero (chaos) to 5.  Two means you have
some practices in place that can be measured and save rework.

Unfortunately, Level 5 is the Zenith and only a handful of companies after
ten-ish years has reached this.  As a person who has worked in level 2 and
has been instructed to level three, i ask, " Is this what I as a company
want to obtain?"  The cost and burden to reach this is very high and how
does it help my business?  What is the net? Most government contracts
require at least level three - if i participate in this market.  The
overhead to be a level 3 and 5 is very high as your people must be trained
to it and in our job market, workers hop jobs very fast.

There are those who beleive that the level five is an artificial standard
that is not needed to meet business objectives, therefore there is no value
added.

In universal design, there is some leverage with developers that are a part
of a government, but we must also be concerned about developers in
non-government markets.  So it seems there will be more buy-in from one
market segment versus another.  This is not the purpose of WCAG and
universla design but it may be the result.

I think this is the wrong approach.  We need a universal design standard
that is implementable across all developer segments and are supported by
tools.  Then as toolsets and agents meet the other guidelines, then they can
be tightened.

You must provide a guideline that supports rapid application development and
a very fast time to market or else you will not get buy-inform the single
most community you need - developers and managers.
