There are different standards of implementable in different cultures. For
example, in the US as I understand it (I could be wrong on all this) an
agency covered by the ADA is required to make accommodations unless it would
impose an undue burden. In Australia, a private agency can claim an exemption
from the requirement not to discriminate unless it would pose an undue
burden, but a public (government owned) agency cannot, unless it is actually
not possible to make an accommodation.

  Maturity Model is a metric for how well your company meets their
  requirements.  the rating level is zero (chaos) to 5.  Two means you have
  some practices in place that can be measured and save rework.
  
  Unfortunately, Level 5 is the Zenith and only a handful of companies after
  ten-ish years has reached this.  As a person who has worked in level 2 and
  has been instructed to level three, i ask, " Is this what I as a company
  want to obtain?"  The cost and burden to reach this is very high and how
  does it help my business?  What is the net? Most government contracts
  require at least level three - if i participate in this market.  The
  overhead to be a level 3 and 5 is very high as your people must be trained
  to it and in our job market, workers hop jobs very fast.
  
  There are those who beleive that the level five is an artificial standard
  that is not needed to meet business objectives, therefore there is no value
  added.
  
  In universal design, there is some leverage with developers that are a part
  of a government, but we must also be concerned about developers in
  non-government markets.  So it seems there will be more buy-in from one
  market segment versus another.  This is not the purpose of WCAG and
  universla design but it may be the result.
  
  I think this is the wrong approach.  We need a universal design standard
  that is implementable across all developer segments and are supported by
  tools.  Then as toolsets and agents meet the other guidelines, then they can
  be tightened.
  
  You must provide a guideline that supports rapid application development and
  a very fast time to market or else you will not get buy-inform the single
  most community you need - developers and managers.
