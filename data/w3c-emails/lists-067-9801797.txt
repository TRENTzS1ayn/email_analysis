AP:: "Is it too late to consider including *text* as a format on the web
that needs accommodation?"

WL: "Considering" it is of absolutely no use unless we know how to
accommodate this need. We discuss it a lot but there is no proposal ever
made as to *HOW* this might be done. It is frustrating that there seems
to be nothing we can do about it, but those of us who would love to do
something don't know of anything we can do. I don't know how to present
any alternative to text that is at all effective. I don't know of any.
So far I can't even imagine any. I want to do this because I feel many
are left out but I just have no clue on what to do. We may deplore and
possibly explore, but so far no joy.

If you have any ideas that might help, please let us know. The reason
for providing text alternatives for illustrations is that this is useful
for some people *AND WE KNOW HOW TO DO IT*. Of course we won't stop
calling for that in the guidelines. If we simply say "provide
alternatives to text" we are faced with the dilemma of trying to explain
how to do that and I have absolutely no idea where to begin.
