If tables used to represent tabular information use markup properly, table
linearization algorithms can use the header information in the document to
provide the appropriate header information for each cell.  I think
encouraging authors to use proper markup for tables is better than trying
to get them to use a certain format so that when a simple linearization
algorithm is applied proper header information is generated by default.
The only case I think simple linearization should be encouraged is when
tables are used for layout.  In this case when the table markup is removed
the document should still make sense.
