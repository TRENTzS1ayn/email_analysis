Jim,

There are three major categories of tables in my mind:

1. Tables that are used purely for layout and are indicated with no header
markup or caption information.  The summary attribute may read "layout".
Simple linearization of these tables results in a readable document.

2. Tables that are used for tabular information (like the TV guide) and use
proper heade markup and should have a defined caption element.

3. Tables that contain tabular information and do not use proper header
markup or header markup is incomplete.  There is not much UA or AT can do
for these tables for proper lineraization or translation to speech or
Braille.  Unfortunately this is the most common type of table in usage today.

Jon
