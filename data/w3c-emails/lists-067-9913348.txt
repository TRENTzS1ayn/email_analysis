Ian,
This is a response to Ian's posting related to navigation markup using XLINK.
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2000JanMar/0386.html

While there are probably techniques for XML for marking up logical units, I
am more concerned about techniques for HTML.  I know there have been
discussions in the WC group about markup to improve navigation in HTML, but
I do not see anything in the techniques document Navigation section.  
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WCAG10-TECHS-20000211/#navigation

1. Am I looking in the wrong place of the techniques document for markup
related to structural navigation information?

2.  Where there no techniques that the group could develop consensus for
marking up navigation bars and other common structural elements?
