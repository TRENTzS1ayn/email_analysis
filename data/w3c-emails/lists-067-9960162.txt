aloha, scott!

i've looked at your demos, and i've read your posts -- what i'm waiting to 
read are:

1) concrete problem statements
2) concrete checkpoint proposals
3) concrete techniques

in the absence of the above, this conversation will go nowhere, but around 
and around, as it has for the past few months...

please -- anyone who has suggested that there are topics that the GL 
working group has missed or who has a plan for a note addressing something 
they believe WCAG does not currently (or adequately) address, please post 
CONCRETE SUGGESTIONS to this list, so that they can be discussed on-list 
and at CSUN

there's been enough bickering and rhetoric posted to this list, and i admit 
my own past complicity in prolonging the cycle...  but enough is enough -- 
let's get back to our mission: improving the guidelines and techniques 
documents through the discussion of concrete and specific examples, 
checkpoints, and techniques,

         gregory.
