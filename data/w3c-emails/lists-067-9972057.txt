Introductions
Requirements document for next version.  What is required for the next 
version? There has been initial discussion about making the guidelines 
easier to read, easier to navigate, and ensuring that they are less 
HTML-specific.  What else is needed?

In what ways can we generalize the guidelines? Which checkpoints should be 
pushed to the technique modules because they are technology specific?  What 
about Web applications?
