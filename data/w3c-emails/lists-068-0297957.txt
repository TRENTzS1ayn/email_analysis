Yes, but that and a nickel will buy you a cup of coffee.

"DC"?  District of Columbia?  Direct Current?

And this would be a bad thing because...?

You still haven't answered that.

Why?

I don't accept your scriptures.  Quotes from various "web luminaries"
who have impressed you won't necessarily hold water with me.  I don't
accept dogmatic arguments.  So I'm glad you don't have time to look
those up.

I'm at a loss to see how existing user agents can be so callously
discarded -- or even why you'd want to do that.  I especially worry
about assistive technology, as it has long lagged far behind the
"current releases" and it's not reasonable to suggest that all web
users will be able to upgrade to this "web of tomorrow" model which
you propose.

Lack of backwards compatibility is a barrier to access by many people
with disabilities (as well as many people without disabilities).

That's beside the point.  You are belittling her contribution at this
point because of the way she referred to SGML.

Actually, it's also possible that she made a typo or a simple
mistake, and you took that and used that as "evidence" that she
doesn't know what she's talking about.  That kind of typo flame has
long been discredited (e.g. on Usenet since I first got on the net),
and pointing it out in two messages just makes you look bad.  So
she got the acronym wrong, so what?  Your tone of dismissal was
not appropriate.

Why not?  Can you answer this without referring to SGML principles?
