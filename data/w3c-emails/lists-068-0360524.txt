Hmmmm.....don't forget, I actually didn't intend to be insulting, but do
realize my "writing style" is a bit odd. Often I imply things that are
undetectable in plain text, but probably would be if I said them. You have
to read "between the lines" as it were.
I realise that we are all working towards a common goal:-
     "To promote usability & accessibility on the WWW".
And I suppose if the underlying tone of my messages was to use "competition"
rather than "cooperation" to achieve these goals, then that was incorrect.
However, I do believe in standing for what one believes in, and persuing
goals to the end (but I'm not going to do that if it menas annoying people
and losing friends for no reason whatsoever along the way).
We have *all* been sarcastic/annoting/insulting at some point or another:-

Sean:
"If you're not able to create styles independant of markup, I suggest that
is because you have spent too long following anachronous, limited, and
blatantly illegal Web programming habits" (unintentional sarcasm)
Anne:
"Nice to know I'm not quite so unknowledgable as Sean makes me out to be!"
(a direct parry to something I didn't intend and had already apologized for)
Kynn:
"Yes, but that and a nickel will buy you a cup of coffee. [...]" (probably
unintentional)
""DC"?  District of Columbia?  Direct Current? [...]" (see above)
"Yes, yes, the holy books.  I am glad you have found your religion. I'm
going to go back to working on making the web work, though; thanks for the
stimulating discussion! [...]" (purely patronizing and sarcastic: I could
demand an apology)
"You mean Saint Tim Berners-Lee." (see above)

And I suggest we forget this discussion (the bad parts of it) ever occurred,
and go back to discussing how we can change the world for the better using
cooperative methods.

Yes, I've seen that page before (you mailed the URI to me).

Don't forget "Tet" and "Ramadan"...
