Of course, this all presumes that the "summary" is written "simpler" than 
what it summarizes. I find this counter-intuitive. If one were able to 
simplify *and* summarize in a smaller space, why wouldn't the "summary" be 
the main thing and have pointers to the hard-to-comprehend main text 
instead of the other way 'round?

In the guidelines effort we are faced with the identical problem: expanding 
the terse/precise/technical stuff with elaborated 
descriptions/definitions/elucidations. If it worked to have a summary 
clarify things, we needn't have the expansion?

I am all in favor of summaries (where appropriate?) and in fact think they 
are an important part of the indexing (they are the "what" and "why") and 
will play a major part in making the Semantic Web usable. Such materials 
are what they mean by "Resource Description" the first two items in the RDF 
acronym!
