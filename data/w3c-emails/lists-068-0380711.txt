Hopefully it will be fossible to automatically generate site summaries in
the SW. You could do it now I suppose, by extracting all of the headings and
so forth, but really page semantics need to improve first. (task: develop an
XSLT script to extract useful page summaries). Actually, Dan Connolly has
already done this: for the W3C homepage. If you look at the source of
http://www.w3.org/ you'll note the profile attribute in the head element.
That points to Dan's hacking around in XSLT and RSS. (Er...try
http://www.w3.org/2000/07/hs78/ if I remember correctly). It's useful, but
it uses class attributes to do it, so it's not the best solution. If we
could embed Dublin Core descriptions into a page, it would make things a lot
easier.
On another similar note, he also created an XSLT for screen scraping RDF
data from HTML:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2000Mar/0103.html
Quoth DC:
Summary: "I believe that one of the best ways to transition into RDF, if not
a long-term deployment strategy for RDF, is to manage the information in
human-consumable form (XHTML) annotated with just enough info to extract the
RDF statements that the human info is intended to convey." - Dan Connolly,
ibid.
So it appears that annotation mechanisms (I favour Dublin Core, for now) are
the way to go.
