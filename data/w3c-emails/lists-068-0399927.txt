The official deadline for review of the User Agent Accessibility
Guidelines (http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10/) has expired. If there are urgent
issues regarding these guidelines that you would like to raise, please do
so as soon as possible.

If your comments are concerned with the relationship between the User
Agent Accessibility Guidelines and the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines, please direct them to both mailing lists (w3c-wai-ua@w3.org

The User Agent Accessibility Guidelines working group would be
especially appreciative of any comments regarding the handling of issues
raised in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0, particularly those
introduced by "until user agents" clauses.
