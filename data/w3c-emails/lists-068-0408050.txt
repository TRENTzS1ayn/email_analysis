I thinking about this again (Maybe I was a bit fed up with the current
threads? Did not dare get sucked into  it - anyway, someone should propose
something ;)

Anyway With the current wording, text that does not have a primarily
grafical function in a graphic is out.

What about a review of the term text and textual content, or adjustment to
the word to make it "relevant textual content" in other words, content that
is relevant to the aim or a goal of the site, should not be in the form of a
graphic, unless that text is of a has a primarily graphical function - I.E.
not banners and ads

OK the wording sucks.

Oh all right, I'll try again

3.1 When an appropriate markup language exists AND WILL WORK, use markup
rather than images to convey information TO ALLOW TEXT SCALABILITY.
[Priority 2]   For example, use SVG for line art, MathML to mark up
mathematical equations, and CSS for text-oriented special effects. You may
not present relevant textual content
as an image, unless the text has a primarily graphical function, and the
effect cannot be achieved with markup,
(as in the case of some for logos and limited accent elements) provided that
you provide a textual equivalent to the content contained in the image.


That, with a glossary definition, should take care of annoying banners that
no user wants to see.

Still could do with a rewrite

i am concerned that the words i see proposed are telling designer how to
design when thie tools and methodologies work.

it is my belief that this is being overthought.  banner ads and images that
have text are an essential part of the user interface.  if i am interpreting
the recommended words here correctly to limit text on an image then i think
this is not good.  then why do we have the ALT tag?

i do like the idea to create recommend usage of AD for Advertisement in the
ALT tag.  we could make this accepted practice.  can the desription be out
in the longdesc?

would be great to have an AD tag.
