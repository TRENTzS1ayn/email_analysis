Lisa,

Unless I am missing something, the first example given doesn't meet the
goal. You say line art should be SVG, but if the reason for this guideline
and this example is to separate all text from graphics, there is no reason
for this example. I've never seen text used in line art, so why is it
important for this element to be "scalable"? Using *any* graphic as line
art makes it possible to provide an alt tag, so what is the point of SVG? 

Otherwise, your wording is excellent and explains the "why" this guideline
should be followed. 

Anne

PS: Don't get too enthusiastic about banning banner ads. Those who use them
aren't standing in line waiting for word from WAI on how to do their job,
and it's at best uncertain if they will be willing to accommodate. Seems
there is a small group of businesses whose business it is to collect
(create?) and distribute banner ads to pages. A guideline that purports to
put people out of business won't fly.
