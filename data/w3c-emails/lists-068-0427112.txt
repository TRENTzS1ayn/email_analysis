Wordsmithing aside for the moment, I wonder if this doesn't capture the 
intent to our satisfaction?

We can argue/discuss/modify "relevant", "primarily graphical", "cannot". We 
can "fix" the "provided that you provide" and "content contained in" from a 
wordsmith point of view, but can we agree that the 
idea/intent/checkpointability is covered?
