Really, the arguement here shouldn't be about the principles of SGML (my
fault), it should be about accessibility.

One of the greatest tools for promoting accessibility is the User Stlye
Sheet. What this means is that on a suitably marked up site, one can apply a
style sheet that overrides every presentational aspect of a site.
Examples could be:
1. Colour blindness. A Red/Green colour blnd person does not want a page
with red text and a green background, no matter how pretty it looks.
2. People such as myself can't stare at a bright screen for too long,
therefore we need to have dark backgrounds.
Now, using CSS, one can override the authors style sheet with one of our
own; meaning we can actually use the sites. *However*, if that presentation
is inherent in the markup itself, it is vey hard to override. I'm not saying
it's impossible, but it is often close to impossible. By using semantic
markup, the USER can define what they want a particular meaning to be
displayed as.
Surely that's not too much to ask - looking at it from a disability and
accessibility viewpoint?
