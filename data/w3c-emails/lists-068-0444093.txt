What are background and font called in semantic markup?
How do they vary from the HTML commands in whatever HTML markup is called?
Is CSS the only way to achieve this? the best way? or one of several ways?
What happens for a user who never heard of or doesn't use a style sheet?
What if it's a user with an old browser? or using the web on a tv? 

Has anyone looked into the new features in Dreamweaver? Do they offer any
solution to this problem?
