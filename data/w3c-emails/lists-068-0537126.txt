We could explain as clearly as has ever been done in the history of 
communication and, by itself this would not have much effect. Only a 
miniscule percentage of people preparing Web sites even understand the 
notion of "structure" in the sense we use it. In many cases they don't even 
acknowledge its importance.

We must pay a lot of attention to how the guidelines/checkpoints impact 
authoring tools and how conformance can be objectively determined.
