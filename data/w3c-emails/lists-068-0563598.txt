Can you cite a reference for that fact (i.e. the definition)?

Well, <font size="+1"> implies an exact scale increase to the font, where as
<big> is a little more generic.

> So if <b> is to be avoided, so is <big>.

I agree. The problem is that there isn't really an equivalent...unless you
used:-

     <strong class="big"> and
     @media screen { strong.big { font-weight: normal; font-size: 1.2em; } }

but that's hardly an ideal solution. It's all about achieving the best
accessible balance operating within the constraints of the technology
(XHTML) we're using. Luckily we will soon have the opportunity to change
those constraints...
In the meantime, I feel that <big> is semantic enough to promote its use
over <font size="+1">, but not perfect.

It all depends how you contsrue the semantic meaning of the tags. Both <b>
and <big> have very limited semantics, but it's a sliding scale:
<em> is more semantic than <i>
<strong> is more semantic than <b>
[<strong class="big"> is more semantic than] <big> which is more semantic
than <font size="+1">
Where by semantic I mean more abstract and carries more "meaning".

I'm not dismissing the need, only stating that there are going to be cases
whereby people *require* to override the background provided by the author.
The best case scenario would be if the author him/herself were to provide
alternative styles and presentations to the page, but even then it is the
accessibility requirements of the page user that are most important.
One example is a Christmas theme: green writing on a red image background. A
lot of people will require a means of changing either the text or the
background, or both. In my own case, I require a dark background, so I
always need to change the background!

In some cases you might have to use lots of methods because there isn't one
clear advantageous one.

Degrading gracefully does not have to mean losing presentation entirely
(case in point: the CSS/Style homepage). But even if it did, the whole fact
that it can be got rid of it's it's primary accessibility point: you can
replace the styling with one of your own (one that you may *require* in
order to use the document).

That is a problem. But it's being gradually fixed, thankfully.

That's why you mustn't rely on CSS: a site should still work without it.
It's fairly easy to accomplish, but it is a tight-rope walk. I think that if
you look upon CSS as a tool to enhance what you have already defined in the
markup, rather than movng away the presentation you already had there, then
it will seem a much friendlier option.

Great. I saw your little reply about Edapta to WL and it looks like a very
neat system. In particular, I see it working very well sending over custom
CSS sheets: if a user requests for example a ceratain colo(u)r font, Edapta
could override the authors style sheet and send only a style sheet of that
colo(u)r. Am I correct in thinking that? If so, great application!
