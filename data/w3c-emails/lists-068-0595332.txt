Well,

it should be en-US actually. And I don't know, but since I know that there
are speech synthesisers out there that have english and american voices, I
would guess that the support is as for other language switching -
unfortunately very low. For those who don't think this is a problem, try
working with a french system that comes across some english content...

  How well is "US-en" vs "en" supported in the assistive technology?
  (Anyone?)

  I'm not convinced that this replacement is valid.  A better formulation
  would be to state:  "Use the H1 to H6 elements".
