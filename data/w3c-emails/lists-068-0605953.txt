CMN One possiblity would be to revisit our understanding of alternative
content. In a lot of cases this means text, but text isn't always
appropriate, there is no known way to write a number of signed languages in
text, and metadata can be used to provide information that can be presented
in different output modes the same way that text can (but with wider
possiblities).
