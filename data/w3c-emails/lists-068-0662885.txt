I'm not adding anything at all! It was/is already there in the guidelines
(2{2.3}). I'm saying that as the part about "distinguish structural and
semantic distinctions within the text" has been removed from the main {2}
and added to the foot of {3.2}, it needs adding into {2.3} where it links
back to.
On the wider scale, I'm saying that the explanation for {3.2} is an
excellent compromise between our two points of view, and needs reinforcing
to some degree, i.e. the casual user looks at it and asks themselves: "why
do we need to add in presentation for cognitively disabled users, and why do
we need to distinguish structural and smeantic distinctions?". We (the GL
WG)  need to explain, explain, and explain again, and then provide useful
examples. This is not a clash of ideas, or a contrast of opinions, but
rather two paths towards a common goal.
