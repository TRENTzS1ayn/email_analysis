Guideline 2 has yet to be re-written per Wendy's note, but 2.3 is
cross-referenced in the re-written 3.2. Why add the wording? Repeating it
here would just make the guidelines overly wordy. 

"why do we need to add in presentation for cognitively disabled users ..." 

Because they are disabled persons who need the content of the web presented
in their modality! Just as you do. (not you personally, Sean, but you, the
casual user of the guidelines.)
