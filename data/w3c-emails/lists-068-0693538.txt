Not sure. Having a list of links isn't really akin to a summary, but it's
not a bad alternative (Well, we'd need them both, so it might be a waste of
space anyway).

Oops, my mistake.

Does this mean the document shouldn't be referred to as en-US rather than
just en? There's no harm specifiying the exact language used, but I agree
that not much software takes note of it. i.e. may as well include it for
forwards compatability.

My idea was something a bit similar to what ERT is doing: metadata to
describe accessibility aspects of a document - but that doesn't stop us from
specifying many accessibiliy checkpoints for metadata (e.g. your suggestion
about alternative content).

Yes. Let me clarify that for people unsure of the particulars:-
"VAR: Indicates an instance of a variable or program argument." -
http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/text.html#edef-VAR
I would have hoped for a longer explaination, but there you go.
"CODE: Designates a fragment of computer code. " - c. ibid.

> I think something like "Use the HTML heading elements <code>h1</code>,

It was a bit picky of me to point it out in the first place, and it depends
on what level we need to go to. If we really went for it, you could put:-

"Use the XHTML heading elements <dfn><code title="XHTML Level 1 Heading
code">h1</code> to <code title="XHTML Level 6 Heading code">h6</code></dfn>,
..."

(Added titles and <dfn> because it is a definition of the XHTML heading
elements), but that would be going over the top!

Another point to raise in a similar vein is the correct useage of <acronym>
and <abbr>, c.f. discussions on WAI IG and www-html, but this is all just me
being pedantic ;-)
