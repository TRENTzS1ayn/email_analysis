This is from the definition of <font> in HTML 4.01:
size  = cdata [CN]
Deprecated. This attribute sets the size of the font. Possible values:
*An integer between 1 and 7. This sets the font to some fixed 
size, whose rendering depends on the user agent. Not all user agents 
may render all seven sizes.
*A relative increase in font size. The value "+1" means one 
size larger. The value "-3" means three sizes smaller. All sizes 
belong to the scale of 1 to 7.

So "+1" means "one size larger."

<big> means:
BIG: Renders text in a "large" font.

I'm confused, you said that <font> doesn't mean much, but now you claim
it means an exact scale increase? :)

That's a hack that abuses <strong>, CSS, and class, though. :)

Why do you think it's semantic?  There is nothing semantic about
<big>.  It's a purely presentational tag.

Yep, and it can also call in parallel edaptors to convert images (if
so desired) to alter them to specific color settings.  For example,
if someone's color blind, we can invoke a filter program to bring out
the color for that specific person's contrast needs.

Is it done yet?  No, not by far yet -- we're still a 5 person company
at present.  But things are coming up very soon that will allow us to
devote a lot of resources to these problems and to see them deployed
in Internet software as early as second quarter 2001.

But -- back to WCAG. :)
