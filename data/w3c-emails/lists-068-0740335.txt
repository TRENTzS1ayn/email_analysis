Sean, if Opera is an option for you, you will want to look into it.  It
has a nice feature which is easily accessed (a statusbar toggle
button) which allows you to change between "author's style settings"
and "user's style settings" painlessly.  You can set up your settings
however you like, including "ignore background", "ignore fonts",
"linearize tables" (!), and "use _this_ stylesheet", and then switch
back and forth whenever you find a page which doesn't work for you.

I do this myself quite often on a number of web pages which are just
very poorly designed.  It clears them up pretty instantly in cases
where you have, say, white text with cyan letters, or pages which
do not distinguish the followed links from the unfollowed.

Opera currently is only stable on Windows platforms (I think), but
there are Mac, Linux, and other versions in various stages of
development.
