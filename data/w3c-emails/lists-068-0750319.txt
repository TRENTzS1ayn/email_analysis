If it's deprecated then there isn't much problem as far as I'm concerned: it
won't be in XHTML 1.1 ;-)

True, but the problem is in the language definition. Whereas something like
<font> only specifies exactly what needs to be changed, why not just say
that it needs to be changed generically (e.g. <strong>) and then apply style
elsewhere?

True. We need RDF, for stuff like this. I suppose we have to ask "why do we
want this bit of text to be 'big'?". All current methods are hacks (<font>,
<big>, <strong class="big">), but if something needs to be bigger, there
must be a reason. Once we have found that reason, it must be possible to
include the reason in the markup and add style based on that meaning.

I agree: we should get rid of it as well as <b> and <i> (and <small>).

Not bad!

I have Opera 4.02. I don't use it all that often ...

Very good point: and in that case find some other way to express those
semantics (i.e. Semantically, rather than using presentation elements). It's
just not viable to use something like <b> rather than <strong>. Can you
offer me any advantages of using <b> rather than <strong>? Implementation
factors aren't an issue here, son't forget; I mean what are the
philisophical reasons that you believe <b> is better to use than <strong>?
I look at it the other wat round because I believe Semantic markup can be
interpreted much more broadly, and therefore adds a range of accessibility
to the element. If the author wants all <strong> elements to be presented as
bold text, then it is up to them to say so, but at least it can be
overidden.

BTW:, by saying:
> Background and font are semantic because they convey content and
> meaning which is important to the author.
You are slightly contradicting:
> Why do you think it's semantic?  There is nothing semantic about
> <big>.  It's a purely presentational tag.
but I get what you mean.

Oh, and Happy Thanksgiving for all of you in the USA!
