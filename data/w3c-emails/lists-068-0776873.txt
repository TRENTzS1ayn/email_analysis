Nope. I'm a "people" and that's not *all* I remember. I am made to examine 
relationships relating to 
semantics/structure/presentation/content/accessibility/"eDaption"/Kynn/Sean/time-binding 
and lots of other stuff. It *does* matter that such things as <b> and 
<strong> purposes and interrelationships get into the 
flow/mix/deliberations/conversations.

Without such "real world" (however "minor") entities being used to reveal 
the truths being constantly re-discovered by those of us standing on the 
shoulders of our predecessors the time-binding that makes us human and not 
"supernatural animals" wouldn't occur. We use symbols/language, etc. to 
move us to new levels of understanding, starting new enterprises, enabling 
inclusion at a rate never before even conceptualized. The Berners-Lees, 
Connollys, Brickleys, etc. aren't saints, they (and we) are practitioners 
of sanity in a world that is frequently un-sane.

And a happy Thanksgiving to you, too!
