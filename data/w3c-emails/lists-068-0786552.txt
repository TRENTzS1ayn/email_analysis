For a cognitively or learning disabled person who hasn't someone handy to
set up the style sheet for them or find options in a browser only printing
is possible. This is the option my husband uses with red/green pages. 

Which browsers let you take out background. I know you can take out
background for printing in Explorer but not sure if can take it for the
screen.  Seems like it could be an easy feature to add to browsers ... that
rules out the need for a personal style sheet, tho a style sheet may be
nice to make one feel "behind the wheel" on the web!
