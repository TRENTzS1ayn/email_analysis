Very profound...unfortunately, due to the lack of apparent sanity in the
world, the sane is often so out of the normal that it is looked upon as
insane. Which is a bit of a problem to any practitioners of sanity (us!).
Anyway, back to accessibility...

Can someone give me a ten to twenty word definition of Thanksgiving
(off-list)? I watch so many American sitcoms/cartoons that I thought I would
have caught on by now...something to do with giving thanks for something
that happened when the USA was born? I really should do my research
myself...but I can't ask a Web site any further questions I may have!
