I've followed CC/PP for quite a while now, and I have often offered the "XML
Source" line of thinking as an appropriate solution to (current) XHTML
limitations. One of the things about the Semantic Web is that it should fit
in well with CC/PP applications, we can describe our XML Source exactly as
we want it, and then attach profles as you say.
The problem is that until such a date, we have to work out how to use all of
this legacy stuff.

I agree. It's alright attaching behaviours to markup even as long as you use
a 100% foolproof CC/PP based system...but I wouldn't condone it's use for
any other system. I suppose the rift is generated by the fact that I see
XHTML as a useful XML source media, and you see it as the final presentation
media. That's quite interesting if true.

I know: I've followed CC/PP. I even tried outlining an implementation system
for it: DTPP.

Ugh...I see where you're coming from now. You could do that as the end
result of a CC/PP system, declared in the XHTML 1.0 namespace: especially if
you use DTDs. For a Schema version of XHTML (2.0?), i.e. a purely XML
version, then you'd never be able to use <b> 'cause it wouldn't mean
anything.

No, you should use <em> :-)

I still believe that philisophically, there should be an allowance of
alternatives.

I think it is going to be a case of me saying the following:-
If you're using XHTML as a document display format for text/html groking
User Agents, then fine: add as much presentation and behaviours as you like.
But if you're using XHTML as a data format, containg Semantic information
that a world of SW/XML/RDF processors can understand, then use a future
version of XHTML, and never breathe a word about presentational markup and
attached behaviours.
In other words you use flavoured HTML, and I'll use plain ol' XHTML (2.0
hopefully). And then in 5/10/20 years time compare these methods again.

As far as CSS goes, I could use <abbr> in place of <b> if I so wished. But
then if that's how I'm used to seeing abbreviations, then why not?

Indeed we do, and I understand why now!
In the words of Bob Dylan (I seem to quote Bob a lot lately): "And time will
tell just who has fell, and who's been left behind...when you go your way,
and I go mine". In the end I think as long as we use our methods at opposite
ends of the CC/PP chain, we'll both prosper *immensely*.
