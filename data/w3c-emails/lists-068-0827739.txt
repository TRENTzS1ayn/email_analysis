Definitely maybe. Adding emphasis (<em>, <strong>, <cite>, <q>, <code> etc.)
is good, adding presentation commands (<b>, <i>, <big> etc.) not so...

If you're using XHTML as a document display format for text/html groking
User Agents, then fine: add as much presentation and behaviours as you like.
But if you're using XHTML as a data format, containg Semantic information
that a world of SW/XML/RDF processors can understand, then use a future
version of XHTML, and never breathe a word about presentational markup and
attached behaviours.
