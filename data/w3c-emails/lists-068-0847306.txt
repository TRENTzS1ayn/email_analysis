Understood, William. So, enter the concept of "classes" instead of using
the conventional mark-ups (B, I, U)that have meaning to students learning
to use textbooks and people who use word processors regularly, but not
perhaps beyond that group ... In marking up a piece of a textbook, one
would use "definitions" to mark certain words in bold and perhaps a certain
color ... and the fact that these words are "definitions" would be conveyed
to the user rather than just intuited ... How exactly is this conveyed?  
How does the user use this page? Do they look at the class Definition and
decide they'll show that in blue, or what?

That makes sense, William. It's a "standard" style sheet.
And I understand that some pages fit neatly into a "standard" style sheet,
but others fit into a "custom" style sheet from the author ... if the
cutomization is to suite a specific audience not well served by the
"standard" it is "accessible", but if it goes into a "custom" style sheet
because it's fun to do for the author, that is an entirely different
concept of web pages ...

I know. And, speaking as a web author, sometimes the "fun" between author
and user misses it's mark ... But, then sometimes, hearing your audience
say "oh, wow!" is worth a lot more than dotting all the i's and crossing
all the t's in the great advances of the world vision!

If you enjoy midi music, there's some neat Thanksgiving music selections
at http://www.night.net/thanksgiving/songs11.html-ssi
When I did that site with the kids this week, I sang a bit for them, even
tho the tempo on "Over the River" is a bit quick...! Me, who was was a high
school teacher, singing to little ones to a computer! What a hoot! Oh, what
the technology brings out in each of us!
