But in HTML, when properly used, a marking of <b> could mean quite a
number of things, but it could _not_ mean strong emphasis.  Because
strong emphasis is marked up with <strong>, and therefore when a
reader/client would see <b> they are entitled to assume that it must
mean something other than <strong>.  They don't know what, but they
are entitled to assume that strong emphasis is excluded.

Right; and <i> could mean quite a number of different things, but what
it could not mean is emphasis, nor cite, nor any of the other logical
markups for which italics are a usual rendering.  Because the
recipient is entitled to expect an author to use the proper markups
for those, and entitled to conclude that <i> therefore must mean
something different than any of those.

all the best
