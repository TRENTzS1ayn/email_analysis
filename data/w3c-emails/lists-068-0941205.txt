Folks,

Have been updating personal pages and reading the posts to the list,
discussed what's keeping me so involved at the screen with hubby, and
pondered where the difference still are. 

One thought, on reading Charlie McCarthy-Neville's reply, is that the name
ascribed to elements which are supposed to be presentational, and within
the control of the user, are called "style" ... To me (and logically
others), the main use of the word "style" is to mean "fine artistic style".
Putting presentational elements which should be usable in either visual
presentation or auditory, under the title of "style" isn't very semantical.
There is also a "style" in the writing of the content, which is probably
impossible to separate from the meat of the words.
If it were possible to mark-up "style" in, say a paragraph, it may make the
task of understanding easier... by a degree or two ...
