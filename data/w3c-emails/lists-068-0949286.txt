I don't want to get too out of hand but if I'm not mistaken all of 
civilization has, in a very real sense been built on "text"? I realize that 
Disney is more popular than McGuffey, but we have to give the text devil 
its due. As I reread Moby Dick I am struck by how futile the efforts to 
tell that story in pictures instead of words has proven to be. We got to 
the point we got to (for better or worse) from learning to learn from the 
"before" of things.

What distinguishes/ennobles/identifies/characterizes humans is 
"time-binding". We stand on the shoulders of the previous and without that 
"human nature" we perish. I would be surprised if among us we could find 
tiller/spinner/weaver but the ability to harness all that previousness 
enables us to whisper over the miles/generations/cultures.

Love.
