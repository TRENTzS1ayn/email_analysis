What is this in reply to? Are you talking about "display: inline;"?

Yes, Dan Connoly uses this kind of techniques for some of his pages.
See: http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly And he has a list of Semantic stuff
he's working on. One link actually links to an XSLT converted view of his
page [1] using classes.
Using classes is all we can use in 1.0/1.1 at the mo', but I think there
should be some alternatives in future: i.e. actually putting the semantics
in the page in the first place! Discussing XSLT transformations to create
Semantic Web summaries isn't part of this list though, I guess, so I suppose
no-one is going to be able to persue this here. Maybe I'll hack an example
up and send it to RDF IG.
