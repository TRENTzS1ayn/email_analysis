William,

This is one of my favorite posts regarding the "great text/image divide"
that I have seen yet.  It has never been clear to me why a discussion about
one vs. the other is even necessary.  Text can supplement meaning provided
by images and images can supplement and support meaning provided (or
intended) by text.

It seems to me that in the long run, the questions will have more to do with
what the most appropriate uses of various media are.  What needs to be
supplied as multiple representations of intended meaning and what can
reasonably be provided only once in a format that is transformable for those
who need it in another way or in multiple ways?

Chuck
