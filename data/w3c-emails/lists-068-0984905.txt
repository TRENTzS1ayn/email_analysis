I. They don't "limit themselves" in the sense that there's some inner voice 
saying "let's mess with Jonathan's mind and not put up any graphics."

II. They aren't "satisfied" with the absence of graphics.

III. They keep having people throw stuff on the table but disappear when 
it's time to clean it up.

There is always the possibility of emplacing "gratuitous graphics" but that 
would evoke just as much rancorous uproar and serve none well.

Point to graphics that satisfy what you think needs satisfying, including 
where it's to go. If it works I assure you we will all salute it. If you 
expect anyone to believe that *ANY* graphics will suffice then I fear for 
your argument. If the meaning is obtained just from the presence then it 
might as well be a "decorative icon" and the judges as to which ones to 
select are very hard to find.
