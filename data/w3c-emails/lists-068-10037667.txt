My conclusion, after reading all the messages in this thread, is to leave 
2.4 as it was since we are giving user's control of how long they need to 
interact with the content.  It is not feasible to say don't limit the time 
at all.

Gregg, Adam included flicker in his proposal since it is in the current 
WCAG draft under checkpoint 2.4.

in the 20 January 2001 draft it says, "2.4 Give users control over how long 
they can spend reading or interacting with content.  Mechanisms that 
required a timed response include:  automatic 
refresh,  redirection,  flicker,  blinking  This can be satisfied by 
providing an option to deactivate automatic updating, or to control the 
rate at which it occurs. User agents may also offer control over this 
effect. Note that flicker effects can cause seizures in people with 
photoepilepsy.  "
