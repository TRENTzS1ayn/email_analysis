Matt,

Thanks for clarifying this. I've had this sniggling urge in the back of my
head that this is not an issue that can be adequately addressed with a
"thou shalt not".  We can affect the presentations that businesses make
with customers, but we can't do much about the back room business
decisions... It's hard to imagine that a web designer is responsible when
real life distracts a user! How long should an item be carried as sold when
the user slumped over his computer and died before he finished buying his
new Dell system? What a scenario in Fiduciary law! Is the dead user
required to pay for the ordered computer since he kept it out of
sellability for whatever time span (til his ISP turned off)?

I made a slide program in Powerpoint over the weekend, to share a set of 36
pictures taken in the school. I added a sentence of text to each picture,
and set the slides to change every four seconds. Ample time for adults to
read the caption. Great, for showing to the principal, the curriculum
specialist, and other adults. But when I showed to program to the kids, who
skipped reading the text and wanted to identify their cousins, siblings and
friends in each picture, I needed to have a longer time span ... 

As you suggested, static pages, and pages within a a "presentation", need
to be available to both run un-manned, as well as manually, to meet all
needs. Static pages' purpose is to serve the user ...

Interactive pages have to meet needs other than solely accommodating the
user. Online tests (anticipated by 2002-2003 in Virginia) may need to be
scored differently if the user uses them timed or untimed. Plus all the
business needs you cite.
