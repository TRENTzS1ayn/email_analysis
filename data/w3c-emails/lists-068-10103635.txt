Yep, Any reading measure you use with the guidelines - they will come out
high on  the reading scale. To the user, the first job is reading and
understanding what is said, then determining what said applies to what the
user is actually doing. 

Why not try SMOG on the new intruduction. I think you'll see that the
introduction is becoming much more readable.
