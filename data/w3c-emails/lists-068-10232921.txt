Gregory,

I would prefer the use of an icon rather than a blank graphic, so that
anyone who needs/wants such a link, has it whether sighted or not ... 

The icon should indicate where you are going rather than be a "skip" icon
... If all skips are to main content, then it needs to be a "main content"
icon ... one of which would be mighty useful on the various guidelines
pages (skip over that humongous list of links to supporting data and
explanations ... they should be either down the side of the page, or at the
bottom, out of the way of what you came to the page to get!

Anne
