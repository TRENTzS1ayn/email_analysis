Why not just use the named-place notation ("#named-place")?
Just put "<a name=starthere> </a>" after the navigation section
of each page (it would help if there were a standard convention
for named places) and program the user agent to toggle a property
for going directly there.

For users who don't have a programmable user agent, put "#starthere"
at the end of every href to an html resource on your site - not
difficult to do globally with sed. Users who want the navigation
part can go up easily enough.
