Thanks to you,Kynn and Jim, for the ideas. Nice site, Jim. Please keep them
coming, I vow to clean them up (mine), and post them all somewhere.  These
ideas are very valuable to several thousand people at the moment............

It's very important to remember that a "skip links" mechanism is
a technique -- it's not the means to the end, it's a way of
accomplishing something.
One way to do that is to include skippable links.  But it may not
be necessary in all cases -- for example, with a right hand navbar,
the need to 'skip links' may be eliminated, since the content will
typically read first, and the navigation links after that.
