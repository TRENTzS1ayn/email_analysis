Intro Re-do SuggestionsThank you so much Thanasis.  As you can see, I never
was an English teacher.  And the strength of this group is utilizing the
talents that exist here to create the best information for the public that
we can. ( I love your editing style on the intro page that you produced, I
just might steal it for the different docs that I am working on.........if
you don't mind........ : )  You have much to contribute, and we appreciate
that you care to..................................Katie

It may be a few days before I can get to
updating.............................

  Greetings,

  Katie posted a request for commentary on the revised "purpose".  I
incorporated several suggestions into a revised version in HTML, which is
available on-line [1]. (I decided not to post the marked-up paragraph as
rich text).

  I hope it's not presumptuous of me to offer edits since I'm not affiliated
in any way with W3C and I only very recently joined this list, but it's in
my professional interest to have the best possible WCAG, so I wanted to get
involved.

  Specific suggestions -- forgive me if these are overly pedantic, but I
used to be an English teacher ;) . . .

  a) Don't use an apostrophe to make a plural, even for acronyms.  The
plural of
  <acronym title="Personal Digital Assistant">PDA</acronym> should be
  <acronym title="Personal Digital Assistant">PDA</acronym>s.

  b) "Web" is a proper noun, and should always be capitalized (see the W3C
home page for example).

  c) "Default" is not a term non-IT people are often familiar with, much to
my frequent surprise.  IIRC this paragraph is meant for the non-specialist,
so I would recommend avoiding the word.

  d) Marking up acronyms and abbreviations would set a good example.

  e) "Mobile phone" is, I think, a more general (and
internationally-understood) term than "cellphone."

  f) The sentence beginning "As well as making . . ." is not a complete
sentence; changing "As well as making" to "It also makes" fixes that.

  g) Adding the word "simple" in the last sentence ("by employing these
_simple_ principles") might not be bad -- we want to make the burden of
compliance seem light, not onerous.

  See [1] for other suggested edits.
