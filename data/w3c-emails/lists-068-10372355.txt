Adam,
Thank you.  I now appreciate what Jason said about not wasting time on
editorial discussion on our weekly telecon. The syntax stuff is more
appropriately handled here, on the list.  Then, during the calls we can work
on the substance of the document. If we continue to receive this kind of
concrete input, we just may come up with one heck of a useful body of
work................Katie

Good ideas, but you need to fix the syntax (one of the sentences has
no verb, and the parenthesized phrase is outside of any sentence) and
usage. I suggest:

These guidelines outline design principles that allow usable,
attractive, and functional web sites to be made more accessible to
people with disabilities. When these principles
are ignored, individuals with disabilities may not be able to access
the content at all, or they may be able to do so only with great
difficulty. When these principles are used
they also make Web content accessible through a variety of
web-enabled devices, such as cellphones, PDA's, kiosks, WebTV etc.
Using those principles also makes content
accessible to non-disabled people in a wider range of
situations (have you ever read captions on a TV in a store,
because background noise made it difficult to
hear?) Web site designers can make a difference in the lives of
millions of people by using the following principles in all
the web content they design.

Context matters. Seldom does *anything* have only one cause.
