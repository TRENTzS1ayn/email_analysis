In my opinion, it's because we don't have many artists
participating.  In fact, I think some WAI attitudes have specifically
chased away artistic folks, and for that we are the weaker.

WAI needs more artist participation -- and by artist I don't just
mean visual, although they are likely the most common types we'd
find here.

I would love to see, for example, Scott McCloud (author of Understanding
Comics) participate in WAI activities.  (He probably doesn't have
the time, though, as WAI participation requires a lot of work for
little tangible feedback...)  If you're not familiar with Scott's
work, it's an excellent explanation of the connection between images
and text embodied by the comic book medium.  His web site is
