Ann's suggestion sounds good to me.   Since the OR is there, it is no more
restrictive, but it is much more suggestive of giving the user active
control.   The "either" needs to move to the front of the sentence for
grammatical reasons but I concur with this suggestion.

Not sure I like leaving out control ... what is not necessary to one person
is undoubtedly necessary or atleast desirable to another ... why not:

Give the user either control over timing of content, or provide _as much
time as possible_ to read or interact with content.
