Why is it necessary?  

Of course, it's preferable to use a 302 or something similar when one has 
control over the server.  But there are other solutions, like using sym links 
on UNIX file systems, for moved documents.  And there's nothing wrong with a 
simple page that says, "this site has moved to . . ." and gives a link.

The meta refresh is a slick trick and it's easy to implement.  Designers will 
howl if WCAG says not to use it -- I know, I've heard them at training 
sessions.  But there are other ways of doing the job without introducing 
accessibility problems.

When I tell some people they can't just export HTML from MS Word, they get 
upset, too.  But that doesn't mean that MS Word-generated HTML should be 
exempted from the requirement to put alt text on images, or from the 
requirement to use structural markup, or from the requirement to conform to a 
published standard.

In my opinion, WAI would be doing itself a disservice to create exceptions 
based on convenience, when simple (and perfectly "reasonable") alternatives 
exist.
