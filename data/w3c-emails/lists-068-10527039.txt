Given that this is the most common way around server redirects, and these
redirect pages don't present content themselves and endeavor to avoid excess
user interaction, I don't consider this to be a problem with accessibility.
If the page being refreshed contained words intended for the user to read
(e.g., splash pages), I would have different thoughts, but the text on
redirect pages is usually nothing more than a safety net.

If necessary, it's possible to require ACSS not to speak the redirect text
to avoid disorientation. But the fact is that it is unprofessional and as a
result unacceptable for many content providers to require an unnecessary
clickthrough.
