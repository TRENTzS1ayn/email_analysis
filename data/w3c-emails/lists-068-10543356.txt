I'm leaving for Europe in a couple of days; I may be unable to connect
regularly while traveling, but I'd like to give 2.4 another shot
before the face-to-face in Amsterdam. I've tried to incorporate the
discussion to date. My current draft:

2.4  If at all possible, do not limit the time that a user may need to
understand or interact with your content.
* When a time limit cannot be avoided, move as much content
  and interaction as possible out of the time-limited segment.
* Provide disabled users with a means to bypass or extend
  any remaining time limit.
* Use delayed refresh or redirection only when necessary to
  bring superceded content up to date.
* Content must cooperate with user agent mechanisms for
  preventing motion (including flicker, blinking, flashing,
  auto-scrolling etc) and for control of the rate at
  which motion occurs.

Context matters. Seldom does *anything* have only one cause.
