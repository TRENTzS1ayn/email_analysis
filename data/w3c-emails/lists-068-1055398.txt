I've said it before and been ignored; I think the WAI pages need
some pictures of people with disabilities.

I also think we need more pictures of WAI staff members and working
groups at work -- such as photographs of WAI meetings.  I have some,
which are mostly unorganized, on my web site from the WCAG meeting
in Bristol (thanks to my digital camera); if anyone finds those
useful for illustrating what working groups do or how WAI functions,
they're more than welcome (with appropriate photo credit) to use
them.

The WAI page is clearly designed by textually oriented folks and without
any sort of commercial motive; if outside contractors with graphic
artist skills were to bid on and design the WAI site, it would be
completely different and would take advantage of established, known
principles for conveying information visually (not just with text).
These principles are often discounted by certain WAI adherents,
though.  However, it is entirely possible to create a web site which
is both accessible and visually appealing; isn't that part of why
we're here in the first place?
