This really IS getting verbose. How about:

2.4  If at all possible, allow time for understanding and interaction.
* Move as much content and interaction as possible out of
  time-limited segments.
* Provide disabled users with a means to bypass or extend
  time limits.
* Use delayed refresh or redirection only when necessary to
  bring content up to date.
* Cooperate with user agent mechanisms for preventing motion
  (flicker, blinking, flashing, auto-scrolling etc) and for
  control of the rate at which motion occurs.
