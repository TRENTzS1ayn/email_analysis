What about the breaking of the back button caused by redirects?  You were on 
page A and followed a link to page B.  Page B is a redirect to page C.  Let's 
assume that the redirect happened flawlessly, and you (who are a blind user) 
are unaware of the redirect at all.  You want to go back to A, so you press 
Alt-Left Arrow, which takes you to the previous page, B.  B redirects you to 
C again.  Only pressing Alt-Left Arrow enough times in rapid succession 
(difficult or impossible if you have any motor disabilities) will let you 
"break through" the redirect loop and get back to A.

That's got nothing to do with 2.4, really; it's a navigation issue.  I would 
say it falls under 2.3 (Give users control of mechanisms that cause extreme 
changes in context).  But breaking their navigation is a pretty big thing to 
burden users with when it can be done another way.

I agree, BTW, that it's unprofessional to have a bunch of "page has moved to 
_here_" pages; it's more unprofessional, though, to break my back button.
