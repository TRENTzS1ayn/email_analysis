I would make the first sentence:

2.4  Allow as much time as possible for understanding and interacting with 
content.

Using the conditional "if at all possible, allow time" has a weaker sound 
than "allow as much time as possible".  Also, it's not helpful if the site 
gives you only five seconds to request a time extension..

Also, what does it mean to "Cooperate with user agent mechanisms for 
preventing motion . . ." in the absence of such mechanisms?  I can envision a 
site claming that the absence of a "stop GIF animation and <marquee>" button 
in MSIE is a UA problem, and it's not the site's fault there's no UA 
mechanism with which to cooperate.
