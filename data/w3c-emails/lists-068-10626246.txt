A minor point about plural agreement and the definitive article:

Provide disabled users with a means to bypass or extend time limits.

Should be:

Provide disabled users with means [or a mean] to bypass time limits.

I would make the first sentence:

2.4  Allow as much time as possible for understanding and interacting with 
content.

Using the conditional "if at all possible, allow time" has a weaker sound 
than "allow as much time as possible".  Also, it's not helpful if the site 
gives you only five seconds to request a time extension..

Also, what does it mean to "Cooperate with user agent mechanisms for 
preventing motion . . ." in the absence of such mechanisms?  I can envision
a 
site claming that the absence of a "stop GIF animation and <marquee>" button

in MSIE is a UA problem, and it's not the site's fault there's no UA 
mechanism with which to cooperate.
