I know, but that's the way the Web appears to be moving (see below).

I'd have to say that "XHTML 1.0" is most certainly *meant* to be a document
markup language, even if people don't use it as such. XHTML 1.1 gives us
some lee-way in mixing vocabularies, allowing us to mix XHTML with pure data
formats. Also, the HTML WG Roadmap specifies that XHTML 2.0 will more likely
than not be a pure XML version of XHTML, with no presentational aspects.
Whether that will happen or not remains to be seen, but the "documents vs.
data" battle is running high: just look at http://doctypes.org/
I still think that more data formats are required, and that XHTML can have
certain data aspects, even if it is only a document markup format. It
depends what meaning you attach to certain tags; whether or not XHTML should
have a Schema, and to what extent the Web is transforming into the SW.
Certainly, RDF and other such technologies to add another reqired dimension
to all of this, but at the end of the day it is down to the high-level
architects of the Web to decide what works.
