WCAG 2 will assume that all "until user agents . . ." have been met?  I 
thought that WCAG meant for pages to be as accessible as possible given the 
capabilities and limitations of deployed UAs.  Charles's response suggests 
that WCAG 2 envisions an ideal UA, which is far from what is available AFAIK.

Is there no responsibility to design pages which are accessible using 
currently deployed UAs, _with_ all their deficiencies?
