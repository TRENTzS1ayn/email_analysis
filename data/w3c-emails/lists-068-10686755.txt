The responsibility of the author is to do things "the right way", and there
are things that screen readers do handle properly. For example, using HTTP
redirects instead of http-equiv in a meta element.

But there are things over which the author has no control, such as whether
someone is using a browser that just doesn't work.

WCAG compromises (like life really) in the attempt to get a world that works
today and tomorrow. And WCAG 2 doesn't assume all "until user agents" clauses
have been met, but last time we discussed the topic there was an agreement
that things would either be phrased as requirements, or not. (It doesn't
really solve the problem, but it does solve people asking "how do I know if
user agents... yet?")

cheers

  WCAG 2 will assume that all "until user agents . . ." have been met?  I
  thought that WCAG meant for pages to be as accessible as possible given the
  capabilities and limitations of deployed UAs.  Charles's response suggests
  that WCAG 2 envisions an ideal UA, which is far from what is available AFAIK.

  Is there no responsibility to design pages which are accessible using
  currently deployed UAs, _with_ all their deficiencies?
