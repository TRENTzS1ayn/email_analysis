My contention was that HTTP redirects are "the right way", and that meta 
refresh redirects were introducing unnecessary obstacles to accessibility 
_given_ _currently_ _deployed_ _UAs._  If I'm not misunderstanding you, you 
just said something very similar.

I would love it (from a designer's perspective) if I could say "all users of 
NS4 go hang; you need to get a better browser".  NS4 emphatically doesn't 
work, in its handling of all sorts of valid markup and style.  But I can't 
ignore that a lot of people are still using it:  many people are resistant to 
embracing the MS monopoly but are unaware of alternatives (Opera, iCab, 
Konqueror, etc.).  And if I design pages that don't work in NS4, those pages 
aren't accessible, regardless of how many WCAG checkpoints they meet.

That's good.  I never cared much for the "until user agents" clauses; they 
introduced too much ambiguity.
