Hmmm, sounds like we are saying the same things.

  My contention was that HTTP redirects are "the right way", and that meta
  refresh redirects were introducing unnecessary obstacles to accessibility
  _given_ _currently_ _deployed_ _UAs._  If I'm not misunderstanding you, you
  just said something very similar.

  I would love it (from a designer's perspective) if I could say "all users of
  NS4 go hang; you need to get a better browser".  NS4 emphatically doesn't
  work, in its handling of all sorts of valid markup and style.  But I can't
  ignore that a lot of people are still using it:  many people are resistant to
  embracing the MS monopoly but are unaware of alternatives (Opera, iCab,
  Konqueror, etc.).  And if I design pages that don't work in NS4, those pages
  aren't accessible, regardless of how many WCAG checkpoints they meet.

  That's good.  I never cared much for the "until user agents" clauses; they
  introduced too much ambiguity.
