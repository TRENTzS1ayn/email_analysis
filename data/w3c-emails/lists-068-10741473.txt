Hi there,

I have been asked by Wendy Chisholm to post the attached proposal for
usability testing of WCAG v2.0 in advance of the Face to Face meeting in
Amsterdam tomorrow, at which I will be talking about the proposal.
Unfortunately there was a delay in putting together the draft which has
prevented me from circulating this sooner. 

I apologise for sending the attached to list members at such short notice,
and hope that as many meeting attendees as possible can have a look at it
before tomorrow morning.

Best regards,
David
