FYI, that site you see now is intended to be but one of many presentations
available to users; other versions of the site would be tailored to
other needs of other users, such as resizeable text instead of
graphics.

It's not functioning yet, though, because we are still working on the
technology to do so.  (Rome wasn't built in a day.)  If you want to see
a demo/preview of the Edapta site that does edaptations, though, please
drop me some private email.
