We talked mostly in broad terms. these are my notes...

--------------- Some references we should look for / at:

SVG access note - http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG-access (the drafting of it goes to
http://www.w3.org/1999/09/SVG-access if people want to see our spelling
mistakes and other thoughts)

bell labs did a lot of studies on illustrating manuals. photos have a lot of
distracting detail, and line drawings are more helpful. Action Adam Reed to
find reference

Paper by robert ephraim on visual agnoses - many people cannot identify
objects in colour, but can with a line drawing.

The icon dicussion on IG
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2001AprJun/0255 and following
messages

Gunnar Hellstrom did good work with sign language telecommunication
http://www.omnitor.se (frame rates and so on. )
Also worked on this in Deaf Australia Online projects - action CMN find
reference

GJR National Braille Press have done work on how to describe for the blind -
we have reference on list archives.

---------------------- Technique stuff (general, not specific techniques)


colour disabilities:
red-green
only greyscales
diminishing perception of blue - we think there are more that we need to
find. Action Lisa Seeman
there are people who cannot distinguish brightness


consistency in styles
distinct in colours
distinct shape

icons should not require complex processing of the representation.

we need to remove everything one after the other - colour, brightness,
outline only
colour can be processed quickly, so it is useful to keep it there
Shape is good too
motion is fastest and draws attention
colour is faster than outline
for binary choices, light/dark may be faster than colour - find out... action
Jan Richards
sound can reinforce, but MUST be in sync
vertical/horizontal orientation can be immportant - a few degrees of
misorientation can make a big difference to how people percieve. Symmetry is
an important factor.
layout of "moving" components is important

subtitling is difficult because sign language syntax is different, so
synchronisation is hard. searching and finding pieces in sign tracks is
difficult, but there are techniques to put metadata and hotspots. we are
discussing how to divide so you can switch from written to signed subtitles
and back.  Action Antti - show this tomorrow how it works.

placement is very important for signing, then colour,

rights management is important in the case of artistic material.

AR2 relationships can be expressed in 2d media through proximity or order
(reading order - can vary according to the "standard local" writing system)

encoding relationships can allow us to transform the representation

---------------Other notes that might remind people of something - probably
not worth reading.

traffic lights - distinguished by position and brightness

AR2 There are people who cannot distinguish brightness

cognitive component of vision - mose people don't know about agnosia (like
CMN until now)

we should look at  perception research

we need colour disability information

agnosia can include motion - people cannot identify motion
facial agnosia

size of a clip can vary widely.

removing colour seems to be helpful for faster processing (open question)

socially, sign language is important, like different "natural languages"

metadata, subtitiling speech signing content...

It is an art to write what is there in a picture.

project - take some photos and ask people to describe them (short and long
descriptions) and see what happens as the pictures are degraded. Any work
like that been done?

navigation: map type of navigation vs tables of images.
