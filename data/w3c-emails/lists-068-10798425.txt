A few month ago we were asked if we are addressing any physiological and cognitive disabilities in our guidelines. Whilst shmoozing over the weekend, I was alerted to (although confess that I know almost nothing about it) some such disabilities / cognitive disabilities that we may be able to do more for.

Semantic pragmatic, is a disabilities were the person is unable to understand anything but the literal meaning of words. If you tell him not to look a gift horse in the mouth he will wonder what horse, and why he should do that anyway. The are unable to understand jokes sarcasm and metaphors and can be unable to distinguish a joke from literal conversation. They can be intelligent, just literal.

The particular children who my friend was working with have a real problem with content, conversational and written. As authors try to make content more user friendly this content becomes less accessible to them.

So I propose the following.
The PF suggest that XHTML, ect create a new tag - <non literal> to enclose non literal comments (or a few tags such a joke metaphor sarcasm expression) that such people can render in a alternative color so that they can at least be alerted to the fact that this content is not  intended to be taken literally. Then we could have a title or translation attribute were the author can say the literal intention of the non-literal content.

E.g. <nonliteral translation="going from bad to worse"> out of the frying pan into the fire</nonliteral>

Just a suggestion. We need to get in touch with professionals dealing with this disability to ask their opinion. 

However  more importantly there is a question, are we looking into helping all the disabilities that we can. 

Comments?
