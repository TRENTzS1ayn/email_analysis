Lisa,

I know of with such children - often autistic folks have this
characteristic, but do not know what you mean when you say:

>As authors try to make  content
>more user friendly this content becomes less >accessible to  them.

How does making a site more user friendly result in reducing accessibility
to these users? I hope you are not thinking that an author is going to toss
in some jokes to make his content more user friendly?
