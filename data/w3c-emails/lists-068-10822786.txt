Text in element content (vs. attributes) is also very useful for
translation.  If I know that all of my element content is meant as
human-readable text (and it's marked up with a proper xml:lang
designation), then I can do automatic translation on it.  If I have
to worry about whether an attribute should be translated or not, or
what language each attribute is in (note: there is no way in XML to
indicate this), then translation is much harder.

It's easier to translate this:

   <img src="blah.gif" xml:lang="en">
      <alt>Welcome to Blah.com</alt>
      <title>Blah Logo</title>
   </img>

Than this:

   <img src="blah.gif" alt="Welcome to Blah.com" title="Blah Logo" />

(Why?  Because in the first example I don't have to _know_ that certain
attributes are human-readable; in the second, I have to have specific
knowledge that alt and title are meant for people, and they're in
English.)
