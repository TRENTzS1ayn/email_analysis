I think that there is a general trend in writing to be more colloquial and,
well, fun. Take the way manuals have evolved, from the dry text books to the
"machine code for dummies" stile of writing.
Just take that fraise "for dummies" that is not literally intended. It
probably means "made friendly".

But all this is not the point. The question is, would such a checkpoint
help. and should we make it.

Again I know that example I made is not the ideal solution, just an example
of a possible direction.

The essence of the issue is - Is this a problem we need to address. And if
so - let us do it.
