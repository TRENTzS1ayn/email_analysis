Lisa, I puzzled over this until I remembered you are not in the US. The
word "Dummies" is used for "Dumb People" as well as for store figures.
There is not necessarily a movement from manuals to fun books, so much a
broadening of the market to include more readers and users - those who find
the manuals "inaccessible" ...

If it won't help, we shouldn't do it. It would be a major chore for text
authors. Perhaps you could give it a first try. Talk to your friend who has
these children as students. Prepare two web pages that her students have to
read, one written with literary elements marked up and defined, the other
with it just straight, and ask the kids which they liked better and why.

If it needs to be done, it needs to be done in markup, which means it needs
to be doable in Front Page, Word, and Word Perfect.
