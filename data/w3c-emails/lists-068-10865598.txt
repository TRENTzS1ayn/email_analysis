The next meeting of the working group will be held on Thursday, 5 July
(there is to be no meeting this week).

We are hopeful that the minutes of last week's face to face meeting
will be made available shortly.

The main topic to be considered for next week's teleconference is the
development of "sufficiency criteria" for each of the checkpoints in
WCAG 2.0--that is, clear criteria which, if met, will enable an
implementor to claim satisfaction of the checkpoint. The desirability
of developing such a proposal was discussed at last week's meeting, as
will be detailed in the minutes.
