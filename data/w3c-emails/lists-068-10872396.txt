Something like that (modulo the attribute design) would also benefit
ESL (English as Second Language) like me who have problem
understanding idioms/expressions usually learnt in the early ages of

It's part of the larger class of alternate (alt for image, expansion
of acronym, etc) so should be accounted for in XHTML 2.0 in a generic
way.
