One of the problems is that users of "I blew my top" are frequently unaware 
that it's idiomatic. When we tell a blind guy "its' the blue one right over 
there" we succumb to this feature. "But it is the blue one!"

How do we remember that there is a semantic tone to much of language that 
is often opposite of what's said: "yeah, right!" meaning "wrong" but there 
being decreasing-with-use/familiarity with that fact?

Is "pragmatics" an indispensable part of markup? It is clearly one of the 
main barriers to machine translation and often the basis for much "ethnic 
humor".
