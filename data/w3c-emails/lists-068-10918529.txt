It's been awhile since these were under consideration, but I have page for
this group on my home webpage that I would like either to move to the W3C
site, or safely delete ... http://www.erols.com/stevepem/guidelines
and http://www.erols.com/stevepem/guidelines/G3

By the way, what came of the efforts to find a professional to do
illustrations for the guidelines?
