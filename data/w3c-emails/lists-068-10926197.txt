Anne,
for archive purposes, these ought to exist somewhere.  Particularly the /G3 
stuff.   I'll find out if it is appropriate to publish it on the W3C site.

I'm supposed to call Meg to talk about illustrating the guidelines.  I saw 
her a few weeks ago and she is still interested, but we need to talk about 
how to move forward.
