I think this stuff comes under checkpoints for simplifying language.

Maybe we should say "provide alternatives for idiomatic or complex text
content" as a checkpoint. This would include multimedia alternatives as well
as simplified text content.

For the specific case of clarifying short text I would suggest using Ruby -
which is part of XHTML 1.1 but has a method for working in older browsers.

The example would be marked up as:

<ruby><rb>out of the frying pan into the fire</rb><rp> (that is
</rp><rt>from bad to worse</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>

In an old HTML browser this will come out as

out of the frying pan into the fire (that is from bad to worse)

and in one that supports ruby the normal stylesheet presentation in Amaya
would mean the explanation is above the original text, but with the following
user stylesheet fragment:

ruby { ruby-position: inline }
rb { display: none }
rp { display: none }
rt { display: inline ; font-size: 100% }
rt:before { content: "[" }
rt:after { content: "]" }

the ruby would be displayed as

[from bad to worse]

Note that this can be further enhanced by the use of class, to select
specific classes of ruby structures to display like this.

More info on Ruby can be got from the specification http://www.w3.org/TR/ruby
- it was developed by the internationalisation (I18N) working group, and is
to do something that is commonly used in East Asia.
