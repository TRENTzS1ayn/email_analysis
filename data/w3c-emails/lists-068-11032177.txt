Hi everyone

and thanks to Lisa. However, I feel like having to cool you down a bit. 
Actually the CinemaSense is basically a product for hearing and Deaf 
students. We have included a lot of features to make it accessible to 
vision impaired, too. But as I said in the meeting we didn't have enough 
time to make proper user surveys with vision impaired people. So we don't 
have hard data to give you about how it really works. We have followed 
Jakob Nielsen's ideas, your guidelines and made some comprehensive thinking 
and mixed it with our expreriences about the item. E.g. I brought the 
knowledge about the tunnel vision into project because I have friends with 
usher-syndrom.

I hope Timo Viikari have a possibility to join your meetings in the future. 
He's capable to work checkpoints and techniques with you. Unfortunately our 
report is only in finnish so far, but I'll guess there's no barrier's to 
change messages with Timo in the first phase. Timo's address above.

- Antti
