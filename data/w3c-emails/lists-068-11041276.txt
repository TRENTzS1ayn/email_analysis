Wow, information overload. Daniel, Wendy and Katie in particular look
quite different from other portraits of them that I've seen. Chaals
and Gregory seem familiar (from RDF F2F, and Bristol DI pictures).
Many of the others I've not seen before (and I've never met any of
you)...

But come on now, where's a picture of Chris? Surely he can't get off
that lightly :-)
