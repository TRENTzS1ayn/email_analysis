It's possible that our notion of "structure" may be limited and may not
actually be as "important" as we think.  It is possible (although likely
not dogmatically attractive) that we could have a faulty vision at
the same time that we are claiming the rest of the world is imperfect,
too.

(I'm sorry if we are supposed to maintain that anything that comes
from the W3C or from TimBL is sacrosanct, I'll try to be better in
the future.)
