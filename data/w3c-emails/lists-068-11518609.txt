William,
Whenever I visit your xguide.htm, I again appreciate your skills in making
the incomprehensible comprehensible. The organization on the page makes it
easy to compare Guidelines 1 and 3 at the same time, to consider where it
best belongs. 

Under "Illustrate Appropriately", we can include the checkpoints you
mentioned, to add alt text, descriptions, text scripts, etc., but it should
also include making choices of "illustrations", use simplist illustrations
when possible (transparent backgrounds, simple drawings, clear photos in 2
sizes, complex drawings in 2 sizes, etc.) 

My homeschooled nephew (yrs old) is visiting this weekend, equipped with
Game Boy. He has a few Pokemon games (of course!), and a camera attachment
for the devise. The little goosenecked lamp he plugs into it is very
effective, tho it could scatter light a bit more than it does. 

But, what fascinated me was the screen. It can handle detailed drawings
with basic color, and a good bit of tightly-organized text and options. The
screen used with the camera is nice, but only b/w images. Color and details
can be added, and my nephew uses his keypad as swiftly and surely as I type
text and more efficiently than I use a pointing device. (Youngsters who are
learning these skills with tiny hands fascinate me, as much as seeing good
penmanship with tiny hands fascinated generations of teachers before me.)

This all said, I can see the difficulties with web sites being useful on
small screens. There has to be a different presentation scheme for use on
small screens ... If a graphic can be associated with a page, chapter or
paragraph on a full-sized screen, it will need to be associated with a
specific sentence to function properly on a small screen. I have no idea
how this could be done.
