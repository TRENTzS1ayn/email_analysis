Subject: SVGSpider.com - the world's "first" all SVG web site?

> List members may be interested to visit www.SVGspider.com. I believe the
site
> may be the world's first "all SVG" web site.
>
> The site is intended as a "proof of concept". It is not claimed that it
is
> production quality at present.
>
> A number of simple SVG animations can be viewed on the site. XLinks can
be
> used to navigate among the pages.
>
> To view the site you will require an SVG viewer. I would recommend
Version
> 1.0 of the Adobe SVG Viewer which can be downloaded from
>
> http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/main.html
>
> Neither the Batik nor Amaya viewers correctly display SVG animations as
yet.
> Therefore using those viewers would significantly obviate the purpose of
the
> site, since the animation would either not be rendered or be rendered as
> static. Therefore the Adobe viewer is my suggestion for a viewer at this
time.
>
> The site can be accessed as
> www.svgspider.com  or
> www.svgspider.com/default.svg
>
> In addition, I am aware that there is a namespace issue. This arises, in
> part, from incompatibilities in how preview releases of various SVG
viewers
> handle XLinks. The site was designed, for the moment, to work with the
Adobe
> "flavour" for XLinks. In time, I would expect the incompatibilities to be
> resolved.

> Constructive feedback is welcome either to this email address or to the
one
> given on the main page of the site.
