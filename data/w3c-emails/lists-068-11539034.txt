Impressive Article by Dr. Zhangxu (China)

Forward by Mike Burks
... Dr Zhangxu's story in an inspiring one, but more importantly it 
emphasizes the need for Universal Accessibility of the Internet and how it 
can help people who might not normally be able to communicate with each 
other for any number of reasons, to work and communicate easily using the 
Internet and Technology In Dr. Zhangxu's case and in the case of many 
people with disabilities this has been brought about by making the Internet 
accessible by the use of various types of assistive technology now 
available. The important thing for everyone to understand is that Universal 
Access is something that is sorely needed in all parts of the world. 
Everyone should have an opportunity to communicate using the Internet and 
Dr. Zhangxu's story is a wonderful example of how this access can help 
people communicate across sometimes otherwise insurmountable barriers. 
People with disabilities may have the most visible barriers but many others 
exist. Universal Access is an achievable goal that everyone should support.

"On the Internet, I am no longer a quadriplegic. With the help of these 
many friends, I am again an orthopedic surgeon, conducting online clinical 
consultations with patients with bone disorders and even helping with the 
Chinese translation of American medical texts." ...
