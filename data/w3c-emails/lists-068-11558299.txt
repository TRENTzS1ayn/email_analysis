Hello all,

I have published an initial draft of a meeting page for the F2F meetings 
1/2 February in Cambridge, MA USA.  It is available at: 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2001/02/f2f-agenda.html

Note that I have added some detail to the agenda based on recent 
discussion. I am not sure what topic to assign to the 1:30 - 3:00 slot on 
Friday.

Comments and ideas welcome,
--wendy
