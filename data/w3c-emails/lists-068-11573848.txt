I have forwarded your question to Doug Wakefield, who is one of the folks
leading up the effort for the Access Board.  I have asked if there has been
consideration for a FAQ page or way to submit questions.  I am seeing many
more questions on 508 and fear folks may be speaking for the Access Board
with having permission or being half right or whatever.  I would rather err
on the side of caution and prefer to have an official opinion rendered from
the Access Board.

We can discuss this but I am not the authority ? the access board is.

Cheers, rob

Hello:

I am wondering if I could get feedback on these issues below:

As far as anyone knows are there any devices, such as PDAs ,Cell phones etc
that are built for people with disabilities?    And, does the section 508
law require mobile devices to comply?
Thanks in advance
