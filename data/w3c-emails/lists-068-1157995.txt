Sean, you do understand what the term "straw man argument" means,
right?

That said, I think it -is- important to note that a good designer
likely _will_ add in as much presentation information as they can.
Can you give a good reason not to?

You realize that nobody's said this besides your imagination.  Sure,

If you saw something that said that, would you be able to understand
it?  I can understand it myself, and people have been understanding
that in print for a long time.  What argument are you trying to
make here?

If you want to present a sarcastic rebuttal, by the way, you should
at least make sure it bears some resemblance to the points you are
trying to rebutt.
