WCAG 1.0 requires <Q> for markup of short quotations.   Here's the requirement:

Mark up quotations. Do not use quotation markup for formatting effects such 
as indentation. [Priority 2] For example, in HTML, use the Q and BLOCKQUOTE 
elements to markup short and longer quotations, respectively.

However, Q is not rendered by MSIE 5, Netscape 4.73, or Opera 3.62 
(although it is rendered in Amaya 4.1 and AOLPress 2.0).  Examples are 
shown in [1].

Lynx renders Q, but it merely turns in into a quotation mark so it doesn't 
matter for Lynx.

So if people follow this guideline then most people using visual browsers 
miss the quotes.  If people redundantly use Q and quotation marks, then 
people using compliant browsers such as Amaya and AOLPress get double 
quotes.  Either way, bad news.

I suggest an erratum that omits Q from this requirement.  Alternatively, 
say that Q is omitted till all browsers render them.   Either of these is 
fine with me, and I hope we can settle this fast.

It seems like a small thing, but strictly speaking it stops good pages from 
getting a double A rating.
