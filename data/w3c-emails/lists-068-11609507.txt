I agree with Len, for the reasons he stated.  The rest of this is
just discussion.

I believe this is a reason why "example" text such as that which
produced this problem should be considered non-normative techniques
instead of strict guidelines; if read this way, the absolute part
is the guideline, before the priority notice, and the e.g. is just
a suggestion.  Even so, this isn't a good suggestion and this
illustrates a point in WCAG 1.0 where the difference between
guideline and example is blurred.  Many people would read that
requirement as "use <Q> even though it introduces problems for
most people".

Question:  Has it -ever- been proven in practice that use of <Q>
increases accessibility for people with disabilities?  Are there
current assistive technologies which recognize and use the <Q>
tag in a meaningful way?
