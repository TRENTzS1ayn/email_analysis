Note that <Q> is not required. It is an example but it does not appear in 
the checklist. I agree that it is a bad example because it is not 
supported. Therefore, I propose that we add an Errata that changes the 
wording of this checkpoint to read,
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><a name="entry-9">9.</a> Correction to example text for checkpoint 3.7
<dd>Added: 15 January 2001
<dd>Type: Clarification
<dd>Refers to: Checkpoint 3.7
<dd>Description.  Checkpoint 3.7 should be reworded to remove the example 
for Q as:
3.7 Mark up quotations. Do not use quotation markup for formatting effects 
such as indentation. [Priority 2] For example, in HTML, use the BLOCKQUOTE 
element to markup quotations.
