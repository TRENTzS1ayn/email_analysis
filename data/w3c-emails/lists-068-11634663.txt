Hmmm, I don't think this does it. Either you use the markup (and Q is part of
the markup) or you don't meet the checkpoint. If we want to have an erratum,
it should be specific: "until user agents support the q element, do not use
it". Which of course brings us to the thorny question (yet again) of how
widely something needs to be supported.

  Note that <Q> is not required. It is an example but it does not appear in
  the checklist. I agree that it is a bad example because it is not
  supported. Therefore, I propose that we add an Errata that changes the
  wording of this checkpoint to read,
  <blockquote>
  <dl>
  <dt><a name="entry-9">9.</a> Correction to example text for checkpoint 3.7
  <dd>Added: 15 January 2001
  <dd>Type: Clarification
  <dd>Refers to: Checkpoint 3.7
  <dd>Description.  Checkpoint 3.7 should be reworded to remove the example
  for Q as:
  3.7 Mark up quotations. Do not use quotation markup for formatting effects
  such as indentation. [Priority 2] For example, in HTML, use the BLOCKQUOTE
  element to markup quotations.
