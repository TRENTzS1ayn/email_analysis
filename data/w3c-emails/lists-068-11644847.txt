Frankly, I view this as a flaw in the specification.  The HTML 4
spec that included <q> was NOT backwards compatible and thus any
implementation will be seriously broken in one of the two ways
that Len described.

So we're not looking at a problem with user agents, we're looking
at a problem with a poorly written spec that doesn't allow for any
sort of transitional implementations.  And that's broken.
