True...but that's not why I wrote any of that...this little point actually
has a purpose (see below)

This is the discussion point I wanted to get to! Can people really
understand <b> etc. if they just looked at it, and if so, what does it
imply? Is <em> any better? Is a stronger semantic framework needed to
describe language?
Does presentational markup carry any semantic meaning, and should plain text
be marked up with presentation/semantics both or neither? These are the
vital points of discussion.

No, not sarcastic at all, because I realise that these aren't the points you
and others are trying to discuss. I raised them in reply to what
Mr.Loguhborough was talking about, as a satirical reply to him (and only
him, although comments such as yours are very welcome). Sarcasm was not
intended at all, it was merely humor to raise further important points,
which I have done.
