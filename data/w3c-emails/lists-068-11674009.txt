I would really like to enlist Al Gilman in crafting the "control" language. 
My goal is to transcend the "user as PWD" aspect and concentrate on the 
"rights" of every user to be, in principle and fact, the ultimate arbiter 
of things controllable. Users and their agents/environments are whom we 
ally with - it will make them better authors!

A (the?) fundamental function/goal/duty of any "performer" is to serve the 
audience.
