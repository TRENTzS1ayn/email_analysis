I have cross posted this from the IG where I had just submitted it.

Doug Wakefield is an Accessibility Specialist at The U.S. Access Board.
With his permission, I am making his reply available on a question posted on
the Interest Group concerning 508 and testing.

"The way the law is written each agency is in charge of their own
compliance. The key is to follow the 508 web standards. If followed, then
liability shouldn't be an issue.  We do recognize that at present a couple
of the standards are difficult to test for, such as the forms requirement.
However most can be examined by simply looking at the code. "

Personally, I would like to ask for comments as I feel the information
exchange can help the WAI and all of us understand the perspectives and
issues.  Also looking for things we are missing in the implementation stage.
May I ask that we maintain a constructive discussion, as we do not want to
get banned <big smile> .

cheers, rob
