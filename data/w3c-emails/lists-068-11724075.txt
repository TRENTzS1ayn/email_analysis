I think the issue with 508 incorporating more or less is not based upon
common sense, rather I am of the opinion it was how much can you chew off
and not overwork the people who have to implement it.  I also think cost was
an issue.  I firmly support the 508 approach.  Lets start small, get buy-in,
educate and then next year implement more.   Lets face it, here is a real
life test case for requirements and implementation and we area part of it as
well as we can listen and learn.

I am pleased, although I daresay that you (as an active member
of the Web Accessibility Initiative and other such projects) are
far from an average test case.

Question to consider:  If we didn't have the artificial divide
of priority 1, priority 2, and priority 3 -- and instead tried to,
I dunno, urge compliance based on common sense -- how many more
checkpoints would there have been included in Section 508 guidelines?

It's my estimation that a "priority 2" checkpoint means a far less
greater chance of someone doing it than priority 1, and giving
something a priority 3 checkpoint is pretty much a death wish for
that checkpoint.  (Interpretation by insiders, such as Bruce, who
understand WCAG on a deeper level than average will of course produce
atypical results.)
