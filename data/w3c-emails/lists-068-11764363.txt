I agree to go with this "until user agents" clause qualifying 
requirement/example/suggestion (whatever it is) for <Q> for WCAG 1.0.

As for WCAG 2.0, I suggest that absence of user agent support is another 
one of those external considerations (a.k.a. "considerations X") that are 
not accessibility per se, like security, intellectual property, or extreme 
difficulty.  So in WCAG 2.0, we on the one hand say that use of Q is needed 
at some priority level for accessibility, but on the other hand allow it to 
not be used because of this external consideration. This would be part of 
the conformance criteria for which Kynn is writing requirements.

Also, regarding the thread about 508 under this subject heading-- I suggest 
moving that discussion to Trace's sec508 email list [1].  I think it was my 
passing reference to 508 in my original email that started that thread and 
I'll be more careful in the future.
