It took me a while to figure out what "in your face" URLs are; if
you are going to use this kind of slang, please explain it up
front?

Why not do it the other way around, and make the "in your face"
URLs something which disappears for "screen" use?

That said, I think that (a) this isn't really an accessibility issue,
at least not as pertains to people with disabilities [hoo boy I
can feel William yelling at me already], (b) the "principle" may be
one that appeals to various sainted personages but I don't see it
as being necessarily carved in stone, and (c) there are a number of
cases besides printing where you might want to reveal a URL, such
as if you expect something to be cut-and-pasted into email frequently
and you don't want to lose specific URL citations.
