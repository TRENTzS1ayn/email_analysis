Quietly. In a previous exchange there was something about a proliferation 
of text in-and-of-itself being a barrier for certain cognitive conditions. 
URIs just flat *look* intimidating to someone who's just reading along.

We are very used to having them in our emails although many (not me) put 
them as footnotes.

KB:: "...various sainted personages ..." is a little extreme so I'll go 
ahead and quote some of the (1991 - 1995!) recommendations that resonate a 
lot with what we've been coming up with, although the Saint wasn't talking 
about the not-yet-existent WAI reasons.

"You should try to:

Sign your work
Give its status
Make links into context .
Use context-free document titles
Format device-independently
Use standard HTML
Use style sheets
Write for the printed work too
Write readable text despite the links
Avoid talking about mechanics"

Not really canonization material since it won't work miracles, but the guy 
had (and still has IMO) some awfully good stuff to say.
