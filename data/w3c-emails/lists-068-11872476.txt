However, I apologise for not making that clearer. One problem with plain
text is that you have to use the space creatively; and that usually
translates as "tersely".

I don't suppose it matters much as long as the "correct presentions are
delivered to the correct people" :-)

Not sure about that: I'm just replying to the basic subject raised on a WAI
list. I'll let William argue about the various philosophies of how much
this relates to PWDs if he wants to :-) I think one general point is
comprehension; if a link is just a URL, it might not give as much
information to the user as a prose title would (i.e. link text). However,
I'm just rambling about a technique for the philosophy, not the philosophy
itself.

About b): idioms are idioms, no matter where they are raised, and how much
(or not) they are set in stone. Oh, and please keep the discussion
technical.

I believe that in these cases it should be possible to use UI specific
functions that allow this (for example, right clicking in IE5 and selecting
"copy shortcut". It would be helpful if you could outline further cases
such as these.
