The same can be said for text used instead of graphics. As Jonathon points
out so often, the perception is that text annt be (easily?) presented in a
different way by someone who can't use the presentation form given. 

Disabled people (not people with cell phones) are being flummoxed by text
not enhanced by illustrations ... the buttons with text are as difficult to
understand by those who can't use the text, as for those who can't enlarge
it sufficiently. Incidently, if graphics were put on all buttons that are
now too small to show the alt tag, the resultant size would probably allow
good usage of that accommodation!
