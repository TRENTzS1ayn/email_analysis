Good point. I wonder if in the future there will be different kinds of
copying mechanisms: copying media and converting it into text form? For
example, if I select a Web page, and copy the text, it should convert the
<img alt=""> to their alt attributes, and <a href=""> to their href
attributes... Maybe AU would be interested in that?

That's always the major reason. Even in 5/10 years time when CSS is more
generally accepted, I don't think there will be many changes. People will
still feel the need to have in-your-face URL's because of the "pre-CSS
browsers"... and that is a problem. If 99% of people haven't got a gimmick
that makes pages more accessible, do you have to provide fallback
mechanisms for those 1%, and cause problems for the 99%? The answer appears
to be yes...

Well, it's a domain name. Yes, they are generally accepted, and most
browsers will take them if you type those in... but what if one didn't? Oh,
and I think you might want the (www.w3.org) after the "W3C" not the "WAI"?

Yes, or as a reference at the foot of the email. Maybe we should have a
techniques document for plain text :-)
