Trying to resolve this thread...

In WCAG 1.0 this relates to checkpoint 13.1 - Clearly identify the target 
of each link. [Priority 2].  Techniques are discussed in the section 6.1 
Link text of the HTML Techniques for WCAG [1]

In WCAG 2.0 this has been wrapped into checkpoint 2.1 Provide consistent 
interaction behaviors and navigation mechanisms.

I think in the techniques we can write more about "consistency" of 
navigation mechanisms (such as links) and one of the recommendations that 
we think should be consistent is only using "in your face URLs" in cases as 
have been described in this thread - in footnotes when the page will be 
printed, when specifically identifying a web site for someone to read 
(again, usually for printing or presentation/discussion purposes), etc.

Therefore, for the time being I propose adding something to section 6.1 of 
the HTML Techniques for WCAG.  This eventually should appear in the Core 
Techniques as it applies across languages - but for something to quickly 
point to and something that 's easy to change how is that for a first stab?
