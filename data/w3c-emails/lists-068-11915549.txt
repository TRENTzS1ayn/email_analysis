Thank you for your comments.

sounds fine to me.

I propose to leave this as is and see what happens at the unified glossary 
meeting.

yes, the working group has resolved to find better wording for several 
reasons but did not have any wording that we felt was sufficient for this 
draft.  We resolved to leave it as is but request feedback in the public 
working draft.

Right - you have to be aware that following the spec does not always 
produce content that "works" because browers have not implemented the specs 
consistently.  also, authors should take into account that newer specs have 
deprecated features of older specs or introduced newer features that did 
not exist in older browers.

This checkpoint does not say that XML must be available without style 
sheets.  That is one very obvious bug in WCAG 1.0 that we are not 
replicating in 2.0.  In the case of XML, the transform requires style 
sheets.  However, if the user's browser does not support XML then we might 
have a problem.

Yes, so do we but we haven't fleshed it out yet.  That's why this is a 
working draft without consensus of the working group rather than a 
recommendation or last call.

sounds good.

yes, that's way out on a limb (i.e., really long) <grin/>
I see your intent here and will discuss with the working group.

There may be some overlap perhaps we can combine. We'll discuss. This may 
not change for this first release though.

Refer to Cynthia's comments on this one.
