That seems to be acceptable. The guidelines *are* already there, but WCAG
2.0 has taken the movement towards tersification, so a great deal of the
interpretation will be done in the techniques documents... (I'm not sure if
that's a good or bad thing, but it seems to be generally agreed upon).
Basically, we are saying that for most media, in-your-face URLs present
accessibility problems, except when a page is a) presented on media that is
independant of the Web, or b) needs possible link context expansion (for
discussion puroses/in streaming media browsers).

O.K. :-)

The core techniques for WCAG 2.0? Seems reasonable. I think this is fairly
HTML specific though: although XLink has xlink:title and so forth to deal
with (may need to issue something about accessibility of XLink).
