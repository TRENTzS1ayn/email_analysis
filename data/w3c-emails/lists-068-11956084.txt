Wendy,

As I considered your addition to techniques, I thought about the web page
that the 2nd graders are now using pretty regularly in the lab
http://www.geocities.com/apembert45 ... some of the links go to old stuff,
and two pages that the students use (Thanksgiving and Halloween) were pages
used in print and just converted to html and hung on the web ... the links
are all "in your face" URL's, and many kids avoid these pages and use only
the newer ones for King and Israel ... (it may be that kids who use the
Internet at home and are used to "clicking on the underlined blue letters"
are more adventuresome) ... Links of one or two words are easier for young
children (perhaps CD and LD folks, even ordinary folks) to navigate ... 

There is an easy "technique" to do it in Front Page, perhaps other
authoring tools - 1) pull up page in Front Page, minimize 2) Pull up IE; 3)
go the the target site; 4) copy address from window; minimize IE; 5) paste
address to desired place in page, press enter; 6) move cursor to somewhere
inside address now in link color and underlined; 7) Insert words for link;
8) delete the original link before and after the inserted words. ....
(Words for link can be the title of the page, the site, or the type of
activity, etc. whatever suits the surrounding page ...)
