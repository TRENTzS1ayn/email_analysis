Persevere!

Although Gregg didn't seem too enchanted with the word, I'd like to 
recommend it quite seriously for a couple of reasons: it expresses what we 
want - for content/semantics/meaning/intent/+ to survive all manner of 
transformation/repurposing/+; it is a word sure to be distinct and not 
carrying much baggage of either technology or particular everyday 
connotations, as "environment" and "graceful transformation" and "data 
model" seem to.

That "content" (or whatever we choose to call the underlying communication 
intended) persevere through being rendered in any language via anything 
from a refreshable braille display to a cell phone screen, in other words 
in a device-independent manner, is what we expect.

Our information should *persevere*.

In this case the fact that we must explain what this means is a "Good 
Thing" because we aren't trying to overcome some already-widely-held notion 
of what the word means in this and other contexts.

Or maybe I'm just too weird for prime time?
