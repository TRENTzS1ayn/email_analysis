Anne,

I have included the AU WG on my response to address the 2nd issue you raise.

My understanding of your message is:
1. in your experience, the children that you work with are less likely to 
follow "in your face" URLs so therefore you support adding something to the 
techniques document.

2. One way that you are able to create text links is using IE and FrontPage 
reader and you've outlined those steps as a proposal to add to our 
techniques document.

3. Another observation you have made is that children and perhaps also 
people with CD and LD find shorter links easier to navigate.

I'll respond to each of these:
1. I'm glad we have some informal data to back up and provide more 
rationale for avoiding "in your face" URLs.

2. Currently, we do not have any techniques that are specific to one 
authoring tool.  People have requested this information but we have not 
provided any yet.  Since these are both Microsoft products, I think it 
would be more appropriate for them to produce something that we could point 
to.  Ideally a document that shows how to work with their tools to follow 
all of the WCAG checkpoints - ala Guideline 6 in the Authoring Tool 
Accessibility Guidelines [1].  What do others think about this?  Does 
Microsoft have documentation online that we can refer to from the 
techniques to help people make the connection between WCAG and the tool 
they are using?  What about other authoring tools?

3.  People in general seem to find shorter links easier to use - assuming a 
link has been given enough context so that it's destination is clear.  User 
Interface Engineering discusses link length in their book "Web Site 
Usability: A Designer's Guide" which is based on a series of usability 
studies.  Jakob Nielsen also discusses link length in his book "Designing 
Web Usability."  Links that are too short can be ambiguous and confusing.
