Before publishing a new working draft I need to add an abstract.  What do 
people think of this:
Abstract
This Working Drafts is the first step towards incorporating feedback 
received on WCAG 1.0 since its publication in May 1999. Primarily, this is 
the first attempt to write checkpoints that may be applied to a wider range 
of languages and that may be understood by a more varied audience.   Since 
this Working Draft builds on WCAG 1.0 it has the same aim: explain how to 
make Web content accessible to people with disabilities.
