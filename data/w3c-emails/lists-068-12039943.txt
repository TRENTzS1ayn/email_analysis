  people think of this:
  Abstract
  This Working Drafts is the first step towards incorporating feedback
  received on WCAG 1.0 since its publication in May 1999. Primarily, this is
  the first attempt to write checkpoints that may be applied to a wider
range
  of languages and that may be understood by a more varied audience.   Since
  this Working Draft builds on WCAG 1.0 it has the same aim: explain how to
  make Web content accessible to people with disabilities.
