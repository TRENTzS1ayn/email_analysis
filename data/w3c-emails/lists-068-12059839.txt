  Good point. I wonder if in the future there will be different kinds of
  copying mechanisms: copying media and converting it into text form? For
  example, if I select a Web page, and copy the text, it should convert the
  <img alt=""> to their alt attributes, and <a href=""> to their href
  attributes... Maybe AU would be interested in that?

CMN: There is an ATAG checkpoint requiring that the copy operation (well
actually all editing operations and conversions) hang on to all the
information...
