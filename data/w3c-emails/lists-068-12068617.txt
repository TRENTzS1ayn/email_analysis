Very nice.

Do we want to say we are trying to make them apply to a wider range of
technologies and understandable too?

Then it might say we are trying to make them apply to a wider range of
technologies and understandable to more varied audiences and in different
languages?

Subject:Proposa for Abstract for WCAG 2.0 working draft

Before publishing a new working draft I need to add an abstract.  What do
people think of this:
Abstract
This Working Drafts is the first step towards incorporating feedback
received on WCAG 1.0 since its publication in May 1999. Primarily, this is
the first attempt to write checkpoints that may be applied to a wider range
of languages and that may be understood by a more varied audience.   Since
this Working Draft builds on WCAG 1.0 it has the same aim: explain how to
make Web content accessible to people with disabilities.
