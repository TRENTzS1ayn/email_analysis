Hello,

The latest working draft is available from: 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20.  If there are no major objections we will 
request this document be published as a public working draft on Tuesday, 23 
January 2001.

I have included the list of changes in this message and they are also 
available at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/change-history.html

I have also updated the checkpoint mapping: 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/2001/01/20-mapping.html

List of changes to this draft. These edits are the result of discussion at 
the 18 January 2001 telecon:
?       Edited Guideline 1 based on Ian's suggestion.
?       Edited text immediately following Guideline 1.
?       Edited Checkpoint 1.7 to replace the phrase "transform gracefully."
?       Edited Guideline 2 per Ian's suggestion.
?       Edited Checkpoint 2.2 - replaced use of word "focus". Also edited 
supplementary text.
?       Added an Abstract.
?       Deleted the WAI logo (no W3C working draft includes the domain logo 
at the top).
?       Brought the copyright up front.
?       Added Appendix B: Contributors.
?       Edited the "Priorities and techniques" section per Judy's suggestions.
?       Made sure the following phrases were used and capitalized 
consistently throughout the document: Working Group and Working Draft.
?       Updated the checkpoint mapping.
?       Moved the icon from checkpoint 1.1 to checkpoint 3.4 and use it as 
an example.
?       Edited the first sentence of the Introduction to make clear that 
the draft's purpose is for feedback rather than internal discussion by the 
Working Group.
