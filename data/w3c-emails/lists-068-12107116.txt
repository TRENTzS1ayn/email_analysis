how about,

<start rewrite>
Since the intial release of the WCAG 1.0 in May 1999, a wide audience has
had the opportunity to review and implement the checkpoints. Therefore a
working draft of the next version has been intiated with the goal to
incorporate comments and to address implementation, additional languages so
a wider audience may more easily understand the checkpoints.  This Working
Daft will also reduce the time and costs to review, understand and implement
the checkpoints. As this Working Draft builds upon the WCAG 1.0, the
objective has not changed and that is to 'explain how to make Web content
accessible to people with disabilities and a wider audience through
guidelines.'
<end rewrite>
