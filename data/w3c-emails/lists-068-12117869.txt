The first couple of sentences are good, but I would put them in the status
section. The abstract just describes the content of the document, as I
understand it.

I would be less certain about whether this will reduce the cost and time, and
particularly the cost. It might be smart to explain that is a goal, in
status. (And I like the idea of a Working Daft - a typo in that sentence
<grin/>).

Cheers

  Since the intial release of the WCAG 1.0 in May 1999, a wide audience has
  had the opportunity to review and implement the checkpoints. Therefore a
  working draft of the next version has been intiated with the goal to
  incorporate comments and to address implementation, additional languages so
  a wider audience may more easily understand the checkpoints.  This Working
  Daft will also reduce the time and costs to review, understand and implement
  the checkpoints. As this Working Draft builds upon the WCAG 1.0, the
  objective has not changed and that is to 'explain how to make Web content
  accessible to people with disabilities and a wider audience through
  guidelines.'
