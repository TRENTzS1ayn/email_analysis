Sorry William, and thanks Kynn,
WAI desperately needs to shelve a few programmers, and buy in artists.
The problem I believe is finding a house style.

I have suggested (and been rudely rebuffed) that wai institute a world-wide
competition to design and make, an interactive puff to graphically
demonstrate wai work.
This could involve film, animation, streaming, text, links, and
accessibility.
This is amazing as no one is committed to accepting entries.
Companies involved would learn about the meaning of accessibility.
Are we certain there would be no interest, a large web design corporation I
had a meeting with expressed a very positive interest in accessibility.

It's not just the suitability, its setting an example.
if government is to make itself accessible, its important to indicate the
way that graphics might be used.
e.g. photographs to illustrate the case studies being written up at eowg,
"disabled use of the web".
All sighted readers benefit from being able to identify.
(TV has transformed politics, Stephen hawking is a popular myth because we
have 'all' seen him.)

If we wish to advocate the translation across media, it is very important
that we make the attempt ourselves.
Does the alt tag "Mona Lisa" represent the painting?
many artists choose not to name their work.
Its a strange ethos that says that everything translates to text, and text
has no need of other media. Why then are we not all authors including
dramatists, musicians...
wai needs to include examples of good practice, otherwise how else do others
recognise their usage.

By seeing one of my clients using http://www.peepo.com to find the music he
or she wants to listen to, you immediately realise the validity of this
approach.
Once I have speech to text software, that works reasonably well, and is
probably 'free' you'll be hearing from my clients as well, though you may
not realise their speech impediments.
They actually benefit from the reward of a graphical stimulation, that tells
them that they have spelt a word right.
