I agree with Cynthia. As I recall, this checkpoint is aimed very squarely at
content that is creating an interface - for example a form, but also more
complex applications.

(If it isn't, we need one there that is.)

In terms of techniques, the whole of the User Agent Guidelines is useful as a
reference (some parts more so than others perhaps)...

cheers

  6) Checkpoint 4.3: "Design assistive-technology compatible

     "Designing interfaces" sounds like this is for user
     agent developers. Should this be "use interfaces" like
     checkpoint 4.2 says "use languages, APIs, and protocols"?

  CS:
  We've had a lot of discussion in the WG about not assuming that web sites
  are documents. IMHO, one of the major flaws with WCAG 1.0 is treatment of
  everything in the browser window as a "document".  Take something like
  Amazon.com or EBay as an example:  these are applications with user
  interfaces that reside in the browser.  The people who build these things
  are designing interfaces, not writing papers, and need our guidance to
  design them in an accessible way.
