I only half agree with William -- I can definitely see where he is
coming from on this and agree that whatever we produce, we will be
unable to please -everyone-.

However, I also do think that if we design a structure rather than
a building, we can produce something which is adaptable, non-rigid
and yet rigorous, which can be used in a variety of situations to
increase accessibility of web sites.

My ideal WCAG 2.0 would be something akin to XHTML modularization,
allowing each developer to build their own accessibility plan.  I
am not convinced I'll see this happen, however.

Maybe we need to do WCAG 1.5 (or 1.1) before we do WCAG 2.0 --
updating and correcting any WCAG 1.0 problems before attempting to
do complete structural overhauls and philosophical shifts.  While
I might disagree with the basic premise of continued XHTML
development, their game plan for spec development was sound, as
they did not try to do three things at once, just one per spec
release (convert to XML format; divide into modules; and only THEN
start considering throwing out elements/adding new functionality).
