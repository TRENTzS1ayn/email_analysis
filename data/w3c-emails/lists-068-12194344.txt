All content "creates an interface".  When you create a web page, you are
creating a user interface, even if that is simply "one left mostly
undefined except for the browser's defaults."

This is a principle I so very much wish I could impress upon web
designers, who don't view web design as UI design.  Any time you create
a web document or application, you are building -some- kind of
interface for users, be that an interface to information or to
program functionality.
