Very true indeed; I'd like to see it as an ontological hierarchy (e.g. a
tree) rather than a list (of points). But of course, ultimately, WCAG 2.0
would be a Web - a modularized Web. Look at CSS3: that is now
modularized...XHTML did it a long time ago. Modularization is the way
forward I think, and neither lists or similar hierarchies are as
expressive.

So what then? Well, I think Kynn's gedankenexperiment of having a WCAG 1.5
was a highly valid one. Clear up WCAG, and then express it better... but I
feel that the fight is lost and that we should have been discussing this a
long time ago. I did propose that WCAG 2.0 be a Web of accessibility points
before, but was strangely ignored... maybe I didn't set out a clear enough
goal...

Time to start work on WCAG 3.0 then? :-)
