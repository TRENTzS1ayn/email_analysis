I still didn't set out a clear enough goal.

I envisage WCAG Kynn:2.0, SBP:3.0 being split up into sections (call them
modules ala Kynn). The "front page" would rant on about the Web being
accessible to all people: the basic fundamental rule (guideline). Then, it
would link to the "minor modules", the guidelines themselves as generic
rules - split up into their own pages (under the sets of "Interoperability"
and "Comprehensibility"). They would then be interlinked showing their
dependencies and interrelations (ontologies).
Very intertwingled (er... imperfect synonym: holistic).
