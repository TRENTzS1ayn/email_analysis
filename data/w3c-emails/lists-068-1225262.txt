I sure am. I notice that Mr.Loughborough tends to move quesitons towards
philisophical arguements, whih is great. I thought he might enjoy a little
satire based on some of his opinions, and I'm sure he got the message (I'm
also sure if he had written it it would have been a logarithmic order of
magnitude better than my efforts).
Things like "language doesn't have meaning, it's just art" do have good
satirical value: it can easily be argued that language is an art form, but
the stire comes from the fact that the art aspect is not in replacement to
the meaning side - whereas in "pure" art it often is. If you read what I
have written quite carefully, it can be construed as being quite funny.

Exactly my point.

Not really, it isn't very future proof so it is a very good example. We are
always looking for forwards compatability because it is a founding principle
of the Web: it's why it still exists.

The problem is that you have used an unnesesary hyperbole there: in reality
on the Web 5 years is well out of date.

No the Seamntic Web is something different altogether. I'm a bit of a rogue
in the sense that I believe if there is going to be an output media for the
SW, then it may as well be Semantic itself. There are lots of different ways
of tying that all up...have you seen my XHTML to RDF deeley:

I'm sure they'll get upset if their mobile devices don't apply style
correctly. The WAP world is already complaining about the complexity handed
down from HTML and CSS.

My point is that Web trends and accessibility are intrinsically linked. The
fact is that the Web is becoming more accessible by design, and I won't let
anything get in the way of that if I can help it.
