I think the main problem is that we can only look at how many rotary dial 
phones are in use, learn that it is less than the number of cell phones 
thrown into the dumpster on the TV ad and conclude that obsolescence will 
run past us before we can collate the survey. The Web's the thing and the 
underlayment recedes in importance with each passing moment.

IE X.x 2000 vs. BrowseKing 3.0 2005 will be upon us and the latest 
BrowseKing will handle all of that, come on a chip in the phone line and...

At the properly chosen level of abstraction we can continue to state 
principles like that one shouldn't place an obstacle to repurposing by
