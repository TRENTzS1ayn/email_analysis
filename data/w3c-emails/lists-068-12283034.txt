Kynn,

If it came to a vote, I would go with 4 Guidelines ... per William's site
....

Linked to each guidelines, which could each have a long description, up to
seven checkpoints, and each checkpoint can have up to seven techniques, but
the opening number is nicer at four.... interoperability/attachments
(specific technologies), navigability, comprehensibility, and (whatever
I've overlooked!) ...

Why? Perhaps because when you are lecturing, you can hold up four fingers
and still sip on your coffee ... !! 

Anne
