Hi Al
    Thanks for the reply.
     It's interesting to compare the various solutions suggested.
     I suggested an application solution (storing an email address in a
Web-based HTML validator)
     Al, being a protocol guy, suggested use of a standard header, based on
an established email header.
     Charles, being a metadata guy, suggested use of structured metadata - I
assume this is to be able to differentiate between the author of the content
and the person who marked up the document (George W Bush may have wrote his
speech, but I guess he's not responsible for any HTML errors in the HTML
version).
    Mine is an application solution.  The information is not reusable, but
it should not require significant work to be implemented.
    Al's is better, allowing the information to be used by any application.
    Charles's is even richer, but possibly time-consuming to reach consensus
(do we need to provide metadata on the person who wrote the style sheet,
JavaScript, original XML DTD, XSLT transformation, etc.)
    Note that one objection to Al's and Charles's solution is that embedding
email information in the document will allow it to be stolen by spammers.
