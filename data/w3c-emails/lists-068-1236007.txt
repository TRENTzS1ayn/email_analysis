Well, from my point of view the WAP world isn't "the web". The instrument
can access a very small part of the web, and lacks "accessibility" to those
with limited vision and those who need help with text. Don't know that you
can use a speech reader (or similar) device with WAP.

"Accessible by design" for whom? Are there any features of your vision of
the "accessible web" that are useful or beneficial for the non-text people?

"pure art" in text, e.g. poetry, has meaning.
