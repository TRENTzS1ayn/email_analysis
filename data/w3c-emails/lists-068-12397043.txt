Despite some of the reactions about the stats collection that I posted the 
other day [1], I'm still curious and will continue to add to it.
<humor><img src="wendy.jpg" alt="wendy gives everyone the raspberries"></humor>

Today's addition:  results of a bot that crawled the sites on the Media 
Metrix Top 500 site last summer to determine which technologies they 
employed.  Results are:
79.9% of the sites use Tables
62.0% use JavaScript
38.2% use Imagemaps
20.6% use Style sheets
2.1% use ActiveX
1.1% use Java

That's likely a lot of tables used for positioning.

This data is from The Client-Side Conundrum by Ray Valdes (August 2000, Web 
Techniques)

BTW - Currently, the browser usage and demographic stats that are listed in 
my collection are only for desktop users with some info on WebTV users, I'm 
anxious to collect info about mobile devices.

FYI - I'm not actively pursuing this info but keep running into it and 
decided to document what I've run into - lest you worry that this exercise 
draws from my attention to the WCAG 2.0 work (although I think it's related).

Thank you all and be well,
