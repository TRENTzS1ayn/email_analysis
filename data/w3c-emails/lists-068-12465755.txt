Bravo!

It is a bit like making our assumtion list, and linking these ussumtions to
our checkpoints (wich assumtions are relevent to wich checkpiont). Wendy
pointed out that we need to specifie our assumtions anyway.

Futher we should note that by global stardardes, both Spain and Israel have
relivltivy high standards of living (both rated between 15  20 top
contries). No were near the US, but still high. (I belive Riussue is rated
in the late  thirties.)  That impies that global baseline critiera, may well
be almost non exixtent.

However baseline cfrytieria are truely site specific. Information sites can
be made to conform to global crytiera, However a Minosate law firm, need not
worry about about global criteria. A federal or US GOV site, also can afford
some leniency. On the other hand, one of the most gratifying part of working
with special need, was providing on line support to parents of LD children
in rural India, were the school teacher had not heard of any forms of LD. It
would have been a shame to have lost that opportunity by inappropriate site
design.

Perhaps it should help to see our job as to provide the information. Let us
worry less about how to legislate its implementation. We can provide the
information, so that web designers legislators and others can make informed
discussion.

It would seem that conformance is a multi dimensional concept. With issues
like user groups, extent of ease of access and baselines all existing in
separate planes. We could have fun with the implication of this, by
attributing to each checkpoint relative x,y,z functions (Kynn, Sean -
something you would like to do one night when you can not sleep) so that
people can select their criteria, and get their relative guidelines, or
conformance level ;) May be not.

But still calling it like it is is a good direction to take.

Lisa
