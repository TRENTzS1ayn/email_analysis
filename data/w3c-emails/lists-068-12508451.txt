It was mentioned on the call that the need for contrast in presentation for the sake of color blind was no longer necessary. This was because:

a) We have facilitated this because in separating content and presentation
b) There is no way to describe what does and does not work for the color blind. There is to much variation.

Although (a) is probably true, it does make accessibility difficult for the color blind (my opinion) and so we are left with (b) . I feel we need to gather information on this. So...

Can people please send info about what contrasts (if any) work for color blind people as a group.

Thanks,
Lisa
