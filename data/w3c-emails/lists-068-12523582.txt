Jason,

Very nice beginning to the introduction! This would not be an introduction
for the "general public" of course, but only to those familiar with the
terms and meanings within.

     One glaring omission: in #4, insert "television" between computer and
telephone. 

Another suggestion: Combine 1, 2, and 3, and add at the end of 3, add the
definiton for proxy server now in 6b.
