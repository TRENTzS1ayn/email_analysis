I think this is a flawed concept. "color blind" is a "condition" along a 
continuum, much like "tone deaf".

Some people are so jarred by certain color combinations that they simply 
will not (cannot?) use a site built using them. For them this is just as 
big a problem as it is for a person who *must* use that same color 
combination (contrast, whatever) to even perceive it.

There is no objectifiable means of ascertaining what constitutes "good" in 
this area (contrast, color) and demanding user (through her agent) control 
is not only necessary, but also sufficient.

What we tell the author to do/not is immaterial/vain/ill-advised. The 
emphasis in the guidelines must be on choice/control by/for the user. The 
"content" in this case transcends its medium and in the instant case, 
bypasses it from the author's viewpoint.

My proposal is that since we cannot reliably advise authors as to the 
effectiveness/usefulness of particular display parameters that we, while 
pointing out the potential problems for certain viewers, we remain silent 
at the guideline/checkpoint level in this regard. It's like dietary laws 
-  it all depends on the eater's biochemistry, not on the chef's instructions.
