First, I hope we are going to see text versions of the drasts for
various reasons?
second, for me, the internal links do not work.  I am using jfw 3.7
and ie 5.5 and when I click on one of them, often, I remain where I am
on the page instead of being taken to the appropriate section.
I'll have more substantive input later.
Thanks!
