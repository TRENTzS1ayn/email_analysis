functionality, infrastructure, software and hardware.
2.Define deliverables for example, functional specification, test
requirements, quality assurance requirements, change request process
3.Define configuration management and file release process
4.either make a make a separate bullet for quality assurance or add a slash

accessibility can be incorporated into this process.
Try to imagine this as a flow diagram. Please add omissions comments.....
