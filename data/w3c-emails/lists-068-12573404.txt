It appears the comma tool still works to produce text dumps from anything on
the W3C.

One can get a text version just by adding the character 'comma' and then the
string 'text' to the tail end of the URL for which you want a text dump.

The failure to follow internal links may, in this early draft, indicate broken
links.? Can you point us at one of the links where this happens?
