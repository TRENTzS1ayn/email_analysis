Best advice we have come up with is to try to view the image in black and
white and look for good foreground background contrast

Contrast ratios don?t seem to work    (if you use  figure-background levels
of    1 and 10 luminance (out of a hundred) you get a 10 to 1 ratio but it
is basically black on black and unreadable.    But  10 and 100 is extremely
readable (also 10 to 1).

So I haven?t heard any better advice.

Love to hear any so keep me posted if you get some.

Subject: Contrast

It was mentioned on the call that the need for contrast in presentation for
the sake of color blind was no longer necessary. This was because:

a) We have facilitated this because in separating content and presentation
b) There is no way to describe what does and does not work for the color
blind. There is to much variation.

Although (a) is probably true, it does make accessibility difficult for the
color blind (my opinion) and so we are left with (b) . I feel we need to
gather information on this. So...

Can people please send info about what contrasts (if any) work for color
blind people as a group.

Thanks,
Lisa
