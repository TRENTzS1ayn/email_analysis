I took an action item to send some pointers to resources on colorblindness.

Some of the resources below do in fact indicate what kind of combinations
can often cause problems, and I think it would be appropriate for us to
include those in techniques. I do not think we should *recommend* color
schemes, especially in a checkpoint.

Avoid Problematic Color Combinations 
Summary: Avoid using colors that commonly cause problems for people with
color vision anomalies.

There are a number of things that can be done to allow even individuals with
color vision anomalies to be able to take advantage of the color-coded
information: 
-- Avoid using common pairs of colors that are indistinguishable by people
with color perception anomalies. For example, avoid mixing green and blue,
or red and green, red and brown, or white and light green.
-- Use colors that differ significantly in hues and intensity
-- Avoid muted colors with low luminance values (intensity).

Hi Gayna.

Seeing as how the home page supports color schemes, I
thought it would be a good idea to explore high contrast ones that would
liven things up for color blind users.  Do you have any data on what color
combos/hues work well for this?

Thanks!
