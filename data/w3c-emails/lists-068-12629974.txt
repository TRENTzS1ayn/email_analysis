William, were do you get this info from?

Dyslexia can also be looked at as a continuum in literary ability, However
when you plot a Gaussian distribution of reading skills you get a "hump"
between -2 and -3 on a normalized scale. That hump is coursed from LD. As
you are no doubt aware by now, there are things that you can do to help
people with LD access a web site. There are people (less) who have a low
reading ability because of low intelligence and normal  variation. They will
find the support given to people with LD, less helpful.

I assume that the same thing is true for color blind people. in contrast to
the gaussian distribution for "color awareness" there does seem to be a
second peck at what we call "color blind" and there may be things we can do
to help.

Lisa
