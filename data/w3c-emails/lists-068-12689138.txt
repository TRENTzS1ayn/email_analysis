The "we" in that are the authors, more so than the guideline fabricators.

The job of particularizing what presentational factors are to be considered 
- and how - is not a guideline/checkpoint issue, IMO.

Although it must be pointed out that presentation must be: 1) semantically 
communicated; 2) considerate of device/user 
capabilities/needs/traditions/+, it need not concern us that "However when 
you plot a Gaussian distribution of reading skills you get a "hump" between 
-2 and -3 on a normalized scale. That hump is coursed from LD" - by which I 
mean that although as human beings we are "concerned", it should inform, 
but not necessarily appear in, the guidelines/checkpoints.

Our real attention should be on assuring that presentational communication 
is revealed semantically, while noting that there are myriad problems with 
the methods we've all come to know/love/"intuit"/use.
