Like an overview of the kinds of problems associated with a particular 
condition, in this case a condition within a user, rather than a "device". 
It is further fodder for the "tease out the content from the presentation" 
fire. If there's a checkpoint here it's like "Get over thinking that 
color/contrast issues don't contain semantic elements."

This time I'll just quote the previously distributed .wav file: "If you 
write what you mean rather than what you want done with it, it can be 
repurposed so much better."
