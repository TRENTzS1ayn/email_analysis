It would be nice if people thought about what their color schemes mean. The
other side of the coin is that if their color schemes have no thought
behind them at all (rare), then they can't be repurposed. But then that's
just bad design, and not really accessibility. The point is that there are
some things with semantics that it is hard to express in a device
independant way... I suppose a technique would be to fully describe a color
scheme with a title on a style sheet link. Maybe PF could ask for a
longdesc in there somewhere :-)
