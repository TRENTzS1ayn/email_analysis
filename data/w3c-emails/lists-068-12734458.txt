I agree with Dick that recommending colour schemes in a checkpoint is a bad
idea. But I think it might be helpful if there are techniques that can
provide a few choices of three, four or five different colours that are
generally OK used together, or an algorithm for determining this. (There is
actually a tool out there that will do a colour-blindnes simulation, but that
doesn't help if you are colour-blind).

  I took an action item to send some pointers to resources on colorblindness.

  Some of the resources below do in fact indicate what kind of combinations
  can often cause problems, and I think it would be appropriate for us to
  include those in techniques. I do not think we should *recommend* color
  schemes, especially in a checkpoint.

  Avoid Problematic Color Combinations

  Summary: Avoid using colors that commonly cause problems for people with
  color vision anomalies.

  There are a number of things that can be done to allow even individuals with
  color vision anomalies to be able to take advantage of the color-coded
  information:

  -- Avoid using common pairs of colors that are indistinguishable by people
  with color perception anomalies. For example, avoid mixing green and blue,
  or red and green, red and brown, or white and light green.

  -- Use colors that differ significantly in hues and intensity

  -- Avoid muted colors with low luminance values (intensity).
