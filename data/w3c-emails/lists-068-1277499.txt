I agree. Feel free to blame me, it was a stupid point to bring up anyway. At
least I learned a valuable lesson...

This (from Kynn) is great:-

So, in summary WCAG are worthless dogmatic fascist rules imposed by an elite
few...I'm not even going to dignify that with a response other than "Kynn,
what on earth are you doing in this group then? Are you trying to break down
the walls of the elite few and get rid of this dogmatic fascism that you
talk about?"

This is the best bit:-

Kynn, you're a member of the PF Group...tell the HTML WG that! Get them to
make XHTML usable.

Yes, and that's how the WCAG rules came about. Hardly fascist is it?

Please feel free to moan at me in the Telecon for bringing these points up
(actually, I might not be able to make it anyway).
