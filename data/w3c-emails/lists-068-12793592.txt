Because, historically, it was a tool that the team developed for ourselves as
a convenience. (We have a handful of "comma tools - ,validate is another that
works like this, and you guessed right, it runs the page through the W3C
validator). It is a very simplistic approach - it just gives a Lynx text dump
if I recall correctly.

But if people are fascinated by the tools, I can look into making more
information about htem and how they work more easily available. I would
suggest that this thread be carried on in the site-comments list though...

cheers

  How arcane!  Do you have any idea why this is not documented in
  any easy-to-find location?
