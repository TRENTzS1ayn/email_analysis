Lets see,
if we were to write "testing" and include in parenthesis "can include: , QA,
project managers, usability consultants, automated done on four staging

Well - everyone does testing (or at least pretend they do) so that is not
intimidating, no one will be put off by by a "can include " thing

keep the terms general, detail by the side.
Just like WCAG 2
