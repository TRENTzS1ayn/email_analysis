Checkpoints 3.4 and 3.9 seem to me redundant with checkpoints 2.1 and 2.3 so
I propose we delete them.

The details...

3.4 provides for labelling (in markup) important pieces of content. I think
that this is the major focus of 2.3, and more properly belongs there.

3.9 provides for labelling abbreviations and acronyms - this is a special
case of that, and should become a technique.

Cheers

Charles
