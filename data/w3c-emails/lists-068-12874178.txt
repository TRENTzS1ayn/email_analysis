The Web's the thing and the underlayment recedes in importance with each passing moment.

Do you think it is, therefore, unsolvable?

Because we, the experts on accessibility, many of us full time "web
gods" in the eyes of the average user, can't figure it out -- what hope
do they have?

If we can't even collate a survey with the W3C's resources, knowledge,
and influence, how on earth can the typical corporate web monkey hope
to make the decisions -themselves-, which is what the current "until
user agents" phrasing demands?

I think we have to do -something-, clearly, and I think that 
"something" consists of either making the decision for the WCAG
reader or giving them enough information to make the decision
themselves.  The burden has to be on -us-, not on -them-.

Maybe it -is- insoluble.  In which case we need to work around the
problem in some way.  I don't know what that is.  Does anyone?
