If we are to perform radical surgery on the 3.x checkpoints we need to look 
at more than those two. E.g. "3.5  Place distinguishing information at the 
beginning of headings..." is arguably a "technique" as are some of the 
others. The thrust of guideline 2 is "structure" and of 3 "content" - I think?

We seem to be challenged as to the viability of the concepts 
structure/content/presentation and whether their separation should form 
such a basic position in our guidelines. I remain persuaded that this 
concept is central and think a fourth (called "action" or something to 
denote "programmatic" and "interactive" elements) that involves scripts, 
applets ("objects"?) might fill the dance card.

To that end we might (briefly?) discuss the possible separation of 
checkpoints dealing with each of those "elelments" so that, e.g. GL2 groups 
how to deal with structure, GL3 with content, GL4 with presentation, and 
perhaps one for "objects"? Just a random barb to scratch on at 6 AM in the 
Washington Wilderness!
