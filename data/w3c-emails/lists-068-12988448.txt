Pierre,

The WCAG WG home page [1] is not available in French, but we have French 
translations of some of our materials [2].  Braille Net contributes to the 
WAI work (particularly education and outreach) and I may have some more 
information that you find helpful [3].

I have included Daniel Dardailler in my reply since he is our Technical 
Manager located in France who may be able to help with further questions 
and resources.
