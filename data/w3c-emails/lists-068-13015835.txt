Thursday, 8 February, 2100 UTC (4 PM US Eastern, 10 PM France, 8 AM
Eastern Australia) on the W3C/MIT Longfellow bridge: +1-617-252-1038:

The main purpose of this meeting is to start discussing and developing
techniques relative to the version 2.0 guidelines.The latest list of
technology-specific requirements is at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/gl/WCAG20/checkpoints.html(currently this is the 23
August 2000 version, but will soon be updated with proposals from Wendy).

If time permits, we may also devote further consideration to the issue of
identifying the checkpoints and techniques in respect of which the issue
of user agent capabilities arises.
