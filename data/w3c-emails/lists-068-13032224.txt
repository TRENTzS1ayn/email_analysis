Last November we pulled together examples of technology-specific 
checkpoints for CSS, HTML, XHTML, SMIL, and XML [1].  Today I went to 
update it to reflect changes in WCAG 2.0 and realized that many of the 
checkpoints were not stated as checkpoints.

In this new draft [2], I have borrowed heavily from the Techniques For 
Accessibility Evaluation And Repair Tools (AERT) public working draft.  I 
have only included a few checkpoints for HTML and only for checkpoint 1.1.

Hopefully, these two drafts can aid Thursday's discussion on 
technology-specifics.
