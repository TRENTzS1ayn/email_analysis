I agree with Kynn.  WAI needs to broaden participation in not just WCAG, 
but all working groups.  Somehow we need to get other people interested and 
I will raise this with coordination group.  I think one of the keys for 
this to happen is everybody must be a good listener to hear other people's 
point of view and then help developers find the means that accessibility 
can be come apart of their thinking, rather than alienating some developers.
