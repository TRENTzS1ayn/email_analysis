Well, we all know what Gregg is in the market for!

I've seen similar "kewl" where the mouse cursor is trailed by a stream of
hearts or clover leafs or where the web page ripples like water as the mouse
is moved over it.  I didn't think it was a real accessibility issue -- since
we are just talking eye candy.

As I understand it, these tricks take advantage of the IE DOM.  Here's a
couple of links that explain the technique:

On a related note, did we come up with a consensus on graphics-only
mouse-over pop-ups?

Thanks,
