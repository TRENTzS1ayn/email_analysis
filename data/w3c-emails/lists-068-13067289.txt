This is an excellent start. Suggestions:

1. Merge XHTML into the HTML requirement list (only treat it separately
where issues of modularization are relevant).

2. Checkpoint 1.1 does not, in my opinion, apply to CSS. To what extent
should CSS be treated separately from HTML/XML?

3. We should think of a better term than "technology-specific checkpoint",
not only is this a cumbersome term but it invites confusion with the
checkpoints in the guidelines. I would propose instead to call them
"techniques", defined as follows:

A technique is a concise statement of an implementation strategy which
satisfies one or more checkpoints. Often, techniques are specific to a
given web-related technology.

In the actual document, techniques would be sharply distinguished from the
following:

a. Code examples.

b. Discussion.

The existing structure of the Techniques document would be
maintained--that is, there would continue to exist a set of core
techniques, together with technology-specific techniques for (X)HTML, CSS,
SVG, SMIL, client-side programming (i.e. scripts), etc.
