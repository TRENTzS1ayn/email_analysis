RE: Action Item from Feb 8 meeting.
Reasonably formal testing procedures imply reasonably formal recording of
results.
So ...
To provide ease of access and consistency in results we should have standard
skeleton web pages that the usual 'code snippets' can be pasted into for
testing.
Archiving those pages with notes appended on how the code performs, or
doesn't, in particular platform/browser/access technology combinations would
then provide a ready reference for those "how does that work with X"
questions.
A record of how particular code snippets perform would also aid designers in
making choices about how far to go with backward compatibility and answering
for themselves the "When user agents have" question.
Some possible advantages:
1) a nice place to test the capabilities of new things
2) might encourage people outside the usual working group to contribute,
providing information on different access tools
3) it might help put to rest some of the never ending questions about things
like, title,abbr,acronym .....
Some possible disadvantages:
1) Somebody would have to maintain it, adding comments etc.
2)

Comments? Suggestions? Sticks and Stones?
