Marti,

       I've re-read Guidelines 1, at least on draft 21, which I have
attached below, and I don't see a place to insert what you are suggesting. 

I think this issue can be fully covered in the techniques, on how to do
text equivalents for images. Techniques to use when an image is an
illustrations, techniques to use when an image is navigational and
techniques to use when the image is both, or even something else we haven't
envisioned yet. 

After I wrote yesterday, I thought about the situation, and when you link
from a small image to the full sized image, the full sized image comes in
alone, not as part of a page so cannot have an alt tag or long description.
All text equivalents need to be on the page with the small image, or they
won't exist. 

I still feel that guidelines 1 should somehow say that the visual
presentation must include illustrations , a minimum of one per page ... 

Perhaps Guideline1  could say: "Design content that be presented visually
(images and text), auditorily, or tactually, according to the needs and
perferences of the user." 

But I aggree the parentheses is a clumsy way to insert this important point.

Anne
