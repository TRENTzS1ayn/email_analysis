Anne,
 The specific place I was looking to add something like that was on
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/checkpoints.html
I think you will see that it does fit there.  This is also probably a good
place to note something about illustrations.
As for the link to a larger image being an isolated image, that kind of
thing is author's choice - The link can be simply defined as an image file
or it can be a page that includes the image. I suspect that linking to just
an image file would violate a few other guidelines/checkpoints in most
cases.
Marti
