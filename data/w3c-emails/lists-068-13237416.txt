Anne,
 I am not sure I understand what you are asking about here? If you mean the
link directly to an image file that I said could be a violation, I think you
answered the question yourself, there is no way to attach alt or longdesc
information if you do that. On the other hand, you can wrap some very simple
html arond it and allow the alt information.
In a way, linking directly to an image file is like linking to a PDF
document which has been created as just an image.
Marti
