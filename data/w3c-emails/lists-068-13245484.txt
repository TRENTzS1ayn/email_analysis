I signed up to help with server-side scripting and XHTML.  Not sure if that
was captured anywhere, though.

Noting that the list I prepared of authors of techniques is a bit scrappy,
here is a compilation of the posts that are uncertain, or need to be
confirmed. Although most of the techniques have multiple editors (i.e. it
doesn't matter if one drops out), the following have shaky positions:-

>    HTML: Kynn (not confirmed)

Kynn, are you working on techniques for 4.01-3.2? You suggested it, and I
volunteered you automatically, but you didn't actually say anything...

>     Server Side Scripting: Cynthia (not confirmed)

Somebody said that Cynthia would want to work on this, but I don't think
she confimed that.

>     XHTML m12n (?/Sean)
>     CSS Styling for XML (?/Sean)

Is anyone going to work with me on these? [Actually, I note that techniques
for XHTML m12n would be a directly governed by XMLGL, because m12n involves
creating an XML language, albeit with respect to XHTML... which is very
interesting.] CSS styling for XML will probably just be a cut down version
of CSS for HTML, with the features generalized, and with more CSS3-type
tips.
