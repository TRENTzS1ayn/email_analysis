Sure you could use longdesc for that. Or you could embed SVG directly - it
can be done to transform reasonably nicely and include a link to the image
for a browser only capable of handling it via a plugin/helper, like IE and
Lynx.

It is an open issue I think whether it is good to use longdesc for something
that isn't HTML as a tatrget.

There has already been work done on this - RDFViz, the  text-only SVG browser
written last year, etc.

  be brilliant. Could you use longdesc for that, and then embed the SVG into
  the longdesc page?
