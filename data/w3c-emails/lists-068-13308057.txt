Thanks, Charlie,

I thought it made more sense to put the text equivalent on the page not on
the picture itself, since there is no reason for someone who cannot see it
anyway to have to download it to get the alt text. 

I looked over the information you sent on embedding information in a
graphic, but the sites were long on words and short on examples. The one
example I found let me view the picture, but I had to download the
explanatory data and when I tried, I didn't have the plug in needed to use
it. Sigh! I will be good when it's ready, but it's not for prime time yet!
