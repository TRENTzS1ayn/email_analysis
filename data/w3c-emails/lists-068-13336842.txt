I traced Nick's complaint about Bobby regarding the overlapping text in a 
table,  to a table rendering bug in the major browsers.  I posted a  test 
page showing the bug to the IG list, where Nick's message was 
cross-posted.  You can pick up the thread at [1].

To avoid duplication, please continue the discussion of that bug on the IG 
list, since it doesn't seem to be an er issue.

I've copied this note to GL for consideration in the techniques doc.  But 
again, I'd suggest letting the tread run its course (if any, you never 
know) on IG instead of duplicating it on GL.
