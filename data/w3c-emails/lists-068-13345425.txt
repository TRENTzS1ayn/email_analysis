Guys and Gals,

Please don't fault Doug for the loopholes and missing pieces, as we all
know, new issues are developing every day, as well as the fact that this is
one complicated mess of differing technologies coming together.  And, every
group writing standards do not necessarily have the luxury of having the
finest technological minds available for each and every issue.

Having said that.....as Reidy said,  where WAI and 508 differ some is that
the 508 standards are not an excuse for obsolescence, on the other hand they
are not espousing any particular browsers latest versions only.  They are
looking, as we all are, for the best way to accommodate the majority of the
people in this moving target of an audience.

Kynn and Tim, we need your ideas as well as others for the different
techniques documents that we are putting together for the W3C and 508.  May
I use your ideas, to add to the Javascript Techniques documents?  It is too
late for this version of the 508 standards to get your ideas across, but the
issues can be addressed today, in these other docs.  That way the world can
benefit from your expertise, to make the web a rich environment for
all..................which I know is your true goal..............yes?

Here is my understanding to add to Reidy, provide all content and navigation
without Javascript, then you can add it in, with the appropriate
alternatives that Kynn, Tim S , and Reidy were talking about.  Be sure that
all functionality is available without Javascript, so if they are using Lynx
(not yet Javascript supported), they will still have all the content. For
those with Javascript enabled, all people can enjoy the eye or ear or touch
candy, that these fun and useful technologies can provide.  Yes, as you
focus on this button, the picture of a mother nursing her child comes into
view.

My simplistic view................................................Katie
