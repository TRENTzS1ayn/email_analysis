Thursday, 15 February, 2100 UTC (4 PM Boston, 10 PM Sophia, 8 AM
Melbourne), on the W3C/MIT Longfellow bridge: +1-617-252-1038, with the
following agenda:

1. WCAG 2.0 issues, as follows:

a. Note accompanying guidelines 1 referring to user agent capabilities:
does this designate the capabilities of what the user actually has, or the
user agent/assistive technology that they could acquire? Is this a
relevant question here?

b. Should we add a requirement that audio-only timed interactions should
be synchronzied (presumably with text?) This issue was raised at an
earlier meeting. Essentially it was the question of how to treat
medium-specific content (other than multimedia) which requires a
time-based response.

2. Management of the process by which techniques will be developed, tested
and approved. We need to determine the framework in which the techniques
will be developed, in preparation for the face to face meeting, large
parts of which will be devoted to techniques.

3. Documentation of assumptions: we resolved last week to incorporate
questions of user agent capability, so far as possible, in to the task of
developing techniques, as it arises at a technology-specific level.
Nevertheless, the issue still emerges at a higher (checkpoint) level: see
checkpoint 1.7, and possibly elsewhere in the guidelines. How should we
define the requirement of checkpoint 1.7, or should it be moved into an
introductory (or advisory) section and out of the checkpoints as such? Or,
if we decide that the Techniques will in any respect be normative, should
checkpoint 1.7 be tied to the specific (evolving) requirements established
at the technique level?
