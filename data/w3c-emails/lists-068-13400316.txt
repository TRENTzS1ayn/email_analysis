These words keep blithely tripping off your fingertips and I don't really 
understand why.

"Poorly written" is just too facile/inaccurate/demeaning for the document. 
It could be said (probably has) for just about anything ever written. I 
just can't accept that you don't "understand" the "requirements".

It can be better written and more understandable and that's why we're 
paying you the big bucks but meanwhile if you could curb the denigration 
just one notch it would be more comfortable herein.
