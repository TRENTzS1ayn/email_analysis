They're carefully chosen.  If you think they're "blithely tripping
off my fingertips" then I'm curious how you've managed to get inside
my head and/or my fingertips, William.

Please -don't- accuse me of lack of thought, just because you don't
agree with what I say.  Nothing pisses me off more.  If you want to
disagree, then fine, but please do -not- assume that my opinions are
based on whimsy.

Obviously you don't think they're poorly written.  I tend to think
they are.  Why do you think that it is "too demeaning" to a document
to call it what it is?  Is this some sort of meta-political-correctness
kick whereby you can't even be critical of a pseudo-technical policy
document without "the document" taking offense?

I think it's unclear and I think it's poorly supported.  The numbers
of people who turn to _WAI_ to interpret _federal regulations_ should
tell us something; namely, that they aren't getting what they need
from the Access Board.

What, exactly, do you see as the problem with saying that I don't find
the Section 508 regulations to be well-written?  They look like they
were written by policy writers with little understanding beyond the
surface level of the technology they're working with, and they don't
seem to be written for a web designer audience.  These are my opinions
and if you like I will _gladly_ go out and get support for them by
interviewing web authors to see if these documents are well-written
or not.  I'd rather not take the time right now, though.

Eh?  Reef is paying me big bucks to do things that have little to do
with making Section 508 more understandable.

It's not denigration.  The Section 508 regulations for web design are
not well written.  That's a fact.  Sorry.

>C U @ CSUN?

Certainly -- it's in my home town, almost, and I wouldn't miss it for
the world.  You can hit me in person if you like. ;)
