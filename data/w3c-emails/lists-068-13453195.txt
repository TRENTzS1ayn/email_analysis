I think the WCAG 1.0 document is confusing and poorly worded too, if
that helps put my comments in perspective.  I dislike _any_ confusing
verbiage, whether or not it's generated by "us", "them", or someone

I haven't said that there is lack of quality in the people who created
508 -- those were Katie's words.  If you don't like that implication,
