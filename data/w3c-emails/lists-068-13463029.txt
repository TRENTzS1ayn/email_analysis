Actually Kynn, what I said was this:
Please don't fault Doug for the loopholes and missing pieces, as we all
know, new issues are developing every day, as well as the fact that this is
one complicated mess of differing technologies coming together. And, every
group writing standards do not necessarily have the luxury of having the
finest technological minds available for each and every issue. 
I think we wasted enough breath on this, we are after all, reaching for the
same goal.........Katie
