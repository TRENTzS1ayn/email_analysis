This is why I like William's terse version [1] so much. It's better
integrated than the current draft, and yet it carries less information. A
HyperLink is a link to much more information... and by letting people
choose the parts they want to cogitate, rather than setting it all out and
having people skip bits, you get mroe value out of it.

We have guidelines... those are the bare backbones. Then we have
checkpoints... those are still essential. But then we have optional bits:
[background] [reasoning] [techniques] and so on, and all of these should be
linked, rather than concisified and crammed into a small bit of space on
the document.
