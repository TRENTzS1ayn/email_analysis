RE: Action item from last meeting
An initial draft test plan/procedure for techniques is available for review
and comment at
http://seti-search.com/draft.html (there are lots of parenthetical notes and
comments)
Also there is a sample of what a resulting test page might look like at
http://seti-search.com/sample.html
this sample looks at animated gifs since the subject has come up on the IG
list.
