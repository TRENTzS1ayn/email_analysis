I updated the Checkpoint mapping [1] to reflect the discussions from the 1 
February [2] and 25 January [3] telecons.

Additions to the checkpoint mapping:
1.  We decided that WCAG 1.0 checkpoint 9.1 would be covered in the HTML 
Techniques, therefore I added a row for HTML Techniques and associated 
checkpoint 9.1 with it.

2. We decided that WCAG 1.0 checkpoint 11.3 would be covered either in 
server-side techniques or core techniques, therefore I added a row for 
server side techniques  and associated checpoint 11.3 with it.

3. The resolution on 1 February was to follow Jason's suggestions [4] for 
everything that had not yet been agreed upon.  Jason was not clear which 
techniques to associate  WCAG 1.0 checkpoint 13.10 (Provide a means to skip 
over multi-line ASCII art. [Priority 3]).  I associated it with core 
techniques, although it might fit with WCAG 2.0 checkpoint 2.3 (Give users 
control of mechanisms that cause extreme changes in context.)  If this is 
not appropriate, please let me know.

4. I associated WCAG 1.0:13.2 with WCAG 2.0:1.4
1.0:13.2 Provide metadata to add semantic information to pages and sites. 
[Priority 2] (if 1.4 is modified to include semantics)
2.0:1.4 Use markup or a data model to provide the logical structure of content.

5. 1.0:5.3 and 1.0:5.4  were associated with 2.0:4.2
1.0:5.3 Do not use tables for layout unless the table makes sense when 
linearized. Otherwise, if the table does not make sense, provide an 
alternative equivalent (which may be a linearized version). [Priority 2]
1.0:5.4 If a table is used for layout, do not use any structural markup for 
the purpose of visual formatting. [Priority 2]
2.0:4.2 Use languages, API's, and protocols according to specification.
