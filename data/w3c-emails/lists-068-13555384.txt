Yes! It's not an "or" thing.

Steven's comments about generalization are well-taken and in our 
discussions have become tacit. They are of course written for "people like 
us" to some extent because if someone happens to arrive via surf-board with 
no previous knowledge of any of this stuff it's just "too bad". By which I 
mean that these are *guidelines/checkpoints* and hopefully later 
techniques/examples for people concerned with this rather specialized 
field. A few people can "fill in the blanks" in an "of course" fashion just 
from reading the guidelines while others can "get it" at the checkpoint 
level, but on the whole the practical consequences will ensue from being 
able to use the techniques as a sort of recipe set.
