Marti,

A good procedure, but in looking at the sample page, I see a serious lack
of information that would be useful to the owner of the page. Some rests in
the choice of example, since "annoying and distracting" are subjective
values, and further, the state of being annoyed isn't a disability - for
some people, it's a way of life!

I do prefer the working in the 508 guidelines (which I too lazy to quote),
which specifies a precise measure of what "flash" speed is disabling and
therefore illegal ... The example did not use any precise definition of the
problem.

An addition to the tester's questions could include as #6 Recommendation
... for example, in the example "annoying and distracting gifs", the
problem could be simply solved if the flash rate were slowed down enough to
be able to see what the pictures are. I don't have a stopwatch, but the
pictures change in less than a second, which isn't long enough for
recognition ... and I hope no one is still promoting subliminal messages!
Clicking on Stop doesn't help if you want to see the pictures, it just
stops the flash ... 

Oh, and a concern with volunteer testers is that you could end up skewing
your data if you don't have a true "representative" team of testers. Not
all disabilities and in-use assistive technology would be adequately
represented if you only used volunteers ...
