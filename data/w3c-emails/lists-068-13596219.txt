William,

Is your point is that we first have to devise the guidelines so "we" can
understand them, then we set about the task of making them understood by
the web-making public? 

No, I think we should plan on making them understandable from the git-go
... Just like we want authors to plan web pages ... to make them
understandable and usable from the git-go ... I have a sister and a sister
in law who have taken classes on web pages, one with a associate degree in
computers, the other in an art program that included web page design ...
neither heard a word about accessibility in their classes and are probably
wondering if it's another "Anne going off on a tangent" situation ... 508
probably puts some starch in my words ... 

Perhaps a recipe is a good metaphor ... you can generally change a recipe
as to quantities and size and still usually come out with a reasonable
product ... (but it helps to have a good understanding of chemistry to do
but so much doodling with bakery goodies) ... it you're a novice cook,
follow the recipe scrupulously ... For the novice cook, the recipe needs to
be precise ... not metaphorical ... for an experienced web author who is
addressing an imprecise audience, the guidelines need to be interpretable ...

Anne
