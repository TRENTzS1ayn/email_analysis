William,

      Thanks for another easily understood answer to my question. I look
forward to what you do at a level that can be understood by first graders,
tho I think practically, the main issue at that level is how to explain
their pictures. 

I'm doing a somewhat complex activity with my first graders recently. They
are corresponding with a friend, writing as a "alien" asking them to
explain "earthlets". One of the exercises was for them to look at six
pictures of the same still life in which each picture had been altered
using photo software. The children were asked to choose the picture that
they liked best. Most preferred the one in which the colors were altered to
very bright, appealing colors. The children recorded their choices, and are
last week and this compiling spread sheets to calculate and display the
results of their choices (the object is for the children to show Zman that
they are "real" because they all think differently). I have a web page that
tracks the various activities between Zman and the children, and have
arranged the pictures so they can be seen as a whole group on the page, or
clicked on to see the full sized version the kids studied. My problem is
that at present I've no equivalancy text for the individual pictures, and
there is a blind woman in the project, and I'm stumped at how best to
describe the pictures and put that information on the web page so she can
generally telll what the kids have been shown. My problem is trying to find
a way to describe to her how the pictures are different without her having
knowledge of what these things look like. The highly colored picture isn't
a problem, but some of the other pictures vary because of treatment in the
photo software to sharpen, or blur, combine pixels or accentuate them. 

You can see the pictures on http://www.enabling.org/zman/Southside. They
are the still life pictures of the flowers with a fruit bowl. 

                   Ooops, gotta go, more later.... And suggestions on
meaningful alt text are welcome...

                                      Anne
