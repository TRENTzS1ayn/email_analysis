OK, let me try to get clearer...

I agree with you that the wording of WCAG 1.0 means that images of text are
in general not able to conform to WCAG 1.0 double-A level.

I agree that it is important for the group to answer this question. If
necessary, they should say "well, as it is written, WCAG 1.0 says no. We have
noted this as an issue for WCAG 2.0 to revisit becuase it is too hard for
people to understand why", or whatever it is that we decide as a group.

In other words, there are two things we need to do. We need to answer the
question of what is required by WCAG 1.0. Not what we think it should be
now, but what is it in the document. The second thing is to examine the issue
that has arisen, to work out how we deal with it in WCAG 2.

cheers

  Thanks for the support Charles but my problem is that even as we speak I'm
  evaluating sites that use textual images--it's my job (well, one of my
  jobs)-- and I have to pronounce whether they are double A compliant.  For
  example, Pennsylvania has decreed full WCAG compliance for state internet
  sites.  I'm talking to the state webmasters next week.  Pennsylvania is
  covered with textual images and I've got to tell them if they are P2
  compliant.  For example

  http://papower.state.pa.us/PAPower/

  I can't talk subtle philosophy to this audience.  I have to point to each
  of those textual image links and say

  <strong>

        YES

        or

        NO

  </strong>

  As it is, I simply read what I see as the plain meaning of WCAG 1.0 and say
  "no"

  But given the controversy around this, and all the big time sites that use
  textual images and claim, or wish to claim, double or triple A,  I'd really
  like to see explicit consensus from this group.  And no matter what wording
  we come up with, I wouldn't be convinced that we have true conensus until
  we all look at some pages with textual links and have consensus on those
  actual examples.

  I realize we want to get on with WCAG 2.0 but if we want people to use WCAG
  1.0 these sorts of issues have to be addressed now IMO.
