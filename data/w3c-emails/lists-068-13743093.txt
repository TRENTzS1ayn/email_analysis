HC was a group to do an accessibility review of HTML 4.0 and CSS 2.0 as they
were approaching W3C Recommendation status.  You can find a summary of the
results before we re-treaded the group with a more long-term charter as PF at

<<http://www.w3.org/WAI/HC/report.html>http://www.w3.org/WAI/HC/report.html>.

The argument against requiring a value of the SUMMARY attribute per se for all
tables is that the SUMMARY is supplementary to the caption element or TITLE
attribute for the table.  See the discussion of CAPTION, not SUMMARY in HTML
4.01.  In other words, the caption or title may suffice, you don't always need
an expansion on these in a SUMMARY attribute.  That is the theory as I
understand it.
