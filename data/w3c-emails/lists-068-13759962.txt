Subject: my first contribution to the techniques


Had trouble sleeping, so I wrote some style sheets. (Doesn't everyone?) 
 
These are my first contribution to the techniques.
In the aural style sheet I have tried to translate the semantic content that is normally visually represented to be represented in the aural presentation.
For example:
    a.. In the aural style sheets the normal voice is male, but links are in a female voice, 
    b.. Emphasis, boldness, headings level etc are all represented by differing changes in stress and other such properties. 
    c.. Quotes, etc sound like they are  coming from far away 
    d..  Abbreviations are spelled out
I think this could be an example also for a general technique/ principle. <b>Represent all content, not just the text.</b>
 
The second CSS is for the color disabled, it makes the contrasts better, makes all link underlined, stuff like that.
Known bug - backgrounds are white, so if the text is set to white in an inline style change, then you have to put the mouse over the words to see them.

They need testing - if anyone on a screen reader cares to have a try.
I will put them up as freeware on Global Formats as soon as I get around to it (and can write clear install instructions).
