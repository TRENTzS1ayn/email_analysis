How about <em>Represent all content, not just the text.</em> :-)

Another good technique is not to use stylesheets to display hard data.
I n other words, don't do stuff like:-

     a:before { content: "Link: "; }

Put that stuff in the document itself. IOW, "don't use stylesheets to
render structural and semantic information that should be contained in
the source."

Maybe <hr /> is therefore O.K., representing a "pause in the document"
rather than a horizontal rule? But they'd have to rename it...
