Yes, it was just a terrible example as usual... how about:-

     a.lsigpin:hover:after { content: " (off site link)"; }

Hmm, that's still a bad example, but there might be times when it is
important to know that a link goes off site. Then again, in that case,
it should be represented in the title="" attribute. Ugh, am I terrible
at examples, or what?

Agreed. You can do more or less whatever you want when you know the
output device. No one is going to tell you what to put in your own
personal U-CSS-sheet, or how accessible to make it!
