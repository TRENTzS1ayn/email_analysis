Evidently this is an FAQ.  This question requires a clarifying interpretation
of both HTML and WCAG 1.0 to be put to bed.  Is the interpretation that I
offered below supported, or is there a better interpreation?

What follows is a quote of a message I just sent on
<webwatch@yahoogroups.com>.

[Al, here.]? 

Tidy is a great tool.? But its purpose is repair, not validation.? It is not
trying to split hairs exactly on the precise line set down by the
specification.? It is trying to help you get on with life with a good
page.? In
the process it may prompt you for a SUMMARY because a SUMMARY may help you
have
a good page, and not strictly because if it doesn't get a SUMMARY it won't be
able to emit a valid repaired page.? 

What is in the DTD for stricy HTML 4.01 is

<!ATTLIST TABLE??????????????????????? -- table element --
[snip]
? summary???? %Text;???????? #IMPLIED? -- purpose/structure for speech
output--

This allows a TABLE without a SUMMARY.? Unless that #IMPLIED had read
#REQUIRED
it is not a format validity error if the attribute is absent from your HTML
code.

In addition, SUMMARY is not always required for accessible content, either.?
The first place to put overview information for a table is in the CAPTION
element if you want it to show visually at all times.? It is also possible to
put a brief TITLE attribute on the TABLE element itself.? Either of these may
be sufficient.? A SUMMARY should be written to expand on these, if they
exist.?
If the CAPTION or TITLE already says all there is to say, there need be no
SUMMARY.?
