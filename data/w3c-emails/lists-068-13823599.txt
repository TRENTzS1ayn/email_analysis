And additionally, if the TABLE is being used to impose layout on the
page and conveys no information, SUMMARY and CAPTION can (and should) be
absent. In such cases the use of the TABLE does need to degrade
gracefully so that it doesn't impact viewers whose clients can not
display tabular data very well. A single table with a single cell on
each row used to force a specific width is an example of such a table.
Moving forward such tables should be replaced by the use of CSS.
