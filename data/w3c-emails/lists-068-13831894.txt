wendy, have we considered javascript opening URLs in new new windows (that
are not pop-ups) as a techniques or other?  was just thinking about the
number of web sites includeing news sites that do this.  you click on the
URL link and it opens another browser window.  what if javascript is turned
off? or do we need no script here?

comments?
