I couldn't disagree more.  This is one of those "until user agents..."
guidelines.  There are many good reasons to use pop-up windows for sighted
users that make sites substantially easier to use and more accessible -- why
do you think so many people use them.  The fact that pop-ups on the screen
distract a screen-reader is not so helpful in content guidelines, it's a UA
issue and could easily be handled by a good piece of software (anyone know
what the IBM reader does here?).  It would be good to hear from some blind
folks out there how much of an issue this really is for them.

I think that there is consensus that opening a new window is not, ever, a
good thing. It confuses navigation. (Imagine a non sited person who is moved
without her knowledge to a pop up window and then tries the back button -
disorienting the user.)
