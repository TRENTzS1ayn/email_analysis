In the WAI CAG meeting i promised the information on Carnegie-Mellon
http://www.sei.cmu.edu/.  By the way, University of Maryland has courses and
placed second in the competiton to Carnegie-Mellon to host the Software
Engineering Institute.

To quote, "The purpose of the Software Engineering Institute (SEI), when
reduced to a few words, is to improve the practice of software engineering.
However, our purpose is, in reality, more complex and involved. To
understand our purpose, you must understand what software engineering is,
review our history, and examine our mission. Even more detail is contained
in the SEI strategy. Explore the topics on the left to learn more about the
purpose of the SEI."

Software Engineering Management Practices - The Software Engineering
Institute (SEI) helps organizations and individuals to improve their
software engineering management practices. Explore the topics listed on the
left for more information about software engineering management, SEI
projects, and software engineering.
