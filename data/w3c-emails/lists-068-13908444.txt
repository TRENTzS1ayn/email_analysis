However, WCAG 1.0 says

5.5 Provide summaries for tables. [Priority 3] For example, in HTML, use 
the "summary" attribute of the TABLE element. Techniques for checkpoint 5.5

That seems to say that summary is required.

Personally, I'd agree with Al that summary isn't always needed.  There's 
the case Al mentioned where  title and caption might suffice.  There's also 
another case: where the text of the document happens to describe the 
table.  In other words, I see summary like a longdesc: a longer explanation 
that isn't always needed.

Anyway, the next time I'm rating a page for triple A, do I need to require 
summary?  I'd look to the folks doing HTML techniques to answer this for 
2.0... we can then issue an errata against 1.0 if necessary.

In the meantime, I'm going to have to go by what I see as the plain meaning 
of the words and require a summary for triple A compliance even in cases 
where I have say that it isn't really necessary.  I hope this gets resolved 
before I run across this in a real case.
