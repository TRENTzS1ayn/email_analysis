I've seen this (variants on <Q>summary="table used for layout"</Q>) quite a
bit.  I am almost ashamed to admit that I have been doing this routinely,
primarily to quiet Tidy (and Bobby et al.).  I used to include the number of
rows and columns, but stopped that when JFW started to vocalize that
information by default.  I understand the argument that this technique is
"too uselessly chatty" and am quite sensitive to that position.

Here's my proposal (which should, amazingly enough, keep everyone happy):
We promote <Q>summary=""</Q> as the preferred technique for layout tables --
in much the same way that <Q>alt=""</Q> is the preferred technique for
spacer gifs.

Can Triple-A pages use tables for layout?
