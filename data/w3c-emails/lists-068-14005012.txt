Can triple-A pages use tables for layout?

Interesting question. I would argue no. But I would argue that in general
layout tables mean a page does not qualify for double-A either, and I think I
am in a very small minority on this one.

P2 checkpoints that I think layout tables violate:
3.3?Use style sheets to control layout and presentation.
11.1?Use W3C technologies when they are available and appropriate for a task
and use the latest versions when supported. ? ? ?
11.2?Avoid deprecated features of W3C technologies.

I don't think the use of layout tables (per se) violates any P3 checkpoints,
so if you accept that they are OK for double-A then I don't see any argument
against them being OK for triple-A.

cheers
