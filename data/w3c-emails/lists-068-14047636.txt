Al brings up the question of whether "for example" means what I thought it 
meant.

Lets see what happens when we use that reading of "for example" in WCAG 
checkpoint 1.1 which says:

For example, in HTML:
?       Use "alt" for the IMG, INPUT, and APPLET elements, or provide a 
text equivalent in the content of the OBJECT and APPLET elements

Do we no longer have to use ALT for images?

or in
3.1 When an appropriate markup language exists, use markup rather than 
images to convey information. [Priority 2] For example, use MathML to mark 
up mathematical equations

Since it says "for example" does this mean we don't have to use MathML for 
equations?

or in

3.6 Mark up lists and list items properly. [Priority 2] For example, in 
HTML, nest OL, UL, and DL lists properly.

Do we not have to mark up lists and list items properly?

In other words, if we don't interpret "for example" to mean "this is 
required", we open a can of snakes in the rest of WCAG 1.0.  If we want it 
to mean "this is just one way to do it"  lets be explicit about that by 
issuing a small erratum.
