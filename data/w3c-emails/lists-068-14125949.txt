--Hi, I have started looking through the minutes, and I would like to
explain the intent of 2.2.
>
People have complain/ commented to me that they have trouble reading and
concentrating on a site were there are animations and distractions. Theses
comments are of course form people with ADD/ADHD. The problem
is>concentrating or following and not interaction.

 The wording has been carefully chosen - "minimize" and not "do not use" so
that you can have alert boxes or other necessary distractions.

However imagine an ADHD high school student trying to research a complex
topic when there are ants crawling across the screen. Every time the ants
come in his field of vision, he will forget what he is doing and have to
start again. The designer may think that this will help make the site appeal
to teenagers. But in reality many students will have to take medication
before using it. An extreme example, but many animations have a similar
effect.

Defiantly, at least, priority three.
