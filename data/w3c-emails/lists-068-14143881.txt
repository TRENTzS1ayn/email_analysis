But the wording is not precise enough -- "minimize" means nothing as
a term.  There is no metric -- "minimize" is at best a relative term,
and at worst a verb which means "continually reduce" i.e. to nothing.

The gist of the face-to-face discussion was that instead of saying
"minimize" -- which is unmeasurable and not easy to understand what is
required -- we'd rather turn the checkpoint on its head and make it a
positive.  Say "use animation for <x> and <y>", defining when it's
appropriate, rather than saying either "use it when you like but feel
guilty" or "never use it", which are the only two logical interpretations
of "minimize."

How do you "minimize" the above?  Is it by "reducing the number of
ants"?  Is one crawling ant acceptable -- because the effect has been
"minimized" -- but 2 or more crawling ants are not?  Clearly in the
example above you want to say "do not use"!  Thus clearer language
is necessary.

The intent is to say:

      Use animation when it is necessary to disrupt the end user's
      ability perform her tasks.  Don't use animation unless you
      specifically want to do this.

Do you agree with the above sentiment?  The wording is not the final
form of the proposal, of course.
