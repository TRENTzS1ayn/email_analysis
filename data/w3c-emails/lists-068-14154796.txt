Repeat after me: "user-controllable".

"Guideline 2. Design content that allows interaction according to the 
user's needs and preferences" - checkpoints may need crafting and 
techniques might be elaborate, but the *principle* is what we should keep 
in focus. If a user's environment would be ruined by crawling ants, but 
must still permit fire alarms, then we deal with that in techniques for 
achieving *needs* (P1) and *preferences* (P2/P3?).

LS:: "The problem is concentrating or following and not interaction."

WL: IMO "interaction" is still OK because diverting one's attention to 
ants/spiders/fireworks is clearly interactive. Thus 
"concentrating/following" are interactions in the sense used here.
