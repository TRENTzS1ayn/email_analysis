I try, but whenever I attempt it I say "edapta."  Oops, was that a
product plug? :)

I'm not sure if P1/P2/P3 break down that way but I do acknowledge the
wisdom of what you are saying.

Yes.

Yes, but I feel that her specific example above was of the sort "don't
put crawling ants on the screen."  :)

I agree 100% that it should be user-configurable -- on the client, on
the server, or BOTH -- whether or not ants are a distraction.  The
default, I think, should be to assume that they _are_ a distraction and
to only use them if there is a specific need by the author to attract
the user's attention to something.

Note:  This does still allow the author to create an animated banner
specifically for the purpose of attracting the user's attention away
from the rest of the information on a page.  However, this is a feature,
not a bug; it's intended that if the author wishes to do this, that is
a _legitimate_ use of "distractive" techniques.

(The conflict here is between the desire of the user to use a page
for a certain purpose, and the desire of the content provider to
use a page for a different purpose.  The example in the current 2.0
draft, that says "you may want to provide a banner-free version of
the page", is hopelessly naive in understanding this conflict and
reduces it to a simple "well, just don't make money" business
non-decision!)
