Many of the things we enjoy in life: jokes, chocolate, etc., operate by
injecting a subliminal amount of pain or trouble.  For most people, the
attention-getting devices used in Ads or to provide stimulation on websites
act
at this tolerable level.  They tickle your attention circuits, but don't
kidnap
your train of thought.

On the other hand, not all people are 'most people.'  Some people have a lower
threshold for distraction than others.  And this condition can be a disability
if they can't manage the quiescence vs. distraction level in their
environments.  Crossing Times Square one can't always manage this.  What is
done in private between a consenting person and their computer should be more
manageable than that.

It would appear that the User Agent guidelines will call for User Agents to
give users override control to still squirmy pages.  So the content guideline
in this area might be something like the guidelines about color.  "Do not rely
on motion alone to draw attention to a featured element."

If, for a given individual, the advertising is so distracting that the content
the user sought is blocked from access, the advertising will be
counter-productive.  The user will hate the page and the advertiser by
association.  This is not what the advertiser wants.  The advertiser's
interest
in the animation device is predicated on the premise that this level of motion
will strike the right balance in the user's attention-paying profile.

We need a device-independent statement of the balance of attention between
what
the user wants to notice and what the sponsor wants the user to notice.  This
balance of attention getting is one of the content characteristics that needs
to transform gracefully as we morph the content into different forms for
different interaction spaces and users.  Still-frame presentation is one of
the
media morphs.  Is your content prepared to be effective in this channel?
