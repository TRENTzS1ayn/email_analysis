Bruce, Al, et. al:

The intrinsic challenge of writing a standards-like document is (and has
always been) clarity. What is clear for some (particularly technical-types)
is often not clear to others. I have truly been impressed by the effort the
WAI working groups have put into the documents as they are today. I
certainly expect issues of clarity to crop up -- it's the nature of the
beast.

Having a technical writer like Ian on board is a distinct advantage.
However, I would further suggest that the WAI groups consider hiring (better
yet, recruite) two additional expert-types: a) a standards expert (Rex Lint
and Jim Isaac come to mind) and b) a technical editor (O'Reilly is a member
of the W3C, surely they could lend a helping hand here).

I believe that these individuals would be of great assistance to the working
groups in your documentation effort.

Regards,

Mike
