Of course. That is not the function of the author, but of the user.

So long as the user isn't somehow prevented from providing for herself such 
a version, there should be no problem. The user's browser should have a 
"don't bother me, I'm trying to concentrate" button which can, while 
providing "banner liberation", still allow "the sky is falling" messages to 
get through.

I think what I'm saying is that this (recommending *specifics* of 
presentation) isn't the business of WCAG. Instead of "don't divert 
attention" we must (rather convolutedly) say "don't preclude removal of 
attention-diverting elements" - and that in techniques, not checkpoints.
