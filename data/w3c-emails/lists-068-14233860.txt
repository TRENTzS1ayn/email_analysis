The user's browser -could- have such a thing, not -should-. :)  Especially
as it is very hard for a browser to make such a choice, and could, in fact,
lose essential accessibility information if it tries to remove "only
banner ads."  (All that such a thing would do is make banner people even
sneakier!)

But we agree on the main point:
