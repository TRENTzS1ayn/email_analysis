Yup, that would do it, It is fine from my perspective, but it may be
stronger then strictly necessary. For example a mouse over button effect,
may be OK, but could be considered animation.

How about:

Don't use animation that can disrupt the user's concentration and ability
perform tasks, unless you  specifically need to do this.

( I also changed "want" to "need". Lets rule out advertisers who consider
people with ADD as easy pray for impulsive spending. :(  )
