Kynn -- not sure whether this is meant to be a serious statement. I'd
debate, from a usabilty perspective, that this is true. Mouseovers, more
often than not, come under the topic of "discovered functionality" --
particularly for the average, non-techie user. And I've yet to do a study
with the blind to see how they discover them, beyond the obvious hyperlink
breakout in the screenreader. The discovery process might be more difficult.

Note that I'm not saying that mousover-like functionality is bad. I tend to
think that this kind of functionality needs to be stated in the help and
documentation system of the interface and/or web application.
