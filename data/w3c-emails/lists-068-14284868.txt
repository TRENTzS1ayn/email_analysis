I am confused.
We could cut the guideline down to one sentence
"Repeat after me: "device independence user-controllable"."
That would be true for text alternatives, true for standardization, true for
transform gracefully.

We specify these things, and with good reason. Repeat after me:
"user-controllable". is true but we need to specify what aspects of a page
can cause problems and hence may need to be controlled.
Animations are one of these.
However with ADD (as I explained in my last email. They will find it hard to
control once the distraction is in effect.
So maybe hear is the one place were "device independence and user control"
does not cover all.
Now if we could have a "distractibility " attribute added to all object and
image tags - Feel free to ask PF.
Yours,
Lisa
