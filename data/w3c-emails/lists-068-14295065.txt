May be in a perfect world.
I am not a great expert on ADD, but from the contact I have had I can not
imagine these techniques or assumptions being overly useful.

Please forgive me if I try to explain the point with a separate, also
possibly neurological based example. I once heard someone giving to a person
who was severely depressed "good advice" of "try harder to help your self".
The nature of depression is that the  sufferer has given up hope, has no
energy ....... the worse you suffer
from depression the less likely you are to be able to help your self - At
least in the short term. If you suspect someone is depressed you have to act
for them. Something similar happens with ADD. Having been
distracted the user can not say "Oh I am being distracted let me tern off
the distraction". They can however, say that before they begin the task. So
they can tern of Java scripts before they are distracted. But as they do not
know they are going to get crawling ants, and there is a lot of stuff that
is useful to them in JS, will they do that?

Further I have never seen anyone one resent the things that are affecting
their attention.
It is perhaps like a gambler to resent a casino, and therefore stop
frequenting it.

Yours,
L
