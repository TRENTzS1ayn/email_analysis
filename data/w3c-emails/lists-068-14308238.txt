I would agree with that, except it would seem too much like an ad
for Edapta. :)

Agreed.  A question for you here is how I can handle this in an Edapta
framework.  It would be relatively simple to add the ability to ask
someone "would you prefer simple, non-distracting interface" and then
design such an interface for those users who select it.

The question is, would this be an acceptable solution?  Your profile
(on any given site) would store this information and would thus be
set only once -- assuming you knew how to find the place to update
your profile -- and would apply to the entire site.

Actually it should be relatively easy to identify, programmatically,
those components of the page which may cause distraction.  The only
issue is whether or not they cause _intentional_ distraction or
_incidental_.
