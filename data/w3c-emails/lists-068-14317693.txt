Looking at it, it's hard to tell, yeah.

But the way you "discover" it is that if you mouseover (select)
something, the UI notifies you in some way.  In some cases it's only
as subtle as a mouse pointer changing from an arrow to a finger; with
mouseovers, you actually get an increase in accessibility/usability
because the change is a change of the graphic.

(The problem here is "links which are not obvious."  Mouseovers are
one of the ways in which designers can alert [certain] users to the
fact that a visual element of the page is also a link.)
