Please note: the next WCAG teleconference will be held on Thursday, 15
March 2001 (there will be no meeting this week).

All minutes resulting from the face-to-face meeting are to be sent to
Wendy for publication.

I wish to thank all those members of the working group who attended
the face-to-face meeting and helped to make it so successful and productive.

Jason.
