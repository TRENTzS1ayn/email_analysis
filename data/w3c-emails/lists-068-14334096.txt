Lisa,

If it ever gets to the point where "in reality *many* students" will
*have* to take meds  to deal with ants crawling across the screen, I will
leave the education field! Children are being overdosed with "meds" in
schools now! 

Yes, find a way to turn off distractions, but that means the ability to
turn off *anything* on the screen that is distracting, including the text
... But "do not use" isn't fair to the many users who enjoy the animations
... Remember that what is "distracting" to one person is the very thing
that makes a page a memorable experience to someone else, and may be
exactly what someone else needs to get the meaning of the page.
