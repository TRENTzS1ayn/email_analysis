This is similar to the restriction on using <hn> element for formatting 
purposes rather than as "headers" in the sense used by ToC generators. By 
making it a convenient means for larger-font dividers the implementations 
of the element drove a (thankfully fairly small) 'nother nail in the 
accessibility coffin.

Some tools check HTML source for apparent abuse of such elements so there's 
some hope of automating the repair of this transgression.

Incidentally because 5.4 says "If a table is used for layout..." it puts 
the lie to the notion that the guidelines preclude the use of tables for 
layout!
