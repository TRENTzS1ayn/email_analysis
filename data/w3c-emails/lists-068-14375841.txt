I was asked the same question a little while ago. I think the
rationale is that "names" are ambiguous, and may not even be set on
some UAs, whereas numbers are exact and should always be interpreted
properly on UAs. *However*, I thought that using names of colors may
allow a user to set the value that they wish for those names ("red at
#a00000" etc.), acutally providing the user with more control, so I've
never been too happy with that section in the TECHS document.
