If it's not a *required* attribute it's not necessary. However, I don't

The tools that decide whether its omission is prohibitive of the right to 
assert Triple-A conformance will likelier parse in accordance with the "Al 
is no doubt correct" view - and we only bordered on "testy" so no apology 
is necessary, but thanks for (rare indeed) document praise.
