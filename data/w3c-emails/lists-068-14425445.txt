As I recall, Netscape borrowed its settings from the X Window System's
rgb.txt file, which has a zillion and one settings (including things like
"aliceblue" and percentages of gray), while IE 3 only knew of the 16 color
names in the HTML spec. So if you chose a color outside of the range of
known names, you got the default, whereas sRGB values stayed constant
(relative to OS color-matching). The problem was that no user agent provides
the kind of facility you're talking about (user-controlled name-value
pairs).

I know that newer versions of IE support the range of color names (mostly
because I use "aliceblue" to test elements...), but outside of the major
browsers (and devices), they're prone to failure outside the sixteen sRGB
values specified in the HTML 4.01 spec:
