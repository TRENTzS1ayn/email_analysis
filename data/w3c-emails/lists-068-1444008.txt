Yes.

The spec says that it is a priority 2 requirement to use markup instead of
text. There is markup available to do this. So I think it violates the
checkpoint.

Getting to the broader philosophical questions, I can see that getting to the
content through the alt is difficult, so at some level I agree that this is a
problem for people with low vision - I guess the only question I have is the
priority level.

There are some more serious problems on that page though...

cheers

  "no"

  I'm tempted to say "I'm in front of you" in some jocular sense implying
  that I'm for even more draconian enforcement of the guidelines, but...

  I find it hard to believe that the stuff in question poses any significant
  problem for low vision users so long as it has alt="text" of decent
  quality. Maybe a little inconvenience (though I even doubt that), but not
  that tough. Of course I can only magnify it 1000% and don't have low vision
  so somebody who's affected by this could embarrass me by saying "you just
  don't understand that getting to the alt is too much trouble" or whatever
  that might make me feel uncaring.

  To me at this time our rule is like the 55 mph speed limit and enforcement
  gets tempered with reality.

  I'd urge them to explore other options (CSS, whatever) but on the whole (as
  W.C. Fields' epitaph is supposed to say, but doesn't) I'd rather be in
  Philadelphia.

  Go to a low vision clinic and see what they can tell you. If they think
  this matters a lot (makes the site difficult to use), then switch me to
  "yes" - with my limited experience I really have to hedge on this and opt
  for "I dunno".
