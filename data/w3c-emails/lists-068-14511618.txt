http://www.elr.com.au/ has a demonstration set that contains many of the 
things we've been discussing, in particular the ability to trivially change 
background colors and slide show icons. I'm not asserting accessibility 
here but just pointing out that they have several features readily 
available that should be useful in certain situations.

I am curious if those (you know who you are <g>) in the teaching racket 
think this is significant stuff?
