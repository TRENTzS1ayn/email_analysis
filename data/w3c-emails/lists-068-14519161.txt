Interesting question on IG -
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2001JanMar/0772.html

Do we have ready-made comments on this, or is it an issue we should try to
resolve as a working group?

Chaals

<hr> has a semantic meaning - It means that what came before the rule
was very different to what was after it, or a logically separate
section of a long document, especially a numbered document.

Putting it another way ...</p><hr /><p>... is far stronger a change
in meaning than ...</p><hr /><p>...

Really the quote: 'Do not use ... horizontal rule "HR" for
presentation purposes.'

should be 'Do not use any HTML tags for presentation purposes'. There
were some HTML tags with presentation purposes, but thankfully
they're being phased out.
