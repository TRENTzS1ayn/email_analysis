I agree with william that the main thing is to make sure people understand 
there are choices and explain the choices.

  I suggest we change the wording from

quote
For example, in HTML, use the "summary" attribute of the TABLE element.
unquote

to something like

quote
For example, in HTML, one way is to use "summary" attribute of the TABLE 
element.
unquote

Or any other wording that makes it explicit that "summary" is not required.

Also, as part of this erratum, I think we should say that things following 
"for example" are always required unless the guidelines explicitly say 
otherwise.  I think that covers most or all of the uses of "for 
example".  We then put in a few words where we didn't want it to always 
required.

It this leads to arguments about whether things are required or not, well, 
that has to be settled for WCAG 2.0 anyway, so that work isn't wasted.

I think we have to be really clear here.  Adherence to WCAG is being 
written into actual contracts, so we should remove ambiguity as much as we 
can, even if it's clear to us what we mean.
