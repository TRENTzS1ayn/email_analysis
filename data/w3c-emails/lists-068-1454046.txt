Kynn,
Thanks for the binary answers.

But I don't think you're addressing exactly what I was asking.

Your argument says why we shouldn't have this guideline.  But that's not 
the question here.  The only question is what is says, which is:

quote

1 When an appropriate markup language exists, use markup rather than images 
to convey information. [Priority 2] For example, use MathML to mark up 
mathematical equations, and style sheets to format text and control layout. 
Also, avoid using images to represent text -- use text and style sheets 
instead.

unquote

It plainly says to avoid using images to represent text.  Now, you might 
say that "avoid" falls short of mandatory. But if we weaken "avoid" that 
way, it makes 7.1 to "avoid" flicker (Priority 1) optional, and if we truly 
want no flicker we'll have to make that an errata,  and examine at all the 
other uses of "avoid".  You might also say that the statement falls within 
the "For example" clause and claim that anything within a "for example" is 
optional, as long as you do it some other way.  But if that's what "for 
example" means, then we're not even requiring ALT text, since ALT text 
falls inside a "for example".  So we'll have to make that an errata also, 
and examine all the other places that use "For example" (which is 
practically every guideline).

Well, since "avoid" and "for example" aren't defined, I suppose those are 
escapes, but if we use them to escape we have to admit that every other 
part of the guidelines that use "for example" or "avoid" have to be 
re-considered.  Is that your position?

But again, that's not the question I was asking.  I was asking if _these 
particular sites_ would be in violation; by which I mean of course these 
particular sites as they exist right now.  Right now, they have no other 
means to provide scalability.  So even if we all we did was impose a high 
level requirement of scalability they would still be in violation.

As for your analysis of Lisa's wording, you're right, "And will work" does 
provide an out.  But just from the discussion so far it's clear that 
there's disagreement about what we want to say.  We'll need to agree on 
what we want to say before we decide how to say it.

Note that the first two questions addresses the narrow issue of whether 
certain current sites are, in their current form P2 compliant.  That's my 
current,  real world concern--e.g. what I'll be  telling an auditorium full 
of webmasters next week.  If the sites aren't compliant, one way to fix 
them is with CSS.  You raise the question of what other methods we should 
allow.  A fair question.  But first, I'd really like to see if we can just 
agree on whether sites as they exist today are compliant.

What are your answers to the more narrow question?   Are the sites as they 
exist now P2 compliant?
