I would suggest the other interpretation - that "for example" means "one way
that this can be achieved is". That is the assumption under which I read the
WCAG drafts as a member of the group. Whether the example is in fact the best
or only way is not reaqlly relevant - I expect people will keep using it for
the real world, and the idea was that the examples are useful. But  they are
not necessarily the only or even best way.

I agree that focussing on what things are actually required is  agood thing
in any event.

  I agree with william that the main thing is to make sure people understand
  there are choices and explain the choices.

    I suggest we change the wording from

  quote
  For example, in HTML, use the "summary" attribute of the TABLE element.
  unquote

  to something like

  quote
  For example, in HTML, one way is to use "summary" attribute of the TABLE
  element.
  unquote

  Or any other wording that makes it explicit that "summary" is not required.

  Also, as part of this erratum, I think we should say that things following
  "for example" are always required unless the guidelines explicitly say
  otherwise.  I think that covers most or all of the uses of "for
  example".  We then put in a few words where we didn't want it to always
  required.

  It this leads to arguments about whether things are required or not, well,
  that has to be settled for WCAG 2.0 anyway, so that work isn't wasted.

  I think we have to be really clear here.  Adherence to WCAG is being
  written into actual contracts, so we should remove ambiguity as much as we
  can, even if it's clear to us what we mean.
