** process -- Request to the chairs:

I believe that this question belongs under the "usage" discussion which is
currently designated as a work item for cross-group coordination using the
wai-xtech list as the discussion space.

Would the chairs of GL be willing to indicate that GL will not take a vote or
position on this point until it has been reviewed in that venue?

** product -- for information

I agree that we could impose an eitorial rule not to rely on "for example" to
convey non-restrictive semantics, but to spell things out in a more verbose
fashion as Len suggested.  Or we can have our own annex to the "must, should,
may" RFC which simply defines our use of i.e. and e.g. so the documents can be
terse but definitive.

This is a "usage" decision and the problem is the same in all the guidelines
volumes.  That's why I suggest we not try to close this thread in GL without
consultation using xtech.
