And at least one old geezer would make this more than a "suggestion". It's 
part of why the glossaries must be mutually aware so that we don't 
understand that "content" is a heavily context/nuance sensitive "collection 
of letters".

I have planted the seed of glossary/dictionary/thesaurus/+ awareness in the 
DI WG. Therein we are (hopefully not terminally) "discussing" what "device" 
means!

To do usable stuff we must at least *do* something and although seemingly 
endless discussions about (DI's) "is the Web a device?" and (RDF's) "is 
reification a stating or a statement?" are necessary we can't work 
through/around them if: 1) we don't take a vote now and then; 2) we have to 
wear flameproof suits.
