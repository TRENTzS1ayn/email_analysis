The minutes are very long, so I am not copying them into this e-mail.  They 
are available at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2001/03/02-f2f-minutes.html

I have incorporated Cynthia's notes.  I do not have minutes/notes for the 
EARL break out session or the server-side scripting session. Those of you 
who took notes and would like to share them, send them to me and I will 
incorporate them into the minutes.

Thanks,
--wendy
