I would break that down in pieces.

Yes, "for example" can be used as a key in searching for places in the
document
where people might misinterpret whether a given practice is a requirement
or an
illustrative example with other alternatives which may not have been spelled
out.

The technology specific techniques for WCAG 2.0 needs to know for all these
cases whether the practice is a flat requirement or an available alternative.

The errata for WCAG 1.0 should document the resolution of these questions at
least for the cases that clearly have caused confusion among the readers of
this document.  Certainly the question "Is SUMMARY required on a TABLE" meets
this criterion.  Note that I am not saying the errata must include an
exhaustive treatment of all places where "for example" appears in the
discussion of checkpoints.  That is a choice that should be available to the
group, under the process leadership of the chairs.

Any erratum which addresses the usage of "for example" categorically should be
considered by the cross-working-group caucus before being adopted here.  The
intended requirements stated by any given WCAG checkpoint can be clarified by
GL with the consent of the [AC and] Director.  The generic use of "for
example"
should be considered in a broader theater before we freeze it here.

As a process and infrastructure issue, I would suggest that

 Open issues from ER WG that need clarification
 <http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/ert-open-issues.html>http://www.w3.org/WA
I/ER/IG/ert/ert-open-issues.html

be replaced by a generic holding tank (owned and operated by GL) for WCAG 1.0
interpretation issues that have been accepted onto the docket and have not yet
been resolved.  Resolved issues go to the errata or to a closed with no change
status.  The sequencing of issues to bring to closure is the job of the
chairs.  The question of "what does 'for example' mean?" could be one of these
issues, or the chairs could decide to subdivide the issue and bring specific
cases to the agenda separately.
