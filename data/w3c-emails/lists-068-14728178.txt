Chaals,

Since the last time this subject came up, I worked on the visuals for some
web pages for a blind woman.... her original text included a few <hr />'s
.... seems to me that if she can learn to insert them, some/many/most blind
folks can understand what they symbolize. All that is necessary is for the
screen readers to pick up the <hr /> command and translate it to "line",
"horizontal rule", or even simple <HR> ...
