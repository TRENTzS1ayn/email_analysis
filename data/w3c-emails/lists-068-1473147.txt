 From Bruce Bailey:

William -- and anyone else who remains skeptical that non-scaleable text is
a significant barrier:
Please (re)review Gregory's description at URL:
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2000OctDec/0194.html>
And Kynn's earlier explanation (before he became contrarian for this
particular thread) at URL:
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2000JulSep/0555.html>
William, please forward the above two links to the GL list for me. It would
seem that I am temporarily unable to post directly to the list...

Love.
                 ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE
