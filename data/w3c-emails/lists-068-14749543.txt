Perhaps a solution would be to change all/most examples in the guidelines
to things that are required, in the best known way to do it at the time of
writing. There are some very fuzzy examples in the guidelines, suggesting
technologies that are still under development and not yet ready to do all
they promise. Examples should be concrete, honed to current reality, and
exemplify solutions that truly lead to accessibility for everyone.
