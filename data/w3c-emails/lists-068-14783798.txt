I'll drink to that! In fact that may be how most pages are built. We seem 
to be stuck on the idea that there are *real* tables and then there are 
layout tables, when in fact the former are merely an almost trivial case of 
the latter which, to most people with nerdlessness is what tables *really* 
are. So-called data tables in that view are simply one way to depict 
"stuff" which may or may not have the old row/column relationship. Just as 
spread sheets are used for a lot of unrelated to the usual, so tables are a 
conceptual entity usually described visually - but not necessarily so.

One of the reasons for eschewing "layout tables" (dumb access systems) 
probably isn't all that big a deal any more?
