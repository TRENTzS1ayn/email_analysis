There are huge, vast amounts of things which are commonly done with
web pages which don't even begin to come close to being captured
in any version of XHTML.  HTML -- X or otherwise -- is a downright
lousy language for web design.

(Or the main one -- this is why so many people are flocking to
Flash or other quick fixes!)
