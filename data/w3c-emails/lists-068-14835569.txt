This is what I was trying to say but much more *real-world*!

In the final analysis I believe (*strongly*?) that this is far more in the 
purview of EO than GL - sort of "GL propose - EO dispose". If the charter 
says elsewise, it's just wrong.

If we bother our pretty little heads about whether CSS is well-supported or 
that tables are being used for layout (or that people still use <font>, 
etc., etc., etc., etc.) then we can not do the necessarily 
forward-compatible stuff that's at the heart of making new 
guidelines/checkpoints.

Please some chairperson declare this entire avenue (at least for GL) a 
*rathole*.

ENOUGH ALREADY!
