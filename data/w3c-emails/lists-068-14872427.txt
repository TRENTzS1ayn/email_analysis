If we don't bother our pretty little heads about what actually works now then
we are doing people a disservice - telling them "just wait until the world is
perfect". Most of them have waited long enough.

On the other hand, if we don't understand where the technology is going, and
how we expect the future to be, then we are doing people a disservice -
telling them "this will work for now, but when things change you will be left
behind (again)".

We actually need to cover both parts.

  This is what I was trying to say but much more *real-world*!

  In the final analysis I believe (*strongly*?) that this is far more in the
  purview of EO than GL - sort of "GL propose - EO dispose". If the charter
  says elsewise, it's just wrong.

  If we bother our pretty little heads about whether CSS is well-supported or
  that tables are being used for layout (or that people still use <font>,
  etc., etc., etc., etc.) then we can not do the necessarily
  forward-compatible stuff that's at the heart of making new
  guidelines/checkpoints.

  Please some chairperson declare this entire avenue (at least for GL) a
  *rathole*.

  ENOUGH ALREADY!
