Dear Marti,
I use a Mac (about half the time) and have just started with DreamWeaver (on
both platforms).  Please be assured that neither one is a particular barrier
to accessibility.  I don't have a good answer for you with regard to XHML
gui editors, except maybe Amaya and Allaire ColdFushion -- but neither of
them have been ported to the Mac.  Hopefully the people have all jumped to
Navigator 6.  The last 4x version is SO broken when it comes to CSS and HTML
4 specific code.
Good luck,
Bruce
