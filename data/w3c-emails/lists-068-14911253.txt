Let's get specific.

Do we go back to "until user agents" and detail how to do stuff without 
using CSS?

Do we ignore SMIL, SVG, and other probably-long-time-a-coming stuff and not 
have them as notions informing checkpoints?

What do we do about LONGDESC? SUMMARY? TITLE? and their different renderings?

Without "just say no" attitude, how do we get into "both parts" in regard 
to having scripts do good stuff but allow excision of bad stuff? Are we 
even equipped to have techniques for script/applet/object preparations?

What does "synchronization" of multimedia mean to a user with a 386 and 4 
MB of memory and a 20 MB Hard Drive?

Have we a glossary entry for "normative"?

If as is claimed 96% of all systems in use have capability of displaying 
Flash or delivering RealMedia are the other 4% (of which it is likely that 
an inordinately high proportion are our clients) to stare hopelessly across 
that particular arm of the digital divide?
