With regard to XML editors, although I know of none (in GUI form) for the
Mac, there are several available in Java. THese should at least run happily
under OS X.

  Dear Marti,
  I use a Mac (about half the time) and have just started with DreamWeaver (on
  both platforms).  Please be assured that neither one is a particular barrier
  to accessibility.  I don't have a good answer for you with regard to XHML
  gui editors, except maybe Amaya and Allaire ColdFushion -- but neither of
  them have been ported to the Mac.  Hopefully the people have all jumped to
  Navigator 6.  The last 4x version is SO broken when it comes to CSS and HTML
  4 specific code.
  Good luck,
  Bruce
