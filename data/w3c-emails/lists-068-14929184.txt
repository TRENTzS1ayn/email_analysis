Thanks, this is useful. I actually do see some good reasons for trying to
move people to XML in a "web publishing" environment.  I think the way it
makes you think about data structure is great, and for those who are doing
"content" getting them to put a tag like <Chapter_title> on a page seems
more doable than <Hn>.  I am just at a bit of a loss on "tools" and
"methods" to make such a plan work in the real world.
