OK, I agree with you about XML in principle, but I think in practice getting
people to do it through XHTML is the easiest learning curve. When people have
Mac OS X with decent Java support there may be other options on the Mac, but
at the moment I find it a bit difficult.

  Thanks, this is useful. I actually do see some good reasons for trying to

  "content" getting them to put a tag like <Chapter_title> on a page seems
  more doable than <Hn>.  I am just at a bit of a loss on "tools" and
  "methods" to make such a plan work in the real world.
