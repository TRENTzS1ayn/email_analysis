There is a very simple transition  path. Use an XHTML aware editor, or run
your page through Tidy before publishing.

It provides smallish returns, ubt significant ones. Like it is possible to
use XSLT on it, and it works in XML tools as well as HTML browsers. And it
gets people thinking in the right direction...

  what real world reason is there for people to take the extra steps to
  implement that?
