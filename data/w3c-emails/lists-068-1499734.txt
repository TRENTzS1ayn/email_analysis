Well put William.

In other words, WCAG does not say what web designers or owners have to do.

It only says what's accessible.   That's what the definitions of Priority 
1, 2, 3 are.  Difficulty of making something accessible may be relevant 
when people decide if they are going to make it accessible, but it isn't 
relevant to the question of whether is accessible or not.

It's similar to UL approval.  Underwriters Laboratories doesn't decree that 
all lamps be UL approved.  They just say what's safe.  This severely limits 
the aesthetic freedom of lamp designers (e.g. thick, ugly 
rubber/plastic/cotton insulation instead of shiny, thin, bare metal 
wires).  But lamp companies are perfectly free to offer lamps that aren't 
UL approved.  It's just that it limits their market, especially where 
customers decide that safety is more important than some particular 
asethetic; and they find lamps designed by other designers with the 
creativity to make lamps both attractive and safe.
