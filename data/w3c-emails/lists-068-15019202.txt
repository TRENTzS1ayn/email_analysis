Currently the Stop button doesn't stop everything as far as I know - as Matt
says, scripts are a different case. So the requirement on a User Agent needs
to be "make the page sit still, and it shouldbe clear that this includes
motion effects due to scripting. I think it mostly is, but I will take an
action item to look at that if someone promises to remind me in a few days
that I said I would.

  In the case of the walking ants, the Stop button can't control that. All it
  controls in IE on Windows, for example, is embedded audio and animated GIFs.
  It's not a standard. Actually, the Stop button itself isn't even a standard
  insofar as it's a user-agent widget. UAAG would have to specify its
  behavior, and even then, the walking-ants analogy would probably sneak
  through, as the Stop button would have to stop script execution on the page
  to stop the motion of the ants, and there's no way to selectively disable
  scripts or (that I'm aware of) to force cleanup/garbage collection on any
  given script.
