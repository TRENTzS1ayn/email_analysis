Well, that's assuming that XHTML 2.0 is viewed as the solution.  At
the Device Indepencence Working Group meeting last week in Boston,
there was talk of the need for a possible "Single Authoring
Markup Language" (which I quickly dubbed SAML) -- not a real
name -- which specifically was _not_ XHTML 2.  Of course, I suspect
that for political reasons (read: the W3C has too much invested
in the XHTML concept and there are powerful people within the
W3C on that working group), any attempt to write such a language
and get it accepted would be shot down.

A shame, really, since placing all eggs in one basket -- the
XHTML 2 basket -- is a really, really, really bad idea.  XHTML 2
does not do the kinds of things that many people need from a
SAML.
