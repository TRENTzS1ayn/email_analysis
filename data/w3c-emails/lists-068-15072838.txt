I agree that this is an until user agents issue. Albeit an important one. I
suspect that for people who have difficulties with concentration, short-term
memory anbd the like this is a ore serious issue than it is for people who
are blind or using substantial screen magnification (two other groups of
people who will not necessarily realise immediately that a new window has
been created).

I believe that Opera and iCab offer the opportunity not to have new windows
created, although I ahven't checked. As far as I know IE and Netscape haven't
got this far yet.

My informal observation of people who are using a screen reader in a
situation where a new window comes up is that they figure out
what is happening reasonably fast, but that re-establishing context is not
instantaneous, and can be a considerable annoyance.

  distract a screen-reader is not so helpful in content guidelines, it's a UA
  issue and could easily be handled by a good piece of software (anyone know
  what the IBM reader does here?).  It would be good to hear from some blind

  I think that there is consensus that opening a new window is not, ever, a
  good thing. It confuses navigation. (Imagine a non sited person who is moved
  without her knowledge to a pop up window and then tries the back button -
  disorienting the user.)
