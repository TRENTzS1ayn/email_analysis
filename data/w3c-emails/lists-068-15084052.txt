I have to say that I doubt Microsoft and AOL will ever get that far. This is
a case where not only does the content-provider community have a reason to
disobey, the user-agent makers do as well. Specifically, AOL Time Warner
owns a bunch of sites which derive revenue from pop-ups, including Netscape
NetCenter itself. Also, pop-up windows may or may not provide information
relevant to the task the user is trying to do, and shutting it down on the
UA side could break sites at the user's end by preventing necessary user
interaction. I think the issue is one WCAG either owns, or shares with UAAG.
