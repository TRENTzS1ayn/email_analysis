Should we then have one of these also for all Gestalt and visual perception 
related laws, such as, don't rely on proximity/texture/size/shape alone to 
point out similarities/differencies? Don't rely on good continuation or 
closure alone.

When the image and alt text are alternatives this probably does not matter. 
However, when someone tries to get information of SVG objects in an image 
and how they relate to each other there is probably a difference. And also 
in HTML, if some elements but not all are presented in a similar way, 
should we ask the user to provide class information too so that those not 
able to see the visual cues can still make a connection?

Authors could provide enough semantic information so that users don't have 
to rely on visual presentation. And when they do provide the semantics it 
also becomes easier to change the presentation with stylesheets.
