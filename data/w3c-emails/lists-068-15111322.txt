If that "could" moves through "should" towards "must" we'd be getting well 
along.

The general aim of "repurposing" demands that in many cases authors (or the 
choice mechanisms provided for selection/presentation of content) must 
convey what they mean, i.e. the underlying semantics of whatever 
structural/presentational elements they use.

This process is involved in all the principles, particularly 
"Transformable" and "Controllable". Of course the conveyance must be 
"Comprehensible" and attention need be paid to "Compatible".
