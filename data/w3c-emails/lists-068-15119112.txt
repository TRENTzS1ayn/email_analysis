I often use the definition below for images and their captions. I though it 
enhances accessibility and makes it easier to change styles.

When Jose saw it he asked if Amaya should help to produce that to enhance 
accessibility. Using the same classes consistently sounded like a good idea 
and I promised some checkpoints to back this practice up.  When I carefully 
rechecked the guidelines, the only thing I could find was 12.3 . Guideline 
3 and 13 somehow support this, but there are no checkpoints that I could 
apply to this.

So should we say something more explicit or is it that there are no 
accessibility benefits in doing this and I should stop?
