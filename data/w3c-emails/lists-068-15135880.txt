Hi everyone, I was given several action items at the Boston face-to-
face.  Some I was pleased with, others are the start of what will
need some discussion and other thoughts.

This is one of them:  Checkpoint 2.1.  I'm not overly pleased with this
so far, but I think it identifies a few points that could be useful.
Note:  I consider "navigation" to be a specific case of "interactions"
and thus it may not be necessary to separate the two -- except if
it's necessary for clarity's sake.

Action Item:  Rewrite 2.1, possibly splitting into two guidelines

2.1  Provide a variety of navigation mechanisms

      <glossary>Navigation mechanisms</glossary> help
      the user find information on your site.  Providing
      more than one navigation mechanism makes content
      easier to locate and use.

      ISSUE:  What does "a variety" mean?  By this guideline
      I mean "use a site map, use a search feature, use navigation
      bars" etc.

3.X  Provide consistent interaction behaviors
(should follow WD-WCAG20-20010125 guideline 3.1)

      <glossary>Interaction behaviors</glossary> are the
      results of user actions.  They include, for example:
      * events caused by the user activating a link
      * rollover effects and popup menus
      * form submission, after activating a submit
        button
      * interface controls within applets or scripts

      These actions should be predictable and sensible
      to the end user; this is achieved by making the
      interactions consistent, both within the site
      and with commonly used models of computer
      interaction.

      ISSUE:  Should there be a separate checkpoint for navigation
      consistency?  If so, how do we define navigation consistency?
