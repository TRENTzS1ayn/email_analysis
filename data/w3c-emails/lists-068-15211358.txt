I can see how it would help with styles.  But I'm not sure exactly
how it would help with accessibility.

No reason to stop, necessarily.

It's somewhat interesting but I'm not sure what you actually do with
the information you're encoding here.  How you style and/or transform
this content would create the value here, not just the encoding of
meaning/intent.  (Current browsers don't, to the best of my knowledge,
do anything useful with this.)

What you're trying to capture here would be expressed in (arbitrary)
XML as something like:

<figure id="Fig-1">
   <image src="architecture.png">
     Basic architecture showing the communication between the
     client and the annotation servers.
   </image>
   <caption>
     The basic architecture of Annotea.
   </caption>
</figure>

...but then how you use that information will be very dependent upon
how you use it.  ("Style and/or transform" in my paragraph above.)

(X)HTML unfortunately doesn't have a rich enough set of presentation to
express what we want, but there are several ways to render this which
might work -- such as using the <table> tag to group related content:

<table summary="Figure Fig-1: The basic architecture of Annotea."
        class="figure">
   <caption>
     Figure 1: The basic architecture of Annotea.
   </caption>
   <tr>
     <td>
       <img src="architecture.png" alt="Basic architecture showing the
            communication between the client and annotation servers."/>
     </td>
   </tr>
</table>

(The above can be generated from the XML using XSLT relatively easily.)

Or, as you've done in the original, you can use <div> for this kind of
thing.  Or some other presentation depending on what you're trying to
accomplish.

Note that this example is by necessity limited; no longdesc is
given which fully explains the architecture, and the caption and
the alt attribute provide pretty much identical information -- a more
complete example would be something like:

<figure id="Fig-1">
   <image src="architecture.png">
     Basic architecture showing the communication between the
     client and the annotation servers.
   </image>
   <caption>
     The basic architecture of Annotea.
   </caption>
   <longdesc>
     <p>
       When a client requests an annotation from a blah blah blah
       blah blah blah
     </p>
     <p>
       ...
       and that's how it works.
     </p>
   </longdesc>
</figure>

Or possibly just:

<figure id="Fig-1">
   <image src="architecture.png">
     Basic architecture showing the communication between the
     client and the annotation servers.
   </image>
   <caption>
     The basic architecture of Annotea.
   </caption>
   <longdesc href="arch_desc#1.html"/>
</figure>

My basic comment is that you wouldn't want to write your _content_ in the
manner you describe -- you hopefully would want to write it in non-XHTML
XML -- but that the way you produced output markup from that content is
okay but not the only way to present that type of information.  (Which
serves to illustrate a weakness with (X)HTML -- multiple ways of
presenting the same semantic mean that it is a poor language for encoding
semantics!)
