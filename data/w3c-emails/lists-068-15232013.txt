How?  There is no obvious relationship encoded in the markup.

In what user agents can you make this distinction?

Yes, but using classes in user-defined stylesheets is highly
problematic, because classes are not meant to be universal over the
range of web sites.  A user relying upon specific class names can
easily -introduce- accessibility errors.

(And of course anything that requires the user to be able to code CSS
is a bad solution.)

How?

How?  What user agents do this?

Marja, I don't understand how you think the stated benefits actually
occur from the type of markup you used.  Yes, those are the right -ideas-,
but saying that encoding the page thusly in (X)HTML produces those
benefits is incorrect, since I don't believe that any of them actually
-work- as you'd like them to work.  You could say the same thing about
encoding it in XML as well, and it probably makes more sense to do
so since the way you want to use classes is not the way classes work,
either in practice or in theory.  They are the wrong mechanism for
doing what you want to do here.

((X)HTML lacks such a mechanism, which is the root of the problem.)
