It's nice to find something on which to agree with Kynn!

Also this is in some sense "checkable". We can certainly check if there is 
a "simplified reading level version" in a document and decide within an 
authoring tool whether to prompt the author for such based on some of the 
"fog index" sorts of tools. To put something as vague as "clear & simple" 
in a checkpoint with no criteria for deciding when you've met it is beyond 
silly.

We don't have a checkpoint advising spell/grammar/punctuation checking. 
"Write well" is about as effective as "drive carefully". We intend to do 
both but...
