I was trying to see a bit further than what we may or may not have today as 
there is always that chicken and egg problem.

Many things maybe cumbersome now, but when user agent let users to have 
several ways to browse the pages and the elements on the pages, it could be 
different. At least at one point the UA guidelines had all kinds of 
browsing mechanism that should be offered to the user. Maybe a site could 
even provide some accessibility friendly metadata of the class or other 
conventions they are using.

I don't know how you want to use XML elements for these conventions, for 
instance, if you use SVG and have several triangle elements belonging to 
different categories according to their appearance, (e.g. color and texture 
and how they move) would it be better to not tell to the user looking the 
markup that they are actually related than use some available mechanisms, 
such as symbols, classes and stylesheets?

And I know very well, there are no conventions for classes but my question 
is should we try to support authors to make them? At least at the site 
level? And how could that then help accessibility? I  would think it helps 
at least offering the users some ready made alternative style sheets. And 
if nothing else it helps managing the site stylesheets.
