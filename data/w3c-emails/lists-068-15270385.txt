Marja,

When you include the following:

<div class="figure" id="Fig-1">
<p><img src="architecture.png"
alt="Basic architecture showing the communication between the client and 
the annotation servers."></p>

<p class="caption">Figure 1: The basic architecture of Annotea.</p>
</div>

What is different in the presentation over just using 

<img src="architecture.png" alt="Basic architecture showing the
communication between the client and the annotation servers">

Does the caption appear in the visual presentation? Is the caption read in
a speech reader? Does the information in div class ever get presented to a
user who doesn't read the source code? What devices or browsers pass this
on to the user? 

Anne
