I also think this is an important issue.

Having said that I also believe that a formal "checkpoint" is not how we 
should address this problem. I have come to believe that checkpoints should 
be checkable, though perhaps not entirely automatically, but at least 
sensibly. While I may agree that illustrations being called for will lead 
to something useful/checkable/effective I am no longer persuaded that 
anything in the checkpoint department concerning clear/simple will serve 
much purpose.

It is of course mandatory to "address this problem" and our only 
disagreement is where/how to do so. I suggest as many of us as feel able to 
do so, write some language to deal with this and suggest where it might 
best be used. I think the very idea of a checkpoint is undermined by this 
particular very important thing being where it is.
