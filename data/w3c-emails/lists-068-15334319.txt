Matt,

    As a career teacher, I have made a huge number of decisions based on
readability scales. A few weren't worth their salt, but those based on
syllable and word density were extremely useful, and clearly indicated
which material would be usable by which student based on a decent test of
their reading ability. 

As a writer, I typically addressed those with one or more degrees in
education, and my writing starts out at a high level on a reading scale. In
order to make myself understandable to school children, I have to simplify
and clarify, include illustrations, and define terms ... It does take some
work to bring it down, but it's do-able, and if the checkpoints specify
"generic" reading level ranges, and exclude all quotable and copyrighted
content, I don't see that it deserves to be flushed ...

Anne
