I was a journalism major, and I would have a hard time going over my sites
to determine how appropriate their content would be, relative to media
style guidelines (of which there are many, and none of them normative).

And we're not dealing with professional writers. Many content providers
may never have even had formal composition. It's unworkable.

I don't have that on Word 97. I don't think the W3C would like to
require Microsoft Word or FrontPage as authoring tools, anyway. Even if
they did, arriving within some chosen acceptable range doesn't ensure it's
accessible in any manner like 1.1 makes non-text objects accessible.

I won't go into the trouble with legacy content compliance, though I
reserve that right in advance.
