Matt,

You do have it on Word 97. Run Spell Check, and go into options, click on
checkbox for readability information, and you will have more than you will
want to know about how readably your text is.

The fact that some members of the committee have their noses out of joint
with Microsoft doesn't change the fact that many web authors, especially
those who aren't high on the html hierarchy, use Word ...
The guidelines need to be neutral on tools ... any computer-generated
readabilty level based on syllables and words per sentence would work just
as well .... 

The fact that it is "easy" to order that everything that isn't text be
made text, isn't reason enough to kick out checkpoints that bring real
accessibility to disabled human beings trying to use the web.

Anne
