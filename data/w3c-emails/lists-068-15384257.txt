Another good issue.  Probably a "techniques" issue but I don't 
mean with that suggestion that we put off the discussion of this!
Techniques or checkpoint/guideline, we definitely need to arrive
at a decision on this.

A good source of info on this is the O'Reilly book "Information

in my online course on Web Management.
