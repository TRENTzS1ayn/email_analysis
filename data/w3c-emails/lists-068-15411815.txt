Then it's a poorly written web site.  It's one that doesn't know
how to write for its audience.  And it violates a lot of OTHER
checkpoints other than just "write well" in the draft WCAG 2.0.

Is it an accessibility error if I am writing a page for Americans
and I write it in German?  No, it's really a case of content written
poorly, no matter what the medium, without any regard for the
audience.

Why not?

You described a specific page written for a specific audience,
which does not take into account that audience's needs.  That does
not extrapolate to a general rule, and when we are writing
checkpoints, we are writing general rules.
