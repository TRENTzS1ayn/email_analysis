Matt,

The point of using Word is to check the reading level, not to produce the
html.... Word is a tool .... one of several ... whether or not it's open
source is immaterial to accessibility. If there eis a tool that does this
in open source, that's fine, but if not, use the tools that exist no matter
who makes them. 

Writing a summary that tells folks to make content readable is not going
to be effective. It will be largely ignored, especially is there is no clue
or suggestion on how to know when you've made your text usable.
