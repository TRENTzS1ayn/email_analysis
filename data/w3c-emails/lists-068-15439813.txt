William,

I'm not sure on this, but I think material needs to be published, or at
least completed before it is copyrighted, so content that is being worked
on to include in a page, is not yet copyrighted. And, it would be best if
it were copyrighted at an average reading level. Content that presumes
pre-knowledge isn't exempt from requiring an average reading level, and
it's no more difficult to do than any other content. Poetry can be treated
as a "quote", and sarcasm is either readable and understandable, or it
fails, so it can be included under the content that must be understandable
to be accessible. 

Anne
