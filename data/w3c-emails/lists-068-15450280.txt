Kynn,

       A site that is poorly written may or may not be "inaccessible" ...
but when the writing is so inappropriate that its "inaccessible" to the
audience, it should come under the umbrella we are supposed to be
providing. Why? Because our mission is to serve people with disabilities,
and those with disabilities that affect reading are a large segment of the
disabled population. If we cannot craft checkpoints to enable their use of
web sites, we have failed our mission no matter how many sites use fancy
semantics that don't deliver the goods.
