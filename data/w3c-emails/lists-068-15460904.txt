While I can certainly see the point about government websites (and
documents, anybody try to read the Tax Code lately?) I don't see how an
average reading level requirement can be applied to something like a Physics
Thesis.  While such a document 'might' be written at a 6th-8th grade reading
level, I doubt the author would get the degree.
It there a way to perhaps distinguish between things written for the web and
things that are "also published" on the web?
