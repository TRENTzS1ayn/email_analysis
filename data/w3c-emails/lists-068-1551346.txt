Charles,
I heartily agree we should revisit Guideline 1, and put all forms of
content on equal footing. Visual Graphical, Visual Text, Auditory
Instrumental, Auditory Text, and Tactual, both touchy-feely, and braille.
The web is so much more than text, and is likely to grow outward to new
applications than inward to text. 

Anne
