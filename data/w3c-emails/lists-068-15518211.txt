Marti,

    Marti, I don't think the point of writing a physics thesis is to
publish it on the web. Perhaps I'm wrong on this, but it seems to me that
the decision to get the degree would be based on the thesis itself, not on
it's web presentation.  Also, a physic thesis isn't gonig to have the
general public as an audience, any more than trade journals will. Web sites
that have highly specialized or limited audiences probably need exceptions
to a variety of the requirements we make for accessibility, not just the
reading level. 

If the Tax Code was put on the web, it would be a quoted item and not need
to be readable but to it's specialized audience ... on the other hand,
pages that explain, instruct, and otherwise aide in understanding the tax
code should bend over backwards to be accessible in all areas and
especially reading level. 

Anne
