I can't go for "will" in this case. I just don't think it is at all clear 
that use of a "fog index" has a high positive correlation with "clear 
writing" - particularly since agreement on the latter's achievement is 
extremely difficult to measure.

If there is a way to do this, bottle it and save the rain forests because 
there'll be a lot less paper used.
