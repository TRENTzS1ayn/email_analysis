Yes.  Well stated.  I agree.

I have always told people that web accessibility is a mindset -- a
methodology, a way of solving problems, a view of the web -- not a
series of binary checkpoints.

At risk of beating a drum, I really need to emphasize that the above
description -- which has been used by a number of people to illustrate
the problem -- is incomplete because it is really only along one
axis.  There are -numerous- reasons to try to communicate, and applying
a fog index (e.g.) to -every- form of written or verbal communication
is improper.  E.g., editorials, advertisements, parodies, humor,
fiction, and a vast number of other content types are even -harder-
to apply such a standard to.
