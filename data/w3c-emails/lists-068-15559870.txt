AG::  I suspect that the difference in assessment here may be based on
different assumptions about how the results of the tool are applied.  I
absolutely agree that a mindless application of what the tool tells you can
reduce valuable artistry to mindless mush.

Let me just try to communicate my experience.  What I find is that the points
where I actually decide to change how I wrote something are a distinct
minority
of the cases where a mechanical checker raises issues.  [With a human
editor it
is closer to 50:50.]  But I rarely check a piece of writing without the
checker
turning up _some_ warning where I am really glad that I got nudged to change
what I had written.

I guess I am extrapolating from this "change the glaring problems, but only a
minority of the grumble-generating points" behavior in my expectations for the
application of reading level tools.  A reasonably stupid tool, in the hands of
a good writer, can generate perceptible improvement, but the smartest tool we
have won't save a clueless writer.

I suppose I am also in particular extrapolating from my experience using a
grammar critic.  Not just an overall reading-level score.  I would think that
reading level is most useful as a tuning parameter in a critic tool.  But the
critic will flag specific points of pain in the text, not just render a bottom
line score.  That is, I believe, the scenario where I expect it to be [not
everywhere, but often] an appreciable help.
