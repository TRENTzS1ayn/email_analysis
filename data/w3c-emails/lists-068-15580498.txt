Just going through the techniques doc for WCAG 1.0. I'm surprised at the

7.4.3 Client-side versus server-side image maps
Checkpoints in this section:

   9.1 Provide client-side image maps instead of server-side image maps
except where the regions cannot be defined with an available geometric
shape. [Priority 1]


7.4.4 Server-side image maps
Checkpoints in this section:

   1.2 Provide redundant text links for each active region of a server-side
image map. [Priority 1]
