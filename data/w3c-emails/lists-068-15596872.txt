The first point says, replace all server-side imagemaps by client-side ones,
except where it's not possible.

The second point says, add redundant links for all server-side imagemaps
[remaining]. But, because of the first point, the only server-side maps
remaining are those that can't actually be converted into client-side
imagemaps.  In this case, it would then be impossible to actually list the
links of the map, and the second point is invalid.

Not sure I understand the flub.

Can you explain how they contradict each other?
