Are there regions that cannot be described by a polygon? I don't think so.
There are some pretty incredible regions at, for example,
http://www.microsoft.com/usa/map.asp. (Mathematically, regions can be
described with polygons). So 9.1 really says provide client-side image maps.
That being said, I don't see the accessibility problem with the server side
map at http://www.metrokc.gov/ (King Co., Washington) having, as it does,
text links at the bottom. That organization even provides a kind of skip
navigation technique.

Just going through the techniques doc for WCAG 1.0. I'm surprised at the
following flub. When these techniques make their way into the HTML specific
techniques, 7.4.4 should be removed as it contradicts 7.4.3.

7.4.3 Client-side versus server-side image maps
Checkpoints in this section:

   9.1 Provide client-side image maps instead of server-side image maps
except where the regions cannot be defined with an available geometric
shape. [Priority 1]


7.4.4 Server-side image maps
Checkpoints in this section:

   1.2 Provide redundant text links for each active region of a server-side
image map. [Priority 1]
