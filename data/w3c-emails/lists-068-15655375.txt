Al,

Chatting with a 2nd grade teacher who is ready and waiting for the
Internet link to arrive in her room (equipment and wiring in place awaiting
the techie's time)... we have both been doing a lot of searching on the web
for stuff related to what she is teaching and coming up dry most often
because of steep reading levels and lack of illustrations ... looking up
"Solids, Liquids and Gases" was a bust! Nothing less than college level
interpretations ... Today was the "Science Fair", and a few second graders
chose that topic and did a better job of showing the simple meanings of
those terms than any web page I found! If I was working in a school for the
blind, I would be having the same difficulty!  

The National Science Foundation works at many levels. A few years ago I
served on a Review Board for an NSF-funded project in West Virginia that
had elementary children logging into the Internet to submit findings from
studies of the local streams ... data that was used by state officials to
determine pollution from coal mines and runoff ... My only fault with NSF
was their dogged determination to keep any language arts componants out of
their "science" project!  

In addition to aiding many disabled adults, and those who don't consider
themselves "disabled", but have difficulty reading, the web can fulfill
it's promise to the lowest levels of educational needs ...

A second grade teacher can easily use materials at a fifth grade reading
level (a bit under what I estimate to be "average" or "general" audience)
with her class by reading and amplifying it with them (which is easier if
there are good illustrations with the text), and fifth grade teachers can
do the same with up to about 10th grade level materials ... again,
illustrations make the task easier ... When a cognitively disabled user is
on the web by himself, he doesn't have the advantage of a teacher --- he
must depend on the page author to provide usable content, or click on the
back button ...
