Hi,
Can I recommend reviewing Tom's fantastic presentation at the  device
independent workshop last November. The link is at
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/DIAWorkshop/pereira/accessiblenavigation.html

He clearly stated the need for clear writing.

Of course Shakespeare can not be reworded. That has to be built into the
guideline - like what we did for text in images,  like:
>
"When their is no other restrictions on  writing style used, and when the
function of the text is only to convey information use the following style
guideline, or a format that will further increase comprehension."

Do not look at  the wording, just the concept.

Please note, Kynn, when there are problem, you have to look for solution not
just give up and through the baby out with the bath water. This checkpoint
is hard to get right, but for millions of people it is the biggest barrier
to the content.
Lets work at it some more.

Lisa

>>Action Item:  Deconstruct 3.3
>>
>>Currently:
>>
>>3.3  Write clearly and simply.
>>      This checkpoint addresses the need to facilitate comprehension
>>of the content
>>      by all readers, especially those with cognitive disabilities. It
>>should not

>>
>>Okay, let's look at what this checkpoint is trying to say.
>>
>>* You shouldn't write in an overly obfuscated manner, if at all possible.
>>
>>* This will have benefits for people who have lower reading levels, for
>>   whatever reason (cognitive disabilities, lack of education, lack of
>>   language skills, youth, etc.)
>>
>>* This also has benefits for translation purposes; it's easier to
translate
>>   a straightforward writing style than an idiosyncratic style.
>>
>>* The checkpoint as written explicitly recognize that there are
>"exceptions"
>>   for technical writing.
>>
>>The problems with this checkpoint:
>>
>>* It's uncheckable since it sets no specific metrics to know if you have
>>   adequately met the checkpoint's requirements.
>>
>>* No sense is given of the _audience_ of the content; content written for
>>   a specific audience (say, lawyers) can (and should) be more complex
than
>>   information written for a "general audience."  (However, often web
>>   content providers may underestimate the diversity of their audiences.)
>>
>>* There is no exception for specific content that -must- be written in
>>   certain "complex" formats, such as:
>>   - Transcripts of speeches:  you should not rewrite what the President
>>     says just because you are putting the speech on the web
>>   - Legal documents:  you should not rewrite legal language merely
>>     because you are placing it on the web
>>   - Literature:  you can't rewrite shakespeare just because you are
>>     putting a version on the web
>>   - <!-- other examples are possible -->
>>
>>* As well, there are a number of content types which specifically
>>   should not be forced into a "simple style", such as:
>>   - Rhetoric and opinion pieces:  I'm thinking here of things such as
>>     sarcasm, parody, and satire
>>   - Riddles, jokes, and puns:  explaining the joke often ruins the
>>     humor value
>>   - Poetry and creative writing:  some works of writing are specifically
>>     meant to not be "easily understood" and the meaning must be inferred
>>   - <!-- other examples are possible -->
>>
>>So, this checkpoint is problematic as written.
>>
>>Suggestion:  Remove the checkpoint entirely
>>
>>This is based on the idea that while we can tell people how to present
>>content, we shouldn't be telling them what kinds of content to present.
>>Saying that text content must be written in a specific manner goes
>>beyond simply stating requirements for how to convey something in the
>>web medium; it demands fundamental changes to the content itself on
>>the expressive level.
>>
>>(I maintain that...) There is no good way to craft a "write well"
>>checkpoint that is checkable, audience centric, and universally
applicable.
>>Inclusion of a vague checkpoint of this nature serves to weaken the
>>guidelines and confuse the issue of accessibility.
>>
>>Rather than requiring textual rewriting, we should concentrate on how
>>the specific features of the web medium can be used to enhance text
>>which is confusing -- for example, by suggesting links to a glossary,
>>annotation, or simpler explanation be added, as done in 3.5, 3.6, and
>>3.7.
>>
>>Here's an example.  If you are placing the Constitution of the United
>>States online, you would not make it "more accessible" by rewriting it
>>in contemporary, simple language.  Rather, you would provide the
>>text as is, but add, for example, sidebar links, glossary terms, and
>>most likely some simple explanations for complex information.  But you
>>would _not_ rewrite the original text.  The checkpoint as written
>>implies that you _should_ and thus it is defective.  Instead we need
>>to concentrate on suggesting that users _supplement_ their text when
>>appropriate (and even _that_ is very hard to make checkable, isn't
>>it?).
