Although a server side map is just a collection of points, so in theory could
be broken into a big pile of 1x1 squares, there are practical reasons for
having them in some cases.

For example, mapping applications will generate a map on the fly from a much
larger store of information, send it down, and then when a point is selected
on the map generate a new one based on that point. The practical value of a
client-side image map is in part that it can have alternatives associated
with the destination of each hotspot. But in fact is not always very easy to
provide useful alternatives - for example in the mapping scenario.

An alternative technique for doing this might be as follows:

Use SVG to create the maps. Make each street a "hot" object, with the default
activation behaviour to get a new map based on that point. The basic
algorithm can be based on the client side on DOM changes or animations to a
use element. On the server side you could implement the same algorithms, but
you might choose to use a different processing language (or not...)

  Are servers side imagemaps mentioned in WCAG 2.0?
