It could be.  It surely doesn't -have- to be.

And image buttons generally function the same way as server-side
imagemaps, for that matter.  They send x and y coordinates.

I don't think there are client-side equivalents for image input
fields -- are there?

So this might be a case in which you might HAVE to use 
server-side map to translate an image input field, and you
can't just use a client-side image map.

(Maybe we should point this out to P&F who can point this out to
XHTML working group?)
