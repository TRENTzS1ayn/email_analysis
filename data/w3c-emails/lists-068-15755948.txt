Those of you interested in working on ECMA/Javascripting techniques, 
perhaps we could pull something together for this session so that 
accessibility is represented?

>The World Wide Web started as a text-only medium.  The first version of
>the
>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) specification did not have the
>capability
>to include graphics on a page.  Today's Web sites can include a wealth
>of
>features: graphics, sounds, animation, video, etc.  Web scripting
>languages,
>such as JavaScript, contribute to these advanced features, which make
>the
>web much more useful and usable than before.
>
>This interactive demonstration session aims to provide information about
>the
>needs in using JavaScript during prototyping a web user interface and
>examples of how JavaScript works.  The purpose of the session is to
>share
>experiences in applying and programming JavaScript for Web user
>interfaces.
>
>The session requires the presenters give examples of browser-based user
>interface prototype where JavaScript is needed and examples of the
>JavaScript.  At the end of session, audience should be able to walk away
>with these examples and use them more easily in their browser-based UI
>design work. Another consequence of the session may be a Web site hosted
>on
>the HFES server that can be used to educate human factors and ergonomics
>professionals in the JavaScript techniques as well as to post requests
>for
>and publish JavaScripts useful for prototyping web user interface
>elements.
>
>Topics include:
>
>- Examples of JavaScript used in user interface prototyping
>- Examples of why JavaScript is needed
>- Examples of what JavaScript is good for
>- Examples of Web interface prototyping needs addressed by JavaScript
>- Examples of the alternatives to JavaScript
>- Examples of how JavaScript fits into a Web page
>
>This is a call for contributes to this interactive demonstration
>session.
>Please prepare 200 - 500 word abstract and the full version of
>JavaScript
>that you plan to share.
>
>Please send your proposal to Cindy Lu (cindylu@lucent.com)or Gary Beck
>(garybeck@lucent.com) via e-mail by March 14. You will be notified
>whether
>your proposal is accepted by March 31 for this proposed session.
