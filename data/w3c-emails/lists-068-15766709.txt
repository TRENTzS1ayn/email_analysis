  It could be.  It surely doesn't -have- to be.

  And image buttons generally function the same way as server-side
  imagemaps, for that matter.  They send x and y coordinates.

  I don't think there are client-side equivalents for image input
  fields -- are there?

  So this might be a case in which you might HAVE to use
  server-side map to translate an image input field, and you
  can't just use a client-side image map.

  (Maybe we should point this out to P&F who can point this out to
  XHTML working group?)
