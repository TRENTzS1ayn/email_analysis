Why was this brought up?

Was there support for calling them "techniques"?

Isn't it a bit late to be changing this since the consensus was reached a 
few years ago? Where were the "opposition" then?

The words "techniques document" although referring to a non-normative item 
might themselves be normative?

Isn't this like the argument we resolved about "principles" vs. "guidelines"?
