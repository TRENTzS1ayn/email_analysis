Yes. It is an ongoing discussion of something that is fairly arbitrary. But
it is very difficult to discuss things if we don't have some common ways of
talking about them - like using the same names, and meaning the same things.

  Why was this brought up?

  Was there support for calling them "techniques"?

  Isn't it a bit late to be changing this since the consensus was reached a
  few years ago? Where were the "opposition" then?

  The words "techniques document" although referring to a non-normative item
  might themselves be normative?

  Isn't this like the argument we resolved about "principles" vs. "guidelines"?
