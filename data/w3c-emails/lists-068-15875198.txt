To:"GL - WAI Guidelines WG (E-mail)"<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>



The following is  the proposal based on everyone's ideas so far and the
discussion in the GL call today.


1)  There is a WCAG Base document which provides the level 1 and Level 2
items
     (For the time being the three levels are being called
             Level 1 - Guidelines
             Level 2 - Checkpoints
             Level 3 - Checkpoint Solutions


2)  There are a series of documents which we call  Technology Specific
Checkpoint Solutions

These documents use the Level 1 Guidelines as divisions
The level 2 items are checkpoints in the document


3)  Under each Checkpoint are a series of conditionals that read like
- If you use the IMG tag than you must do one of the following

Under that conditional - you list all of the things that are acceptable
checkpoint solutions (which could be a set of things) for that checkpoint
and that condition.
     -    The second last item in the list is always:   "Alternate
Equivalent Solution" ...... though if you use an equivalent method you must
document it on your website.)
     -    The last item is a statement that this element is not used.  Such
as "IMG tag is not used"

For EACH conditional they MUST then do one of the items or item sets in the
list (which includes "EQUIVALENT" and "NOT USED")


4)  If they are able to check one "checkpoint solution"   for each
conditional under a checkpoint then they can check off the Checkpoint.


5)   To be Compliant at any level, you must have checked off all the
checkpoints for that level.
(this only works


NOTES:
- if there is anything that MUST be part of ANY solution for a checkpoint -
then that should appear in each alternative and it should also appear in the
Equivalent statement.
