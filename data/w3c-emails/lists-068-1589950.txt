It's an absurd "rule", as it favors one technique (outright banning
of specific types of images) and ignores a bunch of realities, including:

* The problem with magnifying text images also applies to magnifying
   any other images that contain content; you may not be able to
   adequately increase the size of an image of ANY kind.  If the
   answer is to "ban it!" then the answer is clearly to ban all
   images on the web entirely -- because there will likely be some
   audience for whom they are too small.
