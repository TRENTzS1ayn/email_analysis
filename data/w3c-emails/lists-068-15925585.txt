I'm not sure what the term "element" means here.  The example --
of the IMG HTML element -- may imply that we are talking about
markup elements, or that we are talking about particular
"components" of a technology.

It might make more sense to say that the last item is a statement
that the checkpoint does not apply _BECAUSE_ "no images are used
on the page" or whatever.
