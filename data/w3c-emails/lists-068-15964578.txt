This workshop is to be help 3-4 April in Washington, D.C.  Position papers 
are still being accepted.  For those of you concerned about conformance 
with WCAG, particularly those of you developing evaluation and repair 
tools, this workshop should be of interest.

I hope that people working on EARL are well represented since recording 
conformance will be an important aspect of this activity.
