I agree that this is a user agent issue.  It's already implemented in Opera 
(4.x+), although it sometimes seems to hang with a document.open(). You are 
able to configure if you want new windows created or not.  This works for 
both new windows created with javascript (refer to example 4 at [1]) and 
new windows created with target="new" on an HTML A element (refer to the 
link "Savannah Area Convention and Visitors Bureau Website" at [2]).
