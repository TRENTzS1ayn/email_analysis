This is your attempt to create a checkpoint that encompasses 2.5, right? 
[2.5 If search functions are provided, provide a variety of search options 
for different skill levels and preferences.]

In that case then you might want to say, "provide more than one path or 
mechanism to find content."  still pretty rough, but "more than one" might 
be a bit tighter than "a variety."

then we could talk about the "scent of information" and the variety of ways 
people navigate information.  It's like saying, "there are 5 paths to get 
from A to B and people will choose a path based on which stores they wish 
to pass or which park they want to walk through."

this is good. At the face to face we talked about "consistent" having two 
meanings in this context:
1. consistency with standard UI design.
2. consistent usage within a site.
This ought to mentioned in the rationale as well, no?

I think navigation is a subset of navigation and therefore a separate 
checkpoints is not necessary.
