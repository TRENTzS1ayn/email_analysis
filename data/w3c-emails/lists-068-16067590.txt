Very good.

We also need a series of documents which we call "Technology
NON-Specific Checkpoint Solutions" or the like, right?  For things
which do not, strictly speaking, fall under any given technology?
Or are we assuming we will include those on the TSCS?

Such a document might be worth making anyway, even if it's not
released, for internal use -- in other words, something that says
to us making TSCS docs, "Here's what you need to include that are
solutions, but which can be used with a number of technologies."

Or we might be assuming that those will fit into the level 2
Checkpoint hierarchy?

GREGG:   YES  - THAT IS ALREADY AT LEVEL 2

Is there more than one conditional per checkpoint?

I like this.  I think I proposed it last year. ;)      (KYNN)

GREGG:   THEN IT MUST BE A GOOD IDEA
