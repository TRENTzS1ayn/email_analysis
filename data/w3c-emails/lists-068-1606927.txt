Then these aren't "guidelines" and the name needs to be changed.

A guideline tells what to do, when to do it, and why to do it.  A
"definition of accessibility" simply defines whether or not something
is accessible.

It's clear that many people on this working group want to write
accessibility definitions and not write guidelines.  Therefore, I
suggest that WCAG be rechartered and redefined, and clearly state
that the W3C has no intent to issue _guidelines_.  That way other
groups can pick up the slack where WCAG and WAI has failed.

How do I propose this to the WAI coordination group?
