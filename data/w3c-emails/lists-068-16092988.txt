Subject:Section 508 resource

All,

First, I'll introduce myself to all of you on the list -  I am a contractor
to NIEHS (National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, U.S.) and
fulfill the role of  the "web consultant" ...  basically, the job consists
of being as knowledgeable as one person can be about all things concerning
web page/application development, which is much more than one person can
possibly be, but I enjoy the challenge.
I'd like to pass a resource on to this list, as I am not seeing any new web
pages regarding Section 508 since about Dec. or Jan. of this year.  As a
Federal web developer, I am continually trying to become as educated as
possible about each paragraph of Section 508, and what it will mean to all
web page/application developers here at NIEHS.  Saying that, if anyone has
any feedback, corrections, suggestions to the following resource, by all
means let me know - I am open to making changes to what information I am
making available.  I have created a website which defines the part of
Section 508 which will affect the web.  I have gone a step further and tried
to explain what each of the paragraphs mean, using W3C and others as
resources.
Please take a look and let me know if you find it helpful and/or if you have
suggestions:
