My regrets for the meeting, as previously announced. But some quick thoughts
on the agenda proposals inline...

  1. Should 2.1 be split into two checkpoints?

CMN I don't think so. I do not care too much either way though.

  2. Should checkpoint 2.4 be dropped on account of its being a user
     agent requirement?

CMN No. There is still a requirement on authors not to code this way, and
also not to rely on it (these two ideas are linked in a few of the
checkpoints that we have - sometimes we say it one way, and sometimes
another. Maybe we should try to clarify that).
