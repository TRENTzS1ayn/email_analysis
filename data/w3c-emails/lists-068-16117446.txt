Cynthia,

Were you able to find what "distractive presentations" are called in industry?

I think 2.2 is o.k. I will include it in the next draft so people can read 
it in context.

I think your proposed 2.x is covered by "2.3 Give users control of 
mechanisms that cause extreme changes in context. "

We discussed the shortcomings of "extreme changes in context" at the F2F 
and Katie took an action to define it.  Although, it seems like we should 
be able to express the idea in simpler terms.
