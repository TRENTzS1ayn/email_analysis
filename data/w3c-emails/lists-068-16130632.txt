what about languages other than English?  Do we know of tests to run on 
written text in Japanese? Chinese? German? Finnish? Spanish? Hebrew? 
Arabic?  How do the tests differ between dialects?

Addressing the process used to determine if a site is accessible is very 
important.  When I presented to a group at the U. of Wisconsin a couple 
weeks ago, they said one of the biggest lessons they learned was about the 
process that I use to determine if a site is accessible.  This includes 
which tools I use and how I use them and most importantly, what questions 
do I ask myself as I go through a site.  This process has not been 
documented for WCAG 1.0 and should definitely be part of making the 
requirements clear for WCAG 2.0. This gets back to a testing checkpoint 
that Len suggested.  Perhaps we list tests that an author or evaluator must 
run:
1. spelling
2. reading level or grammar check
3. validate syntax
4. lists of questions to ask:...

I'm not sure where this fits in.  Is it a checkpoint?  Is it a 
technique?  Regardless, something like this would be valuable and something 
I get requests for all the time.

Thoughts?
