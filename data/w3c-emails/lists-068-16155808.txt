For Japanese there are published vocabularies... (I don't know about grammar
checking in Japanese - mine is never good enough to understand the checking).

I have built a spell-checker for a language that uses inflection to identify
most grammatical function - the knowledge more or less had to be built-in to
make it work, so it would be feasible to build a checker based on structures
used. (Finnish works like this). As a non-expert it took me a few days.

In general, vocabulary testing is not complex, and we can expect it to be
understood by people in each language. One of the important tests is whether
to use dialectical forms - there are a number of ways that people say
something in english. Some of them mean one thing in en-US and something
else, or nothing at all, in other variants of english, such as en-gb. A good
reference such as the Oxford English Dictionary tells you this information,
and there are trained linguists in most languages. We should be able to get
help in this from the i18n group, who could point us to groups like the
summer institute of linguistics - http://www.sil.org I think - who in turn
can point us to relevant reference work in different languages.

I agree that the general process is an important part. I would invite people
to look at the latter part of the 19 march draft of Techniques for authoring
tool accessibility (or later drafts as they are available) which includes
some material on how to test for conformance.

  what about languages other than English?  Do we know of tests to run on

  Arabic?  How do the tests differ between dialects?

  Addressing the process used to determine if a site is accessible is very
  important.  When I presented to a group at the U. of Wisconsin a couple
  weeks ago, they said one of the biggest lessons they learned was about the
  process that I use to determine if a site is accessible.  This includes
  which tools I use and how I use them and most importantly, what questions
  do I ask myself as I go through a site.  This process has not been
  documented for WCAG 1.0 and should definitely be part of making the
  requirements clear for WCAG 2.0. This gets back to a testing checkpoint
  that Len suggested.  Perhaps we list tests that an author or evaluator must
  run:
  1. spelling
  2. reading level or grammar check
  3. validate syntax
  4. lists of questions to ask:...

  I'm not sure where this fits in.  Is it a checkpoint?  Is it a
  technique?  Regardless, something like this would be valuable and something
  I get requests for all the time.

  Thoughts?
