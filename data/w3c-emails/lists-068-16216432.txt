I agree with this approach.  Consistent with this approach, I feel,
is a methodology of "guiding" which says "well, you -can- do it, but
to do it right you have to do (x), (y), and (z), and that will still
mean you're losing out on (a), (b), and (c), but if you REALLY REALLY
WANT TO, hey, it's your choice."

This isn't forbidding anything -- but it's making it clear that there
are definite problems with certain approaches, and if someone chooses
to follow that path, they at least will be aware of the consequences
of their actions.
