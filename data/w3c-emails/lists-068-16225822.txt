To: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>


I think even WCAG 1.0 can be regarded as consistent with this method of
specifying guidelines, in that the word "avoid" was deliberately chosen to
imply the existence of alternative, more accessible, means of achieving
the same objective. WCAG 2.0 should, however, make this point clearer, to
avoid (pun intended) giving the impression that there are prohibitions in
the guidelines that would limit the capacity of content creators to design
web sites that fulfill their respective purposes.
