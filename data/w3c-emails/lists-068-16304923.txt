The next Web Content Guidelines working group meeting will be held on
Thursday, 29 March, 2100 UTC, on the W3C/MIT Longfellow bridge:
+1-617-252-1038, with the following agenda:

1. The latest draft of WCAG 2.0, to be published shortly, incorporating
changes agreed to at the face to face meeting and in last week's
teleconference. Regarding checkpoint 2.1, the requirement to provide more
than one path or mechanism to find content, seems inappropriate to
comparatively small or uncomplicated web sites. How should the checkpoint
be refined? Naturally, you are welcome to raise other issues in connection
with the latest draft.

2. Checkpoint 3.3 (writing style and cognition): how can this be improved?
Should it be deleted? See the mailing list thread at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2001JanMar/0571.html
(Kynn's original proposal was to remove the checkpoint). What should be
the role of readability measures and testing in the formulation or
implementation of requirements affecting language comprehension.
