Wendy, In the "Presentation and Interaction"  section of the introduction,
you listed a few scenarios of how disabled people use the web, but the last
one is very wrong and misleading.

This is not how people who don't read well use and want to use the web --
they want to study the illustrations to discern the content, perhaps
reading headlines and highlights, and only as much text as absolutely
essential to tease out the understanding. What I've been told by those who
work with this population and web access, is that making the text hearable
solves little of the problem, that the greatest need is still for
illustrations. The comment could read:

"Someone who does read well will depend on the illustrations provided in
order to understand the information."
