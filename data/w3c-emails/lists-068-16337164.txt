Marti,

The main thing to remember is that if a site is well-illustrated (just as
if text is well-written) the visual-graphic user will not be "guessing" ... 

Take for examples, a web site about cats. A text user will know what it's
about by seeing the word "Cat" in the title ... the non-text user will
learn the same by seeing a picture of a cat ... which cat, and what about
the cat are in the text, and should be in the pictures.  That's why the
advice to stick to line drawings falls so short of the needs. Line drawings
are great for "headings", but more detail is needed in the "paragraphs" and
the more detailed and animated illustrations. 

A few weeks ago, I took my digital camera to school for a day and got
shots of some of the children using the computers .... I needed help from
the teachers and kids putting the right names to each photo, and one of the
children, a twin, could only be identified by the fact that the photo was
taken on Friday instead of Wednesday... I pulled the photo up on the screen
yesterday, and asked the Wednesday twin to identify who was in the photo
... she pointed to a high spot on her sister's cheek and said there was a
faint birthmark there that told her it was the Friday twin. 

The librarian looks for Internet sites that she can use in lieu of reading
a story to the kids. All-text sites aren't useful - but sites that combine
the words with good illustrations and animations, are very useful. There're
not enough of them out there.
