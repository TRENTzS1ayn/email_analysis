Dear Anne,
I very much like your suggested comment, but this could be an addition to
and not a replacement for the sentence you don't like.  The technique of
highlighting words as the text is spoken is extremely common.  It is used
for early education software (titles too numerous to list) and in AT
oriented products like Write:Outloud, AiSquared VisAbility, Kurzweil 3000,
and a several others.  You are mistaken when you claim that this scenario is
"very wrong and misleading".
-- Bruce
