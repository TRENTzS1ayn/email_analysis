Wendy,

I am not saying that your statement isn't true, it is, but not for a
significant portion of the affected population and not nearly so effective
as providing illustrations, which with the speech can make a nifty fix, but
not without illustrations .... 

That's why it's wrong and misleading. Wrong, in the sense that it is not
the greatest need of non-readers using the web.  We need to look into
equivalents for text not just text equivalents... If we are presenting four
scenarios, at least one should make it clear that text is not always the
common denominator ...
