I disagree.

This isn't what I said.  I am following the guideline and interpreting
what it says.

The emphasis above is yours, it should probably be noted.  The part we
are debating is "when an appropriate markup language exists" -- and in
my opinion the word "appropriate" means "does what I, the author, want
it to do."

By the way, irony of irony, your added emphasis was done with the
following code:

quote<br>
<br>
1 When an appropriate markup language exists, use markup rather than
images to convey information. [Priority 2] For example, use MathML to
mark up mathematical equations, and <font color="#0000FF"><u>style
sheets</u></font> to format text and control layout. <b>Also, avoid using
images to represent text -- use text and style sheets instead. <br>
<br>
</b>unquote<br>

I got a chuckle out of it, at least.

>It plainly says to avoid using images to represent text.

In the "explanatory text."  Which I feel to be in error.

That is a good idea.  We should indeed examine all uses of the term
"avoid".  If the original meaning was "do not use images to represent
text", I doubt that the current WCAG 1.0 would state "avoid" instead.

Correct.  ALT text is a technique and belongs in the techniques
document.

If you're stating that WCAG 1.0 is poorly edited, well, that may offend
some of the current editors (and I apologize, because I like you all
very much), but it's probably also true.

It's my position, and I've stated it before, that WCAG 1.0 is a flawed
document and the mistakes of WCAG 1.0 should not be repeated in WCAG
2.0.

Right now, WCAG 1.0 is vague, and is unclear on this issue.  Therefore
it is not possible to state whether or not they are in compliance with
this specific checkpoint, as written.  So the next question became
"how should this checkpoint be written?"

There is no such thing as "P2 compliant".  If you are asking if they
are Double-A compliant, we will have to look at all of the P1 and P2
checkpoints.  (I'm not sure why I'm having to explain WCAG 1.0
conformance terminology to the ER chair.)

I'm not trying to dodge your narrow question, but I believe the question
should be "are they accessible enough, and to whom?" not "are they
Double-A compliant?"  I feel your narrow question is too narrow and
you have chosen it to get a specific answer.
