Actually usability makes it usable. Although one person's Priority 1 item 
might seem like Priority 2 for others, etc. the idea that "usability" 
factors aren't "barriers" is untenable. It may be that we can't have a 
checkpoint that requires "fast loading" but that is a major deterrent to 
Web use.

Strictly speaking, *most* of the checkpoints fall under the heading of 
stuff that could be ameliorated by clever enough use of the sources, either 
with existing or soon-to-be technologies - it's even been postulated that 
there will be image recognition - although not yet claimed for "in six 
months" like some other stuff.

Since so much of the "testing" is done in good faith by authors, there is 
probably no harm in calling for "clear, simple" writing or even 
"appropriate illustrations" even though it's highly subjective and can only 
be judged as in "I know clear when I see it, even though I can't define it" 
to paraphrase a jurist's attempt to adjudicate pornography.
