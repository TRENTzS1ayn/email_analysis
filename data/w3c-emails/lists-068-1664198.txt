William was most kindly forwarding my comment, so I will reply.

The words "significant barrier" comes straight from the P2 checkpoint on the
WCAG.  Non-scaleable text (in any form) obviously meets this criteria.  I am
not really going to try and argue that this is a P1 issue (although many
experience blind surfers will tell you that even missing or bad ALT text is
NOT always an absolute barrier to using a site).

Are you seriously looking for an arguement as to why non-scaleable text
should be promoted to P1 status?  Maybe it should.  It address the needs of
a population that is often overlooked.  Before we go down that path, I would
first plead for a consensus to Len's orginal question, less this thread go
on for another two months!

Are small graphical text naviagion buttons a P2 issue?
