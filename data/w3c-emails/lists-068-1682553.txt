We don't ask anyone to put their email address on a site because of spam. If
you do that you can get 100's of emails a day.

Subject: Browser characteristics


Here's my very tardy action item on browser characteristics.  I hope it will
help in our discussion of user agent capabilities on Thursday's call.

I think WCAG 1.0 implies that all browsers support the following

Rendering of HTML 2.0 or greater
Link following via http GET
links in the http:// and mailto: formats
Remember when HTML authoring guides used
to admonish authors to put an email link on all forms?  And, just in case
they also didn't support mailto,  to put a cut-and-paste-able email address
on there too?
