Thank you Cynthia for a "breath of light".

Let us now praise discussing resolutions.

She actually proposed something concrete and the resolutions are: some form 
of scripting; tables, including nesting; accessibility features that have 
been implemented in some browsers;

I think all three proposals have a lot of merit. There may be others that 
would move the "line of backward compatability" forward a bit, for 
instance, Java enablement and security/signature/forms stuff. A "feature 
comparison"with the UAG might prove useful.  Of course the devil in details 
and the wordsmithing of all this will be a big effort but perhaps this more 
generalized way of looking at any other possibly unspoken assumptions about 
what a browser must accomplish would help us resolve the "until" part of 
the user agent equation.

The clearest "forward compatability" issues IMO are CSS, SVG, and XML (in 
all its flavors). There are already full-blown documents on their 
"accessibility-enhancing features" so we will decide just how strong our 
espousal of these *inevitabilities* should be. Polish the crystal balls and 
keep in mind the time line of getting WCAG 2.0 to recommendation (minimum 
of 2 Webyears) and the "when" of widespread use of CSS (already a huge 
start done) and vector graphics (Flash, anyone?).
