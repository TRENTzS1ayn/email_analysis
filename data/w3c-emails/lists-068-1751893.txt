William was looking for a guideline on "action" and what I have previously
called control logic. I think I agree with Jason that in broad terms this is
what guideline 5 is about (with a few relevant requirements from other
guidelines often coming into play as well).

  This is an interesting suggestion. Are there aspects of it which haven't
  been adequately addressed in the guidelines, for example in guideline 4
  (browsing and navigation), and guideline 5 (input device independence of
  user interfaces)? One could argue that if the web content provides its own
  user interface, the access requirements would be met, on the output side,
  by text equivalents (guideline 1), separation of content/structure from
  style/presentation (guideline 2), facilitating comprehension (guideline
  3), and facilitating browsing and navigation (guideline 4); and on the
  input side there is the requirement for device independence (guideline 5).
  These requirements are, naturally, qualified by the over-arching need for
  compatibility with user agents and adaptive technologies. Furthermore, is
  there any need to distinguish, in terms of basic requirements, from
  documents and user interfaces? Is not a hypertext document a relatively
  simple user interface, with structure, navigational elements and input in
  the form of link activations? Moving beyond this basic scenario to
  consider forms and other user interface components included as part of the
  web content, it would seem that the access requirements remain
  fundamentally the same, irrespective of how the interface is implemented
  (as a form, as a client-side script, as a downloaded executable), and so
  forth.

  If we concentrate on the requirements, as William suggested, rather than
  on the technologies used to implement them, in formulating the basic
  access requirements, then is there any aspect which is not adequately
  covered by the existing scheme as outlined above (this being a summary of
  the 2.0 draft as it presently stands)?

  If a user interface is supplied by a user agent then it becomes the
  province of the user agent guidelines.
