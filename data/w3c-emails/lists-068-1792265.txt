The process that the Baha'i run their activities on is called 
"consultation" the essence of which is:

**************************************************************************
Information should be gathered from the widest possible range of sources, 
seeking a diversity of points of view.

During discussion, participants must make every effort to be as frank and 
candid as possible, while maintaining a courteous interest in the views of 
others. Personal attacks, blanket ultimatums and prejudicial statements are 
to be avoided.

When an idea is put forth it becomes at once the property of the group.

The group strives for unanimity, but a majority vote can be taken to bring 
about a conclusion and make the decision. An important aspect to this 
principle is the understanding that once a decision is made, it is 
incumbent on the entire group to act on it with unity--regardless of how 
many supported the measure.
**************************************************************************

It might be worth our while to read the entire document at 
http://www.bahai.org/article-1-3-6-3.html since it describes both how we 
ideally work and what some of our current problems are.

IOW I feel really bad that we are publicly characterizing WCAG 1.0 in such 
inflammatory ways.

All documents will have flaws but the depiction of what resulted from a 
process in which so many participated *so effectively* as "not clear 
enough" and "poorly edited" while others (such as EOWG) are trying to use 
it as our public face is counter-productive.
