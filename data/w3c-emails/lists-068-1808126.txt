I'm sorry if criticism of WCAG 1.0 is not allowed, even within the
working group.

I don't, however, consider the working group list discussion to be
"public" in nature, and for the most part, I do not go around openly
criticizing WCAG 1.0.

I understand that some of you have personal investments in WCAG 1.0
thanks to your work, and I am appreciative of the time and energy
invested in writing that document.  My comments are not meant to
inflame nor to make you feel bad.

I also apologize to the emperor for the comment about his clothes,
too.
