WCAG 1.0 "14.2 Supplement text with graphic or auditory presentations where 
they will facilitate comprehension of the page."
WCAG 2.0 "3.7 Supplement text with graphic or auditory presentations where 
they will facilitate comprehension of the content."

There is growing sentiment to strengthen the latter (2.0 is a 
work-in-progress) because of the widespread concern that we are 
insufficiently attentive to the needs of people with certain cognitive 
problems like ADD, dyslexia, and any text comprehension difficulties. These 
people often are better served with illustrated text and the heavy emphasis 
on "text equivalents" for graphics/sound  with no corresponding attention 
to "graphical/sonic equivalents" for text is a concern of the Working Groups.

EH:: "Why so much focus on text equivalents?"

WL: You've got to start somewhere. Most of us had experience with our blind 
friends/clients, less with other disabilities so we focused on what we knew.

I think the point that Al was trying to make is to avoid pre-packaged 
setups for any of these assistive technologies - let the user rule. Of 
course I could be mis-reading all this stuff.
