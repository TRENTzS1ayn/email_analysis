Shades of meaning aside, this is an issue we need to face head on.

WCAG 1 priorities, and therefore compliance, are based explictly only on 
accessibility:  P1, P2, P3, correspond to whether

      "one or more groups will find it impossible/difficult/somewhat 
difficult to access information in the document"

There is no explicit refererence to any perceived or real tradeoffs against 
non-accessibility factors that this involves, although   some folks have 
read implicit references into some guidelines.

As I understand it this was a considered, deliberate decision for WCAG 1.0, 
and I agree that we need to have such a standard, one that only deals with 
accessibility.

However, I also agree (with e.g. Kynn) that these tradeoffs have to be 
explicitly considered _somewhere_ . If WAI doesn't consider the tradeoffs, 
someone else will, and we may not like what they come up with.

Do we want to consider the tradeoffs here in GL?  If not then indeed, its a 
WAI coordination group issue.

(Hmmm, actually, even if we do want to consider it in GL, we'd want to talk 
about it in CG if it's a new direction).

This is "General Exception for Specific Purpose" redux

where I argued that the tradeoff should be against the essential purpose of 
the site, in analogy with ADA.
