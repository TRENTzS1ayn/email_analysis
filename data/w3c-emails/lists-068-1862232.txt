Anne,

You're probably right that for many folks in this audience at least CSS 
will be an easier sell, given all its other advantages for software 
methodology in large sites.  After all, government sites underlying purpose 
is to deliver information, not market a soft drink.  It would be a harder 
case to make for a soft drink site, at least a site that markets to the 
general public.

The graphics you advocate are a lot harder to create, especially graphics 
that really help comphrehension rather than simply decorate.  So that's a 
harder sell, but it's in WCAG 1.0 as checkpoint 14.2

Are there some sites you could suggest that do a good job of this, that I 
could point out in my talk.. and that would inform further discussion on 
this list?  If you've already done so a pointer into the archives would be 
fine.

Thanks.

Len
