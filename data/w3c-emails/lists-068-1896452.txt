A small change in the wording would help: Supplement text with graphic or
auditory presentations TO facilitate comprehension of the content. That
elminates a choice by the author whether or not to illustrate.

If priority is based on numbers of people who will/can be served by a
guidelines, then this needs to be the highest priority. The number of
people who will be served by this inclusion in the guidelines is greater
than the number served by the never-ending discussion of text in graphics.

This argument has been given here before on the issues, and I tend to think
it's a smokescreen. As I've said before, such "standards" do exist, in
children's books and textbooks if nowhere else (tho I suspect some picture
magazines have a "standard" they use, cookbooks often contain
illustrations, and the many "coffee table" books provide exellent
"standards" to explore.

Illustrations can include a variety of graphic forms from simple line art
to detailed photos. Size would be a useful standard ... detailed photos
should be presented in a small form on the page, with the capacity to click
to a full-sized image. That means the page author needs two versions of
each detailed photo for each page. That is measurable. That standard could
even invoke one of those deprecated clauses "until user agents" allow size
management of graphics as well as text, the two images are needed. But the
most important "standard" is that there be graphics THAT ILLUSTRATE THE
CONTENT for every "document" or HTML page... 

In order to actually set standards, we need outside help from the world of
illustrators. They, not us, can detail what and how to tackle this problem.
And, they can probably set up some means of measuring that this has been
accomplished. I won't promise that a machine can make that determination,
but a human user can. We are designing the web for human users.

Yes, they are communicative. I am not referring to sign or symbolic
language when I talk about illustrations. 

It is commonplace to use words (which is often text) to

All illustrations will have alt tags, some will have descriptions.
Documents have metadata that include Keywords for the page/site, and text
has Mark-Up. All of these can be measured (by machines, even) to see that
all points in meta data have been illustrated as determined by the presence
of the metadata terms in the alt tags and descriptions. 

Rather than pushing this issue aside because the current group is unable to
make it whole, lets find the folks who can, and invite their input.
