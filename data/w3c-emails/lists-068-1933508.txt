Lisa,

Do you mind if I use your example to answer William's questions about the
use of illustrations on the web? Illustrations are needed for communication
to those who can't do much with text. The web is capable of providing as
many illustrations as the author can collect and link up. Is this as
reasonable as building a wheelchair ramp? Is it as necessary? Can we do it?
Is it sufficient to say that the carpenter hired to do the job doesn't know
the specifications (how much incline is necessary for manual and electric
chair, for example). Would it make sense for a builder to say it's
impossible because he doesn't have "standards" on whether wood, metal or
concrete is the best material? Is the fact that is is easier to add
illustrations than to add CSS make a difference? 

Anne
