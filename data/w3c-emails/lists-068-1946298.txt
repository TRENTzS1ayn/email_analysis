The issue is that a policy comes out that says, "use WCAG" but then someone 
goes to use it (e.g. Len) and comes up with a question like "if I use text 
in a raster image can I claim double A conformance to WCAG." When WCAG WG 
is asked the question, we can't agree on how to interpret it (although I 
thought we had been really close a couple times).  If we have multiple 
interpretations, imagine what is happening elsewhere.  How are the people 
who aren't asking for an interpretation designing content?  How are they 
interpreting our work?

In the requirements for WCAG 2.0 we state,
<blockquote>
2. Ensure that the minimal conformance requirements are clear
WCAG 2.0 must clearly specify the minimal requirements necessary for 
conformance. Each requirement must be easily verifiable. The WG will 
provide resources to help readers evaluate conformance, such as 
technology-specific checklists, sample sites, sample renderings (aural as 
well as graphical), and processes for determining conformance (e.g., in 
conjunction with the ERT and EO WGs).
The deliverables must:
?       Distinguish what is required for conformance from what provides 
additional accessibility.
?       Clearly specify how content that is tailored according to client or 
user capabilities may conform (dynamic content or database driven).
?       Resolve the relationship between user agent support and author 
supplied content (cross-platform and backwards compatibility issues).
?       Document the assumptions that underly the minimum requirements.
</blockquote>

We have discussed "technology-specific checkpoints."  I believe these are 
attempts to address these issues.  Part of the problem is tools and testing 
methods.  If people can experience the difficulties that people with 
disabilities experience, they are less likely to design inaccessible 
content.  If we can give them tools that will show them how badly a raster 
image magnifies, perhaps they will be less likely to use them.  But, then 
we need to be prepared to tell them what to do instead.  In the end, 
however it is up to the designer.  We can give them information but we can 
not make decisions for them.
