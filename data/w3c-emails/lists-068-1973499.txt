Yes, and I feel that this is one of the _weaknesses_ of the WCAG 1.0
document.  (I'm sorry if I have to be critical of the holy writ, but
I have felt this for a long time.)

There are also no references to trade-offs for accessibility features,
too.  Different groups may require different accessibility considerations,
but these are pretty much ignored, including possible dichotomies.

I agree that if WAI doesn't consider the tradeoffs and suggest reasonable
methods which will be accepted by web designers, then someone else who
is not WAI will.  I would, if I had the extra time.

I don't think it's a new direction at all; I think it's merely part and
parcel of creating guidelines and of understanding our audience.

I do think, however, that if we want these to be Web Content
Accessibility Definitions instead of Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines, we need a name change and we need to publicly state
that WCAG should _not_ be used directly as an implementation
plan, something I have been saying myself for several years now.
