Let's pick a couple of WAI documents, one that we agree might be amenable 
to illustrative improvement, like 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/PWD-Use-Web/Overview.html "How People With 
Disabilities Use the Web" and one that seems on its surface to be less 
amenable, like http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG10/ "Authoring Tools Accessibility 
Guidelines" and see if anybody has any ideas of whom to ask for help and 
details of "how to tackle this problem."

I wonder if http://cast.org/udl/index.cfm?i=61 is something like what you 
have in mind?
