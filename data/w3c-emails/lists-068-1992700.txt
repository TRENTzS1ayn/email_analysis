The priority system is based on the idea that if a certain population
(of any size) cannot access the information, then it should be a P1.
If a certain population can access the information with difficulty,
then it should be a P2.  If doing this just makes it easier to
access the information, then it is a P3.

I have no idea why this certain checkpoint is a P3, but I am afraid
to be critical of WCAG 1.0 anymore, so I assume that the people who
worked on WCAG 1.0 made a conscious choice to say "people who cannot
read can still access textual information -- there is no absolute
barrier -- but it does make them easier to access the information
if there are graphics."

Why they would say this, I don't know, I was not on the working group
at the time.  And at this rate, I probably will not be on _this_
working group much longer.
