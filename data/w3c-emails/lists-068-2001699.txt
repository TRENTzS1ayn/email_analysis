Ages ago I proposed something like this to WAI IG, based on what Mr.
Loughborough had been talking about on RDF IG (whilst I was developing
swi-dev type stuff). I wasn't a WAI member at the time, and it went
completely unnoticed...now it is being raised again, I've dug up the URI:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2000OctDec/0324.html

The guideline suggestions I made back then still appear to stand, but they
would have to be less technologically oriented for WCAG 2.0

For those that don't know, Charles is talking about this section:-
[[[
Claims of conformance to this document must use one of the following two
forms.
Form 1:
The guidelines title: "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0"
The guidelines URI: http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505
The conformance level satisfied: "A", "Double-A", or "Triple-A".
The scope covered by the claim (e.g., page, site, or defined portion of a
site.).
]]] - http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/#conformance

All we need are as many different ways as possible for expressing that (a
techniques thing), i.e. in HTML and RDF. Notice that I already gave two
examples in the note that I wrote, and that we have online examples of RDF.
Also, when ADL is created, we could use that: in *whatever* form it takes
on.
