William,

Yes, Steve said he noticed that error ... just pulled out one of his books
with big pretty pictures to show me exactly what is wrong.... in the
example engines have an electric motor in the trucks (boogies/wheel
assemblies) ... 
He said he let the error go unnoted since we were interested in the
illustrations and how they are used more than the text. 

Oh, I fowarded your questions about illustrating some of the WAI sites to
my (former) sister-in-law (a couple of decades ago we were married to
brothers and divorced them). She's a good artist, does some computer art,
has recently joined the ranks of web designer, and we'll see if she can
come up with suggestions on illustrating. Fell asleep last night thinking
how unrealistic the example of the LD student with ADD was ... The student
needs to be in high school to be taking such a literature course, and the
ADD is still going to play havoc with listening to the reading, since it
will cause the student to have to replay the text and still keep her behind
her classmates in the "reading". Also, at middle school level, literature
materials are still well illustrated, which, if it's present on the web
materials used in the class, will be shut out from the LD child who needs
them while reading since common text-to-speech software doesn't accommodate
illustrations while reading.
