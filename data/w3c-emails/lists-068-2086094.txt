Thanks Jon+Anne+Kynn,

perhaps a few other list-members and or lurkers could add their names to the
small but growing list.

My purpose is not to divide resources but to identify:
people willing to contribute and comment in a positive way,
a wai team member willing to allocate time to develop, and publish,
accessibility resources for non-verbal communication.

I do realise that I am not a great, or even a bad diplomat, and that
diplomacy is one of the huge skills of the wai team.
