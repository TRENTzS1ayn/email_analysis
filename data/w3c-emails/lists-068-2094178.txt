The imagemap of the bogies is of course a marvelous example of the 
text/illustrations being integrated almost inseparably 
[http://www.trainweb.org/railwaytechnical/bogie1.html].

I just got a nifty little program called LiveImage 
http://www.liveimage.com/ that you will almost certainly find useful and 
probably indispensable. It makes image map creation trivial and the program 
can be learned in minutes. I believe this could make your preparations of 
school materials way less tedious.
