My "consensus" is actually that in the cases used as exemplars in "granting 
that exception" the text wasn't *really* text in the sense of communicating 
linguistics. "Text" in logos (I think the example was "Coca-Cola") was on 
the whole thought to be "unimportant" or some such. In the jargon of the 
Monica era it didn't rise to the level of "textness".

I don't think we really want to get into defining what a "logo" is (how 
many pixels does it take to...?). Perhaps we can issue a "commonsense" 
approach to defining what we mean by "image text" - but I'm not taking such 
an action item. I'm like the Supreme Court justice [speaking of 
pornography]: "I can't define it but I know it when I see it!"
