Yep. It's optional however.

It inserts code into your HTML so if you're going for validation you should 
run the finished product through "tidy" - which of course you should do 
routinely with your XHTML files. They don't mess up stuff (in the authoring 
tool guidelines sense - although of course it will be somewhere between 
tedious and impossible to use via screen reader) but they use upper case 
for elements. No real problems that I've noticed - it's just incredibly 
time/nuisance saving.
