When people ask my advice, here's what I'm going to say (e.g. next Tuesday):

1. Determine the essential purpose of your site.

2. If you want to do something that compromises accessibility ask yourself: 
is this important for the essential purpose?

     a. If it is important for the underlying purpose, use it, but provide 
a accessible alternative if at all feasible.
     b. If not important for the underlying purpose, don't use it.

     Then if, for example, someone wants to use a special font which can 
presently only be rendered via pixel graphics, I would hope that people 
providing a bus schedule would realize that the special font wasn't 
needed  (I'd also encourage them to add a picture of a bus however).

  On the other hand people providing a children's reading book 
could  appropriately choose to have letters formed  from cavorting animals.

People in the US will I think find this resonates with ADA.

I'd prefer to have this advice (or better worded advice) come from the WAI, 
so we retain a single, unified point of contact for accessibility 
recommendations.   But if it doesn't, I hope it finds an authoritative home 
elsewhere.
