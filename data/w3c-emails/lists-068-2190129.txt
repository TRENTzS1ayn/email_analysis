The W3C is working to decrease the spam on our lists.  As such, we have a 
series of lists of e-mail who we will accept e-mail from.  If an e-mail is 
sent to w3c-wai-gl from someone who is not on one of the lists, it gets 
sent to me. I either delete i (spam) or forward it on.  In the case of 
Andi's regrets, I should have forwarded it so that it kept her name of the 
message.  I will do this in the future.

I'm  working to get the right e-mails on the right accept lists.  It may 
take a little while to get this all sorted out. Bear with me.

thanks,
--wendy
