We want to separate structure and content on the one hand from presentation 
on the other.  Lets see if we all agree on which is which in a simple example.

Say I've surveyed people from various countries and ages to find out their 
favorite movies.  Consider these two versions of a web page:

version 1. H1 headings which are counties, H2 headings which are ages, and 
body text within the H2 that says "Favorite movie is x"
version 2. H1 headings which are ages, H2 headings which are countries, and 
the same body text.

Now, if you just look at the HTML, you'll say these are different 
content/structure. However, you might also consider the underlying data as 
the content and say that these are different presentations.

So are these (a) different content/structure or (b) different 
presentations?  Please answer (a) or (b) :-).

Can we get a consensus on this? I ask because if we can't get a consensus, 
I think it shows we've got a problem with the guidelines.

Yes, I suppose there are echos here of some things Kynn has been saying...
