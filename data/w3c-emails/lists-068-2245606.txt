(a) (Different structuring of the same content). The data in this case is
the solid facts "County=>Age=>Movie". The structure is the marking up of the
three different parts using headings. *Presentation* would be adding extra
presentational data to make the definitions 'twixt content and structure
more clear.

It's two different logical assertions about the data, but the data doesn't
change. This is an ontology thing, whereby you have the same set of data,
but with different output relationships:-
[ County => Age | Movie ]
People in this county of age x like these movies.
[ Age => County | Movie ]
People in of this age in county x like these movies.

This *doesn't* change the data, the results (favourite movie overall etc.)
will remain the same. However, with CAM you have:-
County 1
Age Group1: Movie
Age Group2: Movie
County 2
Age Group1: Movie
Age Group2: Movie

But with ACM you have:-
Age Group1
County 1: Movie
County 2: Movie
Age Group2
County 1: Movie
County 2: Movie

The four results of favourite movie for each age/county group stay the same,
they are just presented in a different order. Note that this is like a table
of x and y variables. It doesn't matter if you swap around x and y to become
y and x.

I think what is implied by the guidelines is that presentation is a guide to
content. In other words, you should make sure that the h1/h2 headings are
clear, and that the data is marked up with keywords etc. All you are asking
us to do is to define what we mean by content/structure/presentation, as
implied by the title :-)

Content: Information/data.
Structure: Logical divisions within the content.
Presentation: Output styling to the structure.
