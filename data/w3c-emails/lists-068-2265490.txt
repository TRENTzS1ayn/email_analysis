I was trying to include two ideas. One is that the "data model" needs to be
seperable from teh "presentation model" in order to provide a diffferent
presentation model, for example to convert to a different medium. The other,
important idea, is that there should be presentation models provided. In
practice, HTML includes a default presentation model that is fine for common
types of HTML document, but many languages (for example SVG) do not have a
very helpful default presentation model.
