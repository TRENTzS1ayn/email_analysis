This is a tricky question. The answer isn't a or b, as I see it.

There is data, and it is modelled. In both examples there is a data model,
represented as markup. In fact this is not, in my opinion, the best way t
mark up two-dimensional data - that is what tables are really really meant
for. So these are two different structured representations of a data model.

To be able to query them means that the model needs to be comprehensible -
prefereably not just visually. In both cases it is. If this data were
modelled in a table then it would be easy to use tablin to get different
views of it.

Cheers

  We want to separate structure and content on the one hand from presentation
  on the other.  Lets see if we all agree on which is which in a simple example.

  Say I've surveyed people from various countries and ages to find out their
  favorite movies.  Consider these two versions of a web page:

  version 1. H1 headings which are counties, H2 headings which are ages, and
  body text within the H2 that says "Favorite movie is x"
  version 2. H1 headings which are ages, H2 headings which are countries, and
  the same body text.

  Now, if you just look at the HTML, you'll say these are different
  content/structure. However, you might also consider the underlying data as
  the content and say that these are different presentations.

  So are these (a) different content/structure or (b) different
  presentations?  Please answer (a) or (b) :-).

  Can we get a consensus on this? I ask because if we can't get a consensus,
  I think it shows we've got a problem with the guidelines.

  p.s.
  Yes, I suppose there are echos here of some things Kynn has been saying...
