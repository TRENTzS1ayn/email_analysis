Len,

     I'll take a stand on b) 

     The variances are presentation ... Presentation has it's own
structure, and this is structure of the presentation, not structure of the
content.

If I had the data in a pure database, such as Access, I would change these
variances in the "reports", not in any structure of the data itself.
