Jon,

If the audience is "web designers", is the phrase "styling information
used for rendering" meaningful? The term "styling" instead of "presentation
is going to cause confusion because "styling" has a different meaning to
visual/artistic folks. Styling is part of presentation.  

To obfuscate further there is "style" inherent in content which could be
quite difficult to separate out. 

Presentation, on the other hand is specific to output. Visual/graphic
presentation may differ from visual/textual presentation may differ from
auditory presentation may differ from tactile presentation ... We want to
make presentations equivalent for accessibility

Anne
