Having seen people from Macromedia working (as part of the working
group) on accessibility issues as part of the WAI, I can't help
but disagree with this guy's general premise:

Nor do I really think it's appropriate to immediately flame
companies who _do_ "see the light"; surely a disincentive to
other corporate interests if this is how positive moves are
greeted.

But this fellow (Joe Clark) seems like he's rather bitter.  I'm
not sure why.
