Bob Stein of VisiBone has an article on AListApart:

http://www.alistapart.com/stories/separation/index.html

"The separation of style from content has long been the
web's holy grail. But is it a myth? VisiBone's Stein claims
that when design communicates, style and content are
inextricably wed. You'll love this or hate it; either way,
you can add your comments at the end."

Interesting read.  He addresses accessibility and makes
direct challenges to what would be considered WAI dogma.
