They are different presentations of the same content, which is why
it is very useful to think of XHTML as a display language, not a
content language.  A correct content language would be written in
XML and would not have "headings", which are simply one way of
translating content into a format which can be displayed on a
specific type of output agent -- a web browser.

This isn't the only way to display that content, or even the best
way to do it.  This is presentation markup.  All XHTML is presentation
markup. :)

So -- (b).
