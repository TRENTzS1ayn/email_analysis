I see what Kynn means. I think the main hurdle here is actually defining
what:-
a) Content
b) Structure
c) Presentation
d) Style
e) Formatting
are, because there are so many different possible interpretations. We all
use them in different contexts, so we rarely agree on technicalities of
points, when for the most part we all agree on the ideas.
Example:
Sean said: (a) (Different structuring of the same content).
Kynn said: (b) (Different presentation of the same content).
But really we both *mean* the same thing, and we both used very similar
arguements.
I think we have to look into the fact that (X)HTML is a document markup
language - for marking up documents (presentationally for the most part). Of
course, some semantics were added at a later date.....and the other point of
confusion is how best to display data, XML style.....
If we could all agree on definitions of the above, we'd be half way there.
