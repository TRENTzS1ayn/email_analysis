William,
Checked out the program, and it does the same thing (or close) to what I
can do in publisher2000. I've used it once to make an image map, but the
audience was only 50 women all of whom were able to use the finished map
well. Maybe, when we are up to a few schools in Israel that we are writing
to, I could do one and we can look at what happens in the coding when
Publisher does it.
