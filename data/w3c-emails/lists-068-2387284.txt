I replied to him as soon as I knew the article was published (a couple/few
weeks ago). He seems a highly open minded individual, and to some extent
apears to have been playing devils advocate. I'm pretty sure he wrote it so
that he would recieve thousands (?) of replies telling him why presentation
should be separated from content, just so he could write a follow up
article: cynical I know, but there you go. I advise that all people
interested in the Presentation vs. Content arguement go and read it:

good chuckle...

Quote of the day:-.
Lisa: I'm an 8 year old girl, and no one listens to me no matter *how*
useful my ideas are.
Homer: I'm an average well-bodied white male aged 21-40. Everybody listens
to my ideas, no matter how stupid they are [gets a box out of the cupboard]
Ooooh! Nuts and gum: together at last!

Ah, the mysteries of life...
