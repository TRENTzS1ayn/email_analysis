JRG: I think the term style is more of a W3C term coming from CSS and more 
directly relates to the use of CSS for styling which is what WAI 
promotes.  One thing that has been a big issue with other working groups in 
WAI is the use of terminology, the more different terminology the more 
difficult the guidelines will be to read.  At least that has been my 
experience working on UAAG.

JRG: Could you give an example of content or structure markup that implies 
an inherit styling for a particular type of rendering?  Is this images?

JRG: I think styling can refer to any rendering medium, visual as well as 
audio renderings can be styled using CSS.  Braille I do not believe has an 
special styling markup at this point in CSS.  But there are translators 
that will take MathML and create Nemeth Braille codes.  This is probably 
considered more a translation than a styling issue though.
