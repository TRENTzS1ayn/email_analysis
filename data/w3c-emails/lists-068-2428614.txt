One of my co-workers sent the following to me in a mail thread (in jest, I
hope)...


actually, I do have a spec in mind for a pretty cool activex control that
generates self-reproducing swarms of iframes as soon as the document gets
focus and creates nested popup windows with random sizes, positions and
flashes content when the iframes get focus.  but I'm hoping we can get
around the activex for it and do it cross-browser in some way. 
 
of course, this would be dependent on our implementation of "slippery
textboxes" -- slimy, absolutely positioned suckers that remain 10 pixels
below and to the right of the cursor.

Any ideas on how to make this accessible?
