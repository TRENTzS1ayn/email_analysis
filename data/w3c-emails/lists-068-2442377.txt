Although the realization has been slow to mature, I must express my concern 
with the overall attitude inherent in the guidelines presumption that our 
highly interactive Web has as its basic concept that it is "presented" to 
the user, rather than that the user interacts with it. Although there are 
plenty of guidelines/checkpoints dealing with navigating and other 
functions requiring input from the "user", it is still quite clear that 
there is an underlying view that there is an author pouring content into a 
largely passive user.

Although I'm not entirely sure what I'm recommending it might have to do 
with somehow revising the approach taken in our choice to have GL 1 deal 
less with "presented content" than with some overall interactive experience 
that *includes* being presented with stuff as well as maneuvering about, 
controlling (not just the appearance), and in some senses modifying what 
the interactivity demands. One is not just reading or "intaking" some 
static/dynamic presentation, but is a part of it.

And maybe this is just another pointless ramble.
