Charles,

Let me check if I understand what you mean with an example.

Take LONGDESC for example.

and consider a WCAG that
1. omitted LONGDESC from the baseline requirement
2. said "to accommodate users with user agents that support LONGDESC it is 
sufficient to use that that attribute to give a more detailed description"
3. also said  "to accommodate users with agents that don't support 
LONGDESC, use a "D link" as follows etc..."

Now, for purposes of discussion, please put aside for now whether we 
actually want to omit LONGDESC from the baseline, and also please also put 
aside whether the rest of this example is worded optimally or complete.

I want to ask just this narrower question: is this the type of Guideline 
document you are advocating?

Len

p.s.

I'd personally support that sort of document.  Then the only issue will be 
whether WAI will want to say anything anywhere about what sets of user 
agent capabilities might be assumed and how the guidelines filter thru 
those assumptions.
