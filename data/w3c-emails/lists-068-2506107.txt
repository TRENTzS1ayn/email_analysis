No, I am after something a bit different.

We say in the guidelines "provide functional equivalents that can be used in
different circumstances - by people who are deaf, blind, unable to read huge
slabs of text, ..."

Then in the checkpoints we say "provide text equivalents for all non-text
elements".

(then in the glossary we say that non-text elements are ones that cannot be
rendered as text - they do include ASCII art but may not include accessibly
designed SVG images...)

Then in the techniques we say:
"HTML: Use the alt attribute to provide a short functional equivalent. This
needs to allow the user to scan quickly through the page, so information that
is more than a sentence or so should normally be a long description (see
below).

And somewhere further on (or maybe this is a checkpoint)...

A long description must be provided for complex information presented in the
a non-text element.

HTML: Use the longdesc attribute to link to a full description. This can be
provided in the same page. This requires browsers that support longdesc, so
does not work for (almost anything available today, but we probably want to
have a way of saying this that future proffs us a bit). Alternatively, link
a letter 'D' immediately after the object being described to the description.
This works in anything. (because somewhere we have stated that we expect
links to work in all browsers...)"

Does that make it clearer? I guess we will need to go a  few times around to
get this sorted.

Cheers

Charles

  Charles,

  Let me check if I understand what you mean with an example.

  Take LONGDESC for example.

  and consider a WCAG that
  1. omitted LONGDESC from the baseline requirement
  2. said "to accommodate users with user agents that support LONGDESC it is
  sufficient to use that that attribute to give a more detailed description"
  3. also said  "to accommodate users with agents that don't support
  LONGDESC, use a "D link" as follows etc..."

  Now, for purposes of discussion, please put aside for now whether we
  actually want to omit LONGDESC from the baseline, and also please also put
  aside whether the rest of this example is worded optimally or complete.

  I want to ask just this narrower question: is this the type of Guideline
  document you are advocating?

  Len

  p.s.

  I'd personally support that sort of document.  Then the only issue will be
  whether WAI will want to say anything anywhere about what sets of user
  agent capabilities might be assumed and how the guidelines filter thru
  those assumptions.
