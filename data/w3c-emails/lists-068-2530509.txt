Charles,

There's still something I don't get here.  The WCAG draft 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/  still says that people will be able to 
use it to judge conformance.

Now suppose I have a web page that has LONGDESC but no D links.  The way 
you've described it,  I don't see how I can figure out the conformance from 
the guidelines because LONGDESC isn't even in the guidelines.  It's in the 
techniques which are not normative.

And even if we brought your statement into the guidelines, viz
quote
HTML: Use the longdesc attribute to link to a full description. This can be
provided in the same page. This requires browsers that support longdesc, so
does not work for (almost anything available today, but we probably want to
have a way of saying this that future proffs us a bit). Alternatively, link
a letter 'D' immediately after the object being described to the description.
This works in anything. (because somewhere we have stated that we expect
links to work in all browsers...)"
unquote

that doesn't say whether D is required.

So how do we measure conformance?

Len
