There's another alternative.  We could write documents that would allow 
people to make claims that look like this:

<quote>
This site is double A compliant    _with_respect_to_    the "target set" of 
browsers having the following characteristics:

     1. display LONGDESC
     2. Do not handle scripts
     3.  etc.
</quote>

To make such claims possible, we'd write checkpoints or normative 
techniques that say things like

     always provide ALT text
     if the target set of browsers doesn't support LONGDESC, use D Link
     if the target set of browsers ... etc

In other words,  a site isn't simply "double A compliant".  It's compliant 
with respect to a target set of browsers, and the checkpoints (or normative 
techniques, I'm not concerned with what what we call it) each become 
conditional on the "target set" of browsers.

We may then choose or not to define one or more standard "target sets" 
of  browsers.  These "standard sets" may well be non-normative.  This would 
push the non-stable stuff (state of the browser world) into documents that 
don't have to go thru rec.
