I just spoke at the CNet Builder.Com Live conference last week,
and I had a few people come up to me and ask me to pass along their
appreciation of the checkpoints, listed in checklist form, from 
WCAG 1.0.

They specifically said that the checklists were a life-saver and
they couldn't have gotten through the guidelines without such a
"roadmap".
