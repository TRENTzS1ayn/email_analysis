Thursday, 14 December, 2100 UTC (4 PM Boston, 10 PM France, 8 AM Eastern
Australia), +1-617-252-1038:

Agenda
1. Final vote on WCAG 1.0 checkpoint 3.1 erratum. Proposed text will
shortly be circulated on the mailing list.

2. WCAG 2.0 techniques:

a. Proposal to document clearly, in the techniques associated with each
checkpoint, which techniques or combinations thereof would be sufficient
to meet the requirement of the checkpoint.

b. Miscellaneous matters: see the list of open issues at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wai-gl-tech-issues.html
The working group should try to resolve as many of these issues as
possible during the teleconference. The list is somewhat out of date; some
of the issues may therefore have already been addressed.

3. W3C "all activity meeting", preparation and opportunities for
discussion with other working groups.
