Based on the discussion from 26 October 2000 
[http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2000/10/26-minutes.html] as well as the more 
recent threads, here's where we seem to be at today.

<blockquote>
3.1 When an appropriate markup language exists and is supported, use markup 
rather than raster-based images to convey information. [Priority 2]
For example, use SVG to create graphics, MathML to mark up mathematical 
equations, and CSS for text-oriented special effects. Avoid using 
raster-based images to represent text  -- use text and style 
sheets.  Raster-based formats such as .gif and .jpeg paint the text as an 
image and prevent scalable magnification of the text.
You may use text in images when:
1. the text does not convey its literal meaning but has a more graphical 
function, such as a logo and
2. the effect can not be achieved with CSS and
3. you have provided a text equivalent for the image.
Refer also to guideline1, guideline 6 and guideline 11.
</blockquote>

However, here's a new wrench:
Anne suggested that in my example for checkpoint 1.1 of a right arrow that 
links to the next slide in a slide set, that the image ought to contain the 
text "Next." 
[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2000OctDec/0478.html] In 
this case, does this qualify as a "graphical function"?
