I enthusiastically agree that the information discussed in the previous 
items in this thread would be extremely useful.

Now what about compliance?  Have we figured out
- if there would still be A , double A, or triple AAA, or some other 
compliance?
- if so how they would be determined?

Or is this still an issue that we'll be getting to later?
