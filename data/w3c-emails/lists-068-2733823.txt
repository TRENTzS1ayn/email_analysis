Good work!

Still some minor fiddles suggested below.

Hope they smell like friendly amendments.

Saying "scalable magnification" is repetitiously redundant all over again,
here.

Consider saying 

... paint the text as an image whose size is fixed in terms of pixels.  Such
images do not support magnification or scaling as well as the alternatives. 
The difference [is important | becomes critical] for users with low vision.

If we have comparative examples to link to, this would be a good place to link
to details of how low-vision users use the content and how different content
encodings respond.
