Wendy,

Use of "Next" on the right arrow isn't a "graphical" function, it's a
navigational function. The arrow is the "illustration" for the function ... 

I've been noting how my students use the Internet, and the arrow to
indicate "next" just isn't intuitive! The ones who can read sometimes try
to read stories online, will read down to the bottom of a page, then ASK
what to do when the arrows are in clear view. If the uses of young children
is indicative of disabled users with cognitive problems, the arrows without
words just don't work.  The use of the arrows without a word has to be
TAUGHT and LEARNED ... 

I realize that the guidelines could be more neatly organized if text were
always separable from graphics, but if the goal is accessibility, the text
needs to be there, plus available as alt text, title, or whatever else can
be used. The purpose of the navigations controls it to get the user where
he/she wants to go ... The user of magnification has the arrow whether it
has text on it or not ... if a magnification user also needs the text,
there may be a problem, but the solution isn't eliminating text for all
users ... would it help if the text were a caption directly beneath the
arrow and white spaced from anything below?

Come to think of it, if navigation graphics always carried text, there
would be a use for standard SVG graphics to be created and circulated for
use. It could help promote the use of SVG for such applications while
.jpg's and .gif's continue use as illustrations ... but I really would like
to see a technique tied to a guideline that suggested two sizes of content
illustrations to improve magnification ... Lots of (LD)hubby's train sites
provide "click on small picture to see big picture" ... 

But, if it can't be part of WCAG 1.0, it needs to be in 2.0 ... 

Anne
