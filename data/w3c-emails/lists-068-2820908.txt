I join Kynn in the first clause and can't believe he stated the last one. 
This issue pre-dates the WG and possibly even the WAI. We have "gotten to" 
it boringly often. We took a vote and I lost.  Kynn did too if he voted.

At this time I'd rather discuss/argue/decide/consense/read/write about 
something else. We lost that election and it's not important enough to be a 
"deal breaker" that we have a multi-tiered system in which there's 
"priority levels" with which I disagree.

Let's make the document better and defer yet another round of 
campaigning/voting about conformance levels until a bit later. I hope Kynn 
can get some people to vote different but it's more important that we get 
into stuff like specifying "density levels" for the clear/simple stuff and 
"appropriate to the task" reading levels and proof of the use of non-text 
graphics to make stuff less daunting and how a multimedia 
player/editor/creator can be specified without the inevitability of a major 
retrofit next year.
