I agree with William that there are currently more important issues,
but I am not 100% convinced that the issue has been resolved.  Maybe
I'm just a stubborn old cuss (god, think what I will be like when I
am William's age!), but I think the issue is not yet closed.

But I will second the idea of worrying about some of the more
topical issues -- by which I mean issues directly relating to
accessibility of content -- rather than spending too much time on
this "meta-issue".
