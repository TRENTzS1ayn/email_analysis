Yes, I understand and agree that images should be paired with words.  This
is a fundamental concept in transitioning symbol-oriented users of
Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) to literacy.  This isn't
really the argument.
Even with regard to images maps and buttons, no one has said that text
should be avoided.  What should be avoided is graphical text.
The "arrow button" should NOT have text unless the it is put there by CSS or
SVG or redundant text links.  "Pop-up" text provided via ALT or TITLE
mechanism is fine.  Bit-mapped words are NOT acceptable.
