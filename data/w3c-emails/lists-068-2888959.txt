By the way, if you follow Bruce's suggestion of using CSS to
place the "next" on the graphic, or if you simply include a
text link beside/next to the link, it might be appropriate to
actually make the alt attribute alt="".

See, if you do it otherwise, you have:

    <a href="page02.html"><img src="rarrow.gif" alt="next"/></a>
    <br/>
    <a href="page02.html">next</a>

...which means that if graphics aren't viewed, you see/hear:

    [LINK]next
    [LINK]next

Which looks/sounds really bad.  If you do this instead:

    <a href="page02.html"><img src="rarrow.gif" alt=""/></a>
    <br/>
    <a href="page02.html">next</a>

Then you get this:


    [LINK]next

...which makes more sense and is less confusing to someone who
doesn't see the image.

Any objections to this approach?
