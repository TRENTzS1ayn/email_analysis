If we postpone the discussion of compliance, we have to make absolutely 
sure that we keep compliance issues out of the discussion until 
then.  Based on what I heard on the last call, I believe we are, but I'm 
writing this just to make sure we all have the same understanding.

For example, even though we need to consider at some point how hard it is 
for web site designers to follow certain guidelines, and how acceptable 
they will be to designers, these considerations must have absolutely no 
explicit or implict influence on Guidelines, or on Techniques.  We have to 
put all that into the compliance rules.

It's just like ADA.  When you're describing how hard it is for someone to 
get up a ramp, it's irrelevant how difficult or historically aesthetic it 
is to construct the ramp.    Difficulty of construction and historic 
aesthetics only enters when you're determining compliance rules for 
building the ramp.
