I'm not sure if we have the same type of understanding of
"compliance issues."

I don't agree here, so maybe this -is- the time to discuss the
compliance schemes.

With all due respect to the people here, I think that directly comparing
this to the ADA is going to lead us down the wrong path entirely.  ADA
specifications and WCAG -guidelines- are different things, -and- are
created in a far different manner than what we're doing here.

I'm very worried that there is a huge disconnect between our process
and our goals. I would bring this up to Judy and the WAI coordination
group but I'm not sure they want to hear about more disorder in the
WCAG group. :)

Maybe I just have a different view of "guidelines".  If we are
setting governmental specifications -- like the ADA specs -- then
we really need a different name, _and_ a far different process than
the one we have now.  I am not convinced that the current processes
used in WCAG are appropriate for the type of legislation-style
crafting of guidelines that you are proposing.

PS:  Can anyone point me to a good reference -- preferably on the
      web -- that explains how ADA specifications are and were
      drafted?  Is that really what we are doing here?  Does the
      ADA process generally consist of allowing whatever people
      who show up off the street write the guidelines?  (Near as I
      can tell there are few restrictions on who joins the WCAG
      working group.)
