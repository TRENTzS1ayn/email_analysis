If I get some more concensus that it's worth doing, I'll gladly
take point on this (even though my time is limited).  Some people
believe the issue is settled, but like Cynthia, I clearly recall
it being a "pending, but not looming" issue.

If the rest of ya'll speak up and say "yeah, let's do it", I will
somehow find the cycles to get it done. If it's a pointless
exercise, though...
