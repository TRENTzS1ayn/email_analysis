This approach to having words and images available is what I prefer, except
that to make it more usable I would include the image and the text in a
single link element.

  By the way, if you follow Bruce's suggestion of using CSS to
  place the "next" on the graphic, or if you simply include a
  text link beside/next to the link, it might be appropriate to
  actually make the alt attribute alt="".

  See, if you do it otherwise, you have:

      <a href="page02.html"><img src="rarrow.gif" alt="next"/></a>
      <br/>
      <a href="page02.html">next</a>

  ...which means that if graphics aren't viewed, you see/hear:

      [LINK]next
      [LINK]next

  Which looks/sounds really bad.  If you do this instead:

      <a href="page02.html"><img src="rarrow.gif" alt=""/></a>
      <br/>
      <a href="page02.html">next</a>

  Then you get this:


      [LINK]next

  ...which makes more sense and is less confusing to someone who
  doesn't see the image.

  Any objections to this approach?
