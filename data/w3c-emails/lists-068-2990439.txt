So, are there still user agents that do not handle empty form controls? Can
anyone identify one? Or name a setup (e.g. user agent X with assistive
technology Y) that doesn't, or does?

Hello,

I really appreciate the effort and will learn from the example, but at a
glance the site is not AAA.

>From the Checklist of Checkpoints for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
1.0 at http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/full-checklist.html

10.4 Until user agents handle empty controls correctly, include default,
place-holding characters in edit boxes and text areas.

Clearly the search as well as the feedback pages are not doing this.
