my to chime in...

i think there is merit that organized bodies will look to the WCAG for
guidance and will quote or at least reference us.  therefore i think we nned
to be certain to have a compliance matrix, whereby they can pick and chose.
my fear is when they reference it carte blanc without ryhme or reason.  i do
like wha the access board did in government, the picked what realistic to
achieve for a phased approach.

i agree that we need requirements first and then we can assign a priority.
i have always been concerned about the Priority versus confromance level,
but understand it.  personnally i prefer one system versus two.

as for ADA specifications, i know of none rather i beleive there is verbage
that describes the right of access   but here i would defer our honorable
friend cynthia waddell.  Section 508 of the Rehabiltation Act does have
draft requirements.  not sure if they are live yet.
