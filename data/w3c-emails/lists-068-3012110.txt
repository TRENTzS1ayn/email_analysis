A question came up on the IG list about whether the following are OK:

<a href="somewhere"><img src="icon" alt="">Home</a>

I figure that it is, and is in fact better than having alt="Home", since that
leads to the link being HomeHome.

<a href="somewhere"><img src="icon" alt="Home"></a>
<br/><a href="somewhere">Home</a>

I think it is, but it is poor style. In particular it creates more links to
be skipped, which is a pain and can be confusing.

<a href="somewhere"><img src="icon" alt=""></a>
<br/><a href="somewhere">Home</a>

I don't think so. There is nothing to indicate where the first link is going.

What do people think? Do each of these, none of these, or some of these
correctly satisfy the P1 checkpoint 1.1 ?
