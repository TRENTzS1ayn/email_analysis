A title tag could be set on the <a> attribute.

It's entirely possible that a web author may not want (or may not
be able) to put links directly next to each other, or may not
even _think_ of the two as the _same_ link, but rather as _two
different links_.  (The author's view of the process is very
important to consider.)

I think that all of the three examples you gave clearly met WCAG1's
checkpoint 1.1 which specifies that a textual equivalent must be
provided.  (There is not a "make the relationship explicitly
known" requirement in WCAG1.)
