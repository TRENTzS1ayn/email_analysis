To put some data in:

I use Lynx, version 2.8 on Linux systems. Unfortunately it doesn't do
anything useful about labeels for form controls, so it is still necessary to
use positioning appropriately, but that is a seperate reqirement. I don't
have any problems getting to and editing/activating/what-have-you a form
control that is empty. Same goes for Amaya on Linux systems, at least since
version 2.4

I also use iCab (Macintosh), and the same is true for it except that it
doesn't have enough keyboard support yet.

I also have Netscape 4.7, Lynx and IE 4.5 and 5.0 for the macintosh, and the
same is true there too.

  So, are there still user agents that do not handle empty form controls? Can
  anyone identify one? Or name a setup (e.g. user agent X with assistive
  technology Y) that doesn't, or does?
