I'm afraid that because of the (perceived?) inadequacies of both, as well 
as their inherent "backward incompatability", most authors find neither of 
these AT THIS TIME to be "good choices".

However, having said that (grudgingly, in a way), it seems that since the 
path to Recommendation is at a minimum 6 months and since before any 
checkpoints are allowable there must be demonstrably usable 
implementations, there is no reason not to look forward enough to use both 
in our document. If we turn out to be wrong, it's just a matter of changing 
some words, if in fact they turn out to be "good choices" then it would be 
silly not to account for them. Both technologies have significant notes 
about the accessibility advantages they present and unless we rescind those 
papers, we must respect them.

IOW we are betting that a year from now the fact that CSS was only 
partially implemented in the year 2000 will seem quaint and the idea of 
using raster graphics for much of anything will be close to unthinkable.
