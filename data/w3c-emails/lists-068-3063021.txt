I said there where two good choices.  I didn't claim that they were great
choices!  (smile)
In any case, both SVG and CSS are better than graphical text.  The
inadequacies of bitmaps (especially for words) are well documented.
I am glad you are bullish on CSS.  What's your prognostication for SVG?  I
doubt that raster images will be disappearing all that quickly, but
hopefully their use will mostly be for photographs.
