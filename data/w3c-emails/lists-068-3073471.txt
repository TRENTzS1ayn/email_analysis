Kynn,
The access board is the place to look for how federal standards are set, 
which often form the basis for ADA type legislation that apply to the 
general public.

http://www.access-board.gov/

They are currently publishing new rules (December 21st) on electronic and 
information technologies that will affect any entity that receives federal 
support or contracts.  Part of the specifications will include information 
on web site accessibility.  There guidelines are much more functional 
requirements than technical requirements, at least in the last public version.

Hope this helps,
Jon
