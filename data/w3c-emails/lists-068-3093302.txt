No, I don't think the issue is closed, but I agree that we could let it lie
for a while and do the "primary work" of providing something for which people
might want a conformance scheme <grin>.

As I understood it we were going to provide more inforamtion on teh
applicability of various proposals for things to be done - who benefits, what
technology is needed/served. And then think about how to measure conformacne
afterwards.

  I'm just a stubborn old cuss (god, think what I will be like when I
  am William's age!), but I think the issue is not yet closed.

  But I will second the idea of worrying about some of the more
  topical issues -- by which I mean issues directly relating to
  accessibility of content -- rather than spending too much time on
  this "meta-issue".
