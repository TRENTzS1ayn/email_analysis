The use of "style sheets" at all is more of a leap for many authors than is 
the move to a particular implementation thereof. Just the concept of having 
a "presentation descriptor" is something many blindless people have trouble 
with because of such prejudices as "seeing is believing" or "it's right 
there in front of your eyes". Many of us just don't understand that there 
is an underlying "what" that's somehow being re-presented. We have for so 
long mistaken the medium for the message that it's a hard severance to 
expect compliance with, as is evident from the long-raging exchanges herein.

CSS is sort of the "last best hope" for getting this done and my 
"bullishness" on it is based mainly on the business case arguments for its 
use. It is so clearly more efficient (once the initial bigotry towards it 
is overcome) that it will be as "second-nature" of a thing for Web 
designers (as it sort of already has been in print, where the word "style" 
is frequently understood in the sense it is used in CSS) as it was for the 
designers of SGML. People who wrote documents for UNIX traditionally had a 
separate file that expressed the presentation of what had been captured as 
what we call "content" in a text file.
