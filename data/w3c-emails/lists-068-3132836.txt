Except Flash. Which claims to be installed on 96% of all in-use browsers.

It's of course not strictly "SVG" but it is scalable vector graphics.

I despair a lot about the delays in CSS implementation but OTOH I expect 
quicker avenues of dispersal to emerge.

I presume your "Until that base of knowledge is there, I think a strategy 
of pushing it before it's supported really helps anyone." was a "grammar 
typo" and that you meant it "doesn't help anyone". I think that if stuff 
isn't pushed before it's fully supported, it won't get supported. By the 
time Norman Thomas died his heavily-ridiculed platform was pretty much 
fully implemented. 1 year, 3 years, same thing. PNG on the other hand is 
pretty much a pointless step compared to what vector vs. raster graphics 
brings and the proliferation of metada (probably via RDF) will be so 
machine-doable that it might happen pretty quick.

As somebody in the dim recesses of memory said "I don't gamble - I play 
poker" so I won't really bet on the date of any of the above: I just used 
the "I bet" expression jovially.
