If we ask people to point to the official one, we can change it if we need
to.  If we encourage people to make local copies, then old versions will
hang around forever.

Here's what I hope is a really simple question.

The present conformance page http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG1-Conformance.html

says to reference the copy of the logo on the w3c servers

<A href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG1A-Conformance" title="Explanation of
Level A Conformance">
<IMG height="32" width="88"
src="http://www.w3.org/WAI/wcag1A" alt="Level A conformance icon, W3C-WAI
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0"></A>


Is there any problem in simply coping the logo onto the page?  In other
words, the only difference would be to replace src with something like

src="images/wcag1A.gif"

which refers to the local copy on the site?
