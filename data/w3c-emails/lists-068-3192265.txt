As discussed in our last call, we're going to create some "case law", i.e. 
some examples where we can come to a consensus on acceptability.  Per my 
action item, I've posted three examples at.

http://astro.temple.edu/~kasday/wai/texteg/

We can discuss this in the context of WCAG 1.0 or 2.0.

They represent the "return policy" of a hypothetical web site.  All use 
special fonts or effects.

In example 1, All loops are colored yellow. For example, the inside of the 
loop at the top of the letter P is colored yellow.  This effect cannot be 
produced by CSS or other currently available technology. Is it therefore 
acceptable to present this text as an image?

In example 2, the dots of the i's are two pixels wide instead of one pixel 
wide (the default for Times Roman). This effect cannot be produced by CSS 
or other currently available technology. Is it therefore acceptable to 
present this text as an image?

In example 3, the area of text appears to bulge up, three dimensionally, 
from the center.  Acceptable?

These are extreme examples, but I'm not trying to be flippant: I'm trying 
to get examples that cut to any differences of opinion we may have.

If this discussion belongs in the compliance discussion we can of course 
postpone it till then.

p.s.
To give a hint of my own opinion: the acceptability of example three 
depends on its purpose... as I've tried to argue in general... but so far 
to no avail...
