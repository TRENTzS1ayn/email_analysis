If the effects cannot be produced using CSS, but are desired anyway,
then clearly they -will- be used.  The question then becomes "how can
they be rendered accessible" not "should these be forbidden" (since
that won't work anyway).

As to how to make these accessible, that does depend on the use and
also on whatever other options are available.  For example, this
problem is so trivially and painlessly solved using something akin
to the Edapta architecture, providing scalable text to users with
those needs, and non-scalable text to users who have not expressed
a need for those.
