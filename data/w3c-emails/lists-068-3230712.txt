I think SVG does now have widespread commercial tools since the Adobe
ilistrates and the viewer is avialible for free download.
The download is quick and painless, so it seems to be more a question of
public awerness of these new tecnologies.

I think the argument that we should aviode recomending somthing, that has
commersial builing and a viewing tool, just because it is not widly used,
falles a bit flat.

Afterall the WAI is about recomending difrent ways of doing things, that are
morte accesible. If we were only to recomend what peaple are already doing -
well need I say more.
