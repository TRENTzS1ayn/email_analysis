Is there a w3c policy which simply allows or doesn't allow people to make 
local copies?   If so, lets follow it.  (I couldn't find it however).

If it's up to each w3c group to decide its own policy (which would surprise 
me), and we need to debate this, my two cents would be:

1. If we change the logo in a purely cosmetic way, with no change in 
meaning, it doesn't matter if people are using the old one, so copies can 
be allowed.

2. If we change both the logo's meaning along with its appearance, then 
it's not appropriate to have it change without the page owner being able to 
control it, so local copies should actually be recommended.

I also support the point made by Kynn about the practical problems of 
referring to images on w3c servers.  And thanks William for  pointing that 
copies are OK for the validator.

So I move we post a small errata that local copies be encouraged.
