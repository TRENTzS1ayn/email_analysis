Awareness is the key. If it doesn't come in the box, most people don't
download it. This is especially true of designers, who are the entire market
for Adobe's tools.

Before we even know how (not to mention whether) designers are going to use
it? How would WCAG 1.0 have been drafted before HTML 1.0 was published?

But people are not already doing it. Not in the design community, and not
among anyone but the curious and early adopters. SVG is not widespread, and
it's not going to become that way overnight. There is a lot of
infrastructure to be built before that happens, and my fear is that to
prescribe a solution which clearly will not meet the needs of many people,
including those without up-to-date accessibility technologies, is the
argument that falls flat.

I agree that there should be a strong nudge toward SVG, but "use it right
now and here's how," especially if the idea is that it's tied to a certain
level of compliance.
