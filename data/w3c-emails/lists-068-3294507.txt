What about a version of a page being delivered to both IE5 etc., and a WAP
phone through the use of scripting? Also, what about a "skip optional
content" button only sent to aural browsers (according to the CSS people,
skipping content *isn't* a style. I firmly disagree). Thirdly, what if the
content is simply "You are using browser x"? And so on.
Notice I don't have the solutions, just the questions...

This is a well spotted "guideline inclusion" that we need to discuss.
