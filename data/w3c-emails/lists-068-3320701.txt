Geez! I didn't plan to start an argument, the stats were offered for
whatever they are worth .... whatever that is.
For the record the logs are Unix, collected on the same server as the site
not an outside monitoring service - they could of course be a bit distorted
by the repeat visitors issue.  And I am pretty sure there is a higher % of
things like lynx and pwWebspeak than 'normal'.
