I'm currently downloading the SVG plugin for IE 5/Netscape 4.7
for Windows, from Adobe.

I assume that once I finish this lengthy download process (I'm on a
56K modem), I will be able to view pages which contain inline 
graphics in SVG format, and when I change my font size in my
browser, those images will resized accordingly as well.  Also, I
should be able to access -- using JAWS or Home Page Reader -- the
accessibility information contained -within- those SVG files,
such as titles or text and have those read out loud to me, correct?

Can someone who has gone through this long download please confirm
this for me?  Thanks.  (The file seems to be about 2.42M and just
ended transfer -- I may be able to answer my own questions in a few
minutes.)
