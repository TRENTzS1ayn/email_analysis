Nope, I'm not able to get this to work.  Could someone with experience
with SVG -- such as those of you who are claiming this increases
accessibility for people with low vision -- please explain to me
what I need to do with my browser and/or plugin in order to make
the font size change in accordance with my IE 5 preferences of
"Largest" vs "Smallest" font size?

I am testing on the following map which, since it is in SVG, should
be more accessible than a straight bitmapped GIF image:

Apart from requiring me to download a 2.42M file, I haven't found
any difference yet in my ability to see this image to the scale that
I require, as per my IE 5 text size settings.

I haven't even tried to use my screenreader on this page yet.  I will
wait on that until I am able to resize the map captions at will.
