This is why we have a Web Architecture Group forming up.? In principle we have
a policy, but not all the layers of rules connecting general principles with
bits for individual information resources are in place and connected up and
down the line.

As I have said before and elsewhere, the W3C has been living under the
illusion
that it didn't have to mess with controlling substantive changes.? The
existing
W3C practices are really only sufficiently for W3C pronouncements that are
eternally good.? Web clients don't really honor "expires" data in practice, so
it is hard to mechanize a fully functional policy.? Let's just not go there
over this detail.

There is not a complete plan coming at us from top down.? That is why I
suggest
(in this instance - note exception to general pattern!) we just do it and see
who tells us we did it wrong.? We could ask Gerald who he talked to or who
talked to him about the "copy permitted" legend on the validator icon.

This much of the W3C global policy is clear:? If you change the meaning of a
conformance claim, you should be changing the URI-reference which points to
the
definition of the standard to which [the subject of the claim] claim to
comply.? So on the W3C side if we change the rules, we have to create a new
URI
by which people will identify the rules when they claim conformance to the new
rules.? So we are not supposed to change the rules behind a published URI,
once
the rules are an official pronouncement of the W3C.? Note that this does not
strictly apply to URIs for namespaces, and there is still debate about how
much
change should precipitate a namespace URI change.? Whether and how much we
change the icon when we change the rules is a separate question.? It could be
that the family resemblance of the old vs. new icon is more important than
signaling minute changes in the configuration of the ruleset.

I suggest Len accept as a friendly amendment that we publish "a small erratum"
since there is only one involved here.? Speaking of errata...
