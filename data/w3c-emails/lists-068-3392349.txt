Kynn,
Assuming you're doing this on a windoze IE machine...
Right click on the image, select "zoom-in" from the pop-up palette.  Repeat
as desired.  Pretty cool, no?
I am not sure how one would increase the canvas size.
Someone pointed out that while Flash uses vector graphic format it is not
quote SVG unquote.  Can one resize Flash graphics?  I don't think I have
ever seen this feature demonstrated.

Apart from requiring me to download a 2.42M file, I haven't found
any difference yet in my ability to see this image to the scale that
I require, as per my IE 5 text size settings.

I haven't even tried to use my screenreader on this page yet.  I will
wait on that until I am able to resize the map captions at will.
