As the one who was concerned about change control, I can live with that, as
long as 1) the logo clearly states WCAG 1.0 (which I think it does), and  2)
when we put up conformance logos for WCAG 2.0, they say WCAG 2.0 and are at
a different URL than the WCAG 1.0 logos.

don't want discourage any other companies from using the logo just because
they don't want to reference images on another server, especially companies
as careful as this one.

I not only "can live with that", but I couldn't live with the alternative!
I think it's clearly an omission and there are a number of excellent
reasons for doing what you suggest, Len.
