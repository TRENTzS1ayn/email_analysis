Sorry, I should have posted this a long time ago:-
Important process-note: W3C products (which I'm sure includes logos) are
legally available for use by the public uder certain conditions. For
example, you are allowed to use the "W3C" logo in anything you like as long
as it "accurately reflects the status associated with W3C products." Refer
to: [1] As WCAG is a W3C product, and in recommendation, not only could
people use the W3C logo to say that their page complies to WCAG (as long as
it *does*), but they could also create their own logo incorporating the W3C
logo *as long as* it accurately reflects the status associated with the W3C
product. CAVEAT: Please remember that I am neither a W3C member, or a legal
expert, so please verify for yourselves this statement. See [1] for full
details.

In other words, you don't need to issue a statement that people can use the
WCAG logos locally, they are already allowed. Just cite the reference I
gave [1].

[1] "W3C Trademarks must only be used in a way that
accurately reflects the STATUS
associated with the W3C products."
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/trademark-license-19990516
Please note that the document also says "No right to create modifications
or derivatives of W3C Trademarks is granted pursuant to this license." That
means that the trademarks themselves cannot be modified, but doesn't infer
anything about their usage.

<personal_note>
I know all of this because I modified the valid XHTML logo once by crossing
out the X in protest that XHTML wasn't extensible at the time (or something
like that). I was told that as it accurately reflects the status associated
with W3C products I was allowed to use it! This is a good example that the
W3C is not some overly stodgy group, and that even the W3C can have a bit
of fun...
