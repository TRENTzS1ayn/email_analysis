I'm not a lawyer either but it seems to me that, unfortunately, we can't 
just refer to general W3C policy because the general policy at

http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/logo-usage-20000308


says that
quote
Some usages may differ from the generic W3C Trademark and Servicemark 
License. The policies are further described for these instances.
unquote

and further down, under the wai logos it says
quote
Please refer to the detailed instructions provided by W3C's Web 
Accessibility Initiative.
unquote

and clicking thereon brings us back to our page in WAI space which 
literally says to source the server image.  So strictly speaking, we gotta 
change our page.
