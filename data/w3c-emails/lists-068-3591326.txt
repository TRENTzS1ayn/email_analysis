Dear Group,
Section 1194.22 should be of the most interest to this group.  There is a
table at the end of this section that makes a direct analogy the WCAG 1.0.
For my own edification, I would especially like to have comments from this
group comparing:
(l) plus (m) to 6.3
(n) to 10.2 plus 12.4
I could not find an equivalent (even P3) for (o) and (p).  They might be
covered by Guideline 13 and 7 (respectively).
Please note that the E&IT Accessibility Standards imply no such reference.
Thank you.
Bruce Bailey
