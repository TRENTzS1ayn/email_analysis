Not to canonize either but here's a couple of quotes that are pertinent to 
semantic/presentational/+ issues:

"...what determines the words in the sentence and the sentence itself is 
the thought."
Alonso Reed and Brainerd Kellogg,
     Higher Lessons in English, 1877

"If you write what you mean rather than what you want done with it, then it 
can be repurposed so much better."
Tim Berners-Lee at XML 2000.
