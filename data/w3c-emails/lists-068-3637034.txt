Check this out!
Please forgive the protocol breach with the (12K) attachment.  I must also
compliment Adobe for getting back to me within one business day.
Assuming one has the Adobe Viewer installed, one can open the SVG file in
either IE or NN, right-click, and Zoom In.  The whole image enlarges.  One
cannot scroll, but I consider this very accessible (resetting to the
"Original View", and zooming on another area is fast and easy).  The only
problem I see is the implication that, in order to be scaleable, the whole
page would have to contained in SVG.  No one complains about this limitation
with Flash, so maybe this is no big deal.  Given my experiment with renaming
a .SVG file to .HTM, with XHTML might not there be fall-through potential
for browsers without SVG compatibility?
Cheers, Bruce

Subject: Resizing the SVG canvas



Hello Bruce,

If you omit "height", "width", and "viewBox" from the <SVG> tag, and open
the
SVG directly in the browser, the SVG artwork will resize without the
constraint
of the view box.

Thanks for your interest in SVG,
Corey

I would like the SVG view to provide the feature of increasing the canvas
size.
Maybe the containing HTML page would have to be modified? If I "zoom in",
the
whole image should get larger and, if it would still fit on the page, NOT be
constrained to the original box size. Is this possible to do within the W3C
specification? Any chance you will add this feature in the near future?
Thank
you. Please write me.
