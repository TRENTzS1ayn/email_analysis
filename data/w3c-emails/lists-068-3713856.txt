I find this to be questionable in that it may not be possible in a
fully CC/PP-driven, dynamic presentation model.

In other words, it may be hard for someone who is not using specific
hardware/software/environments/preferences to confirm accessibility
for someone who _is_, because different presentations are delivered.

This seems a bit like a meta-issue rather than an actual accessibility
issue; it doesn't actually affect the accessibility of the content
but rather someone's ability to evaluate that accessibility.  I am not
convinced that those are on the same level of requirement, or even
that this -needs- to be included in our guidelines.
