Here is a document I have been working on for some time (before WCAG 2.0)
The goal was to create a one page summary of access principles and
approaches.

It is not limited to WEB.   It is intended to be broader in nature.  You
will note the parallel with WCAG 2.0 though.
It is passed on for general interest - and for any comments or thoughts.
It is very much an work in progress.  Looking forward to your comments.
Gregg
