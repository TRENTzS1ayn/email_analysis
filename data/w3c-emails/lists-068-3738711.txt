GV:: "Make all information...perceivable"

WL: After all these years and reams of discussions I only rue that we need 
to explain this fundamental in such excruciating detail.

It is because we (humankind) have always reacted to "differences" rather 
than embracing inclusion.

There's a DRM T-shirt inscribed "The Only Difference is the Difference" but 
lack of general appreciation of our mutual "sibling-hoodedness" 
necessitates almost endless discussions about the details that underlie 
affirming our membership in one another.

So some of us continue to try to make our output simple as others insist on 
not making it too simple - and we will continue/overcome/triumph/+.

My comment is that we are clearly on same/similar tracks and have been for 
a while. Gregg's table is a useful piece of the game.
