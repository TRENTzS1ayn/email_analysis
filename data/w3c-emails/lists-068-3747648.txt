Greg,

    From first study, it looks like a very comprehensive document. I would
suggest one addition (which may need to be restated elsewhere. In the first
table, under "How - General" you say:

presented (rendered) in any sensory form (e.g. visual-print,
auditory-speech, tactile-braille)

The presentation needs to be rendered in both visual-print and
visual-graphics to cover both needs of visual people. It's good to add
these users to the list of Who, but they need a corresponding How.
