I think I agree with Kynn - being testable doesn't seem to me to
automatically enhance accessibility. (But explaining accessibility features
of the site and how to use them probably does - I'll add that to my  list of
emails to send...)

However, it is a useful feature. It may also be an intersting issue for the
Authoring Tool Guidelines, at least as a possible extra feature, or a
technique that would be nice to have.

  I find this to be questionable in that it may not be possible in a
  fully CC/PP-driven, dynamic presentation model.

  In other words, it may be hard for someone who is not using specific
  hardware/software/environments/preferences to confirm accessibility
  for someone who _is_, because different presentations are delivered.

  This seems a bit like a meta-issue rather than an actual accessibility
  issue; it doesn't actually affect the accessibility of the content
  but rather someone's ability to evaluate that accessibility.  I am not
  convinced that those are on the same level of requirement, or even
  that this -needs- to be included in our guidelines.
