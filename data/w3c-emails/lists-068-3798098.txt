This is what I was trying to address with the following example in X.4
quote
Positive Example: Two sites created from common data through different 
transformations, PROVIDED that the transformation rules are publically 
visible for validation.
unquote

In other words, its fine to provide different presentations to different 
hardware/software/environments/preferences if the orginal data, and the 
rules creating the different presentations are available to the tester.  In 
fact, to the extent the rules are machine readable, much or all of the 
validation could be done automatically.   The other extreme is an 
alternative version of a site that is created completly by hand and that 
structures the information in a different way... testing the equivalence of 
such a site is very labor consuming and hence costly.

It's true that this is a different type of guideline and it's a legitimate 
question whether it's within scope of this particular document.  However, I 
think it's crucial that it be formally stated somewhere within WAI.

In the real world, requirements that are costly to test are tested 
inadequately or are ignored.
