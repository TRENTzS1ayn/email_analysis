FragID's are good because of the backwards compatability, but I hope that
in 5-10 years from now we'll all be using XPath/XPointer to reference
stuff. It's a primary accessibility feature that you must be able to refer
to stuff, otherwise by definition it isn't accessible!

I feel a quote coming up: "If you write what you mean rather than what you
want done with it, then it can be repurposed so much better." This is in
line with what Kynn was talking about, that if you have a source that says
what you mean, you can then apply what you want done with it:
presentation(content). Brilliant!

Roll on CC/PP / XHTML 2.0. If these go to rec. before WCAG 2.0 (howver
unlikely), won't that make the Techniques documents staggeringly difficult?
Also, I wonder what mention should be made of XHTML Basic? We should be
pushing for accessibility of information to all Web users...but if that
means providing thousands of types of alternative content, people aren't
going to do it. <sigh/>
