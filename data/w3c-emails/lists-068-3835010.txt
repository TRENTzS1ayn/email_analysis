Yes. No.

No matter what we call what we do, others will choose to selectively 
choose/use/enshrine/+

In particular there are "standards" and various (de facto, dejure, etc.) 
standards. In our trade "standards" is most often used in connection with 
ISO stuff and I'll lay odds we don't want to go there for a while. OTOH 
what they get called is far less important than what they say. Eye on 
donut, not on hole.
