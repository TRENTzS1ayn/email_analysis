In fact, to the extent the rules are machine readable, much or all of the validation could be done automatically. 

What if that ruleset is part of a company's strategic advantage
and they do not wish to publicly release their intellectual property
relating to how their rules engine functions?

I don't agree that a company needs to release the internal workings
of their web pages just to make it easy for an automated tester
script to confirm certain things.  I feel that has little to do 
with actual accessibility.

Which groups of people with disabilities have their access to content
increased by such a rule?  (Answer:  none.)
