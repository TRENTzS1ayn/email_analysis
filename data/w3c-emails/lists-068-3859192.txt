In our trade "standards" is most often used in connection with ISO stuff and I'll lay odds we don't want to go there for a while. OTOH what they get called is far less important than what they say.

William, I think it is important because it shapes how we think
about what we are doing.  Whether or not they are actual official
standards, the items we create will be different if we think of them
as "rules" or if we think of them as "advice."

WCAG 1.0 is inconsistent -- some were written as rules, some as
advice -- and it is applied inconsistently as well.  I would rather
see us focus on one or the other, either we are writing as if we
are writing rules, or we are writing as if we are writing advice.
