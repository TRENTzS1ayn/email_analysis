The key is "documents" -- I believe that our current plan calls
for technology-specific, interconnected techniques documents,
and I think of these as "proposed implementation plans for WCAG
2.0" rather than the current hodge-podge collection of techniques
we have now.

This would allow, for example, a techniques document on "using
adaptive transformations to satisfy WCAG 2.0", one on "using
XHTML and CSS to satisfy WCAG 2.0" etc.
