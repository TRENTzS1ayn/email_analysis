To the best of my knowledge, yes -- I believe the current plans
are for a number of techniques documents to be written, and for
them to be technology specific, and for them to, effectively,
"interpret" the set-in-stone "normative" guidelines for each specific
technology set.

I hope this is still the case as I think that it's a marvelous
plan. :)
