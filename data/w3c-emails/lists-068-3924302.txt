I think we are writing both "rules" (or suggested rules?) and "advice" - 
usually the latter are best found in the techniques/examples parts, but 
they inform the former and must be dealt with almost simultaneously. If we 
put on our "imperator hats" and decree that henceforth no "altless" (with 
due exceptions) will be tolerated we must also be ready to advise how this 
is to be done.

So we are writing rules with concommitant advice on how to obey them?

As to the instant discussion of whether "testability" should be a 
requirement we'll probably go through the usual discuss/decide/vote cycle. 
At this time I'm still voting "aye". Testability is an inherent necessity 
for conveying accessibility status, which in turn is a requirement for 
accessibility itself. IMO.
