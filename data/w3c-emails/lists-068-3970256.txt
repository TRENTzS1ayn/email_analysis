It's because the "accessibility evaluator" is not a distinct person from 
the "user". One aspect of using the Web is to be able to tell if a portion 
thereof is going to be accessible. One could use a tool to determine this 
if the testability information were included.

It's a P2 simply because its absence makes "...difficult for people with 
disabilities to access the web" in the above sense. One thing about the Web 
(as distinct from particular Web chunks) that matters is being able to 
determine if a site will work for your circumstances. This can only be 
determined by an agent of yours if it's testable..
