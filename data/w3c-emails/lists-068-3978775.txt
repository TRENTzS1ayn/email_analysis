William,

Reading yours and Len's advice on testability, I have a concern. Kynn
recently pointed out that the checkpoints that address using illustrations
to enhance understanding wouldn't be testable, as to whether they are
illustrations or some other graphic. If the guidelines go in the direction
of testable "accessibility', it may miss whole areas of "accessibility"
which aren't machine testable. It could take the needs of those folks with
disabilities that don't test well out of the loop.
