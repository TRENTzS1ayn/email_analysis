At least we have found the "does too, does not" sticking point in our 
disagreement. In my obstinacy/conviction I still (despite your reasoned 
discourse) vote for "does too". Remember we are not talking about the page 
in isolation, we are talking about the page as "Web Content" - the first 
two words in our output effort. We are talking about accessibility to the 
Web, not just to its elements.

The Web will be significantly more accessible (especially/including) for 
PWDs if: 1) its contents are properly indexed; 2) the accessibility status 
of the contents are determinable *before* access is attempted.

That's my story and I'm sticking by it. At least so far!
