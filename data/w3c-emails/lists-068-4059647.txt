Isn't that a conformance issue, though?  Seeing as no 'agent' can
adequately measure accessibility by itself, you would instead be
relying on self-reported claims of compliance.  If the accuracy
of those claims can be guaranteed (which is iffy), then they can
be relied upon.  But it's not possible to verify accessibility
status automatically, is it?

Therefore, claims will have to be trusted, although they should be
challengeable.  (There's a good proposed conformance scheme 
requirement:  a way to challenge a conformance claim.)
