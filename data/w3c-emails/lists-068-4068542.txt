Nope. It's a reporting of (asserted) conformance details, not conformance 
per se. The external checks on trustworthiness will ensue, I'm sure.

"you would instead be relying on self-reported claims of compliance."

Yep. And the means to test that these claims: 1) were asserted; 2) 
specified how they were tested and are testable, e.g. "I ran Bobby on this" 
or...

Even though this is in theory doable with just icons, the proposed detailed 
methods provide a lot more context/confidence/checkability (love that 
alliteration).
