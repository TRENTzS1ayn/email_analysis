I will review the detailed methods again to try to see what you
are seeing in them, William.

Do you agree that "detailed methods" probably belong in techniques,
even if we agree that some sort of compliance verification

(I think part of my reaction to the proposed checkpoints may have
been simply a reaction to the fact that it seemed to mandate one,
and only one, solution for the problem.)
