Anne, do you believe this information should be self-reported,
reported by an outside agency (say, people who run a search engine
or web index), or evaluated by some sort of automatic metrics?

Is the "number of illustrations" metrics useful?  Many web pages
use "decorative" images, navigation buttons, and many other things
which are not really "illustrations" in the sense that you have
argued for; thus the number of "illustrations" -- if that means
just graphics counts -- may not be useful at all.

Is there any reasonable way to measure reading level automatically?
I have not heard good things about the methods which exist to do
this automatically.
