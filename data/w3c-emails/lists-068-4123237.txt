William,

I think I can frillify your "story" to "The Web will be significantly more
accessible to all users if indexing were better" ... and search engines
permitted input on choices of various features of pages/sites, such as
illustrations, reading level, magnification enabled, sound, text version,
plug-ins needed, and whatever else you want to know. Put the right keyword
in and it hits the search for that feature.
