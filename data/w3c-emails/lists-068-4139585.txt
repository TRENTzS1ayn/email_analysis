Kynn,

I thinking of "metadata" that would be useful to a teacher, and, initially
it wouldn't matter if it was self-reported by the author in the keywords,
or collected by an online tool and reported by search engines or indexes.
But it would be easier for the page author to report the information if
they entered the data under "page properties" to be set before page is
uploaded.  The author is the best one to tell if/how many of the graphics
on a page are illustrations and which are there for other reasons. 

 But, this "accessibility" issue doesn't seem to be as much about users
with disabilities as all users.
