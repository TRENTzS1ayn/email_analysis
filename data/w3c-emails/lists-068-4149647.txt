I want to write up the technical requirements for making content accessible
to people. This can be used by people who have to implement "accessibility"
as a base resource.

I don't really care what it is called. I am also prepared to accept that some
of the testing of accesibility will ultimately be subjective in nature.

 Here's why...

Objectivity is also a subjective concept - this is what schools full of
people learn when they study "post-modernism", various philosophical ideas,
journalism, etc. (Also, people who learn serious amounts of physics,
chemistry, etc.)

Also, remember that the 508 rules only cover one nation, of about 280 million
people. The European Union, in its e-Europe intiative, committed to WCAG
level double-A (as I recall), for a number of governments/nations, covering
at least as many people. The Australian government requires that sites do not
discriminate against people because of their disabilities, and suggests that
WCAG provides the best available information on how to avoid doing so. THe
Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines require a reference for what is
required to produce content that is accessible - they currently use WCAG.

(which in total means we are talking about something like 10% of the world
in all the examples I have given)

In other words, there are many different consumers of a list of technical
requirements. Each will potentially use them differently, and make their own,
informed (or otherwise) decisions on what is too hard in "the current
situtation.

  Keep in mind that the stated reason the 508 rules did not embrace more of
  the WCAG 1.0 P1 checkpoints is that they were not objective (i.e., testable)
  enough.

  Do we want to write "guidelines" or "standards"?  Do we need to choose?
