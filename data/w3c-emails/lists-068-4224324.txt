Because Charles so timely stated "Objectivity is also a subjective concept" then the idea of a "barrier" making the Web beyond merely "difficult" to use - bordering on impossible - is clearly tenable from the POV of getting to the information strewn about on the shoulders of the infobahn.

William, what type of indexing are we talking about?  Is a simple
"all words indexing" similar to that provided by search engines
acceptable (e.g. searchbutton.com), or do you mean the type of
human-generated index found at the back of books?  Or is this a
technique-level question?

I don't agree with the P1 rating, by the way, to me it's clearly a
P2, but I think this points out the problem with the extremely
fuzzy distinction between "difficult" and "impossible" that separate
P1 from P2.

I _do_ agree that indexes, searchability, meta-content, should be
a guideline/requirement.
