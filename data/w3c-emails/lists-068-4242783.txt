By Jove, I think you've got it! There may (almost certainly will) be more 
to it, but the flavor of how the Web will work as a "personal assistant" is 
captured very nicely. Ah,the curse of living in interesting times.

KB:: "this then gives the user the option of accessing the site, or...what?"

WL: The "what?" is exciting enough that you've joined in starting a whole 
enterprise to help answer it. Both the eDapta (my punctuation?) and WCAG 
undertakings, like your 508 Website are harbingers of an era in which the 
almost universal/unconscious/ubiquitous proliferation of tools whose 
innards do all the stuff your scenario depicts exemplify how "tangled a Web 
we'll weave."

Incidentally I'm not sure that "there is no way to test whether or not a 
site will be usable without javascript enabled, short of attempting to use 
that site" and I'd wager that if someone else took that stance (say in the 
ER group) you'd be able to mount a challenge. We may be in the infancy of 
designing just such tests?

KB:: "I _do_ agree that indexes, searchability, meta-content, should be a 
guideline/requirement."

SBP:: "I'm pretty sure that indexing and general metadata related 
checkpoint(s) should be explicitly defined in WCAG 2.0."

WL: And grandpa makes three! We are finding widespread agreement on this 
(non-?) issue and before it gets too much like Mom's Apple Pie, we'd best 
devil the details. Kynn's part of an entire start-up enterprise focused on 
part of this, Sean's beginning program at http://uwimp.com actually gets us 
started with exemplification. Charles previously said "if you jump on the 
bleeding edge and download tools that sometimes work and play around, you 
can have it all a few years ago", which points out that the means of doing 
this (important for confirming that what we seek to call for is in fact 
doable) is probably documentable.

I am personally taken with the idea that WAI's role in leading to a Web 
that can be increasingly helpful to everyone is within our grasp.

Interesting times, indeed!
