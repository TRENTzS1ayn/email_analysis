Do you believe it should be a P1 because it is important and good,
or because it strictly follows the definition of priority 1 in
WCAG 1.0, which means that certain identifiable groups of people
with disabilities will be _absolutely unable_ to access content
if it is not indexed but otherwise follows all other WCAG standards
for accessibility?

I think we need to be careful to distinguish things which we
believe _must_ be done from things which fit the definition of
priority 1 (however we define that -- currently it's defined in
WCAG 1.0).

For example, using valid markup is P2 and using illustrations is P3;
but I believe Sean and Anne (respectively) could argue that those
are essential for access -- but not necessarily P1 as we have
narrowly defined it.

To me, this illustrates a weakness in the P1/P2/P3 system; there
are some things which I believe _must_ be done but which are
not P1 items -- the solution is not to redefine them as P1 by
ignoring our own fuzzy definition, but instead to create a firmer
definition of what P1 means.  P1 _should_ correspond with, in
my opinion, "we think these are the most important things that
you should make highest priority", but at present that is not
the case, by definition.
