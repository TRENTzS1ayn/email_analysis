Kynn,

Following the current definition of the prioritites, including
illustrations should be a priority 1 issue, based strictly on the numbers
of people served. 

I'm unsure where metadata should be. Certainly it would be easier to
"test" for priority one items by metadata, so it would be helpful, and
perhaps make the difference between people with speciial needs finding
sites they can use, or not. Perhaps the distinction needs to be between
supported and unsupported meta data. The supported stuff should be priority
1, and the stuff where we're hoping for future inclusion in priority 2 or 3
(since it actually makes no difference to most/any users now). 

Anne
