While a lot of good points have been made here, I have an uncomfortable
feeling that we may be going to far.  That is, stepping beyond accessibility
into 'good design'.  Although it is certainly true that the two are tightly
linked, I feel we need to draw a line somewhere or we might as well be
developing 'web design guidelines' instead of accessibility guidelines.
In my usual, relate it to the physical world -
 The ADA tells you to put up signs indicating the location of a handicap
access to a building, it does not tell you to put up a sign with your
company name and a description of what it does.
 How a company (web site) chooses to identify and describe itself would seem
to be a 'good business practice' issue not an accessibility issue.
