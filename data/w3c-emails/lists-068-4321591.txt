Let's consider the original example that Marti gave: a billboard for a
company. "The ADA tells you to put up signs indicating the location of a
handicap access to a building, it does not tell you to put up a sign with
your company name and a description of what it does." But what if you were
cognitevely disabled or didn't recognize the makers of the sign etc.?
Indexing and describing things is an integral part of accessibility: why
would I even *want* to access something if I didn't know what it was?
Indexing and metadata (data about data, i.e. descriptive data) the way that
the WAI will (surely) be approaching it will also include metadata about
how accessible a site/URI is; look at Kynn's excellent example for further
explanation of that.
So, William, what is it really like to get old? I feel that we often forget
to include "age" as a disability (too young or too old), in much the same
way as Ann steers us in the direction of cognitive disabilities. We are
focused on"accessibility for all disabled people", and really I think
that's everyone...

Happy holidays everyone! I suppose it may already be Christmas Day in some
parts of the world... (it's 7:22PM GMT). 'Tis the season to be jolly :-)
