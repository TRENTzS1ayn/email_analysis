Only if by so claiming you are creating that "definition". The things you 
cite don't qualify either with a formal definition or a common-sense one. 
OTOH aging is so closely associated with almost inevitable "ability 
decrements" that it really does qualify. E.g. my urologist says "if you get 
to be 90, you WILL have prostate cancer" although there may be some 
nonagenarian out there who didn't. I still read perfectly well without 
glasses but I need more light on the page. That latter is analogous to 
accessing via indices, etc. I "used to could" find items with word 
searches, now I can't. I didn't get lazy (in fact I'm working longer/harder 
than at almost any time in my life), I lost a certain ability - hence the 
term "disability".

There is a detailed version of this inevitability fairly deep into 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/PWD-Use-Web/Overview.html which says 
"Changes in people's functional ability due to aging can
include subtle and/or gradual changes in abilities or a combination of 
abilities including vision, hearing, dexterity and memory. Barriers can 
include any of the issues already mentioned above. Any one of these 
limitations can affect an individual's ability to access Web content. 
Together, these changes can become more complex to accommodate."

So if I claim I'm "disabled" because I'm quite senior, take it as a 
non-frivolous item. Not just because of the 3/4 century but the inevitable 
accompaniment.

You'll see!
