Other guidelines (clear writing, for instance) are "of concern to all"..

Indexing is an accessibility issue because its absence makes the Web 
relatively inaccessible to a reasonably well-defined group.

If it helps others, fine. If clear writing and illustrations help other 
than people with cognitive disabilities, fine.

If audio descriptions allows my wife to "watch" soaps without looking at 
the screen that doesn't make it any less of an accessibility issue.

If we must parse "potential backlash" then count me out. The idea that 
taking up *any* issue threatens our credibility threatens my credibility.
