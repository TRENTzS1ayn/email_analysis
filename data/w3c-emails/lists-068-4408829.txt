Marti,

I share your concerns about going into "good design" instead of remaining
within accessibility, so it is important that the metadata that we ask
authors to include on their pages, be limited to that metadata which will
be used by human disabled users. 

Comparing metadata to signs is a good example. It isn't enough to merely
"reserve" parking for the handicapped, but ya gotta put signs (and
reminders of fines for misuse) before you have fulfilled the law, so the
handicapped drivers can find 'em.
