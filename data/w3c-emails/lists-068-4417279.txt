This question came up on the XHTML-L mailing list; I've quoted my
reply below which contains some context and the body of my concern.

Namely, that by eliminating the start/value attributes for ordered
lists and choosing to rely upon CSS 2, the XHTML working group has
made the mistake of embedding actual -content- (the "correct" 
number values for an item are content or meta-content) in CSS, which
is a no-no.

Is this something for the WCAG group (to add to our guidelines "don't
do this even though by spec you can"), for P&F (as it represents an
error in XHTML/HTML Strict), or even for the XHTML working group 
itself?  I'm not sure if I'm writing to the right place or not.

PS:  I think that this example is related to why I didn't like the
      previous proposal floated on this list for resolving abuse
      of "class."  By suggesting that semantics be embedded in
      CSS via a property for that purpose, and presenting that to
      the user via exposing "class" information, you're ignoring the
      WCAG checkpoint which requires pages to be usable without
      CSS.  What's needed is better use of the markup, not a hack
      in CSS nor elimination of class.
