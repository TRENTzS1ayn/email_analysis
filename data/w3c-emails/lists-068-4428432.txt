We should not be making "updates" to the icon; once it is created,
it stays fixed and at that URI permanently.  The only way we'd
"change" it would be an update to a new version or the like, and
that would require a new URI.

Thus I don't believe it is "best" to reference the W3C server;
in fact, I'm not entirely sure the webmaster would appreciate
that at all, given the extra traffic necessary.
