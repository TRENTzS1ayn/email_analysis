One advantage to storing it centrally is that the W3C would be able to
discover which sites are claiming which levels of compliance. This could be
valuable in getting metrics on how many sites are adopting the guidelines.

To take it a step further, it's theoretically possible to retroactively
"revoke" compliance logos from sites we know to be non-compliant. Not that
I'd advocate such a thing, but that's one benefit of keeping it centralized.
The traffic issue, of course, is a huge mitigating factor.
