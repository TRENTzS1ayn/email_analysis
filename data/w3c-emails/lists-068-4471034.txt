Yes there are.

Yes there are.

And the way to become "prepared" is to prepare.

It's an educational process but it must begin somewhere, sometime. I'm 
suggesting here and now for those items.

People who hand code (like me) won't have any trouble and I've already made 
it a part of my routine.

The "requirements" will be trivially doable. Take a look at 
http://uwimp.com and see if you really think this is some severe burden?
