> They can't afford indexing tools to produce RDF

Sorry, missed that. RDF is easy to generate, and/or extract from HTML, but
it's best use comes in describing "pure" XML. As I see more and more XML
applications and langauges being banded about, they invariably don't have
decent metadata frameworks included with them (even XHTML is inadequate
with its meta elements). RDF provides that framework for anyone wanting to
add indexing to their pages. As for a lack of tools, have a look at Dave
Beckett's site: http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/discovery/rdf/resources
It may be that such indexing is provided for accessibility tools of the
future that read accessibility claims written in EDL etc. The future, as
always, is very hard to predict, but it is us who shape it...

Happy holidays,
