While I fully support this notion as a technique (obviously, else I would
be working on UWIMP etc.), I think that it would be hard/inadviasable to
outline implementation details in the WCAG guidelines (especailly as one of
the key tenets of WCAG is technology independance). It would be best to say
something about adding indexing according to technological contraints, and
then adding a fuller eplanation to an XHTML/RDF Techniquies document.

Could you possibly iterate these issues (if you believe they'll be of
benefit to the list)?

Happy holidays all,
