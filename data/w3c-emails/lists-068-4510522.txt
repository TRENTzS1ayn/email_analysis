If the guideline were to say, "use indexing technologies to (foo)", I think
that, at least, the techniques document would have to say "by indexing
technologies, we mean RDF, done like this," until something better comes
along. The technology independence plank, I believe, is to allow for entropy
in data. Entropy in metadata is a whole other ball of wax, potentially
preventing the proposed guideline from achieving its desired effect, and if
we don't say what we mean here, that's what we'll get.

I can think of two offhand:
- Labor-intensive for users with legacy content. I'd prefer that user agents
that need or desire WCAG compliance metadata look for it in a certain place
(e.g., ./wcag.xml), and designers can override it if they like with a
<link>. (A perhaps welcome side-effect here is that non-compliant content
providers will begin to see how many users they have with assistive
technologies, simply by tracking 404s.)
- meta name="description" is already used (read: contaminated) by search
engines. The contents of the average meta description tag are questionable
because many content providers exploit them for best results in the engines,
not for accurately describing the data within.
