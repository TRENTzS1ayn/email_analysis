Yes, it is true that Web browse statistics are at best very misleading. For
example, I have some of my lynx copies set to claim theyare netscape, in
order not to be denied access to sites. And given the huge prevalence of
caching and proxying outside the US (It seems to eb cheap enough there to
provide straight-out access, so they don't seem to bother as much) the
picture gets distorted even more.

Cheers

  It's not an argument at all, it's simply a warning -- web stats
  are very deceptive at first glance and rarely tell you what you
  think they're telling you.
