Hmmm. I think we need to give a good answer to this one. It will probably
come back. (My ideal is to expand always, until user agents are smart enough
to look it up themselves...)

cheers

Re: checkpoint 4.2, "Specify the expansion of each
abbreviation or acronym in a document where it first
occurs."

Since many HTML documents are not designed to be
read linearly, what is the definition of the first
occurence in that case?  Is there consensus on
this?  (Based on postings I've seen, it seems unlikely.)
