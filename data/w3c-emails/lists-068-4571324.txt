Hi Bruce,

Them's kind words but I guess your book editor was too easily convinced by
the long hair and beard <grin/>.

It is true that Amaya's support for SVG is at this stage very limited and
lacks some crucial elements like path (although it is being worked on as we
speak). You are correct about the first example I gave - it should have been
http://www.w3.org/2000/Talks/1116-oz/slide31-0

As I said in the original post, mixed namespace content is not something that
browsers are very good at yet outside a few special examples. I believe that
Mozilla can in fact handle the examples like Amaya does (but with more
elements supported). Since I also used Amaya to edit them, and since they do
provide content in other browsers, I was happy with that (these are slides
from a presentation I gave, so don't always make a lot of sense out of
context).

I think in the HTML world people will be using OBJECT or its cousins for a
while yet. In the XML world people are inclined to use SVG as a layout
language for presenting content. Which brings up the question again of
whether it is better to use CSS and classes in an existing format, or to work
on proper namespace support in browsers...

Cheers

Charles

  Dear Charles,
  You're definitely a guru in my book.
  I hope you don't mind experimenting with this a little more!
  I am sure it's me, but please double check the URLs you gave.
  I tried IE 5 / NN 4 (on the Mac, no Adobe SVG plugin) and Lynx, Amaya, IE 5,
  NN 4 and 6 (on the PC, w/ Adobe SVG plugin).
  On all platforms, slide32 brought up a PNG graphic.  There was ALT text, but
  no other (non-trivial) text nor links (aside from the navigation buttons).
  Slide40 was on RDF and only Amaya handled it correctly.
  I was distressed to discover that Amaya could not handle the Adobe SVG
  examples at URL <http://www.adobe.com/svg/demos/>
