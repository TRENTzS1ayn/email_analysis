I agree with Al - it might not be perfect but it's many steps towards it...

As I read the WCAG, the requirement is that summaries are provided for
tables. In many cases a summary is provided visually on this site as if it
were a header. Because it is simply a seperate cell in a table, this is not
reflected in markup. If this cell were instead the first row of the
sub-table, marked as a header and then styled, it would provide a summary
for a simple table, and be nice design and other good things. (Do english
talk about Mummy and Steak and Kidney pies? I am trying to recall the
Australian equivalent of the American phrase "motherhood and apple pie" -
things that "everybody" believe are good".)

Something like the following

 <tr><td class="header2">Locations</td></tr>
 <tr><td><table summary="addresses">...
   <tr><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr></table></td></tr>

could be replaced by

 <tr><td><table>
   <tr><th colspan="2" class="header2">Locations</th></tr>
   <tr><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr></table></td></tr>

In my opinion. Any other bids?

  How much use they are to how many people I can't quantify.? But there are
  people with bona fide disabilities such as dyslexia for whom they are a
  considerable aid.? For better or for worse there is no way _in the markup_ to
  distinguish between gratuitous decoration and effective graphic enhancement of
  communication.? In this respect what we need to get you is not guidelines
  but a
  right-brained partner in design.? The art is in the integration, the gestalt.

  At the time that we negotiated this attribute into HTML 4.0, the concept was
  that it gave the author a place to put text which was to _follow and expand on
  the CAPTION (or TITLE)_ _as required_ in the context of linear reading.

  A problem in the HTML specification is that if you only read the
  explanation of
  SUMMARY this is not clear.? One has to read the discussion of CAPTION to
  understand the "optional expansion to complete the orientation to the TABLE"
  function assigned to SUMMARY.

  If your Organisational Index is as you describe it, "no SUMMARY at all" sounds
  like a perfectly good design for effective communication.? If you feel that
  the
  language of the guidelines makes the SUMMARY sound obligatory, we shound take
  that up in the content guidelines group.? It could just be that the message is
  getting exaggerated as it passes through multiple stages of transmission,
  as in
  the game of 'rumors.'? Part of the problem is that there is a vast
  variation in
  complexity among those document components marked TABLE.? The SUMMARY can
  range
  from copious to none as a function of the actual TABLE and the orientation to
  the table already afforded by CAPTION and/or TITLE.

  The HTML Techniques for WCAG 1.0 do present the CAPTION first in terms of
  providing orientation to a TABLE, and how the TITLE is an alternative to the
  CAPTION in doing this.? It talks about how the SUMMARY is more important in
  the
  absense of a CAPTION but it never gets down to the point of a) saying that the
  SUMMARY should be written on the assumption that it will be read after the
  CAPTION or TITLE (which should be true) and "if the TABLE is simple and the
  CAPTION or TITLE says what there is to say about the TABLE, no SUMMARY may be
  needed."? Which is also true.
