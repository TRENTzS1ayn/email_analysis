By Mozilla I mean the Mozilla browser that Netscape takes its source code
from (although they are different beasts). You can get it from
http://www.mozilla.org - ther are also notes ther on the difference between
it and Netscape 6, but mostly Netscape was more concerned about backwards
compatibility with Netscape (and perhaps commercial release type stability),
and Mozilla is more concerned about standards conformance in the future (my
very rough over-simplification).

I believe that the latest version of Amaya now handles plain SVG files. One
thing it does not deal with is the embed element - it is written to conform
to the various W3C specifications, and using the embed element doesn't.
(There are also a few basic bits of SVG it is missing that make the
difference between an interesting demonstration of the technology and a real
working application, but they're coming. Remeber that the Amaya Team is
basically 4 people, two of them part time, and that there is a lot for them
to work on...)

cheers

  Dear Charles,
  I should have poked around with different slides rather than just throwing
  multiple browsers at the wrong one!
  As you promised, Amaya displays quite interesting behavior with Slide31 --
  definitely worth the look!
  None of the other browsers did anything worth while -- but they did all show
  the text!  What do you mean by "Mozilla", Netscape Navigator 6 (Mac or PC,
  with or without Adobe's plug in) was just as useless for that slide as all
  the others!  (The "about" box in NN 6 says "Mozilla 5".)
  Amaya DOES do a nice job with magnifying everything (I guess like Opera) --
  but jeez, does it only increase half a pixel at a time?  I had to "Zoom in"
  like a dozen times before I could notice a difference.  (And how do I reset
  the zoom level without quitting Amaya?)
  Any SVG examples you know of that work with BOTH Amaya and Adobe's viewer?
  Amaya just reported parsing errors when I tried to feed it Adobe's examples
  directly.  Embedded SVG files don't come up at all.  Is there such a thing
  as an SVG validator?
  Thanks for your time!
  Sincerely,
  Bruce
