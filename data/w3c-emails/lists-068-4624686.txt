Okay, tried Mozilla 0.6 too.  Same effects as with the big boys.  SVG
graphics don't load (from your slide, nor the Adobe examples).  My Mozilla
install seems a little flaky though -- I didn't have a location window at
first, but it seems to be working now.  I was using the latest (12/22)
release of Amaya too.  But the only stand-alone SVG files I threw at it were
the ones from Adobe.  It didn't like them.  I am amazed by the constant
updates of Amaya.  They must be some amazing four people.  (I still feel the
UI is awkward, but I guess that come from their Unix backgrounds.)
