I hesitate to bring it up, but there is also the issue that the official
versions have some flaws.  There was the issues with .png files being served
instead of .gif (I think that's been resolved) and coming up blank with some
popular browsers.  The WAI button don't use the "browser safe" palette and
are larger (in bit depth and pixel size) than they need to be. The WAI
conformance icons also don't match up nicely with the other W3C banner
buttons (the "W3C" portion is too small).  Take a look at the bottom of the
W3C home page to see what I mean.  It's been about a year since I first
pointed these picayune problems out.  Any chance they will be fixed?
