This is as good a place as any to raise the issue.? The preferred place to
deal
with it would, I think, be in PF, because we would like to use PF to head off
as many "the spec lets you do this, but don't" rules as possible before they
are needed.

[Aside, general note:  Don't worry too much about where you raise issues; just
do it.  Let the chairs worry scopes and charters - that's their job.  Might as
well give them something to do.]

However, what we are trying to accomplish in PF and GL are so intimately
intertwined that it is not easy to send it one place and feel it is being
dealt
with in the most constructive manner without at the outset setting a hook
for a
check-back from time to time.
