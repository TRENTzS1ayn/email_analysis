That is a clarification question for the 508 "life after reccommendation"
activity.

"Verbal tags" is a way of restating what is intended by requiring "text
equivalents" in other words.? Only the words have been changed to protect the
purity of the idea.

You have to read 'verbal' as "in words" and 'tag' as "markup, built-in
annotation" in this paragraph.? Neither 'text,' nor 'verbal,' if taken too
strictly, says exactly what one wants.? This has been the source of
attempts in
the User Agent group to create more precise definitions.

One possible work item for the "glossary maintenance task group" would be to
coordinate a cross-explanation between this language and the WAI language that
both [corporate] authors could be happpy with.
