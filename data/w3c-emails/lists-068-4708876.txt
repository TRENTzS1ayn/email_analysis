I think this is what we mean by "use a data model to capture the information,
seperate the information from its presentation (although that is more
complex than I think we normally say it is), provide a defualt (set of)
presentations.

(There is another question of whether the information in an ordered list is
in fact paticlar numbers, or just the order of things, but I will leave that
for another topic/thread/day)

  This question came up on the XHTML-L mailing list; I've quoted my
  reply below which contains some context and the body of my concern.

  Namely, that by eliminating the start/value attributes for ordered
  lists and choosing to rely upon CSS 2, the XHTML working group has
  made the mistake of embedding actual -content- (the "correct"
  number values for an item are content or meta-content) in CSS, which
  is a no-no.

  Is this something for the WCAG group (to add to our guidelines "don't
  do this even though by spec you can"), for P&F (as it represents an
  error in XHTML/HTML Strict), or even for the XHTML working group
  itself?  I'm not sure if I'm writing to the right place or not.

  PS:  I think that this example is related to why I didn't like the
        previous proposal floated on this list for resolving abuse
        of "class."  By suggesting that semantics be embedded in
        CSS via a property for that purpose, and presenting that to
        the user via exposing "class" information, you're ignoring the
        WCAG checkpoint which requires pages to be usable without
        CSS.  What's needed is better use of the markup, not a hack
        in CSS nor elimination of class.
