Matt,

AP is a nice stylebook to use, but it was written for paper publications
not the web. Stylebooks will disagree on these issues, but no matter the
outcome, they are still directives for print. On a newspaper, expanding URL
(Universal Resource Locator) every time it's used would make reading very
difficult. On the other hand, clicking to the definition or expansion
whenever the user pleases, then clicking back, going back and forth as
desired, can make reading easier. It may be true that URL is so universally
used that the expansion would lead to more confusion, in which case, use
the definition for URL "web address" or more formally "Internet address"
and be done with it. FBI may be universally known to American adults, but
offers nary a clue to a youngster or someone from another English-speaking
country. 

Online dictionaries exist, and I have on occassion seen pages that link to
dictionary definitions for specific terms, but it is rarely done. For some
sites, such as the WAI, definitions are needed that may not fit dictionary
terms but fit the use made of the term in the guidelines (e.g. the word
"style"). But the online dictionaries and encyclopedia are there, and if
they can be linked from sites, we are already much of the way there. The
rules can be simple: either link to an outside source, or put in your own
definitions on a site/page, but do give the user a chance to understand you.
