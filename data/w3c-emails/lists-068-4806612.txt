If you can't reconcile your rules with AP Style, you're going to block out
every American news outlet from meeting accessibility standards.

What if my audience is exclusively American? Would I need to expand a term I
expect the whole of my audience to understand? Think about courseware for
law or med school. I would expect a med school student to comprehend q.i.d.
as "four times a day" in a class, and leaving out that definition would (or
should) not impact usability or accessibility for my audience.

I'm mostly here with you. But I see problems with putting the onus on
content providers to define already well-defined terms. The solution I see
is a user-agent enhancement that lets users tie their own dictionaries,
online or integrated, into the agent. They can create a trusted authority
for defining terms, which could be overridden by the ABBR or ACRONYM tags in
HTML, for example, to provide a list of possible definitions. Then, WCAG can
state that content providers are only responsible for defining terms they
introduce or use uniquely.
The potential for proliferation of untrusted definitions, which may
ultimately be made useless by such a system (if they're not useless to begin
with), gives me pause. Do we really want to tell people to search and
replace all their acronyms and abbreviations, and then once a system like
this comes along, say, never mind, just put it back the way it was?
