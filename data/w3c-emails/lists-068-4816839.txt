Matt,

Taking your points:

Not really. The American news outlets are capable of undertanding that the
web needs different rules than print. Because of the interactive
capabilities of the web, the AP style may need to be adapted for the web.
In response to your comment in the next paragraph, NO American news outlet
should be defining their audience as exclusively American. This is the
"World Wide Web", not the American Web.

An author who can precisely define his audience so as to KNOW that certain
acronyms or abbreviations are known, would not need to meet "accessibility"
standards other than as needed by that known audience. If a med or law or
HVAC (heating, ventilating and air conditioning) prof is making a web
document for students, it is likely that the document prepared for first
year students will have different definition needs that a document for
third-year students. But most of the time, it seems web designers don't
match up well to their full audience. It doesn't matter whether the web
designer "sins" by leaving out alt tags or by leaving out expansions and
definitions, they haven't done the job properly, they are not reaching all
of their audience. When they miss audience because of the disabilities of
the audience, including cognitive and reading disabilities, it is our job
to head 'em off at the pass!

On the contrary, I feel it is exactly the content providers who should
define their terms. If the terms are already well-defined, all that is
needed is a link to the author's favorite dictionary, or if less
well-defined, a specialized dictionary. 

 The solution I see

Ah, dumping the responsibility onto the user. Nice play! <grin> ...
Seriously, your description of the "trusted authority for defining terms"
took me back a decade to when I was a member of a panel examining an issue
of "book banning" at the school where I worked. The representative of the
clergy maintain, among other things, that he only "recognized" as
authoritative, a 19th century Webster version of the dictionary. The issue
was, interestingly, an expanded acrynym ... RTFM ... used in a book, The
Cuckoo's Egg which was supposed to be more fact than fiction about the
early Internet. The expansion, as a footnote on page 5, used the old
English "F" word to describe the Manual ... the only occurance of the word
(or any other inappropriate word) in the whole book! The reverend with the
narrow references won the day, the book was banned for classroom use, I was
personally vilified from the guy's pulpit for a few weeks.

What do you mean by "put it back"? Once the terms are marked up, they can
be updated to newer technology. It's the unmarked up stuff that's the
problem, not the stuff that is linked one place, and can later be moved to
another. 

Matt, there is a real need to have page authors and content providers think
through what they are offering. Writing a web page isn't like writing
e-mail, and it isn't exactly like writing for publication, but more similar
to writing for publication than to writing e-mail. If you (the author) are
just adding another dust-collector to the web, have at it ... but if you
want to use it to communicate, you have to consider the difference between
web and paper, and you have to consider your widest audience.
