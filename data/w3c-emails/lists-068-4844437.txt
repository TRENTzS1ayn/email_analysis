Matt,

You are correct. I am not considering any "dangers" in the 30 whatabytes
of IBM content that have to be run thru ed IBM has brainpower beyond mine
to solve this <grin>... That isn't my primary concern on this issue ... the
concern is with delivering content to the user ... not crippled, not top of
the head, but serious content that has been prepared to use on the web. I
realize this isn't as "easy to do" if your content is leftover stories from
the main edition of the paper! I will not suggest if some, any, many or no
newspapers that produce a web version presume the are therby addressing
"the universe" ... Even local papers that count their circulation in the
hundreds are anxious to receive statewide and national awards on their
writing, would they really want to pull in the rug from decisions by web
judges? It may be that news sources (AP style or cavalier!) will
discover/invent a new "style" system to use on the web ...
