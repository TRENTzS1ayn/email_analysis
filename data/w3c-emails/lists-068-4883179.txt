The real solution here is to add a link on the web site to
subject-specific RDF metadata which defines all of the common acronyms and
abbreviations used in the particular discipline or in relation to the
specific topic under consideration. The user agent can then load the
dictionary (which, needless to say, may be maintained by a third party) as
required. At a higher level, one could associate subject-specific RDF
labels (useful to search engines) with pronunciation dictionaries, etc.,
obviating the need for direct linking from the web site itself or from its
metadata.
