Human error is as likely to occur if the user is building the dictionary.
More likely! In the case of a large database, it is easy to fix such errors
with another search and replace function, but fixing errors across all
users' dictionaries would be impossible.

This one I don't understand. Are you saying that if an acronym is linked to
it's definition at the bottom of the page or on a definitions page, it
sometimes will not work and there nothing can be done about it?

This is a perfect example of why the acronym must be defined by the content
provider rather than the user. How is the user supposed to choose among the
20 acronyms for IF if they don't know what it means in the first place?

Matt, you make it sounds like the world of databases has been shuffling
along in need of direction for too long anyway. Remember Y2K?
