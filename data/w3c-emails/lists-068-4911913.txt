If this means that Granny can sit down at darling grandson's computer, find
a site with crocheting directions to make him a vest, and, when she forgets
what 2 dc means, can click on the site chosen by the content provider as
having the correct set of acronyms, and it would return dc = "double
crochet" instead of dc = "Dublin Core" such as her grandson may have it
defined on his own user dictionary.... That could be a decent solution. 

Even if a third party site is used for definition, I think the content
providers are going to have to go back and mark up the acronyms anyway, and
metadata for the content site is going to have to reference the correct
definition source. Or not ... is there a way around this?
