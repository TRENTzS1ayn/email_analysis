Hmmm.  Speaking of small problems with the logo, presently the image has

ALT="Level Double-A conformance icon, W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility 
Guidelines 1.0"

Following the principle that ALT should be an equivalent for what the 
sighted person sees, would it not be better to have

ALT="W3C: WAI triple A, WCAG 1.0."

The longer description is an explanation that in principle is seen by 
everyone, so it should be the TITLE

TITLE="Level Double-A conformance icon, W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility 
Guidelines 1.0"
