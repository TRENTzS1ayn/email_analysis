I was asked a question about the rationale for the WCAG CSS Techniques [1]
telling people to use qualified colours (RGB values) rather than names. The
only reason I could think up was that names aren't as widely supported as
RGB values, and you can't get the exact colour that you want. Please note
that the Techniques document provides no explanation whatsoever for using
RGB rather than a name.
I was asked this question about three days ago. It has taken me all that
time to realise that I'm on GL, so I only have to raise the point (duh!)

The commenter noted that it might be a mistake, but since it was not
explained he could not comment further!
