AG:

I have to admit to a violent negative reaction to this suggestion.

Both of the above spellings for ALT text satisfy the sense of 'equivalent' as
used in checkpoint 1.1.? It is a loose equivalence and they both meet this
loose criterion.? It is an equivalence of sense; not of spelling.? And at the
more superficial level that you are evaluating 'equivalence' in the above, the
answer is _no_, the ALT should not be 'equivalent' to the visual presentation
_in those terms_.? It should be _different_ in those terms so as to be both a)
equivalent at the deeper level and b) effective in the alternative
presentation.? The ALT text as understood when heard should be equivalent to
what the sighted user understands on seeing the visual logo.? "What the
sighted
user _sees_" is too medium-specific to be the base for equivalence
comparison.?
"What the sighted user _learns_" is closer.

The fact is that telegraphic diction such as exemplified by the suggested
alternative ALT above works in a visual environment where the user can random
scan over the component elements, and does not work well in a serial pass over
the content such as in synthetic speech.? The more expanded version is more
likely to be comprehensible when read aloud than is the series of cryptic
blurps.

I have to realize that the intensity of my reaction is probably because the
distinction is subtle and sustaining a consensus for any resolution of such a
subtle distinction is tenuous.

Backing off from the initial reaction, I think that the meta-guideline that
this suggestion violates is that "the ALT text should be easy to grasp
(follow)
when read aloud in context."

This may sound like "the ALT text should be designed for how it appears in
Lynx."? That is my home base of experience and bias.? But what the Lynx
display
communicates to me, the sighted, is some of what make the ALT text
effective or
ineffective communication in serial speech presentation.? Which we do need to
care about, even while it is not the only presentation we want to make
effective.
