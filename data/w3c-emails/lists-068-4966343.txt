People should be aware that there is a screen scraping knowledge dispensing
application already in circulation for free from a commercial venture.? I
can't
comment on the accessibility of their client, but the way it runs is
thought-provoking <<http://www.atomica.com/>http://www.atomica.com/>.? 

The way this runs is, in our current usage, a repair function.? It is a
third-party service that fills in gaps in the documentation of terminology as
provided by the first party in a communication.? It has its own client/server
architecture, but the client is in a screen scraping layer like a screen
reader.
