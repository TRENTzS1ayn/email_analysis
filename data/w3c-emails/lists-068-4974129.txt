You're probably right that getting consensus on exactly what to use for ALT 
text here would be difficult or not impossible.

Years ago, when I first got into web accessibility, I sent around an 
informal survey asking people who were blind what they preferred in ALT 
text.  Things like, to use "bullet" or an asterisk for an image of a 
bullet.  Even among actual users who were blind I got differing opinions on 
all questions... including questions on which people, mostly sighted, had 
strong logical, philisophical arguments for one or the other option.   I'd 
be happy to drop this particular question for now, and use list bandwidth 
for bigger topics that i need to get back to...
