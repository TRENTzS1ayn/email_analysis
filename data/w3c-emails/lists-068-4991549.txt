No. Which is why I suggested that the user agent point to a dictionary (or
dictionaries) of the user's choice, which could be stored locally or
remotely. Browser makers would probably look into local dictionaries to
prevent unnecessary round-trips to the web (not to mention server loads).

I never suggested that. I do, however, shudder at the idea of all content
providers creating dictionaries, especially when their acronyms are outside
of their own abilities to adequately define.

When you said "unique terms", that's where I agree with you -- and have been
agreeing with you since the start of this. What they should not be
responsible for is terminology that is better stored in a central repository
of the user's choice. The way this is solved, however, is with the best use
of technology, not by turning the entire content-providing community on its
head.
