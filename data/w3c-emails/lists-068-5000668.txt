If I have three different usages of "DOS" referenced in my documents, it's
nearly impossible for someone to code up an application that's going to come
up with the right definition programatically. Another reason why
search-and-replace has trouble. It's brain-dead to context.

Dictionaries have multiple definitions per word. I did also say that content
providers could and should give guidance using either what's already there
in HTML, or something RDF-based in the future to create custom dictionaries.

Quite the contrary. I think the last thing database administrators need is
to be redirected. Not when I know that not a single one of them is going to
be willing to adopt the "solution."
