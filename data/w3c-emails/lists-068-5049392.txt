Well, I have been quiet so far on this one -
Again, I think this is stretching too far.  Like the index question, it is a
good idea and belongs somewhere, but I don't see it as directly an
accessibility issue.  My biggest concern here is that as we reach for more
issues we 'water down' the direct accessibility issues and lose credibility.
Perhaps what is really needed is another set of guidelines for "good web
design"
