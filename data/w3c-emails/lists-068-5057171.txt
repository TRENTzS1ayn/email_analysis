Even if it's impractical to retrofit a mass of old pages, it would be 
simple to define acronyms and abbreviations at all points in new documents 
as they go forward, especially if the authoring tools supported it (e.g. 
when you type in an abbreviation it lets you specify which meaning you 
meant from your presonal dictionary)

You could also imagine semi-automatic programs to go through existing 
documents popping up each substitution for approval, giving choice from a 
menu when there are alternatives.

As for the problems of using sed--a revered language which, however, knows 
nada about HTML--... you can get around all those problems by using Perl, 
which has e.g. specific ways to check word boundaries, together with a real 
HTML parser, e.g. HTML::Parser, which will make sure you're not messing 
around inside tags and such.  And there are probably equivalents in Java by 
now, tho I haven't looked.

So none of these difficulties should prevent us from requiring that all 
instances of an abbreviation or acronym be tagged.

And even if there were difficulties, I thought we were at this point only 
considering accessibility, and that we were going to discuss difficulty of 
implementation as it affects all guidelines later.  That's my understanding 
of our current process in GL.  I hope I'm right on that, because 
implementation difficulties apply to everything.
