Er... try:-

     abbr:hover:before, acronym:hover:before { content: attr(title); }

In CSS2/3...but I wonder how many browsers this would work on??? Still, if
you used Opera 5.0 and set it as a user style sheet, it might just work.
Interesting...I love hacking up these little ideas :-)

In case anyone reads too much into this little idea, repeat after me: "this
is just a hack"...

Back to work,
Kindest Regards,
