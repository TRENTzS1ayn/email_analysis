Al,

As I learn what speech readers do with alt text I am somewhat confused
myself what should be there ... Usually I use a one or two word alt tag,
"frog", "Martin Luther King", etc., but if I'm trying harder, I may use
"drawing of frog", "photo of M. L. King" ... following this logic, I'd use
"Logo for Double-A Conformance, W3C-WAI Guidelines 1.0" ...
