That sounds pretty good to me.  Time to link up with Kelly Ford, Neal
Ewers, or
someone like that to enter the "real-user testing" phase.  Repeat an exercise
like the one that Len ran in years of yore.

PS:  Another technique I would be interested to see represented in the
popularity contest would be [frog].  That is to say, just use the simple nouns
like what you said you see, but wrap them in square brackets to indicate that
they are object inserts and not part of the narrative flow.   I just don't
know
how many users would have to replay the text with punctuation on to get this,
and how many in practice would ever take the trouble. 

Some of this is the motivation why some of us in PF are keen to see XHTML 2.0
move away from ALT as an attribute and toward something much more like the
title and description attributes in SVG.  Here one can put a range of options
in the TITLE using RUBY markup (Yay, Charles!).

Part of what I myself don't know is how universal is the practice of playing
the synthetic speech with punctuation turned off, and how much the listeners
get used to tuning out random nouns that pop up in illogical ways in the
stream
of speech.
