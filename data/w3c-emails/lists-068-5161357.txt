Hmmm. You may be right that I was gearing up for an "personal attack" on
database managers ...

Probably, I seek this as a personal need more so than most GL issues, since
although not as old as William, I am old enough to know the declines in
short term memory that come because of medications as well as age. The
issue hits me squarely in my disability! I've gotten a better insight into
a lot of "web geek" acronyms this year, but am still flummoxed by some used
on this list. The example of dc = double crochet instead of Dublin Core is
a perfect example.  

I think the problem between Matt and I is that I see it as do-able,
probably on a very much smaller scale than he works with. My son works with
the computerization of document (check) transiting through the banking
system (Bank of America), and may be able to help me visualize this
problem. He's due back from Tampa Saturday. I'll pick his brain...
