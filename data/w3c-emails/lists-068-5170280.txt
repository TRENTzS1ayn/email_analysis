Kynn,
    Perhaps the onus is on the user agents/browsers, to communicate their
features to their customers, rather than on the users, who may have varying
levels of learning capacity ... 

To put a new spin on the discussion, adding or leaving off brackets could
be a "presentation" issue, the brackets added by the browsers used by
screen readers or not as the user chooses in the browser options. The page
author would not add the brackets. Perhaps users would prefer to be told
"image" before the alt text is read. If I remember correctly, Lynx
automatically adds the brackets to the alt text ... If it is
"presentation", it needs to be optional to the user.
