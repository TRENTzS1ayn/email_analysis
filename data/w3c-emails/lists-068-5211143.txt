I would argue thaqt a table that has a single set of headers for rows, and a
single set for columns, doesn't have multiple levels of headers. The example
is where there a headers for other headers.

In other words, the average table of data with a row of headers across the
top, and a column of headers down one side or the other (or sometimes the
same headers reproduced at either side, to make life easier) has only one
logical level of headers.

Tables with two or more levels are those where the row of headers "closest to
the content" itself has headers. A trivial example would be months, which
have season headers (and internationalisation problems <grin/>).

Opinions folks?

cheers

  Dear Group,

  I respectfully request some clarification on WCAG 1.0 Checkpoint 5.2.

  The examples in the Techniques document are very good.  URL:
  <http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#identifying-table-rows-columns>

  I am left with a nagging question however:  Do the first two examples (cups
  of coffee per senator) warrant use of the attributes being demonstrated?
  That is, do ALL non-trivial data  tables have at least two logical levels?

  It seems to me that ANY data table with more than one column (and row) is at
  least as complex as the cups of coffee per senators example.  Is the point
  of those examples just to demonstrate the HTML mechanics of using attributes
  like ID and HEADER or is it ALSO providing an example of a "data table with
  two logical levels"?  If the latter, could someone provide me an example of
  a "data table with only one logical level"?  Assuming that such examples are
  fairly trivial (like the cups of coffee per senator, but with only one
  senator listed) let me also suggest that this checkpoint would be MUCH more
  understandable if it the disclaimer phrase "that have two or more logical
  levels of row or column headers" were deleted.  (Actually, I am hoping that
  I am reading 5.2 wrong and that simple straightforward two dimensional
  tables are okay so long as TD and TH are used appropriately.

  Thanks for your time.
  If I missed the a clarification in the archives, my apologies, please point
  me in the right direction.
