I did something similar in CSS. But then someone from the W3C complained :
") I'm afraid that this does not constitute a valid conformance
   claim according to WCAG 1.0, which states:

   "Claims of conformance to this document must use one of the
    following two forms.."

   From 1: Specify a bunch of stuff.

   Form 2: Include, on each page claiming conformance, one of three
   icons provided by W3C and link the icon to the appropriate W3C '
   explanation of the claim. Information about the icons and how
   to insert them in pages is available at [WCAG-ICONS].

   I think that the CSS approach might be used in conjunction
   with form 1, but form 2 requires images made available by W3"C.
"
IN other words You have to use there icons. Text in images and all.
Well hear is a nice catch 22 situation. If we come up with a good logo that
is using mark up, we violate the criteria for conformance claim.
However if we use the W3C logo, we violate WCAG itself.
Now what?
