Nope, because *our* logos conform to both Form1 and the WCAG guidelines:-
[[[
Form 1: Specify:
The guidelines title: "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0"
The guidelines URI: http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505
The conformance level satisfied: "A", "Double-A", or "Triple-A".
The scope covered by the claim (e.g., page, site, or defined portion of a
site.).
]]] - http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/

So I reckon as our logos are more WCAG compliant than the WCAG logos
themselves, we may as well use them (and legally so). Also, I suppose we
could ask the editors of the [WCAG-ICONS] document to add our "good markup
logo(s)" is they think it is appropriate. (Wendy/Gregg/Ian???)

That is, if there are no qualms about the accessibility of our efforts over
that of the text-in-images ones?
