For the record, I uploaded my first attempt at an XHTML/CSS
WCAG 1.0 logo:-

     http://infomesh.net/2000/12/wcaglogo/

Looks fairly similar to the original logo in my browser..but it works
better because it has lots of different links, and different titles for
each link. What do people think? Is this more or less accessible than the
current logos? How could it be improved?

Kindest Regards,
Sean B. Palmer
