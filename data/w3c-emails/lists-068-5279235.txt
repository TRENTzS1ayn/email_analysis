Maybe it would be better to make the assertion in RDF and then link to it
using:-

     <link rel="meta"
          type="application/rdf"
          href="wcag.rdf"
          title="W3C WAI WCAG Conformance Claim" />

I'm pretty sure that would be more compehensive than having a little logo
on the bottom of the page: it could link to an EDL statement. You can make
up your own RDF statement, such is the beauty of RDF.
