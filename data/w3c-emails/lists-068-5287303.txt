After a *lot* of searching, I found:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999JanMar/0235.html
The recommendation for using RGB values in CSS instead of colour names
comes from Hakon himself, at http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/css2em.htm
[[[
Use numbers, not names, for colors
Color names also vary from one platform to another. CSS supports 16 color
names: aqua, black, blue, fuchsia, gray, green, lime, maroon, navy, olive,
purple, red, silver, teal, yellow, white. Some browsers have chosen to
support additional color names, but there is no definite list. Therefore,
you should: use numbers, not names, for colors . Color names may seem
friendlier than the somewhat cryptic RGB notation introduced in the
previous chapter, but the Web has yet to see the ultimate list of color
names that work on all platforms. Color numbers, on the other hand, can
easily be interpreted by any browser.
You may have to experiment a bit, to get the exact color you want, or find
some software that helps you mix the right colors. CSS supports the
hexadecimal notation ("#FF0000" and "#F00") and also some other notations
that may be easier to use. The following two rules both set the color of h1
elements to brown (50% red, 50% green, 0% blue):
H1 {color: #808000}
H1 {color: rgb(50%,50%,0%)}
]]]

Which seems fine and self-explanatory to me: I've BCC'd this to the
original commentor.
