AG::  This issue is a good one for a detour through ER.  Since the basic
question is "how do I tell if I have a complex table (in the terms of the
guidelines) it is an evaluation question.

Since the algorithmic answer which is easy for a tool to do but not so easy
for
a person to do without tool assistance is a big help with this question, it
would be good to get input from ER before resolving this one.

The algorithmic approach is as follows.  Apply the HTML 4.0 header guessing
algorithm, and see what cell to header associations result.  If those are
valid
(manual assessment), the table is simple.  If they are wrong, start marking
the
cell to header associations with explicit markup until the audit tool gets it
right.
