AG:: I am in full agreement with Alan's bottom line that there is no simple
formula that works in all cases, here.  On the other hand, there is a detail I
would like to offer another view on.  See AG:: below.

AG::

The consideration on another side, here, has to do with rhetorical
structure or
flow.  The point is that an icon is an encapsulated, atomic utterance.  It is
as separate from its environment as a sentence.  In presenting this in the
middle of an audio stream where the basic premise is fluent speech, the
highest
and best representation may need to do something to set this off, because
it is
not a connected piece of a narrative but a standalone mark or gesture.  It
is a
sentence.  Saying 'icon' or 'logo' in a phrase which is as equivalent to the
icon or logo as we can make it may not entirely be a misstep in this case.
The
point is that it is a minor 'exhibit' and not part of the text flow.  "WAI
logo" is an elliptical sentence which is short for the aside, "A copy of the
WAI logo appears here."  Somehow we may benefit from establishing that
set-off-ness in the audio stream.

One of the odd realities in a speech user interface is that the least words is
not always the best way to go.  If one can maintain fluency of diction, then
the speech can be followed at a high speed of rendering.  Any time one has to
stop, one loses an amount of time in which one could have played lots of more
words.  So the optimization goal is to say things concicely while maintaining
fluent diction to the point that the rhetorical structure can be comprehended
at speed.

That is my current working estimate of the criterion.
