I suggest instead that we update the requirement (when it becomes
part of a WCAG 2.0 CSS techniques document) to state "use the
16 named colors defined by CSS level 1, or use RGB colors" instead
of just using RGB colors.  I think those 16 should be considered
a reasonably safe list and I don't think that access problems will
result (which can't be eliminated by turning off CSS!) if those
are used.

I find a prohibition against using 'color: black' or 'background: white'
to be absurd.
