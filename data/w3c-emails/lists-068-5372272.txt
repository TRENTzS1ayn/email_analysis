If that is our opinion then we should ask for the conformance page to be
changed so that you are allowed make a markup conformance logo. At the
moment using a markup logo is against our "rules".

But the other side  of the coin, is that I did not make a "perfect" CSS
logo. It is not as good in some browsers (I tested it on the new IS and NS,
but on other ones it will not be the same). I am not going to make one in
SVG as I can not expect anyone to download a viewer to see a small logo.

So, unless someone else can to do it better (which of course there is)- are
the W3C prepared to do what we are asking of everyone else - to sometimes
compromise on graphics for the sake of accessibility.

(my logo is still up at globalformats.com , but I will have to take it off)
