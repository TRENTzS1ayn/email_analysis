This seems like a reasonable proposal for the current techniques document
actually.

  I suggest instead that we update the requirement (when it becomes
  part of a WCAG 2.0 CSS techniques document) to state "use the
  16 named colors defined by CSS level 1, or use RGB colors" instead
  of just using RGB colors.  I think those 16 should be considered
  a reasonably safe list and I don't think that access problems will
  result (which can't be eliminated by turning off CSS!) if those
  are used.

  I find a prohibition against using 'color: black' or 'background: white'
  to be absurd.
