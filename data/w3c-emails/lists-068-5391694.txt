Being the original commentator, I hope it's OK to jump back in. It seems to
me, from context, the recommendation is merely to use numbers when the color
is not specified by the spec. I think he's simply trying to avoid a
browser-tag-like problem where certain browsers implement extra colors and
others don't, causing incompatibility. However, as long as you use one in
the spec, it seems like you're ok, no?
