Yes, my understanding of the comment is that the 16 colours specified in CSS
are OK, but beyond that there are colours that are only sometimes understood.

  Being the original commentator, I hope it's OK to jump back in. It seems to
  me, from context, the recommendation is merely to use numbers when the color
  is not specified by the spec. I think he's simply trying to avoid a
  browser-tag-like problem where certain browsers implement extra colors and
  others don't, causing incompatibility. However, as long as you use one in
  the spec, it seems like you're ok, no?
