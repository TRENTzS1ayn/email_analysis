  Should we be concerned about the fact that newer versions of XHTML

  like this is something WCAG should say 'yes, we're concerned about'
  and ask PF to bring up with XHTML WG.)

  Should we specifically urge that those functions within CSS which
  convey information (such as using ol/CSS to automatically number
  sections which might be referred to by that name) not be used?
  (Now -there's- a WCAG issue.)  This would be a technology-specific
  technique for CSS under WCAG 2.0 plans.
