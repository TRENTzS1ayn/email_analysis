I checked out Eugenia's page and found a curious phenomena...
In IE 5.5 when I put the mouse over an INPUT the tool tip does pop up but
FLASHES on and off. This was very distracting. (seems to flash at 2 times
the speed of the cursor blink, it flashes when the cursor is in an INPUT or
when no INPUT as a cursor in it).
In Netscape 4.7 nothing is displayed
In Opera 5.1 nothing is displayed.

  Contrary to what I previously thought, I now have evidence that the ALT
attribute on INPUT will not show up using IE 5.5 and Window-Eyes 4.0.

  So as of now it would appear that the technique that looks best is to use
TITLE on the INPUT, at very least where, as in Eugenia's case, there is no
suitable LABEL content already showing somewhere on the page.  And Thatch's
advice is to ignore LABEL and just TITLE it anyway.
