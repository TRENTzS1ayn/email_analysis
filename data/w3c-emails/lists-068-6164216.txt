My apologies for missing the call. I was busy getting laid off. :) (No
worries, folks. I'm smiling.)

I'm of the school that accessibility is in a huge overlapping circle with
usability. I've chatted with Steven Pemberton, who's working on creating a
usability interest group, and I really think that should end up at working
group level specifically so we can feed off one another.

Recently, I've been thinking in terms of "free on board," as someone who has
dealt with shipping might. (It's the statement that we the shipper are
responsible for the delivery to you the recipient up to a certain
agreed-upon point.) The trouble we've been having, I'll suggest, has been
related to where the responsibility of the content provider to convey the
meaning of the content ends. When we've been dealing with vision, that
responsibility ends at the screen, the accessibility tool that reads the
words, or the braille terminal that renders them. If those things work,
irrespective of the recipient, we consider this success. Likewise, SMIL and
captions with the hearing-impaired, and device-independent events with motor
impairments.

In the cognitive realm, we're crossing the technological barrier between
hardware and person, and there's trouble lying that way. To extend my
metaphor, shippers have requirements as to the form and packing of a
package, but they're done once the package is signed for. Similarly, we can
instruct content providers as to the clarity and format of the message, but
we can't ever assure ourselves that the message will be processed properly
by the recipient. Worse, we can't be assured that additional work over and
above "write clearly and simply" will reap any quantifiable benefit when
applied to all content. Food for thought.

I've captured this for the document.

I think this is an issue where we're going to have to trust people's
judgement, and give suggestions as to how that can be done. Every navigation
system has benefits and drawbacks, including those that involve several
systems at once. There are also technical limitations, particularly in
search mechanisms, that prevent a lot of sites from producing good, solid
results (including synonyms and "hot" matches) the way we'd like them to.

I think numbers are really poor indicators here. Grade level or IQ don't
tell the story, because cognitive ability has several other factors
including form, quantity, quality and retention of education, socioeconomic
and cultural factors, and so on. It's possible for someone with a 130 IQ to
be functionally illiterate; all it takes is poor education. And we can't say
that for all people with IQ x or grade-level y, this content is suitable for
understanding.

I think that, instead, we should be stating what cognitive limitations each
checkpoint benefits, and ensure that the solutions are in the hands of the
content providers themselves. Which leads me to...

As a counterproposal, I offer my guideline proposal of a few weeks ago: make
it a requirement to become well-versed in the technologies and practices
required to make sites accessible to people with the range of disabilities
we cover. Produce documents as required reading that tell people simple
language and structure benefits the cognitively disabled, for example.
