is part of a document about Device Independence being looked at by the DI 
WG. Some of the points are of historical interest and others might help in 
divining possible methods in formulating WCAG 2.

This also shows the growing awareness of accessibility matters on the 
technical side of Webstuff.

It might even color our decision to "segregate" so-called "usability" 
features into non-prioritized sections of the guidelines - they are to be, 
after all, *guidelines* not commandments. If we have a bevy of "shoulds" 
connected to a handful of "shalt nots" we might have a salubrious effect on 
the Web.
