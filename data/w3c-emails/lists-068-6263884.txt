How can browser vendors ensure that their product satisfies the
specification without at least the implicit requirement that they understand
the issues affecting them? For that matter, how did anyone pass freshman
English without reading what was required of them?

WCAG is designed to be an educational and informational resource to content
providers just like the HTML spec is a resource to the people who make use
of the language. Saying that developing an understanding of the principles
we're trying to espouse is a requirement isn't impossible: it's what we're
here to do.

Nobody is saying cognitive issues are "dismissable." What we are saying, and
what I have yet to see refuted, is that there is content that cannot be
condensed or simplified to meet a certain reading level or cognitive
profile, and that we have no rules we can present that can quantifiably
improve accessibility for everyone under the umbrella of "cognitively
disabled." As such, that means our options as they have been presented to us
is to create a baseline and determine for content providers what suits their
content, or supply the content providers with information on how they can
communicate their content most effectively, and let them use that
information in context to make their site more accessible. If there is
another option, I would like it to be presented.

I think that there have been several recent postings describing the issues
involved with cognitive disabilities as they relate to designing web sites.
Gregg's comments in the 4/26 minutes, I think, are an excellent starting
point for discussing the pitfalls of trying to create a standard that
satisfies all levels and manifestations of cognitive disability. I think
it's important to furthering this discussion that you respond to these
statements:
