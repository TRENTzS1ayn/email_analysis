Usability is very much defined in a context of users, their environments, 
tasks and used devices. The first thing before starting usability testing 
is to think who the users are, what kinds of tasks they typically use etc.

So I also very much see accessibility as usability that  includes and tests 
a broader group of users, devices etc.  The aim in WAI is to make the 
common user interfaces flexible enough so that they can be usable for this 
broader group instead of making separate user interfaces where usability 
needs to be tailored for each disability group.
