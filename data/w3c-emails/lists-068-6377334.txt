Hi folks,

currently in the Authoring Tool group we are working on adding some basic
icons to our techniques docuement, to identify which techniques are relevant
for what kind of tools.

There is a bit of a discussion on icons - at the moent we have had three sets
of icons offered. So I wonder if people candraw any ideas that explain which
ones are good, and why / why not.

For convenience I have put the stuff into a web page:
http://www.w3.org/2001/04/atag-icon-check - that includes the three sets of
icons mixed up in a fragment of what we use it for, so they can be seen in
context. I have to apologies for the fact that although longdesc links are
defined they currently lead to empty resources. I hope I will fix that today,
but I hoped I would publish this page last week so I am not too optimistic
about it happening immediately.

cheers

chaals
