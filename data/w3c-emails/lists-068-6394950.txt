Charles,

Looks like the development of icons is coming along nicely.

     Of the choices of three, I generally like the first icon of each
choice. On the first one, I like the illustration of the piece of page for
mark-up since the other two show a variation  of a quill pen.
 
For the next set, I like the icon of the movie projector better than the
icon for the snippet of film. The third icon is small and I'm not sure what
it is.
 
     For the third set, I like the first icon that shows the files leading
to the page. It seems to suggest management better than the other two. I'm
a bit unsure what a content management tool is/does ... it may be done
automatically in Front Page so I'm not aware of it.

   For the fourth set, again I like the first icon which shows a piece of a
structure tree which to me indicates programming better than the pen or the
computer.

Hope this is helpful,

                    Anne
