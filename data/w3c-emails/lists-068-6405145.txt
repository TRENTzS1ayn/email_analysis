I have to agree with Anne. The first icons are the clearest, but I
would suggest assigning distinct colors (one predominant color per icon),
not red in both Multimedia Creation Tools and Content Management Tools.  And
the doc tree for Programming Tools is a bit too complicated, less or larger
boxes.  And, of course best with no background color, transparent is best.
Easy for me to say.....................I can make those changes if
you so desire........................................Katie
