As Working Drafts proliferate I have become guilty of "overskim" and didn't 
notice how good the Introduction has become, in fact answering rather 
resoundingly the criticisms of this as an "unreadable" document.

Of course the "Comprehension" and "Technology Considerations" principles' 
text should have big "@@"s since they need much fleshing out in the same 
"conversational" vein as the "Presentation and Interaction" parts.

Just reading this kind of presentation is going to be a major informant for 
anyone wanting to know what this stuff is all about.
