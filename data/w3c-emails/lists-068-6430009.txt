I should probaly say, up front, that I submitted the third set of icons.

Now, before we get too deeply into this, we need to decide a few of
things:

1. How big will the icons be?  While 32 x 32 is nice, these larger icons
will expand the line spacing and may end up doubling an already long
document. Can 16x16 versions of the first two icons be produced to get a
better comparison?

2. How much detail? The flow chart is good in 32 x 32 but loses
something in the 16x16 version.

3. Which colours? If we decide on colours for each category that are
easy to see and distinguish, then all the icons can use the same colours
and we can eliminate that as a variable.


I think we need icons that can be identified at a glance by their shape
(as Katy says) and colour, without messing up the page layout. These are
afterall, not the most important pieces of information on the page.
