Katie,

I agree that distinct colors would make the icons easier to use,
especially since any given guideline/checkpoint/technique could have more
than one icon that it applies to. 

The size of the first two icons is better than the size of the third icon
in each set. The third icons are too small to tell what it is (in 600x800
resolution). I would imagine they'd be a nightmare for anyone with low
vision. 

I noticed that Charles used very simple alt tags, just a statement of
which icon each was instead of trying to explain why they are there. I've
been struggling with the text alternatives for the illustrations for
guideline 3, but if I follow Charles' lead I can  move on. Thanks, Charles!

Anne
