Emmanuelle,

Good work on the icons!

With the color background, the homogeneity works somewhat, but without it,
the icons are too homogeneous. One has to look too long at the icon to
figure out what it means ... If I were to use these icons to find specifics
on what I wanted to do, with my aging memory (cough, cough, drool), I'd
need a key on the page to remind me what they mean, tho the alt tags would
help too .... 

Perhaps that suggests a checkpoint or technique for the use of icons - to
include an icon key for the site and perhaps on each page, and top and
bottom of long pages (there goes that redundency need again) .... at least
until the icons become iconic...

Anne
