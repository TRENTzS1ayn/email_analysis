Alt: Yes. (I had that at one stage, but this document has died on me a few
times.  Actually I think there are some wrong alt text things as well.
Hopefully I will have it cleaned up... hopefully, hopefully, hopefully.

Images themselves:
One of the ideas I had behind content generators and programming tools icon 1
(that is the set I did) was to try and put things that people who are needing
to read this will understand, or recognise, and people who are not needing to
understand it will easily distinguish thenm and not get them confused with
something that they think is intersting. (I am not sure exactly how to
express that as a general rule yet, but that's why we are having teh
discussion <grin/>)

I think for the context of this (identifying different tyypes of authoring
tool) I was trying to focus on what the product of the tool was, not what the
orignal algorithm might be. (Which means that I agree with what you said
about the content, but I am not sure how else to express it). Maybe it just
means that I didn't really think hard enough about that either.

Anyway, thanks for the commetns. - keep 'em coming. By the way, if you have
other icons to propose, please feel free - the Working group is looking for
the best set we can get...

cheers

  Alt text appears in place of graphics, so it merges with other text if
  not set off with punctuation. It is NOT accessible if it appears as

      1. Markup tools icon one Markup tools icon two Markup tools icon
         three Markup Editing Tools: Tools that assist authors to produce
         markup documents. These include text-based and WYSIWYG markup

  Instead of alt="Markup tools icon one", could we please have
  alt=" [Markup tools](icon one) " now, and just alt=" [Markup tools] "
  when used as an actual icon in the future? (Yes, I'm willing to write
  a techniques document on writing accessible alt text.)

  As for the icons themselves, I think literal images of traditional
  tools (icon 2 (pen on pad) for markup and content, icon 1 (camera)
   for multimedia creation, icon 3 (programmers terminal) for
  programming) are more accessible (especially for readers with
  cognitive deficits) than abstract metaphors (such as pen-on-film,
  something never seen in reality but shown in icon 2 for multimedia;
  or the abstract schematics in icon 1 for content and programming).
