Folks, rather than people building 45 pages that have this stuff, I would
prefer to keep it all on one page. I will link the page to the other examples
people have posted, but I would be happier if we could see the different kind
of options side by side. That's what I have tried to do with the stuff after
the initial key bit - including different combinations, reducing sizes, etc.

cheers

Charles
