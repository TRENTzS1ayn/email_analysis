I guess one of the things that occurred to me is that editing is required by
the context - icons to identify different kinds of tools, but where all tools
are by definition editing tools.

The point about proliferation being miortant is a good one - "trash basket"
is a phrase that only makes sense to Australians who have grown up on a diet
of American television, in a country where we supposedly speak the same
language and always did.

Yes, I selected the film camera because it is one of the few things that I
actualy find truly iconic. (I suspect that most icons whoch work really well
are no longer actually relevant ue in language, where the "icons" are
metaphors, idioms, similies and so on).

  Using other versions of the "editing" icon with their small deviations will

  the "pencil" ones. The film camera for multimedia might be too archaic too

  Whatever gets used most becomes the standard so that the famous "trash
  basket", "scissors", and "home" get to be iconic through proliferation
  rather than pertinence.
