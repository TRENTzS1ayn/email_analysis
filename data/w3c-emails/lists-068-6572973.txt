Yes, I agree about the colours of the things and have been meaning to add a
new version of one for a while. Probably I will change the colour of the
camera silhouette (multimedia icon).

Actually I prefer not to have transparent backgrounds for these - I found
that it was nicer to set them off clearly against their own background. White
has a nice way of doing that without making them stand out as squares on teh
page, snice it is a common background colour. But it isn't universal - in a
lot of places white is a bad-luck colour, and people use red or purple
backgrounds (or blue ones). If the background was transpaent taht would
create more problems than it would solve I think.

cheers

  I have to agree with Anne. The first icons are the clearest, but I
  would suggest assigning distinct colors (one predominant color per icon),
  not red in both Multimedia Creation Tools and Content Management Tools.  And
  the doc tree for Programming Tools is a bit too complicated, less or larger
  boxes.  And, of course best with no background color, transparent is best.
  Easy for me to say.....................I can make those changes if
  you so desire........................................Katie
