Adam,

    I haven't looked at something in lynx for a long time, but I thought I
remembered that lynx put the alt tag in brackets < > .... If this is no
longer (or never was) the case, then it would be more sensible to change
the browsers so that punctuation is added to set off the image text when it
is presented visually. That way it will always be there whether the page
author has heard of accessibility or not.
