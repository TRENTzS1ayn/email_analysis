It doesn't do that normally, and I don't think it ieveer did. That is an
issue for teh User Agent Guidelines group in any case. Which reminds me - has
this group finished its review of those guidelines - their official closing
date for last call comments is friday, although I believe there are several
groups who have already requested up to an extra week to complete their
reviews.

  Adam,

      I haven't looked at something in lynx for a long time, but I thought I

  the browsers so that punctuation is added to set off the image text when it
  is presented visually. That way it will always be there whether the page
