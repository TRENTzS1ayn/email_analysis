I am truly surprised to find out that browsers don't do that as a matter of
course! I probably remember seeing brackets on image descriptions when I
used Lynx (before I graduated to Windows 3.1 and could run Mosaic) and I
just assumed that the brackets were always there in Lynx and similar
problems. To me, it seemed logical they should be there ...

Al, there is a whole section on my homepages that has a lot of "blank" alt
tags... And I think I had to do something similar on a page I did for an
organization that wanted it's pages to pass Bobby. I recall a heated
discussion of what to use to alt tag the spacer graphics and the final
decision never made it to the guidelines as far as I've read them ... 

These specifics need to be put somewhere in the guidelines, and made easy
to find. Until then, conscientious and informed people will continue to
make "mistakes".
