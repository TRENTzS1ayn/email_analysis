Alan,

Thanks for your helpful response. In the case of the "Picture of George
Washington", the title, which followed the picture on the same line was
"George Washington in the French and Indian War" ... the purpose of the
picture was to illustrate the "who" of the content ... In the case of the
"Illustration of an ideal web page", the picture is followed by Checkpoint
3.2 ... The function is to illustrate the componants of a ideally
accessible web page. 

How would I word either of those in an alt tag?

Anne
