If the picture is a distinct element - which it is for case (1) -
then it should be set apart with brackets, like this:

alt=" [Picture of George Washington] "

The second, "Illustration of an ideal web page", needs to be softened,
perhaps with a question mark, unless you intend it as a challenge. My
gut reaction was: Ideal for what? and to whom?

I'd prefer

alt="(picture: Ideal web page?)"

but literature is, in some unavoidable part, a matter of style.
