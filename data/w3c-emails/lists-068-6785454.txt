Adam,

Thanks for your answer. You said that "Picture of George Washington"
should be (picture: George Washington) ... which, in a speech reader with
punctuation turned of will read: "picture George Washington George
Washington in the French and Indian War" Is that an improvement over
"Picture of George Washington George Washington in the French and Indian
War" ??? It just doesn't seem like a substantive enough change for the
amount of fussing I got over it....

As to the "Ideal Web Page", it is an illustration and a question mark or
challenge would suggest that the illustration is inadequate. It is not
intended to be inadequate. I asked last week for help in designing the
componants of an ideal page, and your suggestions were limited to saying
the navigational controls should be available at top and bottom of the
page. The illustration is still unfinished so I am still open to more
suggestions.

Anne
