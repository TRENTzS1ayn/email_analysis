Debates about the "best" alt text can go on forever I think - how about we
start with "any alt text is better than none".
That said - your example, where a caption of some sort is already on the
page, the alt might be best as [illustration].  That is the function of the
picture and what the picture actually is is covered in the text.
In the case where more detail is really needed (a page layout) then longdesc
should be considered.
