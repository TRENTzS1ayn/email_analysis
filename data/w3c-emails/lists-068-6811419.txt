Marti,

I'm working on a full web page as the "long description" for the "ideal
web page" with explanations for each componant. We're opening up the beach
this weekend, so it will be sometime next week before it's ready to share. 

The problem with "any alt text is better than none", is that those who use
the alt text complain about confusion from some of the "any alt text".
Front Page, for example, automatically inserts the filename of the graphic
in the alt text unless the page author edits the image properties. That
seems to frustrate a lot of people using the alt text.

Anne
