Alan,

I think there need to be a variety of examples of this given to authors. 

Would I be correct to assume that if a newspaper published a story about
Bill Cosby, for example, or the Queen of England, that the usual publicity
photos available for such use should be given a null alt tag?

My understanding is that the null alt tag is to be used only for spacers,
not for graphics that are part of the content. 

I do hope that this discussion can lead to some clarification in the
guidelines as to what and how to use the alt tag (positive, not negatives,
of course) in something approaching the wide range of types  of graphics
and illustrations that web authors will be using if they are doing good sites.
