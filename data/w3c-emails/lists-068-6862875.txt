Alan, you bring out the two purposes of illustrations: those which
reinforce the content, and those that include information not included in
the text. Again, these two purposes of illustrations need to be addressed
in the guidelines, and details on how to handle the alt tag for them should
be available ...

Also, where the preferences for visual text-only users varies from the
preferences for non-visual text-only users, there needs to be a
reconciliation of what will be "expected" of conscientious authors.
