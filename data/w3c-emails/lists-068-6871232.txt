Hi Anne,
 Sorry that "any" comment was meant to be "tongue in cheek". - I guess I
should use more <grin> to make sure I am not mistaken. The front page
example is, by the way, pretty good because it is a case where it might be
better to have nothing (after the file name the file size gets stuck in, and
that is really aggravating).
Marti
