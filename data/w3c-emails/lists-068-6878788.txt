# 1 problem with alt text, as it stands, no alt text on graphics used as
links.
       (this is frequently found in navigation bars)
# 2 Excessive alt text that does not contribute to the
usefulness/understanding of the page. (file name and size, the word spacer
etc)
# 3 excessive information on #1, like a description of the navigation bar
(here is a magnifying glass you can click on it to search) - no kidding, I
have heard that one!
This is especially nasty when there is no "skip navigation"
# 4 missing alt text on images used to provide essential information (the
instructions on a form that indicate a * means required field placed in a
graphic with no alt text)

Just my 2 cents.
