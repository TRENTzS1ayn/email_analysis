When reading the text-only presentation, I still want to know
what the author considered worth illustrating - and that is not
conveyed by generic tags such as ALT="[Picture]" or
alt="(illustration)". It is worth my while to take in a couple
more words, as in "[Picture of George Washington]", to tell me
what the illustration was.
