I want to apologize for the other message earlier today about question
between ALT and TITLE, 
somehow I managed to miss Al's posting on 4/25 about ALT not displaying.
Thank  you Al. I am 
concerned about Jim's find of the blinking test with a title attribute on IE
5.5. That isn't occuring in 
IE 5.0 or NN 6.0. But I really don't want blinking text since that's a whole
other issue. Sounds like 
I'm stuck again. ALT doesn't work. TITLE is blinking in IE 5.5. LABEL can't
handle it. So if I fix 
the form with TITLE and SCOPE which seems to work great with Homepage
Reader, then I 
make it blink for IE 5.5 users. I realize that the TITLE won't show up as a
tool tip popup for NN 
4.x or some other browsers. That really doesn't worry me. If someone can
"see" the form then the 
popup mouseover isn't necessary (actually I would rather it not be there at
all - especially if it 
blinks!). ALT doesn't popup but the screen readers aren't reading it. So
suggestions? How is this 
handled in the future?

  I checked out Eugenia's page and found a curious phenomena...
  In IE 5.5 when I put the mouse over an INPUT the tool tip does pop up but
  FLASHES on and off. This was very distracting. (seems to flash at 2 times
  the speed of the cursor blink, it flashes when the cursor is in an INPUT
or
  when no INPUT as a cursor in it).
  In Netscape 4.7 nothing is displayed
  In Opera 5.1 nothing is displayed.

    Contrary to what I previously thought, I now have evidence that the ALT
  attribute on INPUT will not show up using IE 5.5 and Window-Eyes 4.0.
 
    So as of now it would appear that the technique that looks best is to
use
  TITLE on the INPUT, at very least where, as in Eugenia's case, there is no
  suitable LABEL content already showing somewhere on the page.  And
Thatch's
  advice is to ignore LABEL and just TITLE it anyway.
