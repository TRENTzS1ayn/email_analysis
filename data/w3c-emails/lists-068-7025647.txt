Just to add that longer tracts can be partially accessible, ie tv soaps, and
repetition also allows longer and more complex passages to be accessible, eg
Old McDonald had a..... or there was an old woman who.... but with a
different topic of greater relevance.

I try my best when writing, edit and rejig then, i use kf/word to check on
passive sentences and usually try to aim for 7-8 for most public guff,
that is when i feel it is important. ie see my essay linked from
http://www.signbrowser.org.uk/ld+web.html they've had a crash so you might
need to re-read the offline version, or I could email it, if you are really
keen. It rates 9.7 which i am not happy about, but is better than what it
started out as. I go through each paragraph checking for bad patches. more
specialised stuff needs far more careful preparation. "running for
president" does not translate into suitable symbols without a tweak.

Its like they say not the gun but the man, mind you in that case I can live
without either...
