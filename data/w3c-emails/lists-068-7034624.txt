This is interesting - I find the above example to be exactly what I
want to read, since it gives me a better sense of the author's
intentions than the alternative:

    [Picture] George Washington in the French and Indian War

- which tells me nothing about what might be in the picture (battle
scene? campaign map? who knows.) I really want to know why the more
specific text might be "incongruous" for some readers.

Context matters. Seldom does *anything* have only one cause.
