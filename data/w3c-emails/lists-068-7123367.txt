The page title in the head tag (that is at the very top of the browser, or,
at the top of this message, for instance). "About us" This is what the
screenreader reads first. "Welcome to the Democratic Access About us Page"
or
"The Democratic Access Contact Info Page", tells the visually impaired
reader "who" it is "about".

The image is made at 1 by 1 pixels, but by referencing at 0 by 0, it never
renders visibly in any browser that I have tested.  Just one of my
quirks..............Katie

on the hieght/width, why use "0" and "0" or are you just resizing a "1" by
"1" gif?
