Let me make my position clear: I fully support your conclusions; I'm
just trying to be sure that the argument is supported on sound
principles.

If I may offer a correction: while it's true in NN 4.* that turning
off Javascript will also disable CSS, there _is_ an option to turn off
CSS without otherwise affecting Javascript.

Since I posted that to the list, I have had further study and
discussions off the list, and I now perceive that it was based upon a
misunderstanding.,.

I was in no doubt that if two or more rules "match", then the user's
!important rule takes precedence.  However, I now realise that my
understanding of how the matching is defined was defective at a key
point, and I offer my apology to you and to the list.
