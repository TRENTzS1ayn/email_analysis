Subject: URGENT 48 hours to respond: Next face to face


Hello,

I need active members of this group to respond to this message within the
next 48 hours to make sure that we can  move forward with the planning for
this meeting.

The next face to face meeting is scheduled for 20 and 21 June at CWI in
Amsterdam. Now that we have the dates for the meeting, I need to know who
can make this meeting.

Note, we will have phone access to this meeting.

Please fill out the following form:

I will attend this meeting:
a. in person (i.e., I will be in Amsterdam)
b. by phone
c. not at all

If by phone, which hours will you be on the phone? (please specify which
time zone you are referring to).

I am an active member in the working group (i.e. I consistently contribute
to mailing list or teleconference discussions) and I object to holding this
meeting [yes/no].

Thank you.
