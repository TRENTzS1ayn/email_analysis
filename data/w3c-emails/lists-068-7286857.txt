Q: I will attend this meeting:
GJR: in person (i.e., I will be in Amsterdam)

Q: If by phone, which hours will you be on the phone? (please specify which
time zone you are referring to).
GJR: not applicable

Q: I am an active member in the working group (i.e. I consistently
contribute
to mailing list or teleconference discussions) and I object to holding this
meeting
GJR: i do NOT object to holding this meeting--on the contrary, i am
overjoyed by the prospect (and the opportunity to meet with non-WAI working
groups), so long as no other WAI groups meet in isolation on either 20 or 21
june--meeting in joint session is fine, but cross-scheduled meetings are not
acceptable

gregory.
