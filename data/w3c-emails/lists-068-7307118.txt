Hello,

I need active members of this group to respond to this message within
the 
next 48 hours to make sure that we can  move forward with the planning
for 
this meeting.

The next face to face meeting is scheduled for 20 and 21 June at CWI in 
Amsterdam. Now that we have the dates for the meeting, I need to know
who 
can make this meeting.

Note, we will have phone access to this meeting.

Please fill out the following form:

I will attend this meeting:
a. in person (i.e., I will be in Amsterdam)
b. by phone
c. not at all

If by phone, which hours will you be on the phone? (please specify which

time zone you are referring to).

I am an active member in the working group (i.e. I consistently
contribute 
to mailing list or teleconference discussions) and I object to holding
this 
meeting [yes/no].

Thank you.
