I received this e-mail from the folks at UsableNet and Macromedia this
morning:

http://dynamic.macromedia.com/bin/MM/exchange/extension_detail.jsp?product=d
reamweaver&extOid=234570

"508 Accessibility Suite" for Dreamweaver 4 and
UltraDev 4, developed by UsableNet with input from
Macromedia.

This new Dreamweaver evaluation tool allows web site
to be "accessibility-checked" much in the same way as
you "spell-check" a word document. The extension
covers Section 508 and level 1 W3C/WAI guidelines and
a report can be run on one page, a complete web site,
selected section or any folder. The user can select
sub-groups of the guidelines to customize tests to run
on different web pages. The extension allows the user
to collect answers to manual tests and includes
content that explains how to perform tests, why the
problems found could be accessibility issues and
explains with examples how the problem can be fixed.
The extension links through to an Online service from
UsableNet that allows tests to be automatically
scheduled on live public web sites. The service starts
at $49 per year and allows a web site owner to
centrally monitor the accessibility of their web
sites.
