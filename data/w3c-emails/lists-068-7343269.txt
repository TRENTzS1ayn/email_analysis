Speaking only for myself I would apologize for taking so long to 
acknowledge the "Pemberton Principle" - which you already knew: 
Illustrations are acceptable for all, useful for many, mandatory for some.

They are "refusable" for those who don't like/want/need them and this is 
nice from a privacy/privelege/priority view.

The details don't really matter. Once the very first example (checkpoint 
3.1) is seen it is clear that the skills of a specialist can make this 
"principle" an integral part of WCAG 2. I hold little hope that much of the 
kind can be done with earcons/sounds because the implementations of those 
possibilities is still so primitive.

I fervently hope that this sort of thing will pervade W3C space soon.
