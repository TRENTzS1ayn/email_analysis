William, I live in rural Virginia, and originally came from Ohio and
Pennsylvania, so I am quite accustomed to railing against deep-seated
prejudices. (Tho I do lose patience sometimes and have to step back and
take a breath or two!)

This is a detriment to communicating our output. We are limiting our
audience to those who are facile with text ... but our true audience goes
beyond such definitions.

Sigh! I remember the gleam in some folks eyes a few years back when there
was hope that English would be pervasive - then translators were developed,
and more folks came online wanting it their way ....

There are times when I'm grateful for being a "girl" ... I learned a lot of
the needle arts from my mother who learned them from her mother. Knitting,
I learned from my mother's oldest sister, tho my mother later learned to
knit much better. I am sad that I could not learn the art of tatting from
my mother because she learned to do it badly and I couldn't learn from
books.   
I am delighted that my nephew who is homeschooled and doing nicely
academically, works with his father and his uncles, to learn the various
trades in the family in addition to the academics ...

I have suggested to her that we record her voice reading to the children,
because she's good at it when her allergies don't render her useless (which
is why she's looking for sites that read to the kids) ... but we really do
have a full day at school -- I leave at the clock time, but Rose often
stays past supper time! 

Probably need to suggest to publishers that their books would sell better
if kids could hear them online and decide they want to own  them ... (who me?)
