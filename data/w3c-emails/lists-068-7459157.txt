To: Web Content Guidelines<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>

The agenda for this week's meeting (Thursday, 20 hours UTC,
+1-617-252-1038) is as follows:

1. Introduction to the guidelines. We need volunteers to help with
   work on an introduction which will provide an overview of the
   guidelines and document our assumptions regarding author/user/user
   agent responsibilities. What form should the introduction take?

2. Bidirectional languages. Issues have been raised in this area.
   Which sets of "checkpoint solutions"/techniques are affected by
   these concerns (HTML only)?

3. Server-side solutions: what should be the principles of
   accessibility that govern the circumstances in which alternative
   versions of content can be provided by a web server? What kind of
   user control is needed. To what extent is it acceptable to claim
   that by providing an alternative version of what purports to be the
   same content, one is satisfying accessibility requirements (that
   is, how similar must the two versions be in order to count as
   different forms of the same material)? This issue has been
   discussed, albeit obliquely, on previous occasions but never
   addressed in a sustained manner.
