William,

I do disagree with you that pictures are less universal than languages. 

Think about any electric or electronic appliance from your washing machine
to a complex computer system. You can write as many words as you want to
indicate what you want the appliance to do, but until a designer reduces
all your words to a picture/s, the circuit boards that control behavior
cannot be manufactured. 

The notion that text is superior to illustrations is a false pride
engendered by a desire to separate users into those worthy of receiving the
message and those who are unworthy. Ther should be no distinctions of
worthiness in accessibility.

Anne
