Hi, I know I have not been able to make the conference calls too often
lately. I've had this post viral thing dragging on, which can make it hard
to get though the day. (The calls are at 11 PM to 12.30 AM  my time. ) I
will try and make it tonight, but if I am too tied, I'll go to sleep
instead.

Lisa

>The agenda for this week's meeting (Thursday, 20 hours UTC,
>+1-617-252-1038) is as follows:
>
>1. Introduction to the guidelines. We need volunteers to help with
>   work on an introduction which will provide an overview of the
>   guidelines and document our assumptions regarding author/user/user
>   agent responsibilities. What form should the introduction take?
>
>2. Bidirectional languages. Issues have been raised in this area.
>   Which sets of "checkpoint solutions"/techniques are affected by
>   these concerns (HTML only)?
>
>3. Server-side solutions: what should be the principles of
>   accessibility that govern the circumstances in which alternative
>   versions of content can be provided by a web server? What kind of
>   user control is needed. To what extent is it acceptable to claim
>   that by providing an alternative version of what purports to be the
>   same content, one is satisfying accessibility requirements (that
>   is, how similar must the two versions be in order to count as
>   different forms of the same material)? This issue has been
>   discussed, albeit obliquely, on previous occasions but never
>   addressed in a sustained manner.
