Dear Anne (et al.)

First of all, let me say that I very much like your work at URL:
<http://users.erols.com/stevepem/guidelines/G3/g3.html>

AP> I guess this means I met your and Bruce's challenge to prove that even
AP> the guidelines can be illustrated! 

My challenge was more on the order that illustrations can not adequately
REPLACE text.

AP> I have been very surprised that there has been no discussion about the
AP> content of any of my illustrations. 

I like the addition of illustrations.  Ascetically, I find such "eye candy"
very appealing and inviting -- and I am all for it.  From a content point of
view, in terms of the WCAG 2 guidelines, I don't know that they add anything
of real value.  I don't think they meet your initial stated objective.
(1)  The graphics do not "stand on their own".  Without the accompanying
body text, the illustrations are fairly vague and meaningless.  Without
looking at the ALT text, I wasn't sure what they were suppose to be showing!
Don't get me wrong, I think the graphics are about as good as they could be.
I think this just reinforces the thesis that some concepts and ideas are not
well communicated pictorially.
(2)  With the exception of the first (which includes a "zoom in" feature),
the images include a great deal of graphical text.  If someone can't read,
these "illustrations" are no more meaningful than the body text!

On the other hand, the examples (George Washington / The Battle of New
Orleans) have, to me, much more meaningful illustrations.  But then again,
they use photographs.

I agree with William's sentiments:

WL> Illustrations are acceptable for all, useful for many, mandatory for
some.
WL> The details don't really matter. Once the very first example (checkpoint

WL> 3.1) is seen it is clear that the skills of a specialist can make this 
WL> "principle" an integral part of WCAG 2.
WL> I fervently hope that this sort of thing will pervade W3C space soon.

I will save my reservations for two of Williams more recent posts...
