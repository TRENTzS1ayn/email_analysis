And my point is that no rule can be drawn from that saying that all web
content is better (for some value of "better") with illustration.

What I meant by "we" was "the set of people educated in school systems I'm
aware of." What I meant by "communicate" is producing that content, rather
than consuming it. It's something we just don't know how to do.

Guideline 4 communicates a lot more content than can be received in a fixed
illustration. In fact, there are a number of concepts such as "languages,
APIs and protocols", "data models", "device-independent event handlers", and
so on, in my opinion cannot be adequately illustrated in the context of the
document itself.

We can attempt to create a multimedia presentation that's linked to from
guidelines and checkpoints, but simple inline illustration is not going to
be sufficient to successfully aid users in comprehension of the more complex
concepts. Additionally, I fear that overillustration would make it more
difficult for many to grasp the content of the document in toto.

The argument I take issue with is that people here who disagree with a given
proposal have some kind of anti-accessibility agenda. It's simply not true,
and it's demeaning to hear it whenever one of us is critical of something
that's proposed.
