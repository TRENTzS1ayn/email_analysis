Emmanuelle,

Any attempt we make to set a mental age limit for the web will be highly
discriminatory. Alan Flavell last week asked that all web pages be designed
so that they will appear to a speech user as if they were created for "all
text" from the beginning. Is it any more unreasonable for those with
impaired cognition to ask that all web pages be designed as if they
contained "no text"? 

In my humble opinion "all" is too much to ask ... but who will end up on
the other side of the dividing line?
