Bruce,

     Glad you like the use of the "click to enlarge" image ... the only
drawback is that the full size is loaded with the page increasing the
download time. If this was the "final" version, I'd create a smaller sample
of the image to load on the page, clicking still to the full sized image.
When the Guidelines specify that illustrations are "required" for
accessibility, this could be a techique to minimize the impact of high
dowload time ... 


In the next few days when I get time to do it, I'll add the rest of the
illustrations (each page in the 3.1 illustration is a full illustration of
a type of page) and hang it up for review and discussion. They will fit
into other guidelines outside of G3 ..

>As I mentioned in my last post, I respectfully disagree.  I don't think
the bulk of illustrations speak for themselves.  I do agree that the
example does demonstrate that even technical documents benefit from the
addition of icons.

version.  This requires a graphic the size of a whole screen.  This is a
helpful illustration, in much the same way that the current techniques
documents includes the occasional picture.  The large consistency graphic
still only supplements the body text.  When it is reduced to a smaller size
(so that it may appear inline with the content) it becomes a useful "visual
bookmark" or icon -- but only because one already has an understanding of
the text!

however, might be better served by having a "mock website" that illustrates
these ideas.  On the other hand, the WAI material, and to a lesser degree
the whole W3 site, does attempt to actively "practice what we preach".
