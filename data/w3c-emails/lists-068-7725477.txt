Neither is any one word universal. And, depending on your age, you were
purposefully or accidently taught to use maps, tables, graphs, photographs,
drawings, and other illustrations as you wended your way to a dissertation.

Sigh .... It's not "almost a rule" ... it's not even a rule ... you must
not have encountered the amount of badly written text that I've seen
"published" online!

Who, where, when, and with what disability??????

>Education in spoken and written language and composition is compulsory. 

Cognitively disabled children have only been included in education in the
past 30 years or less depending on area ... Educational opportunity is now
a right, but there are many adults who came up before this was so ... even
now, there are many children with disabilities who receive something other
than the "compulsory" education.

Hey the "academic high achievers" aren't the sum of the population, and
certainly aren't typical of the disabled adult in the US or elswhere. Yes,
there are unique individuals who have achieved academically in some
disabled groups, but they are the exception not the rule. The vast majority
of those with disabilities are from other walks of life.
