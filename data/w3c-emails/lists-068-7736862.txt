Sean,

The priorities, if I remember correctly, sorta lump all image/multi-media
requirements to P3 rather than P1, so that if 100% of the web is at P1, the
needs of the largest group of disabled folks is left out.... shameful! I
would be happier with the 90% at P3 ...

One of the "advanced mathematics" that I learned a bit about is chaos
theory, which is fascinating when it's put into a plotted graphic ... In a
book I read years ago, it was color plates in the middle of the book, but
it's interactable somewhere on the web (lost the link a while ago) ...
Quantum physics may be hard to represent in two dimensions ... but in
3D-maybe ??? (my understanding of quantum physics is limited to
occasionally watching re-runs of "Quantum Leap"...)

For any subject, there are a some gifted teachers who have learned how to
illustrate their subject, and others who bluster .... 

My students are getting ready for a visit from an e-mail correspondent to
the first graders, and reviewing the vocabulary to name the parts of the
computer: As I ask each student to go up and name all the parts, I find I
have a few children who have been in the lab all year, but still call the
mouse "the clicker", and the keyboard  "the typer" ... (If I told them they
had to do this to meet the state SOLs, they would grouse! I tell them they
have to learn it "for Zman", and they jump up, each eager to do and learn
to do it right ...!)
