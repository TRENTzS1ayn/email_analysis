Even though I didn't verbally say that I wanted to take on the action item
of looking at the introduction during the conference call, I decided to do
it anyway.

While looking through it, my main overall impression was that what is
written really isn't an introduction to the document, but it is an
introduction to the 4 main principles of the guidelines. I feel that there
needs to be an introduction to the document as a whole.

With that in mind, I went ahead and drafted one. My draft ends at the point
where I feel that Wendy's introduction should begin. So I haven't replaced
what she has done, but I have added some preliminary information.

Not all of the information in my draft is information that has been agreed
upon. I threw in a few of my own ideas, but I made highlighted "Author's
Notes" next to the areas that are sure to be more controversial.

The elements of controversy are mainly in the compliance section, which we
aren't dealing with yet, so I guess the controversial ideas can be ignored
for now. Right now I just want to throw out my introduction as a possible
method of introducing the WCAG 2.0 document as a whole.

My introduction can be accessed at http://www.webaim.org/wcag/intro.

Note: The links in my draft are not functional. They're just there as
place-holders.

In short, here is the outline that I have come up with, minus the paragraphs
of text (note: this outline is an "alternative" and not an "equivalent"
representation of what I did <smile>, so I encourage you to read the full
document):

1. Introduction
1.1 The Purpose of These Guidelines
1.2 Who Benefits from These Guidelines?
1.3 The Broad Nature of These Guidelines
1.4 Limitations of These Guidelines
1.5 Determining Compliance with These Guidelines
1.6 The Four Main Principles of These Guidelines
1.6.1 Presentation
1.6.2 Interaction
1.6.3 Comprehension
1.6.4 Technology considerations
