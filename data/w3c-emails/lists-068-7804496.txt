I had a look at the Anne' s site. It was fantastic. It aided comrehention,
by alowig me to fit the word to the consept as I read them.

In fact I used to draw block dyagrams and flow dyagrams, instead of taking
notes. That way I could remember and understand what was said. I somtimes do
somthing similar mentialy when I am following a complexted discution. Siliar
methids are recomeden by the BDA.

As I clearly demonstrated at the November ftf I have learning disabilty. The
only way I can remember thing with an impaired visual and auditory memory is
though the sense on context and meaning. By Anne illustrating the concept
with a diagram or graphic, I new what I was reading the first time I read
it, instead of reading the words, and then trying to fit them in to the
concept or thought that they represent.

Now I now I do not represent every dyslexic on the plaint, and that there
are many sub-groups of dyslexia, but I am one of the lucky ones who have
some measure of all impairments that have been grouped together as dyslexia.
In other words not all dyslexic will find it useful, but it seems to me that
people with an impaired auditory memory (estimated at 60% of dyslexics - see
the many works over the last 15 years by work by Tallal) and/or weak
phonetic processing (possibly 80% Stanovich, et all, or Blachman) skills
probably will.
