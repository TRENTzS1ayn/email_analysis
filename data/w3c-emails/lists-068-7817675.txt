Yes, this is a very practical way to help someone compose good ALT text
content.

Yes, this is completely unreasonable.
(1)  We don't have ANY method for replacing text with pictures.
(2)  Browsers which strip text and present only images don't exist (although
I guess they wouldn't be too hard to create).  On the other hand, browsing
without images is fairly common.
