It shows.  I've fiddled around with graphics enough to know how time
consuming this kind of work is.

No, but we are being fairly loose with our terms.
I believe the word comes from "illuminated drawings" and were originally
used in hand-transcribed bibles to help a largely illiterate population
remember the stories they had heard aurally.

The images you have on your site above, despite their large size, are closer
to computer icons than to a painting.  They are useful to the document
because they provide visual book marks and as reminders of the content.  How
much they aid with comprehension, I could not say.  Some people really like
that kind of thing (like Lisa S.) while others find them either distracting,
wasteful of space, or unprofessional.  Most of us, I suspect, are rather
neutral.  In the best case, we are debating P3 levels of accessibility.

I understood that the objective of this exercise was to present an example
of how illustrations can be used to make even a technical document of some
value to a non-reader.  If this was the case, I don't believe that you have
succeeded.  The images chosen are highly textual.  They may be nice for most
people -- but are of extremely limited (at best) to the intended target
audience.

No one is debating that pictures aren't "nice".  The question is how much
dare we make them a "requirement".  Sure, most of us doodle and we learn to
draw as kids, but very few of us get paid for producing computer-oriented
art.  Most of write as part of jobs, so we are comfortable sharing our
words.

In spite of all the bandwidth, I don't believe that this conversation has
gotten beyond "make your site attractive and easy to use".
