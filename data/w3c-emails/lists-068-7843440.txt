I'm not sure how "fairly common" it is to browse with images turned off... On this list, some folks say they use the web that way, but in my life away from this list, NO ONE I KNOW uses the web that way! Just as I don't know anyone in real life who uses television without the screen on, or listens to anything but music on the radio....

Somehow, early on, accessibility got astray in not recognizing all needs, and it is time to put it back on track. Yes, for those who've been sipping the wine of this table a long time, it will require that you "think out of the box" and consider solutions that would not be your own personal choice of how to use the web. As we tell the little children ... "You have to learn to share!"
