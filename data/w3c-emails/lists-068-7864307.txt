Bruce,

    Lisa didn't just find the illustrations "nice", she found they helped her more quickly and efficiently process the content. I think that is the point you are missing, tho I've no clue why. This is not just about making the web "nice", or even "more friendly", tho there are some checkpoints that do no more than that already (such as synchronizing scripts). 

The definition of priorities is that, for P1 priority, it needs to be necessary for a substantial number of users. This is the case with graphics and multi-media.

Yes, multi-media .... Just asked one of the LD teacher for help in finding "hard data", and she said that there are decades of research indicating that LD persons need more than a single modality, usually at a time, in order for them to comprehend something at the same level as a non-disabled person. Will the hard data specifically mention "The Web" .... perhaps not, but the parallels from our knowledge of low-tech need to be made to high tech. The teacher I spoke with went on at some length pointing out how much information her students retained by using multi-media software instead of a text document or book. It's so clearly obvious and basic to some of us, that it's hard to comprehend why it's incomprehensible to others. Perhaps I need to illustrate my email????

                        Anne
