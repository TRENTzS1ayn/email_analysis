I don't think that's the case. E.g., Lisa is a "reader" with certain 
characteristics that make some "accommodations" valuable beyond just "nice 
to have". We are not trying to devise hieroglyphics or re-invent Bliss 
Symbols. Some of our clients *need* there to be other-than-just-text in 
order to make stuff accessible.

Even though they can read.
