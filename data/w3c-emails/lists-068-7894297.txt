O.K., but as Jason pointed out, we need to be able to draw some kind
of limit or applicable boundaries to this, otherwise we just end up
chasing a giant furphy [1]. I think that clearly this is something
that can only be decided on case-by-case basis, and therefore is left
up to the common sense and intuition of the author. However, what GL
can provide is example after example (a kind of test suite for WCAG),
so that people way wade through these and gain a good feel for exactly
what constitutes appropriate implementation of this guideline.

In other words - we're producing guidelines; we can't force anybody to
do anything, but we can guide them! Saying "thou shalt provide x" is
O.K. until you come to an exception... then people get stuck.

My 0.02 [insert currency here].

[1] A "furphy" is a small Australian mammal that looks a lot like a
rabbit, but is no larger than a rat. Hence the expression, "to chace a
furphy down a rat-hole". Did I get that right Charles? :-)
