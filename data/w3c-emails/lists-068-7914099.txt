Sean,

    Take your whole statement and apply it to, oh, say, alt text instead of illustrations. Set up a dividing line so only some users get their supper, allow authors to choose to follow it or not, and make the examples so many and so inconclusive that authors skip "wading" through it all.  And, when it rankles and you get that awful itch running up and down your typing arm, you will have some idea how your statement sounds to someone advocating for folks who weren't in the original "box"

Simply put, you must SHARE, not covet, not defend a turf ... you must strive for INCLUSION not EXCLUSION ... And when the newbies arrive at the table, share the meat, not just the tossed salad.

                    Anne
