Matt,

    Your basic logic has a serious flaw that is probably contributing to failure to comprehend the similarities I'm presenting...

You said: >MM No, it isn't. Not in the same way alt text is necessary to blind users.
>Without alt text, 100% of blind users will fail to receive information from

First, lets keep both examples in the apple orchard ...

You are correct that without alt text, 100% of blind users will fail to receive information from an image. 

It is equally correct that without graphics, 100% of non-readers will fail to receive information from text ...

Or, we can move to the orange grove ...


100% of blind users will not fail to receive a document whether or not it has alt text.

and

100% of non-readers will not fail to receive a document whether or not is has a graphic.

Do you understand where you err? Or do I need to illustrate the logic?

                        Anne
