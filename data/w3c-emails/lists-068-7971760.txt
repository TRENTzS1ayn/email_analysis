The discussion is beginning to degrade...that must mean we are close to a 
resolution? <grin/>  I certainly hope so.  I have done my best to get my 
head around the issues and to see as many perspectives on this issue as 
possible.  I have documented my thoughts at: 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2001/05/cog-notes.html

I have called it <q>Wendy's unillustrated notes, thoughts, and questions 
about the recent WCAG WG "Illustrating Guidelines" thread</q> because it is 
very dense text and does not have one single illustration. 
<grin/>  However, I tried to provide assistance for people who only want to 
skim the most important parts - e.g. using boxes, bold text, italic text, 
and lists.

It is a living document, and will continue to change until we come to 
consensus on this topic.  Anyone want to add anything?  Have I grossly 
misinterpreted something?  Let me know!

Here is the table of contents:
Axes of discussion
Rough summary of main points of discussion
Research
To do's and questions
Conclusions
Open Issues

Be well.  Be civil.  See each other's perspectives.  Have patience.  We 
<em>will</em> get through this.  It doesn't mean we all have to agree, but 
that we agree to move forward.
