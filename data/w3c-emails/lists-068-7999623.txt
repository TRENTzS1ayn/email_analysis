Lisa,

Thanks so much for sharing your ability to use the graphics as I had hoped
they would be used. I am not an illustrator, and was not certain they would
actually do what was intended. You confirmed that I did so, and I am so
glad you said so. 

If this is the type of "hard data" Jason needs,  then we are off to a good
start. Although I taught LD kids for almost 15 years, I've been five years
away from the field, so checked this morning with an LD teacher for 4-5th
graders, who confirmed what I have been trying to tell folks here, that the
multi-media aides understanding, and it does so in very spectacular ways!

    My husband (who insisted I post the bit last night to express his
dismay over those who cannot accept the importance of graphics) is, in
addition to his vision impairments he wanted stated, also learning
disabled, with some dyslexia and lots more dysgraphia. Unlike you, he will
not attempt to write online, and always has me do his writing for him...

You are to be commended for your efforts!!!

Anne
