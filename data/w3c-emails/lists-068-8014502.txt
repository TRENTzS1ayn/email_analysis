I'd like to propose a change to checkpoint 3.3 (Write clearly and simply):

3.2 Make content clear and simple.

or

3.2 Make content as clear and simple as you can.

The reason I'm recommending this change is that I feel "writing" is too text-specific, and that the authors of images, sound, motion video, and interactive apps should be (more overtly) aware that this applies to their content as well.
