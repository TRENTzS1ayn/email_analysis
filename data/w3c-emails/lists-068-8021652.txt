Wendy,

Your skills in pulling together all the fibers in this thread are
admirable!!!

     Where you expressed my points, thoughts, hopes, and experiences, you
did them exactly as I would have myself! 

I am not surprised that you found more information on learning disabled
students than on adults with this disability. There are social reasons why
this is so. LD folks tend to "melt into the population" after they leave
school. This is because in school the ratio of tasks that are difficult for
an LD person to accomplish to the tasks they can handle is much higher than
in other walks of life. LD persons, unlike CD persons, are usually
competitively employable, sometimes running their own businesses large and
small. As blind people used to routinely employ readers, LD folks employ
secretaries (spell checkers aren't sufficiently developed to meet the needs
of dysgraphic users, tho there is hope that predictive writers may ...) One
difficulty in doing research on LD adults, is that they just don't end up
in a situation where they can be tested as easily as people with other
types of disabilities. Research that is done, is often done on LD adults
who are pursuing higher education who may or may not be employed ... 

One need of many LD students, is to use text (textbooks and handouts)
which have been marked-up with a highlighter to show key points, terms,
names, etc. Once got a new principal from North Carolina who was shocked
that we didn't automatically provide each LD child with such books since it
was "mandatory" in NC ... but is used on an "as needed" basis in Virginia.
In addition to illustrations, LD folks benefit greatly from easy-to-access
glossaries, dictionaries, and other expansions and explanations of the
text. But that need is already addressed in the Guidelines, so I don't
mention it ... but that is why the illustrations for G3 include a glossary
as well as a "topical illustration", an illustrations page, page for
multi-media, etc. in the set shown for G3.1

Don't worry that you didn't illustrate ... as you suggest, creating a "web
site" is usually going to be a multi-person task, so it may as well be
tasked by multi-skilled people so it can approach the ideal of meeting all
needs. 

Text is a wonderful medium, for those who can use it, but depending on the
statistics you read, text isn't as universal in the "real world", even in
the US, as in some exclusive enclaves ... Folks of the "real world" use on
"visuals", "tactiles", "kinesthetics", "sounds" before "text" ... when
nephew stops up the toilet, hubby goes for the snake, not a book ... (for
those who aren't married to a plumber, a snake is a long coil used to clean
out a sewage pipe ... professional plumbers have long snakes ... )
