Matt,

Like your suggestion!!!

All of our guidelines about content should consistently include all types
of content. 

The same guidance that is needed for text writers is needed for
illustrators ... As I've said often in the past few days, I'm not an
illustrator, and the guidelines are not the easiest of text to illustrate,
but I did do it, in my spare time, in a reasonable amount of time ... It's
not an impossible requirement ... just as there as some folks who should
not "write" a web page without hitching up with someone who can write,
those who feel comfortable with writing will need to collaborate with
someone who can illustrate... The product is a web page, remember, not a
"document" ... 

Anne
