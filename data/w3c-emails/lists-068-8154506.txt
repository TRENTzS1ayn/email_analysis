Actually, the "topical illustrations" in your examples are exactly what is
needed as a minimum. No, it is not like using the alt text "image", it is
like using the alt text "tennis ball" or "windows" ... If you studied my
illustrations for guideline 3, you may have noticed the "topical
illustration or logo" space at the top left of the page ... with the Title
in the top right space ... (left/right/middle, etc. are optional as long as
they are both there in the opening screenfull ...it is even optional to
include the topical illustration and title in the site map as long as it's
in the opening screenful so it can be used to determine if further study of
the page is desirable.

The argument over good or bad multimedia is incidental to meeting the needs
of disabled folks. The guidelines don't insist on "good" text, but there is
a goodly amount of "bad" text out there!

 Flash movies, in particular, violate

Can you be more specific? to whom do these supposed violations render the
movie unusable? Does this happen with all Flash objects, or just the
movies? My experience with Flash has been good - problems have been with
certain Shockwave games, especially puzzles, that cause the NT'd computers
to crash ... But Flash doesn't crash the machines, at least not any I work
with... 


 I don't want to see people getting the message

Matt, I don't understand what of "our goals" are countermanded by the use
of multi-media. 

 (Worse, "good" and "bad" are
>highly subjective, and often have little to do with "usable" or
>"accessible." Content providers don't know that, either.)

Yes, good and bad are highly subjective and I have not doubt that you and I
would disagree on which is which ... And, as I said above, the are
irrelevent to the question of whether or not they deserve to be stated as
desirable and needed in the guidelines. 

By the way, here's a link to an enjoyable bit of Flash ... don't know if
you will consider it good or bad, but I enjoy it!
http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/chinese/
There are other flash objects on the site.

If you have an elevator in your building, can you claim accessibity if you
allow it to fall into disrepair?

But we don't. We tell them to add alt tags, long discriptions for stills,
text of sound files, summaries and more for tables, and scripts of
multi-media ... text is not sacred and it needs to be included under the
guidelines as well as the other forms of content.
