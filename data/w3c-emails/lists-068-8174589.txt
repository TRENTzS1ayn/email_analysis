That doesn't convey the meaning of the writing. Only a basic subject. That
isn't anything like "alternative" or "equivalent" content for a larger
document. And it could just as easily be a generic sports logo or a picture
of a window on a house, which would convey even less meaning, or confuse the
viewer.

The guidelines _do_ insist on good text. "Write clearly and simply."

By default, Flash violates most of Guideline 2 (Interaction according to
user needs and preferences).

Flash has no native user interface widgets, so it's next to impossible to
comply with 3.1 (Use consistent presentation) and 2.2 (Provide consistent
responses to user actions). The user has to learn how to work each
individual movie in a different manner. We have a finite number of user
interface objects in HTML, which afford users the ability to access content
without a learning curve. There is a learning curve built in to every Flash
movie.

Flash objects cannot be paused by the user without knowing how to access the
contextual menu, and phrases cannot be replayed, unless the designer had the
forethought to do this.

The goal of WCAG is to make web content accessible to users with the full
range of disabilities. If organizations refuse to make an attempt due to a
constraint they can't meet, and there's no way around it, none of their
content is going to be made more accessible to anyone.

Checkpoint 3.4: Use multimedia to illustrate concepts.
What about that is insufficient?

So, your answer is no, there is no way to make huge swaths of the web
"accessible." That's not satisfactory to me.

I don't think the analogy is accurate, or maybe it's too accurate. These are
buildings (sites/pages) that don't have elevators (accessible technologies)
to begin with, and have no means of accommodating them outside of
constructing a new building (starting from scratch, including replacing
legacy technology). And in some cases, this requirement is being made of the
tenants of the building (content aggregators), rather than the owner
(author). They don't have the _rights_ to build the elevator, even if they
had the resources and know-how to do so.

Yes we do. Checkpoint 3.4. Checkpoint solutions will follow.

And we tell them to use multimedia to illustrate concepts, at checkpoint
level.

What we cannot do is evaluate with any degree of accuracy what is best for a
given situation, or prescribe one-size-fits-all solutions for the web with
respect to the application of multimedia.
