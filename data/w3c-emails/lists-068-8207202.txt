Matt,

If the problems with flash are merely "next to impossible", they are
solvable, perhaps with carefully crafted and well illustrated techniques.
If you feel that all controls should be consistent, design the control
system that you feel is most useful and put it in a technique ... 

The problem of a badly chosen topical illustration is the same as the
problem of a badly written title. No more and no less. If you want to
advocate trusting the page author, then trust them to choose illustrations
well if they are first told they are necessary ... 

Am I to deduce that you would see multi-media as "efficable" if the
guidelines included specified techniques to avoid pitfalls in the various
multi-media tools?

Anne
