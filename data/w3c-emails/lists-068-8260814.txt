I am afraid that I do not know what you are trying to say. Is it that we
should concentrate on text  because we are used to that, or is it a
welcoming of new information so that we can  move forward?
Please explain to me how providing a diagrammatic representation to
accompany the text, could make the text harder to access. Or how adding
graphics like Anne did makes the page less accessible to anyone?
Alternative rendering, - surely that is are motto. Not "Text only"
