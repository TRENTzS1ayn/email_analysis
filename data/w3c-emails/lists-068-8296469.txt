Marti,

Back in the days of DOS, I taught LD and CD children to use the computer
for daily lessons, and helped them use the Internet for weekly lessons.
Most of the time, I read the incoming e-mail to the students, although some
did learn to handle their correspondence independently. When most were
writing replies the method was that they would tell me what they wanted to
say and I'd feed it back to them word by word as they typed it. 
If I didn't feed it back, many of them were unable to remember what they
wanted to write long enough to type it... Teaching children to use the
Internet with a GUI interface, cuts off a lot of the difficulties. None of
the dyslexic members of my family used computers before GUI. 

Happy Mother's Day to all ...

Anne
