Does universal design require one web page for all or the ability to specify

unquote

in my "view", the latter -- the former is merely one technique for
accomplishing the latter...  of course, my answer is also predicated on (a)
the ability of the user to specify precisely what he or she wants, and not
the application of a cookie-cutter profile (e.g. blind, deaf, low vision,
head-pointer, voice input, etc.) and (b) equivalency of function and
equivalent access to content in all individually served pages (a scenario in
which a portion of the onus is shifted from the page author, and onto the
shoulders of those constructing and populating the database from which the
individually served pages are drawn)
