Gregory,

     With my limited knowledge of specifics in technologies, we can go
either of two choices - 1) work to put everything onto each page, and have
people tripping over other folks' needs, or put some of the requirements on
a site, rather than a page level ... there will be pages of text and
illustrations perhaps with accompanying sound files, but multi-media would
be linked from a page "other modality page" rather than *ON* the other
modality page ....

On the multi-media page, we need to specify the controls that are needed
for accessibility - such as the ability to stop, pause, back up a bit, play
forward, etc. If it is felt that these controls are needed on each and
every type of multi-media, then the guidelines need to specify the minimum
types of controls that are necessary. 

     I did include illustrations and sound files with the text page. I
don't feel there is any need for an "all text version" ... It is easy in
any/all? browsers to turn off the illustrations, and sounds files can be
controllable by the user (if by turning the speaker off if all else fails!)
... So all these can reside on the same page...
