I can not imagine that anyone (even on the WAI-GL) can disagree with that.

This solution about the cut curbs was found by not running away from the
problems and dichotomy that were encountered in creating this guideline, but
by facing them head on and finding a creative way to resolve them.

This attitude of late, of "this guideline has a problem/ is not practical -
so let us scrap it" is beneath us.
