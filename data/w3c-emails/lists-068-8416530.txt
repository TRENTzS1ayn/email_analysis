Yes, I would ike to have more illustrations for the checkpoint and teh
examples. But I had a time shortage, and I figured getting something out and
modifying later is better than waiting forever in case I get to do it
perfectly. (But then, I would not claim that my email propsal was accessible,
either...)

  Now we're getting somewhere approaching "concrete".

  Incidentally the instant proposed checkpoint should likely, at least IMO,
  provide a graphic equivalent? We should examine everything in the document
  to ascertain which ones fit this proposed checkpoint. Then we can be more
  into "doing" in a more elaborate sense than *just* "talking"?

  One implication of the long thread is that the checkpoints are mostly
  acceptable?
