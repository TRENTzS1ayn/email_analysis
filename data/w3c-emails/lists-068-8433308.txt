  Hello,

  I need active members of this group to respond to this message within the
  next 48 hours to make sure that we can  move forward with the planning for
  this meeting.

  The next face to face meeting is scheduled for 20 and 21 June at CWI in
  Amsterdam. Now that we have the dates for the meeting, I need to know who
  can make this meeting.

  Note, we will have phone access to this meeting.

  Please fill out the following form:

  I will attend this meeting:
  a. in person (i.e., I will be in Amsterdam)
  b. by phone
  c. not at all

  If by phone, which hours will you be on the phone? (please specify which
  time zone you are referring to).

  I am an active member in the working group (i.e. I consistently contribute
  to mailing list or teleconference discussions) and I object to holding this
  meeting [yes/no].

  Thank you.
