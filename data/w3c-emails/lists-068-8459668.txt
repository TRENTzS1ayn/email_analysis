Tim,

This weeks MSDN "DHTML Dude" [1] says,
<blockquote>
The Internet Explorer team frequently receives requests to allow users to 
disable the appearance of pop-up windows. Yet this puts us in a dilemma: Do 
we allow developers the freedom to use this potentially powerful tool to 
offer great solutions to their customers? Or do we restrict the platform so 
developers cannot misuse this functionality? The Internet Explorer team has 
taken the stand that except where security concerns are present, we should 
allow developers as much flexibility as possible to build powerful 
applications, without undue restrictions.
</blockquote>

WCAG is relying on users being able to control windows opening and 
closing.  This is covered by UAAG 5.3.  Does the IE team realize that UAAG 
is talking about configurability of the user agent rather than restricting 
what it is possible for developers to do?

In other words, pop-up windows can be very useful.  They can increase 
usability if you are able to use them as intended.  However, they can 
really muck things up if you can not use them as intended.  Therefore, we 
don't want to restrict developers from using them, but we do want to let 
people configure the use of pop-up windows.  For example, opera will let 
you say "do not open windows in a new window."

So, can you tell us if the IE team is willing to consider this if it is 
about user configurability rather than restricting developers?

Thank you. Be well,
