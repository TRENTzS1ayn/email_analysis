Thanks, Greg!

This is an area of the guidelines that BEGS for illustrations!

Read some of the techniques (boy what a lot of wading required!) and I
think it can be illustrated with a "control panel" ... with VCR type
buttons ... but I have no clue, as a page author, how I would associate
control of a *.wav file to the controls on the page ...

There are a lot of checkpoints related to the "conditional content" ...
(should they be combined?) and one thing I'm not sure I understand (why
isn't clicking on a link sufficient control of the beginning of a
multi-media presentation?). I'm not sure about the slow down of media
without a corresponding speed up control ... seems some folks may want to
speed through something as likely as slow it down... Also, as one who often
uses both background music, and links to sounds files on web pages, I also
have no idea how to control the volume on the page.
