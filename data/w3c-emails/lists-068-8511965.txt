Charles,

William is right, this is an excellent concrete proposal, and good
examples of how to illustrate ...

I used to have an SVG viewer, but lost it in a drive crash a few months
ago (haven't needed it since!) .. Can you please tell me again where to
download it from?

Very messy situation, not having the SVG viewer ... It spawns a new
window, that stays blank, no clue what's going on, tho you can X back to
the original page ... 

Anne
