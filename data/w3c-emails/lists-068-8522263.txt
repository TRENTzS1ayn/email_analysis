3 queries on svg: viewer, authoring tool and code.
http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG-access/#Structured was a reasonable to good read
with some great examples of illustration helping understanding.


viewer
how does one get mozilla with svg working?
"Steve has a site with embedded SVG examples that can be displayed in
Mozilla (with SVG support). "
but the link to http://jerbaker.dhs.org/mozilla/ was down when I tried it.

tool
I wonder what tool was used to draw the tiger? was a pressure sensitive
tablet?
My experience of vector based tools, is that it would not be easy to
emulate.
It would certainly be worth having links to good examples of how to achieve
more complex effects, the hub is fine and well linked the tiger is not.
gimp and sketch are a world apart.

code
your examples of svg code look great.
Perhaps you could link to the tiger code so we could have another more
complex great example
The lion example: http://www.skeeter-s.com/svg/lion2.xml has no comments,
nor a wealth of useful functions .

Working with LDD clients I find it essential to get feedback asap, otherwise
one can be lead astray.
