One easy way is to go to the Adobe SVG area - http://www.adobe.com/svg and
download their plugin for your browser (they have netsacpe or explorer
versions for Mac and Windows. I have used the Mac Netscape plugin for iCab as
well...

Or go to the SVG page at w3c - http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG and look there
for viewers - there are a handful available.

Cheers
