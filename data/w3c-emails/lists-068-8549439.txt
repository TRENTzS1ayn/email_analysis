Charlie,

Downloaded the viewer this morning, but it's not working right. I still
get a blank explorer screen that never comes in, and when I x if off, it
tells me that there was an "unusual error in IE" ...

I used the adobe site for download. Will try another source at school and
see what happens...

                     Anne
