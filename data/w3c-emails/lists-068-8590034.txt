OS: Linux Debian 2.2 (potato)
Browser: w3m/0.1.11-pre
Hardware: keyboard, color monitor

My w3m display configuration: links are printed with a different color,
and the selected link is underlined.

All links are usable. When there is a non-whitespace separator, it's
obvious that these are separated links even when they aren't selected.
With spaces or no separation, you don't know it by advance but only when
one is selected (thus underlined).
