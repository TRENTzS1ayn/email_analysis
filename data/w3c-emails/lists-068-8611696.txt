So you're saying that I *shouldn't* go for the plain English award?

Well, not necessarily - we don't currently make the distinction over
what is repusposable and what is not, because that's a philisophical
rat-hole; I try to stay as far away from it as possible. I think that
enough people have a feel for what "repurposable" means from everyday
context (remember, XML GL is targeted at XML application/tagset
designers)... and if not, they can always look it up in the glossary,
no?

Hmph, maybe we do need to define "repurposable" somewhere... How
about: "content that can be adpated for more than one 'purpose' - e.g.
output modalities, processing formats".

So much for staying "as far away from it as possible".

That's one way of looking at it, but again, it falls short of the
problem that (to quote myself), "it's a subsumption of the complexity
of relationships that occur between content of different modalities".
In other words, it's just an example of a reversal in techniques - not
good normative example for a guideline without an explanation of
scope. What we're really asking is that people aren't constrained to
one method or t'other.

The second method has its advantages by the way:-
1) Markup can be included in between tags, but not as attribute data.
2) Multiple illustrations can easily be associated with a single run
of text (somthing would needed to be said about the importance of
nesting).
3) You can provide ilustrations for subsections of larger models, and
possibly use this to provide some sort of navigation mechanism at the
same time (being careful not to overload the semantics of the elements
involved - add it as attribute data or whatever).

BTW, your "add images to text rather than text to images" was a big
part in coming up with this; cheers.
