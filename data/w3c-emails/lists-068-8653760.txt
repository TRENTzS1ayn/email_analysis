Does anyone know a way to fine tune left click interpretation?

problem:    left click is used to drag and to trigger link.

We use ie5 and have set up for single click.

some users move icons due to 'shaking'

ie5 seems to be set up so a 1 pixel move is a move not a click (reasonable
for repositioning) else it triggers a link.

I'm creating a dhtml site and want to maintain consisitency with OS, and
have some fine tuning.

aka having ones cake and eating it.

thanks
