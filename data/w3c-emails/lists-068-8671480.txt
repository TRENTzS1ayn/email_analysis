Have used trackball, looking for software approach for dhtml

ie is it a recognised standard across graphical browsers that a left click
followed by a pixel move indicates drag whereas a mouseup without pixel move
equals a link.

basically I've yet to find a dhtml program that drags objects that are links
to external content.
It looks like I might have to write this 'from scratch', and I'd like to
start from the right premise.

short code sample:
<div id="pussy" style="position:absolute; width:32px; height:32px;
z-index:1; left: 75px; top: 250px">
<img src="images/pussy.gif" width=32 height=32 border=0 alt="Top Cat">
</div>

this is draggable, however if I add:
<div id="pussy" style="position:absolute; width:32px; height:32px;
z-index:1; left: 75px; top: 250px">
<a href="http://www.peepo.com/">
<img src="images/pussy.gif" width=32 height=32 border=0 alt="Top Cat">
</a>
</div>
it now is not draggable but does have a working link.
probably this is due to my capturing events incorrectly, and I'm looking
into a workaround.
I still have to figure out how to differentiate, and time could be an option
ie quick = link.

do we have any info on this...
