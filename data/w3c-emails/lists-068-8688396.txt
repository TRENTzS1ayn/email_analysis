Although these particular icons aren't proposed for specific sections of 
WCAG 2 I thought that the details of how she designed them and the icons 
themselves would be of interest to our "deliberations". Any comments should 
either go to her or if to the list, copy to her.

>I've just designed a set of icons to indicate three different versions of

>and dark backgrounds, as well as patterned backgrounds (using simple solid 
>highlight and shadow effects that should set them apart from any 
>background); either white (GIF) or the lower-left pixel color (BMP) should 
>be transparent; if transparency is not supported they should just have a 
>white background. Using both color and symbols, they should also "work" 
>for someone who is totally color blind. All icons share the same 
>(16-color) palette, while the colors are all from the "web safe" palette 
>(I think).

>"strict" - the icon has two black arrows pointing inwards re-STRICT-ing a 
>green ("safe") area in the middle;
>"transitional" - a reddish ("deprecated") area on the left and a green 
>("safe") area on the right, and a little space in-between; over that a 
>black arrow from the deprecated into the safe area;
>"frameset" - a rectangle divided into three "frames", each with a reddish 
>interior; two different shades used to make it a little more visually 
>interesting.

>Any comments appreciated! And as far as I'm concerned, they're in the 
>public domain now (let me know if you'd like the different sizes or image 
>formats and I'll publish them on my web site).
