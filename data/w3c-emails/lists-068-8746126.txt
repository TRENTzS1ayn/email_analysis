These are my thoughts.

The work that Paul Bowman did is excellent, and stands on it's own.
And, I think that Wendy's analogies are clear and understandable.
So, in an attempt NOT to reinvent the wheel................

With my Glossary hat on.......We (the WAI) clearly need to come to terms
with our terms for the different disabilities.
Rather than the four that Paul used, I used the seven that Judy has listed
in her "How People with Disabilities use the Web" (Working Draft 4 January
2001: http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/PWD-Use-Web/Overview.html).  Perhaps
we should defer to EO on these definitions, they seem to have a greater
number of knowledgeable folks whom, I assume, agreed to those seven
disability categories.

And for continuity across all the WAI documents we should be using the same
language, and be on the same page.....
So, for the moment, until the exact number of disabilities is agreed on
**** I will cross post this to xtech *****
I have linked many of the specific disabilities to Judy's, scenario
individuals, in the EO doc.

My mock WCAG 2.0 doc with a modified version of Wendy and Pauls structure is
here:
 http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/intro20.html
I will try to fill in the wording content for the intro with a shorter
version of Wendy and Pauls verbiage, but it is 5:20 am and like a fool I
waited until the last minute to do this, and Paul's URL hasn't worked all
night, so I assume he is working on it as well.  I had planned on cutting
and pasting instead of retyping it all.  I HATE typing..........Katie
