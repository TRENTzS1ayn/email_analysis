Note:  I have added information to the meeting page for the F2F [1].

To arrange a hotel at the CWI discounted price, please contact Wilmy van 
Ojik at wilmy@cwi.nl. I also listed 3 other sites that you may use to book 
hotels in Amsterdam.

Are there any questions about the meeting page?  Information I have missed? 
Let me know!
