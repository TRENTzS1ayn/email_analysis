Subject:natural language checkpoint for WCAG2 GL1

<PROPOSED>
Define the natural language of each document. Indicate changes in the
natural language declared for a document using appropriate markup.
</PROPOSED>

i would also suggest that we accept the following definitions from UAAG
(source http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010411/)

   Natural language
          Natural language is spoken, written, or signed human language
          such as French, Japanese, and American Sign Language. On the
          Web, the natural language of content may be specified by markup
          or HTTP headers. Some examples include the "lang" attribute in
          HTML 4 ([HTML4] section 8.1), the "xml:lang" attribute in XML
          1.0 ([XML], section 2.12), the HTML 4 "hreflang" attribute for
          links in HTML 4 ([HTML4], section 12.1.5), the HTTP
          Content-Language header ([RFC2616], section 14.12) and the
          Accept-Language request header ([RFC2616], section 14.4). See
          also the definition of script.

   Script
          In this document, the term "script" almost always refers to a
          scripting (programming) language used to create dynamic Web
          content. However, in checkpoints referring to the written
          (natural) language of content, the term "script" is used as in
          Unicode [UNICODE] to mean "A collection of symbols used to
          represent textual information in one or more writing systems."
