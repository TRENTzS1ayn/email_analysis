I would be careful about using "processing impairments".  There are more
cognitive impairments than just processing.  Memory for one.

AVR: You may want to fix the following. Please let me know if you disagree -
1.2: "cognitive impairments" is too narrow. I suggest "processing
impairments", so that attention deficits are included.
PB: I understand what you're saying, but I wonder if there isn't a more
understandable way of saying it. "Mental processing impairment" maybe?
"Cognitive processing impairments"? And, to my way of thinking, although I'm
sure others would disagree, attention deficits can be included under the
term "cognitive", even without the word "processing." The act of processing
information is a cognitive act, isn't it? Even if the word "cognitive" seems
slanted away from attention deficits, I think that the word "processing"
slants too far towards it and away from other types.
