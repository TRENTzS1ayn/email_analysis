Added the new 1.5 proposed checkpoint after an agreement on the terminology
by Gregory, Gregg and Katie.  Please comment.
Corrected the "languages" to "technologies" in the "Changes from WCAG 1.0"
section
Merged Wendy and Pauls opening introduction under "Purpose"
Changed the "Individuals With Disabilities" categories under "Who
Benefits?", based on discussions with Gregg V.  He will be sending that list
to Xtech, EO, GL, AU, & Trace Lists for feedback, to help us define our
disabilities verbiage.
Still working on it of course........ http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/intro20.html
