How about

"Using appropriate markup, identify the natural language of content".

It is not clear, in a world of pluggable and customised web pages, what is
"the document" anyway. So the technique relevant is to identify the main
language of a piece of content, and if there are parts of it in another
language or languages to identify those individually.

  aloha, gregg!

  while i'm not sure that, in this instance, a one-sentence distillation of my
  2 sentence proposal would be any clearer, and since--as you all too well
  know--terseness isn't exactly my strong suit, i may not be the right person
  to ask to whittle my proposal down, but here goes anyway...

  submitted for your (collective approval) are 2 re-iterations of my original
  proposal, which i have also included here, marked as PROPOSED1:

  <PROPOSED1>
  Define the natural language of each document. Indicate changes in the
  natural language declared for a document using appropriate markup.
  </PROPOSED1>

  <PROPOSED2>
  Using appropriate markup, define the natural language of each
  document, indicating any changes.
  </PROPOSED2>

  <PROPOSED3>
  Define the natural language of each document, and indicate any
  changes within the document, using appropriate markup.
  </PROPOSED3>

  personally, if i had to choose, i'd choose PROPOSED2 -- the more i re-listen
  to it, the more it allays my initial reluctance about combination of the 2
  requirements into a single statment, especially as i don't think you have to
  be a loose constructionist to read PROPOSED2 as extending to the indication
  of changes in natural language as a result of user activity, such as, say,
  following a link whose target resource has been referentially marked, using
  an 'hreflang'-type mechanism, as being encoded in a different natural
  language...

  gregory.
