If people would like to book a room through CWI, note that you must send 
them a note by the end of the day Monday.

CWI will try to get rooms through a booking agent.

It's my understanding that Amsterdam is very popular this time of year and 
that rooms are scarce.  We are not guaranteed that the booking agent will 
be successful, in which case we all might be on our own for booking hotel 
rooms.

If you have not already sent your information, please send the following 
information to w3c-netherlands@w3.org:
your name
the date and time you arrive in Amsterdam
how many nights you require a hotel room in Amsterdam

Thank you,
