Hmmmm.  Interesting.  But I like the other wording that was proposed
(Gregory's  and Katie's).    I don't think that one would consider a two
word phrase in French as being another piece of content.  And I don't think
you should have to re-label the text that follows (where it returns to
English) as being English.

I would vote that we go with Gregory's last version.

I've added the following to the draft:
   <dt class="toc" id="markup-lang">1.5 Using appropriate markup, identify
the natural language of content.</dt>
   <dd>Since a document is made up of several pieces of content, if the
language differs between pieces, they should each be marked up.</dd>
