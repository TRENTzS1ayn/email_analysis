I don't see that this scenario changes for Gregory's version, where you have
to label changes. Per esempio if someone uses fancy terms in a foreign
language, and marks them up, they can easily enough be auto-translated (and
are likely to be amenable to such) for easier comprehension.

Unfortunately in the guidelines context I don't think there is a level of
content where it doesn't matter if people can't use it. (In some
implementations a decision like this may be taken, but that is outside our
scope).

  Hmmmm.  Interesting.  But I like the other wording that was proposed
  (Gregory's  and Katie's).    I don't think that one would consider a two
  word phrase in French as being another piece of content.  And I don't think
  you should have to re-label the text that follows (where it returns to
  English) as being English.

  I would vote that we go with Gregory's last version.

  I've added the following to the draft:
     <dt class="toc" id="markup-lang">1.5 Using appropriate markup, identify
  the natural language of content.</dt>
     <dd>Since a document is made up of several pieces of content, if the
  language differs between pieces, they should each be marked up.</dd>
