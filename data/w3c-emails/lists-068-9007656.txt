Sorry, you misunderstood.

I wasn't suggesting that any text NOT be marked.   Gregory's version asks
that all changes be marked no matter how small.    But the wording sounds
like "mark the content --- and mark any changes from that".  Which is what I
think we want.

The version Wendy proposed sounds like.  "mark each block of content with
the appropriate language"  which sounds like you would mark  English at the
beginning of a page and then say "End English" just before the two words of
French.  Then mark the French as start and stop.  Then mark the following
English as start English  (unless you nested the language tags).   This is
not of course what is intended so I thought Gregory's text sounded better
because it sounded more like what was actually done.

I don't see that this scenario changes for Gregory's version, where you have
to label changes. Per esempio if someone uses fancy terms in a foreign
language, and marks them up, they can easily enough be auto-translated (and
are likely to be amenable to such) for easier comprehension.

Unfortunately in the guidelines context I don't think there is a level of
content where it doesn't matter if people can't use it. (In some
implementations a decision like this may be taken, but that is outside our
scope).

  Hmmmm.  Interesting.  But I like the other wording that was proposed
  (Gregory's  and Katie's).    I don't think that one would consider a two
  word phrase in French as being another piece of content.  And I don't
think
  you should have to re-label the text that follows (where it returns to
  English) as being English.

  I would vote that we go with Gregory's last version.

  I've added the following to the draft:
     <dt class="toc" id="markup-lang">1.5 Using appropriate markup, identify
  the natural language of content.</dt>
     <dd>Since a document is made up of several pieces of content, if the
  language differs between pieces, they should each be marked up.</dd>
