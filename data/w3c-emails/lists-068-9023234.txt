I suggested the addition of content modes to Gudeline 4.1 as a
possible way of dealing with the vowel mark problem in Hebrew and
Arabic, which was brought to our attention by Lisa Seeman (vowel marks
are required to support screen reading in user agents, and for
accessibility to people with limited reading ability.) If there
is no objection, I would like to see Gudeline 4.1 updated as follows:

4.1 Choose content modes, languages, API's, and protocols that support
the use of these guidelines.
Content modes (e.g. Hebrew with and without vowel marks,)
markup languages, multimedia formats, software interface
standards, etc., vary in their support of accessibility. When
choosing which technologies and content modes to use, consider
how easy it is apply these guidelines. Where feasible, favor
content modes and technologies that:
* support assistive technology in user agents;
* permit equivalents to be associated with or synchronized
  with auditory, graphical, and multimedia content;
* allow the logical structure of the content to be defined
  independently of presentation;
* support device-independence;
* are documented in published specifications and can be
  implemented by user agent and assistive technology
  developers.

Context matters. Seldom does *anything* have only one cause.
