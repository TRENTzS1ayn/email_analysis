  I suggested the addition of content modes to Gudeline 4.1 as a
  possible way of dealing with the vowel mark problem in Hebrew and
  Arabic, which was brought to our attention by Lisa Seeman (vowel marks
  are required to support screen reading in user agents, and for
  accessibility to people with limited reading ability.) If there
  is no objection, I would like to see Gudeline 4.1 updated as follows:

  4.1 Choose content modes, languages, API's, and protocols that support
  the use of these guidelines.
  Content modes (e.g. Hebrew with and without vowel marks,)
  markup languages, multimedia formats, software interface
  standards, etc., vary in their support of accessibility. When
  choosing which technologies and content modes to use, consider
  how easy it is apply these guidelines. Where feasible, favor
  content modes and technologies that:
  * support assistive technology in user agents;
  * permit equivalents to be associated with or synchronized
    with auditory, graphical, and multimedia content;
  * allow the logical structure of the content to be defined
    independently of presentation;
  * support device-independence;
  * are documented in published specifications and can be
    implemented by user agent and assistive technology
    developers.
