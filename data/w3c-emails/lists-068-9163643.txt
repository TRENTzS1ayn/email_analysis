   Hi Eugina,

  Sorry for being so long in responding, Frankly, I was hoping others would
respond since I am not active in the Guideline working group.

  Title on the INPUT elements is, like the LABEL element, a technique for a
guideline, not itself a guideline (or checkpoint). But it is a "strong"
technique since it is included in the checkpoint as a "for example." I would
think that if the major user agents are supporting title on input elements,
then it would be a technique suggested for the appropriate guideline.

    Does anyone know if this recommendation of TITLE in INPUT will be part
of the WCAG 2.0 guidelines? Changes to the BOBBY software by CAST will be
done based on those quideslines. If not, how do I go about getting it in
place as a guideline?

    thanks,
    Eugenia

      Thanks Jim. I've also tried a 5.5 version and couldn't duplicate the
"blinking" text. I'm going with TITLE in my input fields as well as SCOPE on
my td tags. HPR seems to do very well with the SCOPE even if the TITLE
ability isn't turned on. JAWS doesn't like my form page at all. It gets
stuck on the first line. I hope that the update/patch will correct this. I
haven't tried Window-eyes. Have you tested it against my form page?

        I haven't experienced the "blinking" that Jim Allan talked about. I
wonder how serious it is. The sighted user moves the mouse to one of the
input areas and starts typing. What happens. Does the title keep popping up?

        I forgot that I had 5.5 on a different computer and tried it there.
Sometimes the title pops up and disappears. It does not continue blinking. I
think this is not a problem.

        The title for input areas is such a good solution to a tough
problem. I have a simplified version of Eugenia's form at
(http://jimthatcher.com/SimpleFormWithTitles.htm). It is also the form I
advocate at the end of the section on accessible forms in the ITTATC Web
Accessibility Course (http://jimthatcher.com/webcourse8.htm). I would like
to hear what others feel about the "blinking concern" in IE 5.5 title popup.

        After discussion with the JFW developer yesterday, it is definite
that support for titles will be in a soon to be released update/patch. As I
mentioned before, HPR will support the title attribute and Window-Eyes
already does support it.

          I want to apologize for the other message earlier today about
question between ALT and TITLE,
          somehow I managed to miss Al's posting on 4/25 about ALT not
displaying. Thank  you Al. I am
          concerned about Jim's find of the blinking test with a title
attribute on IE 5.5. That isn't occuring in
          IE 5.0 or NN 6.0. But I really don't want blinking text since
that's a whole other issue. Sounds like
          I'm stuck again. ALT doesn't work. TITLE is blinking in IE 5.5.
LABEL can't handle it. So if I fix
          the form with TITLE and SCOPE which seems to work great with
Homepage Reader, then I
          make it blink for IE 5.5 users. I realize that the TITLE won't
show up as a tool tip popup for NN
          4.x or some other browsers. That really doesn't worry me. If
someone can "see" the form then the
          popup mouseover isn't necessary (actually I would rather it not be
there at all - especially if it
          blinks!). ALT doesn't popup but the screen readers aren't reading
it. So suggestions? How is this
          handled in the future?

          Eugenia

            I checked out Eugenia's page and found a curious phenomena...
            In IE 5.5 when I put the mouse over an INPUT the tool tip does
pop up but
            FLASHES on and off. This was very distracting. (seems to flash
at 2 times
            the speed of the cursor blink, it flashes when the cursor is in
an INPUT or
            when no INPUT as a cursor in it).
            In Netscape 4.7 nothing is displayed
            In Opera 5.1 nothing is displayed.

              Contrary to what I previously thought, I now have evidence
that the ALT
            attribute on INPUT will not show up using IE 5.5 and Window-Eyes
4.0.

              So as of now it would appear that the technique that looks
best is to use
            TITLE on the INPUT, at very least where, as in Eugenia's case,
there is no
            suitable LABEL content already showing somewhere on the page.
And Thatch's
            advice is to ignore LABEL and just TITLE it anyway.
