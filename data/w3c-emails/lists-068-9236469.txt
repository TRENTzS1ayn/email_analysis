Although PF is "member-private" the Working Draft of XMLGL is public
http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/XML/gl-20010508
so I'm not violating any trust by quoting its Checkpoint:

1.1 Provide a mechanism to explicitly associate alternative equivalents for 
content or content fragments. [p1]

Which comes under its Guideline:

1.0 Ensure that authors can associate multiple media objects as alternatives

The sense expressed in the phrase "multiple media objects" is IMO much more 
fitting/general for WCAG 2's Checkpoint 1.1 intent than the current "text 
equivalent for all non-text content".
