Hello all,

As I mentioned a few weeks ago at a teleconference, I've been looking for a 
graphic designer to help us illustrate the working draft of WCAG 2.0.  I 
began discussing possibilities with one person last week, Meg.

She put together a page that shows icons and screen shots she has designed 
for other clients.  This gives an idea of her style.  It is at: 
http://www.digitalmeg.com/wcag/

I was thinking she could create icons for each checkpoint and guideline to 
help illustrate the concepts.  If someone clicked on the icon they would 
get a larger image of it, more detailed.  I sent her Anne's work, but we 
haven't had a chance to discuss it yet.

I'll be talking with her again this week, any questions you would like me 
to ask her?

My proposal:
I'll ask her to illustrate checkpoint 1.1 to see what she comes up 
with.  We can then talk about it.

Thoughts?
