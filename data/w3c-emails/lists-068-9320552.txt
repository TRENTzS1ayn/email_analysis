Wendy,

You can share a new page showing the illustrations I used to build the web
site illustration - she may find them of use in planning her work.

http://www.erols.com/stevepem/guidelines/G3/illustrations.html

in addition to the rest of the illustrations on 

http://www.erols.com/stevepem/guidelines/G3/g3.html

I, too, very much like the work she has shown us, and hope that she will
take the challenge to apply her skills to the whole of the guidelines ... I
will be happy to assist as needed.

Anne
