William,

I agree with much of what they say, but wonder how many "retarded" people
will recognize the term "cognitively disabled" as describing themselves.
Mostly, they describe themselves as "not smart", "slow" and sometimes
"special ed" depending on their age. It's a decision whether to apply the
terms people use to describe themselves, or what they are called by others.
And these folks may describe themselves in different words in different
parts of the country/world ... !
