That is fast becoming "when we include icons" - thankfully - and in the 
usual sense "professionally" definitely matters. I might be competent to 
vote on icon choices but clearly will never "do" any. Earcons, maybe, since 
I've been in that general field in the past, but there likely aren't really 
any professional "earconists" - yet!
