Hi folks,

I'm looking for a good example of the implementation of checkpoint 11.4,
please read below for the checkpoint description. If you know of a good
example, would you please forward me the URL(s)?

Thanks,
Jenae Andershonis

If, after best efforts, you cannot create an accessible page, provide a
link to an alternative page that uses W3C technologies, is accessible,
has equivalent information (or functionality), and is updated as often
as the inaccessible (original) page.
