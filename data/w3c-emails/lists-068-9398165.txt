Bruce,

    First of all, while William is working with earcons, I have not worked
with icons. I have worked with illustrations. There is a world of
difference in them, both as to use and in how they are made. Icons would
require drawing skills I don't have and/or software and hardware that I
don't have. As I thought about what was needed to illustrate Guideline 3, I
hit on the idea of showing the pages with sections marked, which I could do
with what I had available. 

Icons are useful a quick reference marks in the content and are used to
find pertinent sections of content, while the illustrations share the same
purpose 
as the text content. The same icon may appear in many places, but an
illustration would be specific to a certain text content. 

I do agree that the W3C icons should be in the smallest color palette that
they can use. Yes, the icons, after they have been developed and approved,
should be done in SVG. If they can be developed in SVG that would save
time, but I don't know if Meg has the software and skill yet to work in SVG
from the git-go. Since her web page shared her comparisons of gif and jpg,
I suspect she may not be ready to create in SVG. I'm not sure of the
benefits of PNG ...

Anne
