"could" is one of those seemingly usable words that bring out a tendency to 
temporize. In CSS there are audio flavorings but they are essentially 
unimplemented and also clearly thought of as speech mechanisms. We use them 
as "system event markers" but seldom (as in never?) in a Web context. It's 
something that will happen, so I guess they "could be made available" - 
they just aren't in any practical sense.

Like the now popular practice of using "skins" to personalize stuff on 
one's own system, they will probably be like the "sounds" selections for 
system events for a long time to come - if they ever get started.

T.V. Raman's emacspeak environment makes them part of a desktop scene but 
that's essentially another planet.
