Hence the Device Independent Activity (and Working Group) within W3C where 
the same song is sung repeatedly. It's also a fact that the i18n activity 
is faced with a lot of these problems.

The possibility of repurposing in this "medium" is stronger than in the 
examples Matt cites (TV, newspapers, magazines), but it will remain 
divisive. I believe that if we are to claim that there even can be alt-text 
but deny that there can be alt-illustration we will find ourselves with 
endless (and IMO justifiable) complaints about our opacity/hypocrisy.

And the fact that the "original" design of HTML was for academicians is 
barely even of interest.

Text is not sacred.
