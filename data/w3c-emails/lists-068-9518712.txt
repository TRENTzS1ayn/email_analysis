aloha, wendy!

first of all, i have to say that the WCAG2 issues list is a thing of
beauty...  and then quickly add that that opening line was not a setup for
the rest of this emessage!

my proposal, as amended in response to gregg's request for conflation, and
which i, too, vastly prefer to my first iteration, is:

<PROPOSED>
Using appropriate markup, define the natural language of each
document, indicating any changes.
</PROPOSED>

the reference is:

i also find anne's terse restatement of my proposal,

<ANNE>
Identify the natural language of each document and mark up any changes.
</ANNE>

quite intriguing, although i think the "using appropriate markup" bit is
extremely important, so that, for example, people don't use JavaScript cued
to OnMouseOver to provide an implementation-specific simulation of what can
be done in an accessible/interoperable manner using Ruby... i'm still not
sure whether we should say just say "document and/or document fragment", but
then, wouldn't fragments pulled into a document already be covered by the
marking up any changes bit?
