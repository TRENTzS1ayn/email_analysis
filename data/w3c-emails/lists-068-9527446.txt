It may be worth checking out some of the work that widget software have 
done around symbols. They have a web page at http://www.widgit.com/

While symbols are not the answer for everyone (you often need to learn 
what they mean!), they may be a useful resource. It is also worth noting 
that the people I work with often prefer photos to symbols

Widgit have graphic designers who have been producing symbols for many 
years.

Cheers
