Adam,

It would be helpful to cite the URL when describing a situation you wish
to bring  to folks' attention. 

Also, it's counter productive to write guidelines that suggest eliminating
content used and valued by some in order to accommodate some others. Those
who prefer to use the stuff you want eliminated are more likely to include
the desired content and ignore accessibility if you don't say HOW to
include, instead of to eliminate.
