The notion that text doesn't have a really high potential for 
misinterpretation is IMO incorrect. Much of our lives in personal/social 
interactions centers around attempts to correct such cross-talk.

Language is a wonderful thing but interpretation, particularly in 
translations (repurposing) is very prolific. Even the testimony of "eye 
witnesses" is repeatedly shown to be questionable. The way we cling to the 
idea that text is sacred, even while saying we know it's not is revelatory.
