Adam,

   You repeated an oft-quoted comment that more and more, I question.

   Do flickering web pages cause seizures? Has it ever happened, even once? 

   The reason I ask is because my husband had to give up welding as his first out-of-school job because of a seizure that was blamed on the exposure on the job. He sometimes "feels" the pre-seizure feeling when driving down a street with sunlight coming through the bare trunks of a wooded patch. But even that level of blinking has never actually caused a seizure (perhaps because he usually does something to block it, moving a sun visor, etc.) 

    So I wonder if this note in the guidelines is based on hard evidence that seizures have been induced by web page flickers, flashes, etc, or is it just a precaution for something that "could" happen! If it is just a precaution and a seizure has never actually been reported, I wonder if it isn't being given undue importance to be included as a note in the guidelines. There are so many other things that actually do impede usability of the web that I'm not sure we need to splash notes on things that don't.

                       Anne
