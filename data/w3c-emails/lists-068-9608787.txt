We have been fairly loose with our terms.  Webster defines illustration as:
"an example or instance that helps make something clear" or "a picture or
diagram that helps make something clear or attractive".  Icon is defined as
"a sign (as a word or graphic symbol) whose form suggests its meaning" or "a
graphic symbol on a computer display screen that suggests the purpose of an
available function".  I think your work
<http://users.erols.com/stevepem/guidelines/G3/g3.html> is closer to being
"iconic" than illustrative.  The only image that comes close to being an
illustration is <http://users.erols.com/stevepem/guidelines/G3/pageset.gif>

As I wrote before
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2001AprJun/0371.html> I
think your prototype example is great, but the images largely fail as
"illustrations" because they are not IMHO useful unless one is already quite
comfortable with the concepts and content they refer to.  The tools used for
creating icons are the same as those used for other graphics.

As I argued earlier, this is all your "illustrations" are doing.  They are
visual bookmarks that are helpful to people who are already familiar with
the material.

I agree that this is the purpose of illustrations.  I don't think you have
achieved that, except with <pageset.gif>.  BTW, the WAI documents are not
completely bereft of good illustration.  Consider, for example:
<http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-TECHS/#def-ascii-art>
<http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-TECHS/#def-braille>
<http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#travel-report-longdesc>

Icons might only be used once.  This is often true for icons that represent
specific applications, for example.  (Icons representing documents are
frequently re-used.)

It's not enough that the palette be small -- is should also be (perhaps a
sub-set of the) standard.  I will leave it to Wendy to decide if the format
should be gif/png/svg/bmp (or some combination).  I brought the issue up
just as a reminder.  I would not be so bold as to assume that Meg is not
comfortable with SVG.  She espoused so articulately on the differences
between gif and jpeg, I would be inclined to believe her conversant with
other related subtleties.  My understanding is that Adobe Illustrator
already supports SVG, and I am sure there are others, so why wait?

I agree with both of these points.

It is interesting that our experience of surfing the web is so different.  I
regularly encounter plenty of photographs, graphical rules and bullets,
decoration, graphical text, and clip art.  There is also the occasional line
drawing, but most of these would seem to be scanned from paper.  Good
original graphics (except for textual buttons and banner logos) are the
domain of well financed (primarily commercial) sites.  The only "mom and
pop" type shops I have seen that are exceptions to this are the small
business (like Meg or Widgit) that are in the field of graphic art!  If I am
wrong about this, please send me four links to counter examples.  Let's keep
such a discussion off-list however!  (We can get back to the list with our
findings if you like.)

Someone (my apologies for forgetting who) recently pointed out that we all
start drawing before we start writing.  That we abandon such pursuits is
probably cultural, but the fact of the matter is that graphical talent
(especially that which translates well to the computer screen) is extremely
thin.  Almost all of us using writing as part of our work life.  How many of
us routinely create drawings as part of our jobs?

I would expect that Wendy has suggested someone who already knows something
about accessibility!

This aspect of the process has been valuable.

We find that we need to paying someone from the outside to provide this
aspect of the work.  This is telling.  The development of the standards was
largely voluntary.  One of the principle tenets of accessibility is that it
doesn't cost much (or anything) -- if incorporated into the original design
and planning.  Retro-fitting -- repairing problems -- is expensive.  Lack of
foresight is usually costly.  No where (in WCAG1) is the suggestion made
that audio or multimedia should be added to web sites!

This is hardly a straw man.  It is a frequent complaint that there are NO
highly-graphical sites which model all P2 checkpoints.  Should WAI provide
such a model?  Is it better to demonstrate (as the current WAI site does)
that accessibility can be achieved at no measurable cost?  Well funded
organization can buy afford to add accessibility if they can afford a
graphically rich site.  The implied message that accessibility means hiring
professional may be counter productive.

I would like to see thoughtful discussion on the question on "when" versus
"if".  I don't think that has yet happened.  Mostly we have been exploring
just the feasibility of such a project.  Just because we can do something
doesn't mean we should do it!  I am very much looking forward to Meg's first
cut at this.  Like Lisa, and probably most others on this list, I too what
to know the limits of what can be done.

As I and others have pointed out repeatedly:  NO ONE knows how to
systematically explain how to make alternatives for text!
