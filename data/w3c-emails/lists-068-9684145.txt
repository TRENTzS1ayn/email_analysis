The problem is that in NT, dynamically loadable libraries (DLLs)
are shared among applications, and many application distributions
include non-standard replacements for standard DLLs. Thus it is
possible that you have installed an application which includes a
DLL that is not compatible with shockwave.

This is really an architecture-level defect in NT (and W2000 etc.)
In Unix/Linux, LD_LIBRARY_PATH is a per-process variable, so that this
sort of thing cannot happen. There is no fix in NT/W2000 short of
scrapping Microsoft's defective architecture.

Context matters. Seldom does *anything* have only one cause.
