Adam,

Something was wrong with your link to the dell site. It came up page not
found.

I did check the other site, linked to the British Epilepsy organization,
and found the following note on the first page: 

>Visual display units (VDUs) 
>
>Contrary to public belief, the use of professional VDUs rarely presents
any risk to the person with epilepsy. However, the use of domestic
televisions as computer displays is likely to present a greater risk.
People using televisions as computer or computer games displays should view
at a distance of 2.5 metres or more. 
>

Seems there may not be any relativity to these types of seizures with
computer monitors unless they are TV's ...

I'd like to suggest that the note about flicker and seizures be removed
from the guidelines until and unless any hard data on it can be found. 

And repeat again, that the term "eliminate" is excessively heavy and not
well supported in documentation anyway. 

Anne
