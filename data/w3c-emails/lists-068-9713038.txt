Adam,

Thanks for a good explanation. If I could figure out what applications
have the problematic DLLs, I could choose to run those on certain machines
leaving the others available to shockwave. As I said, the problem doesn't
happen on machines running W98, only on the ones with NT. 

Unix or Linux isn't, to my experience, a useful substitute because it
doesn't run the software we need to use.

Anne
