I think that this could use a bit of rewording, but it is basicaly sound and
I like it. (The word I didn't like was eliminate).

  My apology for poor style in what I just posted. Please replace with
  the following:

  2.4 Do not limit the time that a user may need to understand or
  interact with your content.  Eliminate:
  * demands that the user respond within a preset period
  * automatic refresh and delayed redirection
  * flicker, blinking, flashing, self-scrolling, and any
    other animation effects that can't be disabled by the user.
  Content must cooperate with user agent mechanisms for preventing
  motion, or for control of the rate at which it occurs. Note that
  flicker effects can cause seizures in people with photoepilepsy.

  Context matters. Seldom does *anything* have only one cause.
