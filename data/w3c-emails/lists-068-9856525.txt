The page which contains the timeout that prompted me to attempt a
revision of Guideline 2.4 is now

http://www.dell.com/us/en/dfb/default.htm

The text announcing the time-out is:

"Due to the high demand and limited quantity of our available
products, your selection(s) will be removed from your cart
after 15 minutes of inactivity."

I have re-written my proposed update of Guideline 2.4 to reflect
discussion on the list.

2.4 Do not limit the time that a user may need to understand or
interact with your content.
* Avoid demands that the user respond within a preset period.
* Use automatic refresh and delayed redirection only when
  necessary to bring superceded content up to date.
* Content must cooperate with user agent mechanisms for
  preventing motion (including flicker, blinking, flashing,
  self-scrolling etc) and for control of the rate at which
  it occurs. Note that flicker effects can cause seizures in
  people with photoepilepsy.

Context matters. Seldom does *anything* have only one cause.
