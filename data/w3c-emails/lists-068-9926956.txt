I tend to agree with this, and do not think the proposal should slide
through without further examination. I don't think this has been discussed
from the viewpoint of those who see it as necessary (Why is Dell doing it?
They've said it's to manage inventory ... is that unreasonable? How much
time is enough? When does a site become vulnerable to mischief-makers who
can manipulate inventory by playing with shopping carts? Is there a better
way for Dell to accomplish their goal?)
