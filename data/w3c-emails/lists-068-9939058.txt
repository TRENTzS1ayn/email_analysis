What should be on the agenda for the upcoming face to face meeting?

As a reminder, please note that registration closes on 8 June.

It has already been established that the authoring tools working group (AU
WG) will be meeting jointly with our HTML techniques sub-group to discuss
open issues of mutual concern. Apart from this, what do you think should
be on the agenda?
