I suggest that the group look carefully at the 'until user agents'
checkpoints in WCAG 1.0 and attempt to give some guidance as to which of
these are still required. (Note that as well as discussion, this will require
some work to be done in advance. But it is an important issue for people
currently working on producing accessible content).

If there are outstanding questions of interpreting WCAG 1.0 it would also be
helpful to work on resolving those.

cheers

  What should be on the agenda for the upcoming face to face meeting?

  As a reminder, please note that registration closes on 8 June.

  It has already been established that the authoring tools working group (AU
  WG) will be meeting jointly with our HTML techniques sub-group to discuss
  open issues of mutual concern. Apart from this, what do you think should
  be on the agenda?
