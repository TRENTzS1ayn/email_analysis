Accessibility is such a huge area where we all have a lot to learn and the 
related research is evolving all the time. For instance, many of the 
arguments on the list made me read some of the latest research on 
perception, attention etc. and also refresh my memory on some old stuff 
again and I still feel I need more. I like it when people explain both 
their opinions/hypothesis and also try to see what kinds of research 
questions there might be that they feel needs to be checked.

I wonder if it would help the discussions to mark the issues that possibly 
need additional research in a more detailed way and gather them to a list 
as research problems. Then as part of the research & development efforts we 
could try to increase our knowledge by finding experts beyond the 
participants of this group to come and talk about their research fields and 
possible solutions for the research problems to specific teleconferences. 
They might find good research questions to study and we might learn more.
