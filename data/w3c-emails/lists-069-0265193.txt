Kynn,

         I hate to be the one to say it, but this is exactly what I said 
would happen when I first came on this list two years ago, and now it is 
happening. Not just in Texas, but on the site the feds are making for how 
to's - it is stated that these accommodations are aimed at the visually 
impaired disabled.

         We really need to put and end to the bickering and name calling. 
Yes I reply in kind when my name is used or implied. And I really have not 
enjoyed the past few weeks with some new guys on the list who instigated 
another fight over the rights of certain disabled folks to be 
accommodated.  Each time we waste a week or two letting the new guys spout 
off and pick on Anne, we lose another week of solving the real problems.

         Today we report back to work for the new school year, and my time 
to waste arguing comes to an end. What is my argument?   To include the 
cognitively disabled in the guidelines? Is that such a bad thing? Seems to 
have been. Now it's clear we may have missed the chance to include these 
folks in government guidelines (when accessible government sites are the 
most important and least useful at present) ... It's looking like my time 
with W3C has been mostly wasted....

         Thanks, Kynn, for bringing this to our attention.

                                                 Anne
