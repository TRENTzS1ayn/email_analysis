Matt, the W3C has had the issue of cognitive disabilities before them for 
two years. Probably longer, but I've been here two years. Progress has been 
impeded by the number of new members who had difficulty accepting that the 
need was addressable. The most obvious and simple solution - to provide 
images/graphics/pictures/illustrations has been ridiculed.

Really, I don't think that "understanding" the other disabilities is much 
of an excuse. Understanding those disabilities and the needs and obstacles 
they face should be the responsibility of everyone working on these issues.
