"Example 5: history of Jazz.
A grandfather's hobby is listening and playing to Jazz..."

Should be "...Our grandfather's hobby is playing and listening to Jazz..."

I have *lots* to say about the current direction of the document and all

the flames were quenched. I would like to take about five minutes at the 
f2f joint meeting in Seattle for presenting.
