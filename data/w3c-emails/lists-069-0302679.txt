A) Presentation

When you have non-text
Provide text equivalents.
Text repurposes

Reveal the structure.
Logical order is good
Showing it, better

Use presentation!
Clarify and emphacize
Paint form on data

B) Interaction

Assist the users;
Allow the user control
Of access and search

Make things consistent
Consistency's a good thing
Don't confuse users

Give user control
For changing views of pages
The user laughs last

C) Comprehension

Write clear and simple
As much as appropriate
This is common sense

Break information
Into manageable chunks
Easier to use

Outline and index
Illustrate and summarize
Organize your work!

D) Technology

When writing pages
Use accessible markup
Like W3C stuff

Don't abuse markup
Follow specifications.
There for a reason

Transform gracefully
People still use old browsers
Use new, support old
