I may not have picked up on it, but have we mentioned that for many
instances images are preferred, ie buttons for toolbars and where screens
are very small, to say nothing of those examples such as airplane fitters
use, and when learning about for instance a new laptop ?

ie consider whether an illustration might enhance a text description, and
use less screen area.
