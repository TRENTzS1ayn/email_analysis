Open issue #53:

<quote>
Paul proposed a section of the Introduction called "Optimizing content for
Specific Disability Types." Should we include it in the intro? Or is it part
of the server-side scripting techniques and the "appendix" that Paul
mentioned at the June F2F (refer to WC's question to him on 23 July 2001).

I addressed this in my last email. Let's NOT include it in the introduction,
but create a separate Disability-Type Specificity techniques document, with
references to it from the Server-Side techniques document.
