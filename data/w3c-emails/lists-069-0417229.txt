Open issue #50

<quote>
Visual presentation
Paul has suggested a variety of styles to make the document easier to read.
One issue is that the checkpoints do not currently stand out well.
Gregg has suggested displaying normative info in a box with a colored
background to set it apart from informative info.

The styles that I proposed are at http://www.webaim.org/wcag/wcag2_0 (see
also the subsequent pages). This is just a rapid prototype, and subject to
change, but the most significant ideas are these:

1. Create a border and outline around each of the four main guidelines

2. Create an outline around each of the checkpoints, so that each is an
identifiable entity, with all of the pertinent definitions and examples,
etc.

I still think that this is a good idea.
