Open issue #56

Divide into separate chapters
As the document gets longer people are getting more concerned. Paul mocked
up what the document would look like in separate chapters. This is the
direction that many W3C specs are taking with the first page only containing
front matter and a table of contents.

My mockup can be found at http://www.webaim.org/wcag/wcag2_0. I am still
very much in favor of this. Note the navigation at the top and bottom of
each page.
