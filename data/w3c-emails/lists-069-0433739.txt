AG:: Sure, but there is a question as to whether that's the question.

If you can win them over [with brevity and wit] on _whether_ to do it, and
your
hints can show them _how_ to do it, is it really essential to frame a
definitive statement of _what_ to do?  That's the charter; but is it our best
option?

Do we need a "real spec," or is that a formula for a papyrus dinosaur?

Iss a puzzlement.  

Better put:  What do we need _more_ at the moment?  Something more real as a
spec, or stuff that is more real as accessible web content?

Al


Note:  "Iss a puzzlement."  The King says this memorably in "The King and I." 
That's why the double 's.'
