If the document can be kept in a reasonable size, I prefer to have it all in
front of me at once (so to speak). But where it goes beyond some size I can't
quite figure out (around 40k of text, or 60k for the xhtml document?) I agree
that it is much better broken into chapters.

  Divide into separate chapters
  As the document gets longer people are getting more concerned. Paul mocked
  up what the document would look like in separate chapters. This is the
  direction that many W3C specs are taking with the first page only containing
  front matter and a table of contents.

  My mockup can be found at http://www.webaim.org/wcag/wcag2_0. I am still
  very much in favor of this. Note the navigation at the top and bottom of
  each page.
