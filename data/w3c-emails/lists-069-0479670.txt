Nope. Not really beyond the one we already had! WCAG 1.0 has already 
affected the laws of many lands and it could be argued that changing it 
much is pointless/counter-productive.

Yep. One "dinosaur" to a WG might be a good rule.

QuickTips, Tetrahedra, and Haiku. Soon rock 'n' roll or a chorale?

I once was a part of a Haiku judging team for a contest run by a San 
Francisco radio station. I was shocked when we got literally bags of 
entries. I am also quite surprised/pleased at the sudden proliferation of 
acceptably decent poems herein.

Incidentally I believe that the Haiku form, when used for "vulgar" 
(non-ephemeral) content is called "Senryu"?
