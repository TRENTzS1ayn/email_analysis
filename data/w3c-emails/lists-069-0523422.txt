I agree. Something that worked well in the AU working group was to first put
up issues that had  a proposed resolution for instant consensus. If anyone
objected to the resolution it went back on the table for the agenda, but that
way we got rid of a number of issues quite fast, and could concentrate on
what was more difficult.

Cheers

  I'd like to propose a 4th option:

  Address the easy questions first, and check them off the to-do list.  Then,
  address the complex and controversial ones, and get through as many as we
  can in the allotted time.

  I suspect that we'll be more motivated to close the difficult issues if we
  know that they are all that stands between us and publication, rather than
  having a bunch of other work still to do once they're closed.
