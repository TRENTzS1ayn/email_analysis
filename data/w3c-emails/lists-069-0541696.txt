I've updated the checkpoint mapping.  It assumes we will publish to TR on 
Friday, 24 August, 2001.  the links to a TR draft dated 24 August are 
broken since it doesn't exist yet, but I wanted the mapping and as much 
else to be in place assuming we will publish.

The *really* basic XSLT used to create it is at:
