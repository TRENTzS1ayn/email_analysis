I already did. Perhaps those of us who are in Seattle on Tuesday night (11 
September) will go to the outstanding Chinese place that Charles Munat 
correctly recommended so highly and wrap up GL in some hand-shaved noodles? 
Katie can see to it that the U.S. Government continues to respect their 
"508 ladies" and similar actions will occur all over the world. 
Legislators/administrators don't care from 1.x or 2.0! We can all write 
individual "guides to the guidelines" and pool the royalties for a really 
big party.

This will have the further side-benefit of not requiring a rewrite of ATAG 
and there'll even be enough for the UA WG to join the fun and not even 
worry about moving from "proposed" through "candidate" towards the probably 
unachievable "final" recommendation process.

As the '60s query might be paraphrased "suppose they gave a recommendation 
and nobody came?" The war was over when various regulatory entities began 
treating WCAG 1 as the marching orders for an 800 pound gorilla.

Off to the effort to make information truly ambient!
