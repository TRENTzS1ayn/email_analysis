I think having multiple optional views is a great idea.  And I don?t
think there is anything about it that would violate the W3C policy
(though we should check).

As long as the document had a default linear presentation that was
complete and which always appeared when you opened the document (so a
person couldn?t open the doc and only get a partial view by accident),
alternate views should be fine.

Having "buttons" that would cause the complete doc to collapse to more
limited views shouldn?t be a problem that I can see.

I think we can only have one version, one doc on TR though - since it
would be the normative version.  And when each person opens a doc they
should see the same thing, - at least initially.
