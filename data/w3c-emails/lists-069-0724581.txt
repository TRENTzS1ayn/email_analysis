Yes, it  was put forward aws a reason why the checkpoint was impossible. So I
went to a little bit of effort to actually demonstrate that it could be done,
and generated some non-text content to go with it. I updated the exmaple page
a bit to incude how the checkpoint might appear:

http://www.w3.org/2001/08/mmcmn/

I would like to do something better with the image, so it is clear that the
unillustrated version is not being recommended. But for that matter I would
like  to have a better image or two. The one there is what I came up with in
about an hour (which after all is a lot less time than I have put into the
text of the checkpoint, and as my original note pointed out I could have used
existing clip art if I had the appropriate software licenses, which many
people do).

  Does anyone else find it bizarre that

  "Checkpoint 3.4: Supplement text with non-text content" is not

  3.5 Annotate complex, abbreviated, or unfamiliar information with summaries
  and definitions" is annotated with definitions?

  "Do as we have done, not just as we say" should
  rule. IMO.
