Right. "The specification" has to be the same for anyone who is trying to
find the authorative version to check against. But there is no reason not to
then provide lots of helpful ways to use the information, so long as it is
clear what is a helpful partial view and what is "the normative official
one-and-only (written in US english for W3C documents) final version of the
specification to be checked against".

Even translations are not official, since if there is an error introduced in
translation it would become impossible to know which way to go.

Cheers

Charles

  I think we can only have one version, one doc on TR though - since it
  would be the normative version.  And when each person opens a doc they
  should see the same thing, - at least initially.
