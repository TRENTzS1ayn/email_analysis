Chaals,

         There is a lot of clip art on the web that is free if you are 
using it for educational rather than commercial purposes. I'm not sure it 
we'd fit under this or not. I think the Guidelines has an educational 
purpose, so perhaps we could use it. Unfortunately, I don't think we would 
find anything as specifically tailored to what we need to illustrate in 
clip art that would be as effective as what you created.

         Some possibilities to help emphasize the right way: draw a red box 
around the wrong way and put a red diagonal bar across as the international 
symbol of don't .... or make the "wrong way" picture smaller than the right 
way.

         In any event, the illustration is wonderful, and far more creative 
than I what I tried to do in the spring.

                                                 Anne
