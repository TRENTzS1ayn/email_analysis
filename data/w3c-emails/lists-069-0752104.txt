Yes, I know there are clip-art libraries that can be used. If I had more
semantic web tools I would have thought harder about searching for existing
stuff, but it seemed just as easy to make my example (it took about twice as
long as I expected though so next time I will start to think about ways of
doing it in a more re-usable fashion). Besides, this way I have no copyright
hassles at all - it is mine (published under W3C copyright rules) <grin/>.

Yes, I thought of those ways of clarifying the "do-don't" bit. I just haven't
got around to playing with the image again yet.

cheers

  Chaals,

           There is a lot of clip art on the web that is free if you are
  using it for educational rather than commercial purposes. I'm not sure it
  we'd fit under this or not. I think the Guidelines has an educational
  purpose, so perhaps we could use it. Unfortunately, I don't think we would
  find anything as specifically tailored to what we need to illustrate in
  clip art that would be as effective as what you created.

           Some possibilities to help emphasize the right way: draw a red box
  around the wrong way and put a red diagonal bar across as the international
  symbol of don't .... or make the "wrong way" picture smaller than the right
  way.
