An aside: Over the weekend hubby found a site full of animated train gifs, 
and downloaded dozens. He wanted me to add some of the animations to his 
train page, and I told him he could do it himself, and showed him how. Then 
showed him how to test it, I uploaded it, and he tested it again, decided 
it came in too slowly, and cut a few extra large animations, and liked how 
it ran then. Steve is dyslexic, photo epileptic, and one eyed with 
cataracts in the good eye. All perhaps excellent reasons for him to need to 
shy away from animations, but he loaded the page and loved the effect. I 
kept asking him if all the animations going at once was having any effect, 
and he said No most emphatically. The page he made is at 
http://www.erols.com/stevepem/Trains/Trains.html - do not visit unless you 
enjoy animations, trains, or both ... I'm not sure of my point here, except 
that perhaps we are a bit "overprotective" on the photo-epilepsy issue as 
it relates to animation (but not flicker).
