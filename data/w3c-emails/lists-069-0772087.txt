This sort of demonstrates why I think it is good to have explicit rationales,
and probably to have them in the guidelines document. (I used to be against
having them in the Guidelines documents, preferring to move as much as
possible to the techniques to keep the "normative reference" short for easier
reading)

I don't think that (except for flicker) we are concerned about animations
having any effect on people with photo-sensitive epilepsy. I was under the
impression that animations can have a very distracting effect for people with
disabilities that affect their attention to something, and that it was also
an "until user agents" type problem for some screen-reading software (for
example Tiflowin, which is a spanish screen reader, apparently froze
completely if there was an animation).
