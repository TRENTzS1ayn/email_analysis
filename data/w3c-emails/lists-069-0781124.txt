  Open issue #55

[snip]
  There are a few reasons why I think it is important to acknowledge the
  limitations of our guidelines:

  1. I believe that it will increase our credibility.
  2. It will give us something to work toward in future versions
  3. *** This is probably the most important of all: It underscores the fact
  that wrote compliance with a set of guidelines is not synonymous with
  accessibility.
