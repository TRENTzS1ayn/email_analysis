I disagree that the section in "how people with disabilities use the web"
resolves the issue for us. Although it is good informative stuff it does not
provide the critical technical details, such as whether assistive
technologies are capable of dealing with script-enabled browsers, or whether
they are equivalent in functionality for different languages.

cheers

Charles
