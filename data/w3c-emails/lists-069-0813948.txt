AG:: David has a point.  AccessKey makes assumptions about the delivery
environment in a way which is not fully device independent.  This protocol is
part of what should be reviewed before it moves forward in XHTML 2.0.  If
we're
going to tell the DI people these things have to have 'hint' status, we should
see to it that HTML plays by the rules.

Or at least I haven't understood it if there is a coherent approach to the
blending of input bindings.

The device independent methods are "comeToMe" and/or "doMeImmediate" and
the UI
bindings for these methods have scopes and have to be blendable into the
established environment of the delivery context.
