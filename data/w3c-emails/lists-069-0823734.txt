Thanks. I've augmented it so that it fits in with the 5/7/5 pattern, and
posted the whole thing to:-

   http://infomesh.net/2001/08/wcaghaiku/

because it's better referring to a Web page than it is an archived email
:-) The page comes complete with illustrations, which I blatantly copied
from William's terse WCAG 2.0 [1], because they're so cool.
