Right, any list is going to be limited in usefulness, so for development
purposes it should be possible to pick one from any number of lists (I would
be inclined to use a book by Richard Scarry, such as "libro de parole" which
has words in english, french and italian, and represents words that a lot of
people will know - mostly concrete nouns, but that's just my background...)

But I like the technique. I'll try to figure out an implementation of it.

  The reason to use the Dolch words is that they were "the definitive
  learning task" of cognitively disabled students (at least in the US) during
  the 80's thru the late 90's. These are the words that you can be "safely
  assured" that a cognitively disabled person (in the US, educated in the
  80's and 90's) will be able to read to the extent it has been possible to
  do ... I'm thinking of greeking out all words not on the Dolch list on an
  all-text page, then the same text on an illustrated page, and let the user
  see for which he can identify the topic. This may limit the usefulness of
  the example, but it's at least a starting point ....
