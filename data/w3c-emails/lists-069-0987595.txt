Hence the mantra "author proposes, user disposes".

If the user of the GL isn't as empowered by their presentation as the 
output we call upon authors to provide, I'll need another entry in the sig

transparentized obfuscation methodologies and maximize their lack of 
extraneous containments by means of minimilizations"?
