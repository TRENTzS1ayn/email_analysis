Hi,
?
This is just me musing, but I was thinking that our success criteria
seem somewhat scattered and at the best very broad.
?
When it comes to our job here, correct me if I'm wrong, we write
guidelines to ensure that people with disabilities can access the
information and functionality present in a web site.? From my
perspective, the disability they have may hinder them in one or several
of the following ways:

*  Hardware - they cannot manipulate the hardware available to the rest
   of us
*  Software - they cannot access the software available to the rest of
   us, or can only access it through another piece of software
*  Content - they cannot access the content (ie. information) available
   to the rest of us

Hardware
People with Parkinson's disease (inability to use a mouse), or people
using SAMs or joysticks. People using solely keyboards. etc.
Checkpoint examples (WCAG 1.0):
- 9.5
- 13.6
- 10.4
?
Software
People who are visually impaired (screen-readers / magnifiers). People
who manipulate style-sheets, people who a colour-blind etc.
Checkpoint examples (WCAG 1.0):
- 1.1
- 2.1
- 4.1
?
Content
People who are autistic, dyslexic etc. People who have difficulty with
all-text web sites, easily distracted by web site inconsistencies etc.
Checkpoint examples (WCAG 1.0):
- 7.1
- 14.1
- 11.4
?
I would be interested to know what people think.? They say an idea
either dies or gets stronger with criticism, so bring it on!
?
Cheers,
Gian
