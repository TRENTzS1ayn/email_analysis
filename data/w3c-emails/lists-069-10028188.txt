What the heck does "programmatically" mean? If you mean "A system, 
without human interpretation, can derive the following," then maybe 
that should be stated.

>a.      A logical, linear reading order

Why does it have to be logical? As in mathematics?

If we say "linear reading order," anyone who's been online since 1994 
is going to laugh. The Web is all about hypertext, which is 
nonlinear. I suppose we mean linear reading within a page, but even 
that is not really the rule-- one thinks of page anchors ("fragment 
identifiers" in the official nomenclature).

I think you really mean "The markup is valid, meaning that the device 
does not have to try to wade through unmatched <li> or <p> or <h> 
codes and hack together something resembling a readable document."

>c.      Relationships between elements, such as cross-references and
>associations between labels and controls

What is a cross-reference?

>d.      Emphasis

<i></i> is emphasis. So is <u></u>. So are capital letters, So are 
_various_ E-mail *methods*. Why is emphasis so important?

I think this is another case of people writing a spec that has little 
relation to real-world Web sites.
