Hi,

I posted this message to CHI-WEB.  A question that came back was how
will the web site technology handle a single URI for multiple versions
of a web page if the user doesn't allow cookies or has reached a limit
on cookies.  Did the GL committee come up with technology solutions
for this situation?

Thanks,
Scott

Hi,

The guidelines group for the Web Access Initiative (WAI) of the World
Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is considering a new consensus item on web page
accessibility:

     RE: CLIENT SIDE AND SERVER SIDE SOLUTIONS
     S1 - serving content in different forms is an acceptable way to comply
     with the guidelines as long as equivalents for all of the information
     are provided in the different forms and it is all available through the
     same URI (though it may be linked to it) (server side solutions are
     acceptable - as specified)

This is a paradigm shift from the current paradigm of having a
"one size fits all" approach towards web page accessibility
where there's a single version of a web page rather than multiple
versions as the new consensus item would provide.

I was wondering what people thought of this change in approach towards
web page accessibility.

Scott
