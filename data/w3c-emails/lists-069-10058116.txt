Not a consensus, just my opinion....

One way would be to detect that the user can't accept cookies (not
hard), and in that case send a page that links to all the different
renderings.  The user could then click the appropriate link and see the
one they want.  

Another would be store the user preference on the server, and have the
user log in to access it.

In both cases, the preference could be passed from page to page on the
site in a query string, so the user would only have to do this once per
session.  For users who do support cookies, this setting can be saved so
they only have to do it once per machine.  

Once CC/PP is more widely supported, the user preferences could also be
stored in a CC/PP profile on the client, which could be sent to the
server and used to configure the page.  I don't think this is feasible
right now, but some day...

Subject: A single URI

Hi,

I posted this message to CHI-WEB.  A question that came back was how
will the web site technology handle a single URI for multiple versions
of a web page if the user doesn't allow cookies or has reached a limit
on cookies.  Did the GL committee come up with technology solutions
for this situation?

Thanks,
Scott

Hi,

The guidelines group for the Web Access Initiative (WAI) of the World
Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is considering a new consensus item on web
page
accessibility:

     RE: CLIENT SIDE AND SERVER SIDE SOLUTIONS
     S1 - serving content in different forms is an acceptable way to
comply
     with the guidelines as long as equivalents for all of the
information
     are provided in the different forms and it is all available through
the
     same URI (though it may be linked to it) (server side solutions are
     acceptable - as specified)

This is a paradigm shift from the current paradigm of having a
"one size fits all" approach towards web page accessibility
where there's a single version of a web page rather than multiple
versions as the new consensus item would provide.

I was wondering what people thought of this change in approach towards
web page accessibility.

Scott
