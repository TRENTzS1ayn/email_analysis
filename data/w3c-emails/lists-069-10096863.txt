This is quite simple, but not widely used.
Server can detect type of userAgent used (HTTP_USER_AGENT request) and 
generate "on-the-fly" HTML (or XHTML, or XML) which is rendered best by this 
userAgent.
One of the best known (recent) example is when MSN.com was blocking 
non-Microsoft browsers.
I have some links about that at:
http://kde2.newmail.ru/kde_news.html
   
Well, it was really Bad Practice, but I used it just as an example because I 
am not aware of other web site using it.
 
Ideally, your back-end engine should translate XML (representing web site 
design/structure) to XML+CSS2 or XHTML+CSS, which can be easily rendered by 
modern browsers.
You can control accessibility via composing *right* CSS stylesheets, and 
adding @MEDIA section to make content accessible for Deaf users.
Visually-impared users can use either custom stylesheets (using !important 
rules), or again you can generate for them custom CSS (complementing either 
XML or XHTML) up to their requirements.
To allow user-specific processing in such case, user need to add specific 
field to its userAgent (like: "Visually-impared content" at the end of 
userAgnet string). 
** In Konqueror (www.konqueror.org), it can be done on per-site basis in 
userAgent configuration dialog.

Than server can detect such user's requirements and serve him up to his 
needs.

|   Hi,
|
|   The guidelines group for the Web Access Initiative (WAI) of the World
|   Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is considering a new consensus item on web page
|   accessibility:
|
|        RE: CLIENT SIDE AND SERVER SIDE SOLUTIONS
|        S1 - serving content in different forms is an acceptable way to
| comply with the guidelines as long as equivalents for all of the
| information are provided in the different forms and it is all available
| through the same URI (though it may be linked to it) (server side solutions
| are acceptable - as specified)
|
|   This is a paradigm shift from the current paradigm of having a
|   "one size fits all" approach towards web page accessibility
|   where there's a single version of a web page rather than multiple
|   versions as the new consensus item would provide.
|
|   I was wondering what people thought of this change in approach towards
|   web page accessibility.
