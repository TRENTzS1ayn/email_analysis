Status update:

A while ago I volunteered to gather open issues for WCAG CSS
techniques which had been posted on WAI-IG.  I have done the first
half of that work -- sifting through the WCAG archives and making
bookmarks -- and I just need to get the second half of the work
done, which is making that into some sort of sensible list.
