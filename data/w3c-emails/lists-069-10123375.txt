On the contrary, CC/PP, when used correctly, talks in terms of capabilities
and preferences, which are user-centric, rather than just sending a browser
or platform identifier.  This means that problems such as storing a
database of capabilities for future browsers are solved.  CC/PP, correctly
applied, should also solve the problem of non-identifcation of assistive
technology (e.g. JAWS), since JAWS' capabilities _should_ be identified
within a CC/PP framework.
