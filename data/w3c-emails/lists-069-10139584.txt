Hi Kynn! 

|   Vadim,

I probably the wrong person to ask - but I cc'ing Dirk Mueller who can 
answer, for sure.
As far as I know, Dirk was investigating possibilities about improoving 
accessibility for Konqueror  - but probbaly it's better to ask him directly.

As about adding CC/PP into KDE, I think it's possible - as everything is 
possible in Open-Source projects.
Key issue is that all developers are focusing on areas they are interested 
in. So, if we get developer on board familiar with CC/PP - it will be 
implemented.  
Even not being developer, you can download latest version (I would recommend 
KDE3beta1, which has most-up-to-date code), test it, and report Bugs and 
Wishlists (see http://bugs.kde.org for details).
There is no warranty that your Wishlist will be implemented, but earlier you 
send bugreport /wishlist, earlier you can get it implemented :-)

So far, Konqueror has:
* Cookie policy on "per site" basis (you can Disable/Enable cookies "per 
site", or use option "ask about this ite" which is my favourite one. I 
disable cookies for all banners and enable them for trusted sites, like say 
http://apps.kde.com or Freshmeat)
* Cookie management (you can look for exact values of storied cookies and 
edit some values, plus delete cookies which you don't like)
* JavaScript can be turned On/Off on per site basis
* same for Java (I don't have Java and can't test but AFAIK it works as was 
designed)
* auto form completion (which IMO enhances accessibility)
* accessibility stylesheet and customization of accessibility stylesheet 
option
* HOVER effect implemented (can be turned On/Off) - sometimes it helps to 
find "hidden" or other links which are difficult to access.
* custom userAgent settings (I wrote about this before)
On site with some browser discrimination, Konqueror can fake as MS 
IE/Windows, MS IE/Mac, Netscape Navigator 4.7 or Netscape6 or Mozilla.
This, as I mentioned, allowed Konqueror to "get in" MSN.com, when Microsoft 
decided to block non-MS browsers.

Plus:
* Favicon support
 Favicon support includes display of site's favicon on Konqueror's location 
toolbar (which is really nice) and in Bookmarks.
* highly configurable Sidebar (believe me, it does more than you can think 
about! I still don't know all its functions)
* Unlimited number of Views (including picture previews, etc.) - unique 
feature of Konqueror, not available in other browsers.
If you have KOffice installed, you can preview "inline" (inside of one 
view/mini-window) KOffice docs, and even (aprtially supported) Word 2000 
documents!

I am still going to put all this info together and make some kind of article 
- but I was pretty busy last month. May be, I'll do it in January...
