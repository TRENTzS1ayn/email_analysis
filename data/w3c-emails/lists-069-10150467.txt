Hi,

I thought also that it meant the exact same URI and was guessing that
the linking meant some redirection or something.  I think that Al is
correct that the consensus item could benefit from some work.  Perhaps
including a couple of examples could help.  For example,
http://www.someplace.org/newsletter.html gets a regular version while
http://www.someplace.org/alternate/newsletter.html gets the alternate
version.

While cookies and content negotiation can be helpful, they require the
web site developers to have some advanced technical skills.  If various
URI's are allowed, that would be helpful.

I agree that the parallel sites need to overcome the distrust from the
past.  However, I think it means that the right technology and tools for
supporting multiple versions of a web site need to be developed.

The reason I suggested that this was a paradigm shift was that early
last year and other times when Kynn or I brought up the possibility of
multiple versions of a page, there was some extremely strongly held
positions on the "one size fits all" approach.
