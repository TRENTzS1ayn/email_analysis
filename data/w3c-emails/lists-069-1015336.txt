Ooops on your grammar .... more than beneficial, it is a necessity ...

This is the problem .... we have to stretch from necessity to nuisance ... 
and accommodate everyone. This is do-able ... Put it there for those who 
want and need it and let the others turn it off ...

But if it's not there, it helps NO ONE!!!!

Matt, the task is to accommodate all disabilities on the web. This means 
that we cannot make guidelines that put obstacles on the web for people 
with disabilities. And I really don't think we should tell folks to wait 
for their accommodations until we can make that "technology" available to 
all ...
