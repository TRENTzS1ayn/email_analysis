I'd asked this before, can you please show me where in the public drafts
of the CC/PP protocols, examples implementations etc. there exists
frameworks for describing users accessibiltity needs, I'm obviously
missing everything, or the working group has published something quite
different to what it's developing privately.  Either way please provide
evidence that supports the above so developers can start preparing - some
of us actually create User Agents and sites.

So that doesn't solve the need to have a database of what jaws means in
Accessibiltiy terms and all others UAs and ATs - and how do I provide site
developers with the functionality of Snufkin (my own browser, based on my
own needs.)
