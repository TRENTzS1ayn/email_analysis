I'm still confused as to why you can't see the framework for such.
It seems obvious to me from reading the same documents.  I'm amazed
that you continue to insist otherwise.

Yes it does.  It just means that JAWS needs to provide part of a CC/PP
profile.  (Which means the user agent -- IE probably -- needs to have a
way to add those on, which can be used by AT devices.)

There's no need for a database of what JAWS means, there's just a need
for those user-agents to be made self-identifying under CC/PP as to
what their capabilities are.  (At no time does the CC/PP-enabled
server need to know what "JAWS" is, it just needs a profile which
includes those _capabilities_.)
