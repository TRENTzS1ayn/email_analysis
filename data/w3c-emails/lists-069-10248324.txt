Simple links to the relevant parts would seem appropriate,

In http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2001OctDec/0546.html

Consider charHeight - "for a text display device, the number of lines of
text that can be displayed" - that's nothing about the user, that's all
about the device, that's about the closest it gets to being useful in a

Okay, I'd like to add CC/PP to my user agent, can you provide me details
of where I can find a profile with the common elements so I can describe
it?
