So you're saying the framework may or may not be useful, but the
specific vocabulary in the draft is lacking?  That is a far cry from
the idea that the approach is all wrong and it's worthless for
accessibility.

Well, for the most part it's waiting to be developed.  Certainly if
WAI participants continue to poo-poo the idea, not much will get done.
When I was active in the working group -- nearly two years ago, now,
when I was quasi-employed by the HTML Writers Guild -- I was waiting
for the framework to be developed far enough that the accessible
vocabularies could be written.

Have you sent your comments to the CC/PP working group?  Are you
a PF member and thus able to see current working drafts and give
authoritative-sounding comments on them?  (You can do the latter
without being part of PF, of course.)  Are you part of the solution?

This discussion would probably best be moved to PF or private
email if you're not part of PF.  Obviously there are going to be
issues that need to be addressed within CC/PP -- nobody is
claiming their first attempt at a vocabulary, without the benefit
of WAI expertise, is going to be perfect.  But the principle is
solid and useful, and not at all the way you have described it.
