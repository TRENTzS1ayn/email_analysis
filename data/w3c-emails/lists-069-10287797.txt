Almost everything in the current vocabulary is a negative, so yes in my
mind it does nothing  for accessibility (more harm than good), so the
current vocabulary is not only lacking it's a negative from an
Accessibility perspective, however it does solve problems I can see in
the mobile world.

However that's not to say the general concept of users describing their
needs is a bad one, I do however feel it's an impractical one, and
definately one to be used as a last resort in authoring terms.

I do not believe there is a solution in CC/PP, in any area I have
interest in, and as I'm not part of PF, I can't participate sensibly
until another public draft exists (detailed comments 9 months after the
last public draft are likely useless.) I'll be waiting until a new public
draft.

So what is it?  Tell me, refute my statements - convince me, don't just
say I'm wrong, without explaining why, by e-mail is of course welcome if
continued discussion of using CC/PP (or the general technique) to
describe accessibility needs is unwelcome on the list.

Jim.
