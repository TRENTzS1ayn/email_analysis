Summary of actions, resolutions, issues
?       Resolved: move forward on 2 day meeting after CSUN (23/24 March) 
?       Unresolved: not sure where to meet after March. Suggestion is in conjunction with ASSETS in Scotland July 8-10 2002. 
?       Action GV: write a proposal for 2.4 by the end of the week. 
?       Issue: We came up with several categories of interactions that require timed responses. Will we include these in the Guidelines/Checkpoints or in Techniques? 
?       Next meeting is 3 January. 

We had a good discussion about what types of things Checkpoint 2.4 might be applied to and what types of things should have exceptions. 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2001/12/20-minutes.html#examples-2-4

For example, time-outs on sites for security and privacy reasons are reasonable but people should be warned when time will expire and be offered a chance to reset the clock to give them more time. An exception would be purchasing ticktes where there is a limited pool to choose from. Another thing we decided not to address was tests where time is an important factor. For example, a timed test to qualify to be a real-time captioner. Time is an important aspect of that job. Tests in general are a complex topic and one that we do not think we will directly cover with 2.4.
