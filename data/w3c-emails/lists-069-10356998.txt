User Agent should be in the glossary (I think it is already) and we
should link to it from here.

It would be useful to find or create a short summary of the types of
configuration that a UAAG compliant browser should support.

Can we think of a way to state this in specific terms. 

I am worried that if I were a page author I wouldn't know what a UAAG
compliant user-agent was?   (or even what a user-agent was).
