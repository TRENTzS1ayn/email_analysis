Hi,

The UI issue may not be that hard for the most basic case of
only two versions of a web page.  One version could be the information
in a very simple, pretty linear format while the other has all
the complications that the web page designer would like.

If the first is called the 'universal' format (I'm still looking for
another name), it would be just a matter of having the 'universal'
tree, e.g.  www.zzz.com/universal .  A third tree could possibly be added,
but after that a different approach probably needs to be considered.
