A good candidate for "base HTML capabilities" would be XHTML
Basic and the HTML equivalent thereof.

I think it's not enough to simply "ignore" or "not break" on <abbr>
and <acronym> and <dfn> and <tt> -- there should be some manner in
which this information is conveyed to the user.  It shouldn't be
treated as a <div> or <span> alone.

In my opinion, styling is not merely "content enhancement" as some
have claimed, and therefore -- at the very least -- CSS level one
should be supported.  There is an increasing argument to be made that
JavaScript is standardizable enough that some subset of basic
JavaScript must be supported.

So, it looks like the list I'd draw up, as a start, would be:

* XHTML Basic
* HTML equivalents for XHTML Basic
* CSS level 1
* ECMAscript (plus W3C DOM?)

In my opinion that constitutes a reasonable baseline of support for
2001 web browsers.  Anything less than that is lagging behind spec
by a great deal, and represents software in serious need of upgrade.
