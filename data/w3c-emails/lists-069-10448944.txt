If users have CSS1, they do not necessarily have the ability to override the
stylesheet provided by the author.

Should they have the CSS2 cascade, or should the user agent provide some
means to enusre that the styling can be disabled, or should it provide a
methos for overriding styling on a property by property basis (essentially
the CSS2 cascade by another specification)?

If they did have this ability, then they could clearly identify, in a way
that suits them, each different element.

  A good candidate for "base HTML capabilities" would be XHTML

  I think it's not enough to simply "ignore" or "not break" on <abbr>
  and <acronym> and <dfn> and <tt> -- there should be some manner in
  which this information is conveyed to the user.  It shouldn't be
  treated as a <div> or <span> alone.

  In my opinion, styling is not merely "content enhancement" as some
  have claimed, and therefore -- at the very least -- CSS level one
  should be supported.  There is an increasing argument to be made that
  JavaScript is standardizable enough that some subset of basic
  JavaScript must be supported.

  So, it looks like the list I'd draw up, as a start, would be:

  * XHTML Basic
  * HTML equivalents for XHTML Basic
  * CSS level 1
  * ECMAscript (plus W3C DOM?)

  In my opinion that constitutes a reasonable baseline of support for
  2001 web browsers.  Anything less than that is lagging behind spec
  by a great deal, and represents software in serious need of upgrade.
