|   Good point.  Users should have the CSS2 specification's cascade,
|   and the subset of CSS2 which corresponds to CSS1.

CSS2 conflicts with CSS1, at some points.
Plus, CSS1 (and CSS2) is rather bloated.
I guess CSS3: VisualBoxModel + Aureal rendering is a real minimum for CSS 
support (cascading and selectors should be included, too, but these are 
supporting modules). I also think that CSS3: Line Text layout module should 
be optional, it's really not necessary to support "Line Text layouting" in 
text-based browser, like Lynx (you can emulate DIV and SPAN elements, 
borders, padding even in text mode, but I doubt that you can use different 
typeface, etc.). 
Therefor, I think that dependency list for Visual BoxModel should be changed 
in final CSS3 Recommendation.

Tables, Positioning, Fonts, etc. should be optional in Minimal Browser 
Capabilities.

Now we just need to get Netscape and Microsoft supporting this minimum ASAP 
:-)
