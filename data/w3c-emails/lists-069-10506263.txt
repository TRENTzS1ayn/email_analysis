A page is considered accessible if it can be used by users with
disabilities.  It's not a very rigorous definition, but it's the
one in WCAG 1:

<blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#accessible"
             xml:space="preserve">
      Accessible
Content is accessible when it may be used by someone with a disability.
</blockquote>

There are obviously serious problems with this definition.

WCAG 2.0 draft does not attempt to define accessible, but instead
refers to accessible web sites and, by implication, kinda defines
accessibility:

<blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#intro-purpose">
This document outlines design principles for creating accessible Web 
sites. When these principles are ignored, individuals with 
disabilities may not be able to access the content at all, or they 
may be able to do so only with great difficulty. When these 
principles are employed, they also make Web content accessible to a 
variety of Web-enabled devices, such as phones, handheld devices, 
kiosks, network appliances, etc. By making content accessible to a 
variety of devices, the content is now accessible to people in a 
variety of situations.
</blockquote>

Hope this helps.
