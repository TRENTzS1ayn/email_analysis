Hi,

Thanks.  Was there any thought given to a definition like:

    "A web page can be considered accessible to a person with a disability
    if that person can understand the content on the page and be able
    to interact with that information with the goal of being as effective
    and efficient as a person without a disability when using the web page."

In some ways, the second approach doesn't make sense.  One problem is
that it is possible to follow the guidelines and still end up with a web
page which can be not easily understood.  Also, the principles do not
necessarily make content accessible on various devices.  Ever try to use
a long web page which meets the guidelines from a web-enabled cell phone?


Another possible definition could be something like:

    "A set of versions of a web page can be considered accessible to
    a person with a disability if both of these conditions are true:
    
      a.  each version in the set has the exact same information and
          equivalent interaction with the information as that of any
  other version in the set
  
      b.  the set contains a version of the web page such that the person
          can understand the content on the page and be able to interact with
  that information with the goal of being as effective and efficient
  as a person without a disability when using the web page."

Kind of long.

Scott
