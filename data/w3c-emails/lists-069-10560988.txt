Hello,

We would like to publish the Requirements for WCAG 2.0 Working Draft on the W3C Technical Reports page. [1]  We are aiming to publish to TR on 25 January.  Please send comments to the list before 18 January.

We have not published the Requirements to the TR page yet.  The document had changed very little from the time it was first published (June 2000).  The primary change is the addition of an appendix that contains the consensus items from the "elephant" discussions.  This Appendix to the Requirements for WCAG 2.0 was first published for Working Group review on 18 October 2001. [2]

The consensus items resulted from discussion that began at the September F2F meetings in Redmond, Washington, USA. [3]
