What about the following:

An accessible Web page can easily be transformed into equivalent forms 
suitable for different media, such as text, audio or images. User's not 
able to access one media because of their disabilities should be able to 
access the equivalent information in a usable manner. An accessible page 
also supports the use of different interaction devices.

- having shorter or longer versions of the information or abstracts would 
help too or simpler versions of language but currently there are no exact 
definitions
