I wasn't thinking I suggested something totally new. Just tried to 
verbalize what we do in another way. For instance, I think that adding alt 
text for the images of a Web page is one way to make in transformable to 
text and from that it can be transformed to audio with the help of proper 
devices. If the page has enough equivalent information we can do it. When 
the end result from the transformation is usable for users with different 
disabilities the page is accessible. The transformation itself can be done 
in many several ways e.g. with one user agent or by using specialized user 
agents or with some filters etc.

I do agree that there is a need to think of what are the most needed 
transformations and if  some additional equivalents would be beneficial 
e.g. different length abstracts of the text may would be beneficial to be 
able to quickly glance a page while browsing with voice or show the page on 
a small screen.
