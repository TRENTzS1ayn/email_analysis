I think that what yu have suggested is merely a longer (and therefore more
explicit) version of what is in WCAG 1.0. It reflects roughly what I think
of when I use the term "accessible page", and I think it makes a good
definition.

If we were to take it further, we would point out that landing on a page
doesn't mean that the only way to provide the access required is through the
content that is on that page. There are various other possiblities - a page
might be negotiated to provide the content in sensible useful chunks (yes, I
have used a W3C spec on a mobile phone, and the gateway I had sensibly cut it
into useful pieces, using the structure required at level double-A of WCAG
conformance).

A set of versions can not, I don't think, be accessible if they assume that I
have come to them through some particular path - it must be possible for any
user to get to the version that will suit them from any version they happen
to hit, at least until we have a reliable way of users being able to identify
the capabilities and preferences for content automatically.

  Hi,

  Thanks.  Was there any thought given to a definition like:

      "A web page can be considered accessible to a person with a disability
      if that person can understand the content on the page and be able
      to interact with that information with the goal of being as effective
      and efficient as a person without a disability when using the web page."

  In some ways, the second approach doesn't make sense.  One problem is
  that it is possible to follow the guidelines and still end up with a web
  page which can be not easily understood.  Also, the principles do not
  necessarily make content accessible on various devices.  Ever try to use
  a long web page which meets the guidelines from a web-enabled cell phone?


  Another possible definition could be something like:

      "A set of versions of a web page can be considered accessible to
      a person with a disability if both of these conditions are true:

        a.  each version in the set has the exact same information and
            equivalent interaction with the information as that of any
    other version in the set

        b.  the set contains a version of the web page such that the person
            can understand the content on the page and be able to interact with
    that information with the goal of being as effective and efficient
    as a person without a disability when using the web page."

  Kind of long.
