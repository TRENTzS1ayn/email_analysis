I'm also a developer, and I do this sort of thing almost daily as well. I 
find the opposite is true. CSS takes me less time than tables. I think it 
is a mixture of personal style, and the nature of the website you are 
doing. At UNITE, our perl seems to lend itself very easily to css layouts.

It must be said, there is at least one table based layout I couldn't get to 
work in Netscape 4.7 using CSS.
