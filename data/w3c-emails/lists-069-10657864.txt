Hi,

While transformations can be useful in various situations as an approach
towards accessibility, I'm thinking we need to be careful to
differentiate between which transformations are desirable and which can
be readily achieved by the web page developers including testing, etc.

I've been kind of exploring some ideas not to dissimilar to what
you are suggesting about abstracts as a way to quickly size ulp
a web page when browsing by voice or on a small screen.  A format
that I keep coming back to that could appear at the beginning of appropriate
web pages would be something like:

    TITLE

    INTRODUCTION / SUMMARY

    INDEX OF SECTIONS ON PAGE
