I smell a FAQ.  Hey, fellow WCAG members, why don't we have a FAQ,
anyway?  (For that matter, why doesn't ANYONE seem to have a detailed
FAQ on web accessibility?  Maybe I should make one, in my infinite
free time!)

Rowan, in general pixel sizes for positioning are not a huge barrier
to access but don't necessarily help it -- well not more than you
already assist access by putting pages in CSS.  (Since you can turn
those off and such.)

In theory, em sizes for positioning are kinda helpful because it makes
it more likely that you'll be able to fit your text into the page; by
using one set of units for all values in your layout, you can get
closer to whatever design you might want.  In practice, I don't think
it's that big a deal, though.

Other people may disagree. :)
