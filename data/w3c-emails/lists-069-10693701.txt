Hi,

There seems to be two basic strategies for accessing different versions
of a web page.  One strategey has a way to track a user's preference by
using cookies or including session information in the URL.  The other
strategy is to provide parallel tree structures.  I think that both are
reasonable depending of the development resources possible.  For some
places where the availability of programmers to hadle cookies or
rewriting URL's is very limited, the parallel tree approach might be
reasonable.  It can also be useful for users who refuse cookies.  For
other sites where there is more programming resources available, using
cookies or rewriting URL's might be fine.

If the parallel tree approach is used, peoviding links to versions od
the page in other trees would be desirable.
