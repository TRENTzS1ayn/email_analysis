Hmmm. I think that the value of simple (simplistic?) conformance systems
means it  is worth having them, but I think Kynn's analysis raises the issue
that we may have put too much emphasis on how easy it is to test a checkpoint
in assessing priorities - which I feel is generally a result of some
checkpoints being too broadly stated in areas where we were lacking specific
knowledge.

At any rate, following the explanation of priority in WCAG 1.0 it is clear
that level-A conformance only provides "bare accessibility" - the test
applied in Australian law of "not discriminating" would clearly require going
further than this before being able to expect that one had complied with the
legal requirement.

Cheers

  Please consider this argument added to my other objections to WCAG 1.0's
  conformance system based entirely on priorities.  I like the other
  proposals recently raised (e.g. Jason's, Paul's) better than I like the
  idea of adopting WCAG 1.0's priorities/compliance for WCAG 2.0.
