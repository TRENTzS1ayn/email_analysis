I agree that it's important, when choosing accesskeys, to make sure that
you're not using letters that are already "taken" by the browser.  But that
doesn't mean you're restricted to the numerals 0-9; it just means you can't
use letters that already belong to the browser's top-level menus.

Subject: RE: Comment 4 - Access keys


I posted this to the list a few months ago...

When I first used access keys a colleague did some research on it, and found
that the only keys that were definately not used for general applications
(whether on Windows, Mac or Linux) were numbers... therefore accesskeys
should utilise 0 -9 and that is all

(For example, in Windows, ALT+F opens the 'File' menu, thus 'F' cannot be
used as an accesskey - the only ascii keys which can be used are numerals).

This should be included in the checkpoint.
