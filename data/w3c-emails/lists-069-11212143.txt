Hello,

Could someone tell me if Jaws, Window Eyes, Home Page Reader, et al give 
some indication when html code elements have been encountered?

e.g. here's a code snippet
<html>
<body>
<p>here's some text</p>
<code>here's some code</code>
</body>
</html>

When "here's some code" is read - does it give indication that this is 
code?  Visually, it is usually shown in a courier font (to make it look 
more machine-like i suppose).  Just wondering if there is also some audio 
indication.

Could you please include the version and platform of the product that you 
are using?

Thanks,
--wendy
