Wendy,

JAWS doesn't give any indication that it's reading code other than reading
the angle brackets, curly brackets, square brackets, etc.  Yet another
reason for wishing some browser somewhere (other than emacspeak, I mean)
would support ACSS.

Subject: html code element and speech output


Hello,

Could someone tell me if Jaws, Window Eyes, Home Page Reader, et al give 
some indication when html code elements have been encountered?

e.g. here's a code snippet
<html>
<body>
<p>here's some text</p>
<code>here's some code</code>
</body>
</html>

When "here's some code" is read - does it give indication that this is 
code?  Visually, it is usually shown in a courier font (to make it look 
more machine-like i suppose).  Just wondering if there is also some audio 
indication.

Could you please include the version and platform of the product that you 
are using?

Thanks,
--wendy
