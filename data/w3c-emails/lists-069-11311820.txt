1. WCAG 2.0 requirements, latest R1/R2 proposal, as follows (quoted
from Wendy's message to the list):

R1: WCAG 2.0 deliverables should be more understandable and usable by a 
wider audience than was anticipated for WCAG 1.0, including policy 
makers.   While the WCAG WG does not set policy, harmonization of 
accessibility requirements helps drive demand for supporting 
implementations in Web applications; therefore it should be easy for policy 
makers and individuals responsible for implementing policy  to understand, 
cite and/or adopt WCAG 2.0 and related deliverables.

R2:   We will try to express the technical requirements in language that 
policy makers can understand, adopt, and use, but technical requirements 
are not driven by policy; they are driven by the needs of users with 
disabilities.

2. The latest draft of WCAG 2.0, including:

a. Testability of the semantic requirement in checkpoint 1.1, namely
that text equivalents fulfill the same function or convey the same
information as the non-text content.

b. Checkpoint 1.2, proposed additional success criterion as follows:
<proposed>
5. Descriptions, captions and synchronized media equivalents have been
    reviewed and are believed to be both accurate and sufficient.
</proposed>

c. Checkpoint 2.1 (in Gregg's reorganization). The following wording
has been proposed to address issues of device-independence in this
checkpoint:

all functions can be operated via character input

d. Treatment of real-time events under checkpoint 2.2 and how these
can be made accessible.

e. Flicker and colour contrast. See Lee's recent messages to the list:
