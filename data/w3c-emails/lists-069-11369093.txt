Yes, I think this is a good addition.

(It means that we have to resolve the "baseline requirements" issue).

Wendy had written
  We are proposing a new R2 to supplement the existing R1 proposal.

  R1: WCAG 2.0 deliverables should be more understandable and usable by a
  wider audience than was anticipated for WCAG 1.0, including policy
  makers.  While the WCAG WG does not set policy, harmonization of
  accessibility requirements helps drive demand for supporting
  implementations in Web applications; therefore it should be easy for
  policy makers and individuals responsible for implementing policy to
  understand, cite and/or adopt WCAG 2.0 and related deliverables.

  R2:  We will try to express the technical requirements in language that
  policy makers can understand, adopt, and use, but technical requirements
  are not driven by policy; they are driven by the needs of users with
  disabilities.
