Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) Becomes a W3C Recommendation

   16 April 2002: The World Wide Web Consortium today released "The
   Platform for Privacy Preferences 1.0 (P3P 1.0)" as a W3C
   Recommendation. The specification has been reviewed by the W3C
   Membership, who favor its adoption by industry. P3P allows people to
   define and publish their Web site privacy policies, and helps
   automate how those policies are read. P3P also gives users control
   over the use of their personal information on Web sites they visit,
   thus promoting trust and confidence in the Web. Read the press
   release and testimonials.
