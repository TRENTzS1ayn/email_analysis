IE has such an action, at least for click.  I haven't tried mouseover,
but MSDN (http://msdn.microsoft.com) should have documentation on which
events can be fired this way.  If memory serves, this worked all the way
back to IE4.

<span tabindex="1" onclick="alert('click');"
onkeypress="this.click();">hot span</span>

Paste this into an HTML page, tab till the "hot span" has focus, and hit
a key.  You'll see the 'click' alert.

Hi Phill,

yes, there is a new issue to deal with here, at the same time as dealing
with a legacy issue - IE has linked some events, but not all of them,
other developers have implemented the spec as is, and the result is that
it is hard for authors.

My initial thoughts are that it would be useful if IE had a deliberate
"fire the mouse" action that could be keyboard generated, or if the
specifications were written to unify the mouse and keyboard models, but
having an unspecified half-way solution is not serving us in the long
term. On the other hand, it should be acknowledged that they have helped
some people in the short term.

I recommend that people interested in this question consider the PF
working group as a venue for further discussion - there are several
groups working on event models including HTML, and SVG. I realise the
member-only nature of that group means people will have to join it and
agree to the confidentiality requirements, but consider that the work
there is valuable.

cheers
