Hello everyone, Gregory,

  The wisest solution, of course.
  I will leave the less important abbreviations (PDF, Ltd., Co. and so
  on) with no expansion at all.

  There's no standard mechanism for this and I don't think I'm the
  right person to invent one.

  How about this:
  <link rel="Glossary" href="explanation-of-abbrs-in-russian.html"
  title="Abbreviations expansion in Russian" /> or one could change the link
  type to "Help".

  Or this:
  <link rel="Alternate" href="same-doc-but-with-russian-abbrs.html"
  title="Abbreviations in Russian" />

  There wasn't much feedback.

Best regards.
