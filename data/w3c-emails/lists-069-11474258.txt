aloha, yet again, alexander!

OLD GJR: the use of Ruby as both a "glossing" mechanism and a pronunciation 
guide has been broadly discussed within WAI and with the 
internationalization people (whose arcane acronym i can never remember)

AS: I guess it is "i18n", heh.

NEW GJR: that's the one!

the reason i neglected to mention ruby in my first post is that it suffers 
from the tree falling in the woods syndrome -- whom does it benefit if no 
mainstream tools expose the markup?  (note that this is a recurrent problem 
in the arena of accessibility -- a lot of really useful slash essential 
markup exists, but few tools recognize, support, or expose it, although i 
am glad to report that this seems to be slowly changing for the 
better...  i write "slowly" because a lot of accessibility-oriented markup 
was added to HTML4, and inherited by XHTML 1.0, and thus has been canonical 
for quite some time, HTML4 having reached Rec status in 1998, while 
HTML4.01 and XHTML1.0 became recommendations in 1999)

as for practical solutions, i think your LINK suggestion quite elegant, and 
would strongly encourage you to implement it, AS WELL AS adopting martin's 
suggested markup for the ACRONYM itself...

was i correct in assuming that one of the reasons for marking the ACRONYM 
with the xml:lang attribute is so that it is displayed in a latin, rather 
than a cyrillic font?

gregory.
