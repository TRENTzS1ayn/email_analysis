So should we use "data structure" instead of "data model"? Thus:

1. the hierarchical structure of the content is represented unambiguously in
the markup or data structure.


Or is this redundant?

It seems to me that what we are getting at here is this:

1. The content has some intrinsic structure to it.

2. This structure must be reflected in the structure applied to it, either
through markup or some other process.

So in the example above, "the hierarchicial structure of the content" refers
to the intrinsic structure of the content, and "the markup or data
model/structure" refers to a structure imposed on the content from outside.
And we are saying that these must match.

Am I getting warmer?
