aloha, jonathan!

i agree with your critique, but would like to "see" a more explicit 
"round-tripping" -- while the buck may stop at the desk of a policy maker, 
accessibility is achieved not with a single stroke of a bureaucratic pen, 
but by technicians -- a concept that can neither be lost nor diluted...

<proposed who="GJR">
<!-- optional bits in square brackets -->
The technical requirements of WCAG 2.0 are driven by the needs of users 
with disabilities. However, every attempt has been made to express the 
technical requirements in language that policy makers can understand, 
adopt, and use to assess [the results of] specific implementation decisions 
[and policies].
</proposed>

i'm sure that 99.9 percent of you could phrase that more directly and 
succinctly, gregory. (who is even more woolly-headed than usual today)

PS: for the thread's sake, here's jonathan's original:

<proposed who="JC">
'Technical requirements  are driven by the needs of users with 
disabilities. We do however try to express the technical requirements in 
language that policy makers can understand, adopt, and use.'
