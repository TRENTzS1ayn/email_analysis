I actually like Gregory's phrtasing, and wonder whether we can make a new
re-unified R1 proposal, along the lines of

  The technical requirements of WCAG 2.0 are driven by the needs of users
  with disabilities. However, the users of WCAG 2.0 are a wide audience,
  and the requirements it expresses these must be expressed in language
  that policy makers can use, reference and directly adopt as appropriate.

Which brings me to another point. In order to meet this requirement, we need
some clear guidance about what language is appropriate for the various
policy-setting audiences.

  aloha, jonathan!

  i agree with your critique, but would like to "see" a more explicit
  "round-tripping" -- while the buck may stop at the desk of a policy maker,
  accessibility is achieved not with a single stroke of a bureaucratic pen,
  but by technicians -- a concept that can neither be lost nor diluted...

  <proposed who="GJR">
  <!-- optional bits in square brackets -->
  The technical requirements of WCAG 2.0 are driven by the needs of users

  technical requirements in language that policy makers can understand,

  [and policies].

  i'm sure that 99.9 percent of you could phrase that more directly and
  succinctly, gregory. (who is even more woolly-headed than usual today)

  PS: for the thread's sake, here's jonathan's original:
