?A very useful document!

It is possible that I have passed over some discussion in this respect, and
if it is I hope that you forgive me, but I find that:

It is more appropriate the text of the point 2.5 of the Working Draft"
2.5 Use device-independent event handlers.
that that of the point 2.1 of the restructuring.
2.1 Provide keyboard access to all functionality of the content.
Because some people with disability cannot even use a keyboard. Some people
use a switch.

It is more appropriate the text of the point 1.3 of the Working Draft"
1.3 Use markup or a data model to provide the logical structure of content.
that that of the point 3.1 of the restructuring:
3.1 Provide structure within content.
Because it is clearer and it includes the word " logical "

Best regards,
Emmanuelle

Restructuring Proposal


I have taken the checkpoints from Gregg's Restructuring Proposal and
integrated them into the WCAG 2.0 to WCAG 1.0 checkpoint mapping document
that Wendy did last year. You can view the mapping at
