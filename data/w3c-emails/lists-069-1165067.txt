Folks,

         The first rough and unpolished version of a Cognition Simulation 
is now available at: http://www.erols.com/stevepem/Guidelines/Cognition.html

         Of course, y'all will recognize Chaals' illustration in it .... 
interesting .... it's isn't possible to right click on a *.png image and 
download it. I had to link it to Chaals' site ...

         Come to think of it, I should link the sound file to it as further 
illustration to help make the point.

         Anyone else have suggestions, comments, etc? I'm most curious if 
some of you think it does or doesn't do what it's intended to do - simulate 
what it's like to be faced with an incomprehensible page.

                                         Anne
