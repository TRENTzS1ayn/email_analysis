I think "Microsoft's market share" has very little to do with the question
of screen reader support for browsers. What screen reader developers are
trying to do is support access to the web. As you said, John, these are
small companies with very limited resources. The question boils down to how
does the developer obtain the web data to present to the blind user. As I
indicated in my last post, each of three AT's do it in three VERY different
ways though all use IE as a vehicle - because they are running on the
Windows platform. Having chosen IE as that vehicle (technically justified)
then they also "support" IE as an application, its dialogs and other
features - which is where scripts or set files are needed. HPR isn't
supporting IE; it is using the same Windows web controls that IE uses.

I would be interested in understanding how you believe your web access would
be changed if your screen reader supported a different browser, say Opera. I
assume you would want the same handling of the page that JFW now provides
under IE through parsing the HTML. So what is going to be different?

Thanks for all the responses.  It's good to be reminded that there are
indeed other browsers out there.  But my post was prompted by a specific
experience: Jim Allan and I spent about an hour sitting in my office the
other day, looking at Opera and marveling at some of its features.  But we
were also strucky by the fact that JAWS 4.02 (the most recent version,
released last month) read the pages very badly when it read them at all--
even after going into the Opera preferences and checking off the things
designed specifically to support screen readers.  For example there is a
page that lists Opera's extensive keyboard support-- critical information
for me and for other people who are blind/have low vision who use screen
readers.  But JAWS could not read all the items on the list; Jim told me
that it seemed to be picking up "about every third itme."  We spent some
time looking at Opera's documentation, finding everything they had to say
about screen readers and making the changes they recommended.  Then we went
to JAWS' help and looked for references to Opera.  Not one.  So I called
Freedom Scientific tech support and asked if they had scripts for Opera.
The short answer was "No."  The long answer was also "No."  And when I
pushed the point, the guy on the phone said that he had "never seen" Opera,
nor had anyone else in his unit.  I asked if there were ways I could
configure JAWS to improve performance.  The short answer was "no."  The long
answer was that I might be able to do it if I knew how to write JAWS
scripts.  I got similar answers about Lynx, which JAWS also seems to handle
pretty badly.

My next move was to email GW Micro, publishers of Window-Eyes.  The response
was quick, and said that they simply had to concentrate all their resources
on supporting IE.  Period.  I sent the same query to DolphinUSA and will
report back when I hear from them.

There's no conspiracy here.  Just small companies in a small market doing
their best to allocate resources where they and their customers get the most
bang for the buck.  Given Microsoft's market share, it makes good business
sense for the vendors to focus on IE.  But that just has the effect of
continuing to narrow choices and driving innovation into tight dark corners.

John

Hi Charles,

The statement of screen reader "support" is debatable. OutSpoken supports
any browser just like other screen readers support any browser - reading the
text written to the screen. Outspoken is not unique in that regard. But it
is hopelessly inadequate for the web. It is inadequate support. Mercator
never "supported" the web either. Emacspeak is great technology used by at
least 4 people and is purely text. The way you write about these things
makes it sound a lot better than it really is.

I don't agree with your assertion about the way screen readers support
browsers either. In fact, JFW parses the HTML, Window-Eyes uses MSAA, and
only HPR uses the DOM ... as their main resource for getting web content and
structure.

well, an example of standardisation on the windows platform is using DOM and
MSAA - apparently this is the critical part of making browsers accesible to
the blind (I guess unless you use a directly accessible browser like
websound or homepage reader). Netscape have been working hard on this
recently and appear to be making very good progress.

So next roll-outs should be better. I agree that the range of browsers which
sighted people can use is valuable, and not being able to use the same range
is a great shame.

cheers

  Yes But this is an issue which needs raising.
  'where is the standardisation?'
  its not much **** good if you only get one or two browsers, per reader, or
  visa-versa is it?
  especially if they stop working with the next roll-out.

  thanks
