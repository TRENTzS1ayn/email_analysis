Perhaps one is using older hardware which lacks the `horsepower' to run
a modern MSIE (which needs a _lot_ of resources), but could easily run
Opera with good performance.  Perhaps one likes the idea of Opera's
tabbed interface, which allows having several pages open with only one
window, the user being able to switch between them with CTRL-TAB without
having to wade through other Windows applications' windows in an
ALT-TAB.  This is a real boon when one has a slow network and pages take
many minutes to load.  Perhaps one likes the ability to manage privacy
concerns more closely than MSIE allows, or wants the ability to control
popup windows, etc.  Or perhaps one is Norwegian, and wants to support
local small business.  There are a multitude of reasons one might want
to use a browser other than MSIE.

Browsing the Web using even the best aural interface is not an exercise
for the impatient.  Anything that can be done to make that task easier
is going to be very welcome indeed.  On the other hand, throwing up
further limitations -- like only being able to use one browser, when
sighted users have so many to choose from -- is doing visualy impaired
users a great disservice.
