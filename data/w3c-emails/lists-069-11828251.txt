John, Gian, and Lee accepted action items yesterday to review files for 
conformance to checkpoint 1.1. (Thanks!!)

There are 10 test files for checkpoint 1.1 at (as well as files for several 
other checkpoints)
http://snow.utoronto.ca/access/evaltoolreview/ATRtestfiles/
(files with the name 1-1-1-f[1-10].html
e.g. http://snow.utoronto.ca/access/evaltoolreview/ATRtestfiles/1-1-1-f1.html
http://snow.utoronto.ca/access/evaltoolreview/ATRtestfiles/1-1-1-f2.html
through
http://snow.utoronto.ca/access/evaltoolreview/ATRtestfiles/1-1-1-f12.html

The files were created by Chris Ridpath and Josh Krieger to cause 
evaluation tools to trigger specific warnings.

After going through them again, I think it would be more helpful to go 
through the few mock sites that I'm aware of.  I expect that more mock 
sites exist. If you are aware of one, please send me a link so we can 
generate a list.

1. mock news site created by Matt May.
This site was created to purposefully violate several checkpoints.
http://bestkungfu.com/csun/

Many images do not have text equivalents.  What should the text equivalent 
be?  Do you agree with the text equivalents that are provided?  What about 
the flash animation - what text equivalent would you assign for that.

2. WebAIM's mock site - University of the Antarctic
Again, this site purposefully violates several checkpoints
http://www.webaim.org/tutorials/uofa/

What should the missing text equivalents be?  Do you agree with the text 
equivalents that are provided?

3. W3C mock health news site created by Ian Jacobs.
It purposefully violates several checkpoints
http://www.w3.org/Talks/1999/0512-wai-www8-ij/bad/index.html

What should the missing text equivalents be?

Here is the "fixed" version. Do you agree with the fixes?
http://www.w3.org/Talks/1999/0512-wai-www8-ij/good/index.html

4. I am reluctant to select live sites without asking permission from the 
site owner.  Does anyone wish to offer their own site for 
review?  Particularly one that contains audio?

How can we make this exercise more helpful?  Suggestions encouraged!

Thank you,
