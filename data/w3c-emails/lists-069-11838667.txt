Wendy,

We have a site made for our 2001 staff United Way campaign at Arizona
State University [1].  It doesn't contain audio, but links a QuickTime
clip provided to us from outside.  As we couldn't modify the QuickTime
file to add captioning, we make a separate text description of it.

Note that the site has been static since last fall, so some external
links may not be current.
