Anyone ever wondered where the icons that UA use, are?

If you now know, perhaps you could post a link, I've found out that staff are capturing screen shots of UA in order to cut out buttons. 
To use in creating educational resources concerned with teaching UA skills.

This is frankly ridiculous, and needs to be addressed in some guidelines.

Also:

http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/chapter6.html is littered with .png files: http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/026.html is there a similar sheet wich uses unicode to display these symbols? unicode.org uses .pdf files, what's with these people?

Also:

does anyone know a chart (similar to unicode.org, or MathML) that give the typing shortcuts to generate the symbols?

thanks for your patience
