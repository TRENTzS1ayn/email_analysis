1.1.1-1f
<img src="noAlt.jpg"/>
Using Netscape 6.2 I ended up with a blank page.
Using IE 5.5 I had a broken image.
This is about as useless as it can get.

1.1.1-f2
<img src="gifimage.gif" alt="gifimage.gif"/>
Using Netscape 6.2 I ended up with an alt text of
"gifimage.gif".  Using IE 5.5 I had a broken image
and alt text.
Personally, I don't care if the image is a gif,
jpg, png, tif or anything else.  What is the image
all about?

1.1.1-f3
<img src="bytesImage.gif" alt="34K bytes"/>
Using Netscape 6.2 I ended up with an alt text of
"34k image".  Using IE 5.5 I had a broken image
and alt text.
The size in bytes of the image is useless
information.  What's the image all about?

1.1.1-f4
<img src="animage.gif" alt="{short description of
image}"/>
Using Netscape 6.2 I ended up with an alt text of
"{short description of image}".  Using IE 5.5 I
had a broken image and alt text.
The alt image is not useful at all.  I would feel
much better on this if we had something that
provided base information and a "d" link and/or
longdesc.

1.1.1-f5
<img src="nullimage.gif" alt=""/>
Using Netscape 6.2 I ended up with a blank page.
Using IE 5.5 I had a broken image and no alt text.
Based upon the name of the file, I'd say it was
properly tagged.

1.1.1-f6
<img src="space.gif" alt=" "/>
Using Netscape 6.2 I ended up with a blank page.
Using IE 5.5 I had a broken image and no alt text.
Based upon the name of the file, I'd say the image
is properly tagged.

1.1.1-f8 (there was no 1.1.1-f7)
<img src="hasAlt.gif" alt="A small black dog"/>
Using Netscape 6.2 I ended up with an alt text of
"a small black dog".  Using IE 5.5 I had a broken
image and an alt text.
Well the alt text is descriptive, but is it really
a small black dog?  What kind of dog is it?
Perhaps it's a mutt or a Yorkie.

1.1.1-f10 (there was no 1.1.1-f9)
<img src="hasAlt.gif" alt="0123456789 0123456789
0123456789 0123456789 0123456789 0123456789
0123456789 0123456789 0123456789 0123456789
0123456789 0123456789 0123456789 0123456789
0123456789"/>
Using Netscape 6.2 I ended up with a long lising
of numbers.  Using IE 5.5 I had a broken image and
an alt text.
Since this image has nothing that I can go on for
what it is or what it's for I would say that the
alt tag information leaves me wondering what the
heck this is all about.


1.1.1-f11
star.jpg    width=5    height=5
Using Netscape 6.2 I ended up with a blank page.
Using IE 5.5 I had a blank page (I can only image
that the image was there and it was a white image,
however when I changed the background to grey I
still didn't have an image)
Based upon the name of the image I think it should
have "star" or a desription of the star since
there are different types of stars (e.g., Star of
David, Star of Bethlehem, Sheriff's Star, solar
star, etc.).  If the image is used as for an
unordered list it should have "list item 1" or
such to identify the separation.

1.1.1-f12
bar.gif    width=200    height=5
Using Netscape 6.2 I ended up with a blank page.
Using IE 5.5 I had a blank page again with both a
white background and a grey background.
I think this image should have the alt tag of
"horizontal rule" or a blank alt text.  I depends
upon how the image is being used.
