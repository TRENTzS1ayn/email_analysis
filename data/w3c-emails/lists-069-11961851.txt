The long promised next draft version of 2.0 based on

 

1) the reorganization

2) the conformance scheme we came up with at face-to-face

3) the comments from face-to-face

4) open issues (as many as possible without delaying posting this)

5) discussions on the list

6) an attempt to put something up that we could talk from (which meant
making things up for spots where there wasn't something)

7) any bugs found in process

 

is up on our Home Page at  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/

 

(if you don't see the new version immediately - try again in 20 min. and
it should show.)

 

 

It needs lots of work and discussion - but you can see a pattern forming
- and that is the most important.  

 

Please read for tomorrows teleconf call with emphasis on 

 

a)  structure

b) conformance scheme

c) big picture items 

Thanks

And a BIG thanks to Ben for working side by side with me at all hours to
get this thing pulled together.  And to Jason for all the review and
conformance thoughts, and to Wendy for support throughout.

See you tomorrow


Gregg
