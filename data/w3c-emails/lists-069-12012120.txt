Thanks for posting this.
 
Can someone point me to resources where I can learn about symbol systems
that are used by people with learning (or other cognitive?) disabilities?
There's at least one reference to such symbolic notations in the Guidelines
that Jonathan sent out, and I've seen a number of other references in
discussions of WCAG; but I haven't known how to follow up.
 
Thanks!
John Slatin

Unfortunately due to the use of frames, the nearest I can get to a uri is
 
http://www.learningdisabilities.org.uk/html/frames/fr_main.cfm?page=WN
<http://www.learningdisabilities.org.uk/html/frames/fr_main.cfm?page=WN> 
 
one click away.
 
Could someone post me the correct URI, please.
 
thanks
