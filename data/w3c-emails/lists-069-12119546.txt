At our meeting today it was suggested (and we all agreed) to make all
the SHORT TITLES conform to the same part of speech.   The list we came
up with was.

 

Perceivable

Operable

Navigable (including Orientation)

Understandable

Technology Robust

 

In the meeting I had suggested the "Navigable (including Orientation)"
form.  It was the best I/we could come up with. 

I would like to now suggest that we just drop the parenthetical and have

 

Perceivable

Operable

Navigable 

Understandable

Technology Robust

I don't think dropping orientation is a problem.  It still appears in
the long form of that item.   And the idea of orientation is implied by
the combination of Navigable and Understandable.   
     From our discussion I think this would be accepted by everyone on
the Teleconf call too.    But let me know if you think the parenthetical
needs to stay.

THIS IS POSTED TO THE LIST FOR COMMMENT PRIOR TO ACTION

 If there are no objections (or better ideas)  I will proceed to change
them in the Draft.   

Thanks everyone 

 

Gregg
