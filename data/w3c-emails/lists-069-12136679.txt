Hi John

 

Good comments - so let me tackle them one at a time - each in a
different email to facilitate threading.

 

- I see what you mean. This doesn't read well does it.  

but we need to say that there won't be a whole new set of rules...

 

what about: 

 

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group is working
carefully to enable organizations and individuals that have adopted WCAG
1.0 in the past to make a smooth transition to WCAG 2.0.  To facilitate
this WCAG 2.0 is being designed to be a clearer, less technology
specific version of the same principles found in 1.0.    To see how the
two relate please refer to the Checkpoint Mapping Between WCAG 1.0 and
WCAG 2.0 Working Draft.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Current wording

The WCAG Working Group is proceeding carefully to minimize substantial
differences between the WCAG 1.0 Recommendation and the WCAG 2.0 Working
Draft. Refer to the Checkpoint Mapping Between WCAG 1.0 and WCAG 2.0
Working Draft for more detail on current correspondences. 

 

[js: If the goal is to "minimize substantial differences" between 1.0
and 2.0 there's no reason to spend time creating 2.0.  I would propose
something like the following language:

 

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group is working
carefully to enable organizations and individuals that have adopted WCAG
1.0 in the past to make a smooth transition to WCAG 2.0.  To facilitate
this transition, please refer to the Checkpoint Mapping Between WCAG 1.0
and WCAG 2.0 Working Draft for more detail on current correspondences.]
