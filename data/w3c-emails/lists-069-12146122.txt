I think this works very nicely.

 

Anyone not think we should make this edit?

Design Principle

Current wording

The overall goal is to create Web content that is Perceivable, Operable,
Navigable, and Understandable by the broadest possible range of users
and compatible with their wide range of assistive technologies, now and
in the future.

 

[js: Suggest a re-wording to avoid passive voice, as follows:

 

The primary goal is to create Web content that the widest possible range
of persons can perceive, operate, navigate, and understand using the
widest possible range of current and future technologies.]
