I did a chapter a number of years ago that is a good intro.  I did it with
Lyle Lloyd  for the American Speech Hearing and Language Assn (ASHA) for
their book  AUGMENTATIVE COMMUNICATION    - Sarah Blackstone Ph.D.  Editor.


 

If you don't have it in your library let me know - and I'll see if I can
send you a copy of the chapter.

 

There are new picture systems since then  --  and Minspeak has evolved --
but it will give you a good intro.    You can also so a forward reference
search off of the book  or chapter and you should get most newer papers. (if
you chain your search).

 

Here is the chapter.  It was a long one with selection systems and symbols
systems.

components.  In S. W. Blackstone & D. M. Bruskin (Eds.), Augmentative
communication: An introduction (p. 49-161).  Rockville, MD: American Speech,
Language, and Hearing Association.  

 

 

 

Thanks

Thanks for posting this.

 

Can someone point me to resources where I can learn about symbol systems
that are used by people with learning (or other cognitive?) disabilities?
There's at least one reference to such symbolic notations in the Guidelines
that Jonathan sent out, and I've seen a number of other references in
discussions of WCAG; but I haven't known how to follow up.

 

Thanks!

John Slatin

Unfortunately due to the use of frames, the nearest I can get to a uri is

 

http://www.learningdisabilities.org.uk/html/frames/fr_main.cfm?page=WN
<http://www.learningdisabilities.org.uk/html/frames/fr_main.cfm?page=WN> 

 

one click away.

 

Could someone post me the correct URI, please.

 

thanks
