Specifically not specificy.

I would suggest the final sentence as

  This can be done using text on the page, or through the use of metadata
  (EARL [reference] is an example technique).

Also, it isn't just recommended, it is required for level 2 conformance.

And can the information be provided in user-readable format on a different
page? Does there need to be an explicit linkage? (level-2 conformant Mobile
phone content will not, I hope, have its WCAG conformance information in the
page...)

cheers

  3. It is possible and recommended that sites report specificy which
  criteria they have met within each of the guidelines and checkpoints.
  This can be done using explicit text on the page or RDF/EARL (or other
  Metadata approach?).
