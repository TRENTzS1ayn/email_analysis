What about

The WCAG group wants to make sure that people whose content conforms to WCAG
1.0 can make it conform to WCAG 2.0 as easily as possible. The group
is trying to make WCAG 2.0 clearer and easier to use for a wide range of
technology. But the two versions work from the same general principles.

To show how to apply WCAG 2.0 for content that conforms to WCAG 1.0 there is
a mapping from checkpoints in WCAG 1.0 to the requirements of WCAG 2.0.

  but we need to say that there won't be a whole new set of rules...



  what about:



  The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group is working
  carefully to enable organizations and individuals that have adopted WCAG
  1.0 in the past to make a smooth transition to WCAG 2.0.  To facilitate
  this WCAG 2.0 is being designed to be a clearer, less technology
  specific version of the same principles found in 1.0.    To see how the
  two relate please refer to the Checkpoint Mapping Between WCAG 1.0 and
  WCAG 2.0 Working Draft.















  Current wording

  The WCAG Working Group is proceeding carefully to minimize substantial
  differences between the WCAG 1.0 Recommendation and the WCAG 2.0 Working
  Draft. Refer to the Checkpoint Mapping Between WCAG 1.0 and WCAG 2.0
  Working Draft for more detail on current correspondences.



  [js: If the goal is to "minimize substantial differences" between 1.0
  and 2.0 there's no reason to spend time creating 2.0.  I would propose
  something like the following language:



  The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group is working
  carefully to enable organizations and individuals that have adopted WCAG
  1.0 in the past to make a smooth transition to WCAG 2.0.  To facilitate
  this transition, please refer to the Checkpoint Mapping Between WCAG 1.0
  and WCAG 2.0 Working Draft for more detail on current correspondences.]
