I hate the word persons - I prefer people. But that's trivial, and I think

  Design Principle

  Current wording

  The overall goal is to create Web content that is Perceivable, Operable,
  Navigable, and Understandable by the broadest possible range of users
  and compatible with their wide range of assistive technologies, now and
  in the future.



  [js: Suggest a re-wording to avoid passive voice, as follows:



  The primary goal is to create Web content that the widest possible range
  of persons can perceive, operate, navigate, and understand using the
  widest possible range of current and future technologies.]
