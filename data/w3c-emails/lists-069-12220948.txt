Hi,

I too prefer perceptible, although I think it is a question of language style
rather than different meanings.

I am happy about dropping the "(including Orientation)" - that should be an
obvious part of navigable.

I don't think technology robust means anything. I had to look up where it was
being used to get any clue at all. Robust on its own is slightly more
obvious, but I hope another word could be found at some point.

cheers

Chaals

  I would like to now suggest that we just drop the parenthetical and have



  Perceivable

  Operable

  Navigable

  Understandable

  Technology Robust
