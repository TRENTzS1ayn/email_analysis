Hello,

available at:

Summary:
1. we decided to make a few editorial changes to the Requirements document 
before sending it off for publication on TR.  It should be published in the 
next few days.
2. We had some initial discussion of the new WCAG 2.0 Working Draft and 
decided on new short phrases for each guideline.
