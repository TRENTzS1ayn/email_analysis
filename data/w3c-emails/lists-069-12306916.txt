Since "Technology Robust" just leaves people scratching their heads --
how about we just go with ROBUST for now -- and use the full title to
describe what type of ROBUST we mean.  (maybe we will find other types
of Robustness we want to put in there anyway.

That also gives us a complete set of one word items

 Anyone with any other ideas, keep posting them.


Thanks

 

Gregg
