I suppose we should look at the whole doc and use persons or individuals
or people in some consistent fashion. 

I think 'people' tends to read better.  But individuals or persons tends
to highlight individual needs rather than group needs.   Don't know
though.  

I'll create an open issue that says

OPEN ISSUE
When we get near the end and the text is more stable we need to  look at
the whole doc and use persons or individuals or people in some
consistent fashion. 
NOTE:  Does 'people' read better?   Do "Individuals" or "Persons"  tends
to highlight individual needs rather than group needs?   Which is more
important or more like what we are trying to do?    Is variation ok?
Better?  Dependent on sentence?
  

Thanks

 

Gregg
