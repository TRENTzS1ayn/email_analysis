In WCAG 1.0 there was

 

13.7 If search functions are provided, enable different types of
searches for different skill levels and preferences. [Priority  3]

 

this doesn't appear specifically in 2.0

 

this sounds like it should be part of either OPERABLE or UNDERSTANDABLE.
I think it goes in understandable since it sounds like the different
forms are provided because a person wouldn't understand a more complex
form.   

 

It also doesn't sound like a high level checkpoint with  level 1
criteria, but rather a success strategy under another.

 

I was thinking it was 4.3 ish.  (

Checkpoint 4.3 [3.5] Annotate complex, abbreviated, or unfamiliar
information with summaries and definitions

 

But instead it might be 5.4.

Checkpoint 5.4  Ensure that user interfaces are accessible or provide an
accessible alternative. 

If your search function is not clear and simple and easy to operate,
then you should provide an alternative that is.

 

Thoughts?
