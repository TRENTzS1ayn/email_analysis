Aimply srRWS, MY PEOVLWM QIRH WITH THE WHOLE SIMPLICITY ISSUE IS THAT
SIMPLICITY IS NOT SIMPLE.  Simplicity is *hard,* and it's contextual.
Readability indices are problematic, because they rely too heavily on
counting and usually assume that short=good.  But that's not always the
case: you can create a bunch of short sentences that produce a grade-level
readability score of, say 8.0 (eight grade), and have an unintelligible
text, often because they rely so heavily on pronoun reference for cohesion--
but the pronouns lose their antecedents, and you end up with a bunch of
"this" and "that" and "these" that aren't tied to anything.

Grammar checkers, speel checkers, style-checkers, and similar tools are most
effective in the hands of highly skilled writers who know how ti interpret
what those tools offer.  This should come as no surprise: isn't it the same
issue we run into all the time with automated accessibility checkers like
Bobby, AccVerify, etc., etc.?  We remind people that these tools are useful
but no substitute for informed human judgment.  Same goes for writing.

John

Are there things in one of these that we don't have in our guidelines or
techniques docs?  Can someone take a look at these and abstract out
strategies that we should capture in our techniques or strategies.


Thanks
