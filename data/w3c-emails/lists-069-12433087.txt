I spoke with Kerstin Goldsmith from Oracle about the concept of "words" in 
languages like Chinese, Japanese, and Arabic.   I wanted to collect some 
data on how easy it will be to translate the current checkpoint 1.1 [1] 
into other languages.

Kerstin lived in China for several years and has worked in localization for 
a while.

[1] Checkpoint 1.1 For all non-text content that can be expressed in words, 
provide a text equivalent of the function or information the non-text 
content was intended to convey.
