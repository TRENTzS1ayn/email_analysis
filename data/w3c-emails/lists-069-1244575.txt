Marti,
         Thanks for your quick response!!!

         Do you mean that the whole thing is incomprehensible, or did you 
get lost somewhere in the steps?

         I should have added that this rough draft is understandable only 
by a sighted person who is not using any special technology. Is that a 
factor for you? If so, I apologize for the inconvenience.

                                 Anne
