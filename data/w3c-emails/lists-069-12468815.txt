Hello all - I wanted to let you know that I'm moving into a different
role here at work. I'll still be working on accessibility, but with
different responsibilities. Because of this change, I won't be able to
continue as a member of the WCAG working group.  8-(

 

My manager, Heather Swayne, will be finding my replacement. In the
meantime, the one and only Cynthia Shelly will be passing along info to
my team. Thanks, Cynthia!

 

I've enjoyed being part of WCAG and have learned so much from all of
you. Best of luck with WCAG 2.0. 

 

Thank you!
