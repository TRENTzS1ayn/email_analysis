This brings up a discussion I recently had at a conference in New Orleans.
We had a visually impaired presenter tell us that she prefers that images
used solely for layout and convey no information be identified with ALT="".
I maintain the Commonwealth of Virginia portal, and we use ALT="#" (with the
first image identifying what the # stands for).  The reason we do this is
because there didn't seem to be any way for a blind user to tell the
difference between an image with an empty ALT tag and an image someone
FORGOT to ALT tag.  Has there been any discussion (and I apologize if there
has been, as I'm a newbie here) on how to best address this?  Does the NAME
attribute work on all browsers?
