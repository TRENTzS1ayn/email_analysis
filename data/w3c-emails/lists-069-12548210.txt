Which browser is not too relevant for JAWS since the they just use the
browser to get at the HTML which they then parse themselves. So they do know
the difference between alt=quote quote and no alt attribute. When I
discussed the situation that John found, the speaking of the name attribute
on images with alt="", with a developer at Freedom Scientific, his response
was that that was done because authors put alt="" on meaningful images. I
argue that we must support the authors statement that an image carries no
information  - i.e., we must support alt="". In a subsequent update for JAWS
I was told they will honor alt="" on images  which are NOT links; but
continue the process of searching from something to speak (title, name,
etc.) when images are links, which, of course, should not have alt="".

Subject: RE: JAWS and name attribute for IMG


Most of our developers here use Dreamweaver, which sometimes had problems
with null ALT tags (they fixed it with Dreamweaver MX).  I guess we may be
trying to overcompensate for bad design, which often occurs on the
government level.  So many designers just leave off the ALT tags or - even
worse - leave off SOME ALT tags or leave some null that need defining, that
we wanted to make sure people knew when an image was important or not.  A
vision-impaired user will know that the image read as "pound sign" is
nothing important and not have to worry if an image not read was not read
because it was a transparent gif, or not read because someone forgot an ALT
tag that should have said, " ALT = "Clicking on this button will kill a
puppy"

Is it possible to set JAWS to ignore images ALT tagged with a certain
character in the way it ignores null ALT tags?  Or, as may be the case, am I
wasting effort in trying to get around bad design with annoying design?
