In our call we wrestled with 2.1 (new) 

 

 

Some of the approaches from that 

 

 

1.Operable with device independent handlers

-          does this include text input?

-          what are these?

-          do they apply to all technologies?

-          Would they all be operable from keyboard?

 

 

2.Operable from Keyboard

-          assumes all devices have a keyboard?

-          what keys on keyboard?  (function keys too)?

-          what keyboard?  Apple?   PC?

-          Can one assume that a kiosk will have that many keys?

-           

 

3.All functionality is operable using event handlers that can be
activated with commands.

-          can text be input with commands?

-          What does commands mean?

-           

 

4.All functionality is operable via text input plus command
operable events

 

 

5.All functionality operable via text input plus tab, up, down,
left, right, and enter.

(these are the text and command keys that can be ensured would be on all
"keyboards"  (real or virtual).)

 

 

6.All functionality is operable via text input plus
Step-to-next-control, up, down, left, right, and activate.

 

 

Have fun
