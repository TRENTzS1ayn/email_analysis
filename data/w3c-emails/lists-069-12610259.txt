Summary
(also available in easier-to-read HTML at: 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/05/02-minutes.html#summary)

We went through the list of new open issues that Gregg posted on 28 April 
2002.
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002AprJun/0158.html

Here are the resolutions:

** People vs individual/person - Resolved: leave until text is more stable.

**WCAG 1 to WCAG 2 - Resolved: resolve on the list...hard to read the 3 
paragraphs over the phone. Please indicate on the list by next Wednesday (8 
May 2002) which of the 3 alternatives you prefer.

** Parts of conformance statement - Resolved: seems reasonable to add these 
items. They are similar to the WCAG 1.0 conformance statement.

** Definition of "site" - In general, people seemed ok with this 
definition. However, multiple renderings was an issue.

** 5 Magic words - Resolved: Perceivable, Operable, Navigable, 
Understandable, Robust (they don't all need to end in -able).


Other topics discussed:

Resolved: (related to the definintion of "site" issue) on 23 May 2002 we'll 
discuss generated content and different version of content. It would be 
good to make sure that Kynn, Scott Luebking, etc. are present. WAC takes 
the action to remind people to prep for the upcoming discussion.

We generally discussed the new conformance scheme. People don't seem 
opposed to the levels but need some time to see how it has been applied to 
each checkpoint. Resolved: Participants are asked to review and send 
comments to the list by next Wednesday (8 May 2002).

Related to the conformance scheme, John Slatin took an action to write a 
sentence for the conformance paragraph that reflects the decision that 
minimum criteria are testable.

Keyboard input vs character input (current checkpoint 2.1) - no resolution. 
Difficulty determining what we mean by "device independence." WAC took an 
action to discuss with device independent folks next week at the WWW2002 
conference and W3C AC meeting. WG participants are encouraged to read 
Device Independent Principles written by the Device Independence Working Group.
