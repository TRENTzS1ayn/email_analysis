Apologies to anyone who finds me condescending. I'm not, but that doesn't
always come across well (either on line or in person). I can't possibly
condescend because I see everyone on this list as at least an equal. Most of
the time, I feel rather overmatched. But my argumentative style, honed as it
was by adolescent struggles with an aggressive and articulate father, does
turn some people off. I'll be happy if I just get something positive done.

One man's melodrama is another man's understatement.

I would say it was considerably less. But then I already did.

Not my intention to shout, but to allow a person scanning the text to find
the key points faster. I don't think * cuts it, but if all caps is being
misinterpreted, then I'll need to find a better method. Maybe key concepts
should be on separate lines. Maybe a triple *** would be better, but that
might also provide more emphasis than I intended. I'll play around with it.
