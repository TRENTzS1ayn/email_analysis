  ----ALTERNATE 1----

  The WCAG group wants to make sure that people whose content conforms to
  WCAG 1.0 can make it conform to WCAG 2.0 as easily as possible. The
  group is trying to make WCAG 2.0 clearer and easier to use for a wide
  range of technology. But the two versions work from the same general
  principles.

  To show how to apply WCAG 2.0 for content that conforms to WCAG 1.0
  there is a mapping from checkpoints in WCAG 1.0 to the requirements of
  WCAG 2.0.
