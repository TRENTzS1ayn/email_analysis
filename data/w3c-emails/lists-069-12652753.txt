Note to reviewers: Should we include the entire glossary or just the
definitions of terms appearing in the guidelines? We also need to make
sure that the  <http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/Glossary/> glossary definitions
are the same as the definitions which appear in the guidelines
themselves. For now, a simple list of the terms that are defined in this
document are included below. Definitions for each term will be included
at a later date.
