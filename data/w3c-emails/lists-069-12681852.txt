a quick comment.   under section 6 disabilities,  one significant group of people seem to be overlooked.  this is probably partly due to the lack of understanding and embaressment.
AADD (Adult Attention Deficit disorder) and similar disorders.  One of the problems is the distractablity of such individuals which can be made worse by color and "busy" websites
the real solution is a text only monocromatic screen (almost the same requirement as screen readers)  GUI's are a disaster.
the solutions are being able, either locally or via some web based operation to display the content of the site in text.  so far the best viewer is Lynx with some others being usable.

thanks
