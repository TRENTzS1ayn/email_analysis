OK, I think I get where you are at.

As far as I can tell there is some value in being able to say "this thing is
important enough to have a special trigger (either to get there, or to
activate it)". The point is that if we rely on users being able to generate
any character we are lost, and if we can't internationalise this we are still
lost, and if we rely on a certain keyboard layout we are lost.

So as far as I can tell this thing has to be a hint to work. Although it is a
useful thing, and we would like it to work.

In the meantime, if people use it, they can go for things that already work
(seems like there are a handful of numbers) or can hope that it gets fixed
and so use the spec as is.

  Or at least I haven't understood it if there is a coherent approach to
  the blending of input bindings.

  The device independent methods are "comeToMe" and/or "doMeImmediate" and
  the UI bindings for these methods have scopes and have to be blendable
  into the established environment of the delivery context.
