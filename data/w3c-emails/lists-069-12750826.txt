I vote for #2 or #3.  #2 would be better if it really will be a  "clearer,
less technology specific version" as opposed to just our opinion that it is
a "clearer, less technology specific version."

Per discussion on telecon

 

Please vote for the version you like by next Wednesday

 

 

 

Paragraph on WCAG 1 AND 2.0

 

Current proposed wordings.

 

----ALTERNATE 1----

The WCAG group wants to make sure that people whose content conforms to WCAG
1.0 can make it conform to WCAG 2.0 as easily as possible. The group is
trying to make WCAG 2.0 clearer and easier to use for a wide range of
technology. But the two versions work from the same general principles.

 

To show how to apply WCAG 2.0 for content that conforms to WCAG 1.0 there is
a mapping from checkpoints in WCAG 1.0 to the requirements of WCAG 2.0.

 

----ALTERNATE 2----

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group is working carefully
to enable organizations and individuals that have adopted WCAG 1.0 in the
past to make a smooth transition to WCAG 2.0.  To facilitate this WCAG 2.0
is being designed to be a clearer, less technology specific version of the
same principles found in 1.0.    To see how the two relate please refer to
the Checkpoint Mapping Between WCAG 1.0 and  WCAG 2.0 Working Draft.

 

----ALTERNATE 3----

  The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group is working
carefully to enable organizations and individuals that have adopted WCAG 1.0
in the past to make a smooth transition to WCAG 2.0.  To facilitate this
transition, please refer to the Checkpoint Mapping Between WCAG 1.0  and
WCAG 2.0 Working Draft for more detail on current correspondences.]
