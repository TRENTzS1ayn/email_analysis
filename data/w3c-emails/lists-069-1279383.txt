Chas,

         Thanks for your prompt response.

         When I wrote the note to this list to check out the simulation, I 
also sent a note to a friend who is the expert needed to turn this idea 
into the real thing .... He will certainly make improvements in my choice 
of question .... and may or may not change it to a free input .... yes the 
multiple choice is misleading ... this is the first draft of the idea ... 
not a polished product.

         There is no guarantee that a given individual will be able to 
understand a particular passage or text, a picture, a sound file, or a 
multi-media .... but if the presentation mode is inadequate the individual 
cannot choose the modality that is best for them ... I have a student who 
comes in the lab with the severely disabled class, who at age five had less 
than a year's worth of cognition on board .... He is still learning to 
focus on the screen, and occasionally experiences changes on the 
screen/sound initiated by his touching anything on the keyboard or mouse 
... He will not be able to gain anything from the web for awhile yet .... 
but his classmates with more cognition on board are learning to use the 
Internet as well as specially designed games.

         One thing that is on my version of this eventual simulation is 
that I greeked out every word that was not on the word list ---- ruthlessly 
..... in the case of a real person with a cognitive, reading or learning 
disability is that the individual will have a reading vocabulary beyond 
that of the word list, which may or may not include vocabulary on the 
target page ... but I'm not sure how to duplicate that without making the 
simulation less than "authentic" ... (which is where the expert comes in .... )

                                                 Anne
