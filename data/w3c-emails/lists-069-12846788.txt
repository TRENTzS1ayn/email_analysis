Since in WCAG 2.0 we aren't including any technology-specific
requirements at the checkpoint level, but instead generalizing them so
as to apply across relevant technologies, what would you suggest as an
appropriate checkpoint to meet the need which the above example
illustrates? What is the accessibility problem, is it covered by any
of our existing checkpoints, and if not, what is the general access
requirement that is missing from the guidelines?

Perhaps guideline 5 would be pertinent here, as its purpose is to
discuss technical robustness; or maybe  guideline 1?

Either way, the techniques documents (especially CSS techniques) will
discuss style sheets in detail.

There are still issues of backward compatibility and choice of
technology under guideline 5 to be worked out.

The most important point is to identify, at a fundamental level, what
the requirement is, independently of specific technologies, and to
make sure it is specified appropriately in the guidelines.
