Jason,
There are too many people who think they can use images to stylize text
and just use ALT text to make it accessible. This is a big problem for low
vision users:

1. Most popular browsers do not support the rendering of ALT text for area
elements.  I just reviewed a web site that the developers thought was
accessible (passed some level of WCAG) and I told them it was not
functaionally accessible because they used AREA elements to define links
and they are not rendered by Opera 6.0, IE 6.0 or Netscape 6.2 when
images are configured to be turned off.

2. Control over the styling of ALT text is limited in many browsers.  For
example IE does not provide much control over styling, so the text is
often very small when compared to other text in a high contrast rendering.
Users cannot make it bigger, even when adding user style sheets.

3. I also think that using images to stylize text promotes a graphical
view of the web.  People can think "I can use images all I want and be
accessible by putting in ALT text".  I think this should not be considered
good practice for accessible designs.


So I think a more general checkpoint would be to not use images to stylize
text.  This provides an accessible design oriented requirement, rather
than the current repair oriented requirement of providing text equivalents
for non-text content.
