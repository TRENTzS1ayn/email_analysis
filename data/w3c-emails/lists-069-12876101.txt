  Obviously. For this reason a simple anchor will do better.
  Furthermore, XHTML Basic is in XHTML 1.0 and I believe it's not
  reasonable to convert it to XHTML 1.1 to add ruby.

  You may check this out at http://w3.hotbox.ru/TR/2000/REC-xhtml-basic-20001219
  The translation is linked to a large list of terms/abbreviations/acronyms at
  http://w3.hotbox.ru/TR/2000/REC-xhtml-basic-20001219/glossary.html
  Comments are welcome.

  You definitely were. There's no such problem nowadays but it may
  emerge in the future (IMHO). Apart from this xml:lang helps screen
  readers to get the right pronunciation.

Thanks to everyone for the help.
Best wishes.
