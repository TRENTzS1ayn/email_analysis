Absolutely.

And again, "hear, hear".

What doesn't seem entirely satisfactory is, as was said earlier on the
thread, that images are often used to stand for empty space; but
alt=" " (quote space unquote) is apparently deprecated or unsupported
for this purpose.  I'm never quite sure whether to code alt=" "
anyway, and ignore the deprecation, or code alt="&nbsp;" or
equivalent. Sure: ideally one shouldn't be using images for that
purpose anyway, but sometimes there are other constraints.

Now, excuse me for a bit of a digression, but as for the suggestion
earlier on this thread, to code alt="#" and have it read as "pound
sign", might I point out that according to international standards the
"pound sign" is iso-8859-1 character number 163, expressed as &pound;
in HTML.  If I heard "pound sign" read out, I would not associate it
as some irrelevant placeholder, but a rather important indicator of
"money".  *smile*

According to international standards (the us-ascii code falls into
line with iso-8859-1 and Unicode in this regard), the official name of
the "#" character is "number sign".

But that was a digression, as I don't believe we should be doing that
anyway, as you apparently agree.

best regards
