Hi Matthew,

I think the first answer to your question is that PICS, and its replacement
RDF, and P3P (which is written in RDF), aren't designed for direct
presentation. They are designed to encode information for machines, although
access to that via a user interface (for example setting PICS controls in a
browser) is sometimes required.

That kind of interface is likely to be covered by principles in WCAG, and
also in the User Agent Accessibility Guideines. The WAI Protocols and Formats
group http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF looks at whether things like P3P (and RDF,
XML, and all the other things W3C works on) have enough in them to ensure
that they can be used for an accessible user interface.

At least that's my personal understanding...

cheers

  While in the process of investigating requirements for a web site, I've made
  my way through HTML, CSS, WCAG, P3P, PICS, DCMES, IEEE, etc.

  I'm wondering why WCAG 2.0 doesn't include provisions for P3P & PICS
  technologies ? I've looked through WCAG 2.0 issues, but to no avail.
