After considering the 3 alternatives, I'm proposing ALTERNATE 4:
 
 
WCAG 2.0 is based on the same principles as WCAG 1.0. However, it
is designed to be less technology-specific so that it is clearer
and easier to apply those principles to a wide range of technologies.
The Checkpoint Mapping Between WCAG 1.0 and WCAG 2.0 Working Draft 
shows the way that the principles of WCAG 1.0 have been generalized
in WCAG 2.0.
