Paul,

         I agree, and have probably said already too many times, that until 
we say there is a need for illustrations we cannot begin to address the 
issues of "how to" illustrate        "clearly and simply" .... there are 
times when a bad photo is better than nothing!  (an example is my kids' 
page of Famous Americans ... can't find a picture of one of the FA's the 
kids have to learn about, Susan B. Anthony, because there are apparently no 
pictures of her smiling ... so a drawing that shows a half smile, with the 
"grouchy" pictures as back up, were the solution) .... not as "clear and 
simple" as I would like the page to be ...but A picture is often better 
than NO picture!

                                                 Anne
