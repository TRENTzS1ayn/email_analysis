Yes I am. But that isn't a problem - most web pages already are. It is just a
question of how we phrase the requirement, so we can ensure that we aren't
accidentally excluding something, or requiring an implementation detail too
specific for the use cases we have.

  Are you saying that all web pages have to be navigable and operable from
  a phone keypad that doesn't even support tab?
