Loretta's rewrite seems to capture nicely the objectives of the previous
versions.

Please comment on this wording.  
Also, if you like the others better - please comment.

 After considering the 3 alternatives, I'm proposing ALTERNATE 4:
 
WCAG 2.0 is based on the same principles as WCAG 1.0. However, it is
designed to be less technology-specific so that it is clearer and easier
to apply those principles to a wide range of technologies. The
Checkpoint Mapping between WCAG 1.0 and WCAG 2.0 Working Draft shows the
way that the principles of WCAG 1.0 have been generalized in WCAG 2
