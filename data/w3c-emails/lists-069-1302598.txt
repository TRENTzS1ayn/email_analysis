(apologies to Duke Ellington for this paraphrase of "I Don't Know What Kind 
of Blues I've Got")

The CP 3.3 Blues
_____________________________________
There's two kinds of simple
And two kinds of clear
And two ways of trying to make fog disappear
There's insiders' jargon
And common folks' jive
One makes it too boring
The other brings it alive
Well, I don't know
What kind of prose to write.
