Per discussion on telecon
?
Please vote for the version you like by next Wednesday

Paragraph on WCAG 1 AND 2.0
?
Current proposed wordings.
?
----ALTERNATE 1----
The WCAG group wants to make sure that people whose content conforms to
WCAG 1.0 can make it conform to WCAG 2.0 as easily as possible. The
group is trying to make WCAG 2.0 clearer and easier to use for a wide
range of technology. But the two versions work from the same general
principles.
?
To show how to apply WCAG 2.0 for content that conforms to WCAG 1.0
there is a mapping from checkpoints in WCAG 1.0 to the requirements of
WCAG 2.0.
?
----ALTERNATE 2----
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group is working
carefully to enable organizations and individuals that have adopted WCAG
1.0 in the past to make a smooth transition to WCAG 2.0.? To facilitate
this WCAG 2.0 is being designed to be a clearer, less
technology?specific version of the same principles found in 1.0.??? To
see how the two relate please refer to the Checkpoint Mapping Between
WCAG 1.0 and? WCAG 2.0 Working Draft.
?
----ALTERNATE 3----
? The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group is
working?carefully to enable organizations and individuals that have
adopted WCAG?1.0 in the past to make a smooth transition to WCAG 2.0.?
To facilitate?this transition, please refer to the Checkpoint Mapping
Between WCAG 1.0? and WCAG 2.0 Working Draft for more detail on current
correspondences.]
