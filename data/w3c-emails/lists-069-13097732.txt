I really like the way Loretta expressed the relationship, but I would like it
to be more explicit about the updagrade path. Something like

"Sites which conform to WCAG 1.0 may already conform to WCAG 2.0, since many
requirements are the same. However, not all sites will conform to both
guidelines. The checkpoint mapping will help in evaluating a site whose
conformance to WCAG 1.0 is already known."

(I would like simpler wording than that though - any offers?)

Cheers
