1. We shall continue discussion of the items on last week's agenda,
   resuming at checkpoint 2.1. See
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002AprJun/0172.html

2. If time permits, we should commence discussion of issues
   surrounding guideline 5 and its success criteria.

Note that Wendy will be unavailable this week and next, so we need
volunteers to take notes.

like to discuss, please bring them to the meeting.
