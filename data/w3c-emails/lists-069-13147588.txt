I still think they should be removed since there's no information
except somehow if you've followed the pre-history of the document.
So presumably, this information is only for WG participants. How
about a note in the next version that says "The following issues
were subsumed: Nx, Ny, .... Please refer to the WG issues list
(or archives or wherever this information is found) for information
about these issues."

Otherwise they distracted me more than if some numbers had
been skipped.

Both of my suggestions #4 and #5 reflect my confusion about
statements in the requirements documents, and therefore I do think
those statements should be reviewed.

The metadata comments confused me. The comment about being
able to choose to not satisfy a checkpoint concerned me since it
seems inconsistent with conformance (unless it isn't inconsistent,
but that's not clear from the document).

Here's what I think I understand:

  a) For some users, alternatives will be necessary.
  b) In terms of WCAG 2.0, it doesn't matter whether the alternatives
     reside on the client-side or server-side, as long as the user
     can get them.

What is confusing is the expression "at the same URI". I first
read this to mean "by dereferencing a single URI" (which implied
content negotiation) rather than as "there must be a single Web
page that includes links to all alternatives" (or something 
similar). Thus, I think clarification is necessary.

Meanwhile, if I were to rate the requirement, I would give it
a P2. It seems like a P1 that the alternatives exist (and perhaps
I should have to provide URIs to all alternatives in a conformance
claim). It seems like a P2 to have access to all alternatives from
a single location.
