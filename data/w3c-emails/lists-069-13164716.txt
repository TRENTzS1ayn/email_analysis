Should the rationale under each checkpoint be stratified by
conformance level? That is, should it be explicit as to who will most
likely benefit from level 1 conformance, who will still be
excluded unless level 2 or level 3 is met, and, where applicable, what
the limitations of the checkpoint as regards making the content
accessible?

I recall a memorable statement by Charles McCathieNevile at a WCAG
meeting (last November, if memory serves) to the effect that he wanted
content developers and policy setters, via the guideline, to be aware
of whom they were including and excluding by taking certain design
decisions; and that the conformance scheme should facilitate such
awareness. [Charles, please correct me if this summary misrepresents
your assertions at the meeting.]
