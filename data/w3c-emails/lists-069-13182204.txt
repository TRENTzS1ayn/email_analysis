  1. We shall continue discussion of the items on last week's agenda,
     resuming at checkpoint 2.1. See
     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002AprJun/0172.html

  2. If time permits, we should commence discussion of issues
     surrounding guideline 5 and its success criteria.

  Note that Wendy will be unavailable this week and next, so we need
  volunteers to take notes.

  If there are any action items that you have been working on and would
  like to discuss, please bring them to the meeting.
