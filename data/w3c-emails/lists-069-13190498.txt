Jason, your memory is (not surprisingly, in my experience <grin/>) correct.
I
think that if we are setting confromance level criteria we should specify at
each level who is benefitting and who is not.

  Should the rationale under each checkpoint be stratified by

  the limitations of the checkpoint as regards making the content
  accessible?

  I recall a memorable statement by Charles McCathieNevile at a WCAG
  meeting (last November, if memory serves) to the effect that he wanted
  content developers and policy setters, via the guideline, to be aware
  of whom they were including and excluding by taking certain design
  decisions; and that the conformance scheme should facilitate such
  awareness. [Charles, please correct me if this summary misrepresents
  your assertions at the meeting.]
