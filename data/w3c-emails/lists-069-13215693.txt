On the bragging rights of level2:

Naturally I've always imagined that reviewing websites could provide an 
income streamfor people with severe learning difficulties(and their 
assistants).

Perhaps a little more authority could be attained by including a 
statement to the effect that level 2 conformance meant that users with 
given disabilities had asserted the pages were accessible, rather than 
merely the 'reviewer'.

This could be something like amateur referees initially.

thanks
