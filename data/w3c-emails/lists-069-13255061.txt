RE:  Specific Benefits and People Excluded - by level for each
checkpoint


We have the coverage by disability provided in the benefits section for
each checkpoint.   

I don't think it is practical to do it by level for most checkpoints.
Usually all benefit some at each level.  Some just benefit more as you
go down.  Some - but usually rarely - receive no benefit as you have
deeper levels.    

Providing a list as to who would be excluded until you got down to a
lower level would require detailed descriptions of combinations of
disabilities, skills, technologies and web content.  

So I think we need to stay with benefits by checkpoint rather than
Levels.   It may work for some checkpoints but not all or most.

Anyone is welcome though to prove me wrong.    Would be wonderful
information if we could do it accurately.
