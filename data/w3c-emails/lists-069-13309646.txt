With regards to this:

I recall this being a discussion a few months back, and as I see it, it
falls under the checkpoint 3.1: When an appropriate markup language
exists, use markup rather than images to convey information.

As far as I am concerned, the issues you raised are user agent problems,
not content problems, and perhaps you should take it up with the UAAG
Working Group. No "appropriate markup language" currently exists that
properly imitates what images of text can illustrate.

So including a checkpoint to "not use images to stylize text" is
essentially taking the onus off user agents to deal with the problems
you have identified. I do agree however, that they are issues very real
to people with vision impairments.
