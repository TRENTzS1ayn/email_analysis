In view of the anticipated development of symbolic language and the general need of clear writing, I think there is a definitive need for controlled use of language. But, as has been pointed  out, web authors will not like to use one. So I want to develop a standard technique for marking up typical electronic textual content, and referencing textual content, so that it's meaning becomes unambiguous, translatable and machine-readable.
I think this is better done of the list, but if anyone wants to join me on this, please let me know. Be prepared for it to be a long process.

Please feel free not to bother telling me why you think it is undue burden or not necessary. 

Thank you all.
