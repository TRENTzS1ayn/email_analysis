I can not make it as it is a Jewish festival tonight.

my comments are:
1, I like Kynns modular approach much better. We need a more flexible system
if we are not going to discriminate against some disabilities within the
guidelines (even if it is just in terms of numbers)

2 on
" Absolute essentials.  If these aren't done - most everyone in a major
disability group can't access the information.  (e.g. no
captions)"
Please note the largest disabilities groups are thoughs with cognitive
disabilities. There needs must be addressed as P1 or equivalent.

3.
Minimal conformance to a guideline may require some testability. That does
not  mean that checkpoints without testability need to be demoted for
prioritization levels as well.
