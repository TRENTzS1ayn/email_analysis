Thursday, 16 May, 20:00 UTC - 4 PM US Eastern, 10 PM France, 6 AM
Eastern Australia, on +1-617-252-1038:

1. The conformance scheme. See Gregg's latest summary to the list at
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002AprJun/0266.html

2. Guideline 5. Issues related to guideline 5 arose at last week's
   meeting; thus it seems best to address them directly. Note that
   Cynthia's proposed reworking of guideline 5 is included in the
   latest internal working draft.
