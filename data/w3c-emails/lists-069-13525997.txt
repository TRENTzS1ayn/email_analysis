The latest draft indicates a need for more examples at the end of the
informative section under Checkpoint 1.3. Here are two suggestions that
I thought might be good candidates. 

Example 3: a 3-dimensional site map.
A custom user interface renders 3D visualizations of the pages on a site
and how they relate to one another from a data source. Any hierarchical
relationships, groupings, cross-references, etc. would originate in the
data source so that alternate interfaces could be rendered (from the
same source) that expose the structure of the site in an accessible
form. (See also checkpoint 5.4)
?
Example 4: a list that allows users to sort information on a page
according to preference.
A script allows a user to rearrange a categorical listing of music files
by date, artist, genre, or file size. The script updates both the
structure and the presentation accordingly when generating alternate
views.
 
Comments? Questions? Suggestions? 

Thanks,

-Ben
