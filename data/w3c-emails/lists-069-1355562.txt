I see that using all caps to make things stand out was a bad idea. (So much
for the null hypothesis.)

My point exactly. Your "experiment" wasn't one. But it will be perceived as
one because it implies certain conclusions. And some people -- especially
those with an axe to grind -- will rush to those conclusions. If there is
any value to this checkpoint count it is as a generator of hypotheses that
can be tested under controlled conditions. Put simply, I think that we could
have achieved the same positive result without all the potential negative
results. And I think it was a bad idea to post your results to the IG list
rather than the GL list. It is much more likely to be cross-posted and
misinterpreted there than here.
