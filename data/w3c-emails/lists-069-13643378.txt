Hi Lisa, 

    Thanks for comments.   

I follow them - and we are increasingly using metadata in the
recommendations,  -  but am not sure exactly what you mean for us to do.

Do you have specific recommendations for wording changes in the
guidelines to reflect this that you would like to propose?

Gregg
