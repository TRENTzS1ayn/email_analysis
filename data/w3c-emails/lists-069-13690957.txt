Would the suggestion then be that implementors ought to be permitted
to make assertions in metadata regarding the checkpoints which they
have satisfied, even if they haven't met the minimal requirements of
conformance?

Presumably a tool which reads the metadata could distinguish between
accessibility-related assertions not amounting to a conformance claim,
but which might still be helpful to the user, and an actual assertion
of conformance to the guidelines.
