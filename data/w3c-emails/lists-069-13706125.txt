The attached document includes the relevant portions of the WCAG 2
appendix for review/comment/possible inclusion in the next draft. This
section was inadvertently dropped from the April 24 draft.

Proposed changes (from the Oct. 26 draft) include: 

1) a slightly reworded issue in Appendix A (glossary) (now reads as a
reviewers note). 

2) an update to gl.xsl to automatically include a simple list of the
terms defined in the document. Once the document settles down and the
issue on what terms need to go in is resolved, we can insert other terms
(if necessary) and include the definitions in their entirety. 

3) A simplification of the contributors list so that, rather than
maintaining two lists of names while the document evolves, the
contributors section (appendix B) now points directly to
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/participants.html 

4) updates to the improvements section (Appendix C) to reflect goals
from the new requirements document. At this point, only the list appears
in the appendix and a link to the recently published requirements doc
was added. 

5) slight modifications to Appendix D so that it reads as a reviewers
note.

All the best,

-Ben
