Question -

How does the document at the following link apply to xhtml?
http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TECHS/

I am being required to comply with said document for accessibility reasons
but in many ways it seems out of date.

Where can I locate a set of guidelines regarding Accessibility, that is
pertinent to xhtml?

- Dan
