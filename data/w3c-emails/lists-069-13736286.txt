The document doesn't address XHTML specifically, since XHTML was not yet a
Recommendation when it was originally published in 1999.

The HTML techniques[1] document for WCAG 2.0 will contain XHTML techniques,
but it's not presently in a state I would call authoritative.

I think that the best way presently to claim compliance to a set of
guidelines relating to XHTML right now would be to follow both the HTML
techniques for WCAG 1 and the XML Accessibility Guidelines [2], and where
the HTML techniques are lacking or the two conflict, taking guidance from
XAG. XAG is designed for developers creating their own XML-based language,
but may point you in the right direction.

It is important to note, however, that support for XHTML may be sporadic
among assistive technologies, and some may need to make use of out-of-date
techniques.

Are you having any specific hangups that someone could clarify?
