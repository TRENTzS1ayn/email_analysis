Has anyone seen an example of the following:

a static link that is the place-holder for a current picture?

for example this could be a picture of the singer from the current No1 
single, where the link name and address is static from week to week, or 
a news site where the image changes from day to day, but the link is static.

Rationale: we have a lot of work updating our links, which could 
possibly be avoided.

thanks
