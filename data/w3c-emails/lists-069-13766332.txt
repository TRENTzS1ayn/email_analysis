As of version 1.1, the features of XHTML are identical to those of
HTML 4.01, for which the original WCAG 1.0 techniques were written.
Thus unless you plan to create your own modules (in which case I would
suggest reading the draft XML accessibility guidelines) it should be
entirely possible to apply the existing HTML techniques to XHTML
content. Of course, if you use any of the basic modules (i.e., basic
tables) rather than the full version), you won't be able to apply
techniques that rely on features which are not included in your chosen
XHTML modules. Usually however, alternative techniques are provided
for each checkpoint in the guidelines.

I also agree with Matt that reviewing the WCAG 2.0 HTML techniques
draft, of which he is the primary author, would be useful.
