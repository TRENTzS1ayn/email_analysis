Chas,

         Once again, you and Kynn are in agreement that what he wrote in no 
way approached the scope of an experiment, although it was an important 
first step towards what may at some point be a more scientific study to 
determine if it is a "problem" or just a part of the process.

         In any event, keep your eye on being part of the solution instead 
of the problem. And, next time you're surfing, look up Net Etiquette and 
save yourself some embarrassment. (Advice from the nearly elderly, ignore 
as you please! <grin>)

                                         Anne
