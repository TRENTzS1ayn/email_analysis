Hello,

For those of you who help take minutes, you can now generate an HTML file 
with the structure that I use.

Using a browser, go to: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/,new

You will have the choice of three templates. Choose, 
"/WAI/GL/Templates/minutes.html"

It will give you 6 fields to fill in:
1. the date of the teleconference/meeting
2. the month of the teleconference/meeting
3. the year of the teleconference/meeting
4. the URI of the previous meeting minutes
5. Your name
6. A uri for you (a web page, an email address) or whatever.  (you may 
leave this empty)

The date, month, and year are filled in with the date the page is generated.

This will generate a file with a long URI.  Save that file to your disk. 
Rename it whatever you wish. Take minutes, then mail the file as an 
attachment to the list.

Any questions?

Thanks,
--wendy
