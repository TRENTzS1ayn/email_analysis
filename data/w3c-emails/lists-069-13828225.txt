I have today changed the links here: http://www.learningdifficulty.org/develop/papers.html
that previously pointed to "making the web special" , and "making communication special" on your site.
They now point to copies obtained from google.

Please advise me when you place updated versions on the web, and I shall arrange to link to them.

thank you 

jonathan chetwynd
