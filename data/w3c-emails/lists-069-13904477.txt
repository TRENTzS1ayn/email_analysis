I checked with Lars Borg, one of Adobe's color scientists, about the best way 
to evaluate the contrast between two RGB colors. Here is his advice:

Convert each color to Lab, then calculate the length of the difference 
vector in Lab (also known as deltaE). The distance is a fairly 
consistent measure of color difference. Contrasting colors may need a 
deltaE of 40 or more. (This needs to be verified.)
