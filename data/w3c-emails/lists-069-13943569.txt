I would like to object to 4.1 (and 4.2) - write as clearly and simply as
author feels appropriate for the content

I would prefer that the checkpoint is omitted entirely.

As it stands a site that is entirely inaccessible to people in terms of
conforms to 4.1 can claim conformance to 4.1.
This will serve to confuse people as to what sites are and are not
accessible to them


I also feel that "as appropriate for content " is offensive as most people
are not thinking in terms of linguistic art, but in terms of abilities.

In other words people will assume that WCAG thinks that there is content
were people with severe cognitive disabilities could not understand. I
prefer such a checkpoint should not be written

Thanks
Lisa
