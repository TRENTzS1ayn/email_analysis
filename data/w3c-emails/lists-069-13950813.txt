May 30 telecon highlightsOk I am calling 4.1, still  3.3

I mean the same thing.

were is avoid confusing and distracting content?


individual comments:
     Acronyms and Abbreviations are defined the first time they appear in
text.      -    without a short term memory, acronyms remain confusing. Mark
them up, all the time.

We must have make each word unambiguous or Hebrew and Arabic without Vowels
will stay acceptable

Lots of stuff in 4.1 missed out, (see
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002JanMar/0346.html)
from the work done on the last including:
Highlight key information,
    use active voicing in instructions, visual references, absolute
reference (rather than relative ones)
 simplest word (for lowest reading age in the area were the highest %of
target audience) that does not change the meaning,
provide a mode with minimum functionality. - Eliminate or hide what isn't
essential. with simple screen layouts or one thing at a time presentation.
Use prompts for procedures and support decision making.
Structure tasks, provide step-by-step instructions Use a two-step "select
and confirm" to reduce accidental selections,
especially for critical functions ,cue sequences, use goal/action structure
for menu prompts, definite feedback cues,Provide defaults and make it easy
to re-establish them. calculation assistance, or reduce the need to
calculate.






Also I made a review of  links from Greg not that long ago

from:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002AprJun/0205.html
Lots of good stuff:
Do not use more then one negative in a sentence....
Use simple verb tenses.
Avoid split infinitives

omit needless words
 Use concrete words
avoid redundancy ?(we would need to add that this is
only redundancy in text itself)
 Avoid noun sandwiches e.g.: Underground mine worker
safety protection procedures development (add "OF" AND "FOR")
 Readable sentences are
simple, active, affirmative, and declarative.
Use a known Lexicon, and stick to it
They recommend this by:
State one thing and only one thing in each sentence.


Divide long sentences into two or three short sentences.

Remove all unnecessary words. Strive for a simple sentence with a
subject and verb. Eliminate unnecessary modifiers.

[Include in WCAG ?] If only one or two simple conditions must be met
before a rule applies, state the conditions first and then state the
rule.

[Include in WCAG ?] If two or more complex conditions must be met before
a rule applies, state the rule first and then state the conditions.


[Include in WCAG ?] Use language consistently
