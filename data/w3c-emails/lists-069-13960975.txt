I have to agree with Lisa, the present guideline 4.1[3.3] offensive in part.

there is no mention of peer review, which is the standard and recognised 
method for assessment.

please find below an edited version:


      Checkpoint 4.1 [3.3] Write as clearly and simply as is possible.

          You will have successfully met Checkpoint 4.1 at the Minimum

      possible*


          You will have successfully met Checkpoint 4.1 at Level 2 if:
