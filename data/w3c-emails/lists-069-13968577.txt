I think the requirement belongs, but I agree that "as the author feels
appropriate" weakens the requirement beyond any point of usefulness. It also
makes self-fulfilling the claim (which I do not believe as consensus) that it
is not possible to provide relatively objective success criteria (our 80%
rule) for this checkpoint.

How about "Use language that is easy to understand" as the text. This makes
no comment on the complexity of the content being described, does not attempt
to incorporate success criteria such as "what the author thinks is
appropriate" into the checkpoint, and allows for success criteria to be
provided as well as additional techniques to be offered.

Cheers

Charles

  I would prefer that the checkpoint is omitted entirely.

  As it stands a site that is entirely inaccessible to people in terms of
  conforms to 4.1 can claim conformance to 4.1.
  This will serve to confuse people as to what sites are and are not
  accessible to them


  I also feel that "as appropriate for content " is offensive as most people
  are not thinking in terms of linguistic art, but in terms of abilities.

  In other words people will assume that WCAG thinks that there is content
  were people with severe cognitive disabilities could not understand. I
  prefer such a checkpoint should not be written

  Thanks
