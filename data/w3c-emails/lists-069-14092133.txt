Well you can not prove absolutely that a alt tag is a text equivalent. But
we have spent month of work pulling out criteria that takes you there in
most cases (e.g. if a word can be replaced with an easer word -one that is
understood by a lower age grope - without changing the meaning then use
that.

 Which leads to the problem of how to determine if something has been
written in a way that everyone can understand.  I've seen "clearly written"
documents that are so poorly done as to mean multiple things from what was
intended.  But you can't dictate good writing style, can you?

I concur with Chaals.  However, I have the same question as before.

If we say this, are we saying that the content must be written to a
level
that everyone would understand.  If a thesis, article, or scientific
paper
is published on the Internet so others might be able to use the
information,
is this then required to be easily understood by everyone?

It seems constraining and possibly discrediting to the individual's work
or
studies. Or even discrediting to the business' research.  If we go to
the
library and do research on a scientific research project we expect to
see
tough language and concepts.  Wouldn't this also apply to the Internet?

Thanks,
Lee

I think the requirement belongs, but I agree that "as the author feels
appropriate" weakens the requirement beyond any point of usefulness. It
also
makes self-fulfilling the claim (which I do not believe as consensus)
that
it
is not possible to provide relatively objective success criteria (our
80%
rule) for this checkpoint.

How about "Use language that is easy to understand" as the text. This
makes
no comment on the complexity of the content being described, does not
attempt
to incorporate success criteria such as "what the author thinks is
appropriate" into the checkpoint, and allows for success criteria to be
provided as well as additional techniques to be offered.

Cheers

  I would prefer that the checkpoint is omitted entirely.

  As it stands a site that is entirely inaccessible to people in terms
of
  conforms to 4.1 can claim conformance to 4.1.
  This will serve to confuse people as to what sites are and are not
  accessible to them


  I also feel that "as appropriate for content " is offensive as most
people
  are not thinking in terms of linguistic art, but in terms of
abilities.

  In other words people will assume that WCAG thinks that there is
content
  were people with severe cognitive disabilities could not understand. I
  prefer such a checkpoint should not be written
