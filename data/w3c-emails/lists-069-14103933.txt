That is the problem, People assume that their target audience does not have
people with cognitive disabilities. Everyone Assumes that. but their is no
audience were you can know that no one is developing senility, or has LD or
many other common courses of cognition impairments without actually testing
everyone in your audience.

All the best
Lisa

I agree with Lee and Charles. "Use language that is easy to understand" is a
better wording for the checkpoint, but it is still constraining. Something
more along the lines of "Use language that is easily understandable by the
content's intended audience" ?

I concur with Chaals.  However, I have the same question as before.

If we say this, are we saying that the content must be written to a level
that everyone would understand.  If a thesis, article, or scientific paper
is published on the Internet so others might be able to use the information,
is this then required to be easily understood by everyone?

It seems constraining and possibly discrediting to the individual's work or
studies. Or even discrediting to the business' research.  If we go to the
library and do research on a scientific research project we expect to see
tough language and concepts.  Wouldn't this also apply to the Internet?

Thanks,
Lee

I think the requirement belongs, but I agree that "as the author feels
appropriate" weakens the requirement beyond any point of usefulness. It also
makes self-fulfilling the claim (which I do not believe as consensus) that
it
is not possible to provide relatively objective success criteria (our 80%
rule) for this checkpoint.

How about "Use language that is easy to understand" as the text. This makes
no comment on the complexity of the content being described, does not
attempt
to incorporate success criteria such as "what the author thinks is
appropriate" into the checkpoint, and allows for success criteria to be
provided as well as additional techniques to be offered.

Cheers

Charles

  I would prefer that the checkpoint is omitted entirely.

  As it stands a site that is entirely inaccessible to people in terms of
  conforms to 4.1 can claim conformance to 4.1.
  This will serve to confuse people as to what sites are and are not
  accessible to them


  I also feel that "as appropriate for content " is offensive as most people
  are not thinking in terms of linguistic art, but in terms of abilities.

  In other words people will assume that WCAG thinks that there is content
  were people with severe cognitive disabilities could not understand. I
  prefer such a checkpoint should not be written

  Thanks
