I don't think it matters.

One could argue that the "technology" should be the first guideline because 
if one hasn't attended to validation, etc. the rest will never get right. 
Or one could just argue to be arguing. Hence my indifference to this 
particular issue. We could put all the checkpoints into a randomizer basket 
and get a different sequence to the reader each time it was accessed, or...

The thing is now "public" and the possibility that meaningful issues will 
arise from without now is upon us (I should say "you"!). And we haven't 
even heard from Eric in a long time.
