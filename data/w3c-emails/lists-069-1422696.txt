Chas,

         You are discussing the presentation of the guidelines, not their 
content.

         Any linear presentation of the guidelines is faulty because we are 
using the web. William's simplified site allows the user to choose the 
order in which to use the guidelines. In your presentation, I could quibble 
over interchanging 2 and 3 because when I make web pages, I do presentation 
with content before navigation and technology.  So, my ideal use would be 
different than yours. On the other hand, there are some considerations of 
the amount of work to meet technology needs that should be considered when 
collecting the content, so perhaps the designer should see that first  ....

                         It's a User Thang!

(Am I sounding like William?)

                                                 Anne
