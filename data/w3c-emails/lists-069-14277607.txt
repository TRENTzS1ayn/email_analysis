No, I don't make this assumption. I agree with you that there isn't an
absolute seperation. But I do assume that in many practical circumstances
there is more than one way of saying what we want to say. So, as Lisa said,
we should tell authors to choose the most accessible way.

As an example I don't suggest that we should explain what DNA is in every
case we use it. In general we should clarify that we mean "deoxyribonucleic
acid" and not "discrimantory node association". Our tools should make it easy
to do so, in the ways that the web supports well. If it is a normal term to
use in a given document that should be sufficient - the web allows people to
find further information on it if they need it.

We should not say "the double-helical molecule formed of sequential chains of
compatibly paired adenine, guanine, somethingine and theotherine which is
found in the central nucleus of the cell" very often, because that is more
complex language than we normally need.

One of the suggested success criteria from the meeting in Melbourne was that
the appropriate terms be used. That is different from using very long
convoluted sentences and paragraphs when it is possible to say the same thing
using "plain language".

What we are trying to do, I think, is work out what are the success criteria
that we can apply. Most of the suggestions have been to do with ways of
writing a sentence or a paragraph. They are very similar to the suggestions
we seem to accept of ways to structure a page or a collection of pages.

Cheers
