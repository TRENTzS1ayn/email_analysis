I dont think it is so much that we all get the same message, whatever that
might mean, rather that we all get a handle.
one person visiting the opera might come away with the score, another might
only have a title.
They both have a handle.
So it is important that we ensure that all users get a reasonable handle on
resources.

I do have to say that I have found the linux community incredibly patient
and willing to help explain minutae.
similarly juries are expected to make decisions about events well outside
their life experience.
finally when using google we all come across documents not written for us,
but which we non the less need to be able to interpret.
