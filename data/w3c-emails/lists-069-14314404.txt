Isn't it part of the commons that most people visiting any given web page,
are not interested in its content?
of those that are, a very high percentage will only be interested in a
link(topic) or two and that almost no-one will be interested in the whole
document.

Our primary goal is for this reason, to enable visitors to understand a
relatively ill-defined context, to extract some detail and move on; rather
than to speak to a select audience (naturally this is a strong, but
secondary goal) and develop a complex realization.
Print and film are far better media for developing threads coherently.
