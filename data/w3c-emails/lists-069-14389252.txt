As I recall there were three types of color sensors, the red yellow and
Blue.

Any or all off these can be low impaired or missing entirely.

For people who are completely color blind (no color vision at all) it is
only the gray scale that counts, so a red on black is completely invisible
 I actually wrote to them a year ago or so, and got some conformation on
this)

If someone has no blue vision, then having a high contrast just biased on
the blue scale is not sufficient. Of course the same is true for the other
cones.
So you need sufficient contrast in each of the fundamental colors, to
guarantee contrast for all color disabilities (not just the common ones).


All the best

Interesting.  But how does that control for color blindness?

The problem is contrast, not color difference.   Are they the same?

Thanks
