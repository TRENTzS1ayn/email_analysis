As of this week's meeting we will be using a new phone bridge.

We had noise on last week's call that we could not determine whose line it 
came from.  We've also had problems in the past with snoring, hold music, 
and being sent to someone's voicemail.

Therefore, we are moving our calls to the W3C phone bridge named 
Zakim.  With Zakim people can mute their line from the bridge end rather 
than their handset.  This will help us mute noisy lines and hopefully 
reduce echo.  Also, if someone does snore, puts us on hold, or what not I 
can mute their line so the conference can continue undisturbed.

Please read "User Instructions for the W3C Zakim Teleconference Bridge" [1].
The bridge number is:  617.761.6200
The passcode is: 9224 or ("WCAG").

Hear you on the new bridge...
