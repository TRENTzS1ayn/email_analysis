Hello,

Paul, Cynthia, and I took an action item at the 23 May telecon [1] to 
suggest improved success criteria for Checkpoint 1.2 regarding real-time 
information.

We've put together a proposal at [2].  Our proposed changes are marked with 
the class "proposed" and appear in white text with a red background.

The complete text of checkpoint 1.2 appears on this page, but we have only 
changed the pieces that are marked.  We wanted to see it in context.

Notes:
- The "unless" clause on SC # 4 is derived from "Federal Captioning 
Mandates: What They Are and What They Mean to You." [3]
- We asked Geoff Freed about real-time audio descriptions.  He said that 
they (NCAM) have provided audio descriptions on special occasions but there 
is nothing happening regularly in the broadcast world that he is aware of.

Thoughts?
