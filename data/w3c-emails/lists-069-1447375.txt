My goodness, Anne, you've been reading my posts. I made this same point
several times. But it has been pointed out to me that a normative view is
required, and I believe we were just discussing issues surrounding
checkpoint 1.5 which states as a success criteria:

Since we need a logical, linear, normative reading order, I think that it's
worthwhile to discuss what that order might be.
