Highlights from today's telecon 

: 

1.Regarding 4.1, the group decided that the best way to proceed
would be to try to compile a list of all the ideas without discussing
their assignment to any particular level. It was felt that we could have
a more constructive discussion if people were first collecting all the
ideas without worrying about whether they should be required for this or
that or every site. 


2.The group came up with the following  to put into the WCAG2
draft for the TR release: 

a.4.1 main item should be a rendition of Write as clearly and
simply as appropriate/possible for the content. (and not talk about
audience. 
b.We have no level SC Levels 
c.We provide a partial list of ideas based on the current draft
plus some items from the GL list.
d.Include a reviewers note that says 4.1 is currently still under
development. The intended form is to have a list of strategies in the
informative portion. No decision has been made about what will be in the
final document or if they will be in the success criteria or in the
informative section has been made. (similar to checkpoint 3.1) (group
agrees) --- underneath put -- A partial list of  strategies for
addressing 4.1 includes: [list to be based on list in current draft plus
some additional items from the GL list:]



3.We will be creating a master list of all ideas related to 4.1.
Ideas will be divided into 4 categories. (grab from above)

a.fairly solid items 
b.items which are possible, questionable, or need 
c.items that depend on something which does not yet exist 
d.items which address 4.1 but really are part of other checkpoints
(ex. structure, markup, etc.)



3.Another highlight was Lisa's discussion of the cascading lexicon
reference links in metadata. (i.e.   providing a way for AT to find a
pointer or list of pointers to various places where definitions for
words on the page.)  (e.g. references to definitions for terms that were
used on the page, that are often used by the author, that are often used
on the site, that are particular to this topic area, etc.)
