I thought the final resolution was:

Write as clearly and simply as is [appropriate/possible] for the
purpose of the content.

This formulation took account of John's point, namely that the
"content" is not some abstract meaning that exists independently of
the words used, but is intimately connected with those words
themselves.

As I remember, no one on the teleconference objected to this, at least
as a provisional formulation.
