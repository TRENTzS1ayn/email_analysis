All together:


From the call I am doing few thins.

Disclaimers. Mining and proofing are <sarcastic implied content = "never
asked a dyslexic to proof or mine information out of lots of words unless
someone is double checking everything she does"> not my strong points
</sarcastic>.


Ok hear is my best shot:

1) access to a draft of the markup that i want to develop is now up at
http://www.ubaccess.com/ils.html


2) links to threads on clear and simple writing.
I have tried to only include new points or information - not opinions

Links on what is now 4.1:

3, A list of what i think is missed out of the current draft.
I think that what we could say to make it all easer is supply the user agent
the means to do the following....

in other words you <important> do not have to supply all this information,
but us a mark up technique that allows for these presentations at the user
end</important>

 (see http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002JanMar/0346.html
and http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002AprJun/0205.html)

Highlight key words and information,  <importance = 0.1>(a bit different
from what is in [1.3A] Provide structure and then 3.2 -highlight it. I am
talking about <em> keywords</em> mid-sentence </importance>

In instructions, use: a, active voicing b, visual references, absolute
reference (rather than relative ones)

State meanings explicitly.
simplest word <importance = 0.1>(for lowest reading age in the area were the
highest %of target audience) </importance>that does not change the meaning,
Do not use more then one negative in a sentence....
Use simple verb tenses.
Avoid split infinitives

 Use concrete words
avoid redundancy <importance = 0.6>?(we would need to add that this is only
redundancy in text itself)</importance> -omit needless words
 Avoid noun sandwiches e.g.: Underground mine worker safety protection
procedures development (add "OF" AND "FOR")
 Readable sentences are simple, active, affirmative, and declarative.
State one thing and only one thing in each sentence.
Divide long sentences into two or three short sentences.
Strive for a simple sentence with a subject and verb. Eliminate unnecessary
modifiers.
Use a known Lexicon, and stick to it.
Use language consistently <importance = 0.1>(yup we are having that problem
with the word "content")</importance)

If only one or two simple conditions must be met before a rule applies,
state the conditions first and then state the rule.
If two or more complex conditions must be met before a rule applies, state
the rule first and then state the conditions.


Use prompts for procedures and support decision making:
Structure tasks, provide step-by-step instructions. Use a two-step "select
and confirm" to reduce accidental selections,
especially for critical functions. cue sequences. use goal/action structure
for menu prompts. definite feedback cues. Provide defaults and make it easy
to re-establish them. Calculation assistance, or reduce the need to
calculate.

provide a mode with minimum functionality.<importance = 0.1> - Eliminate or
hide what isn't essential. with simple screen layouts or one thing at a time
presentation.</importance > this can be done with Markup.


All the best

Lisa
