My memory of what we agreed yesterday squares with Jason's.

I thought the final resolution was:

Write as clearly and simply as is [appropriate/possible] for the purpose of
the content.

This formulation took account of John's point, namely that the "content" is
not some abstract meaning that exists independently of the words used, but
is intimately connected with those words themselves.

As I remember, no one on the teleconference objected to this, at least as a
provisional formulation.
