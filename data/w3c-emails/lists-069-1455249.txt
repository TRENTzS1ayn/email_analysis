Yes, Chas, I read your posts. No, that was not new to you .... the first 
time I heard it expressed was by Tim Sigmund at UVA sometime in the late 
eighties when it was till only available on a MAC as Hyperstack ... Tim 
Sigmund was the Tim BL of Virginia ...

Perhaps you are onto something about the linear model - perhaps the 
checkpoint isn't needed any more but I think what the guideline is 
suggesting is that the author provide at least one linear way to get thru 
the data, even if it's a bunch of next links from page to page ...

Maybe it's worthwhile to discuss how to arrange the linear presentation, 
but perhaps it is too soon in the development to work on presentation. The 
content isn't finished yet.
