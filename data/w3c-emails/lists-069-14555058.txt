Well, after much digging in my old fire alarm code
books I finally found it.  It's a shame how much
someone forgets when not working in the field :)

Frequency: 1 flash per second
Minimum: (not that we need this) 1 flash in six
seconds
Just a note: there is one area that does equate to
120Hz, but not what we were looking for.

Sincerely,
Lee Roberts
