Our students* have almost no, or at least very little understanding of pun.
I understood it is a common misconception that some nationalities fail 
to see the irony.
the joke is lost in the telling? doing rather than talking, gosh i bore 
even myself on occassion.

another reason why triple AAA ranking should require that its meaning is 
understood by all.
AA is quite enough for any drier intellect, and really A should suffice.

Art is accessible, it has to sell.
