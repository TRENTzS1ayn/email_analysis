I agree that flicker is a user agent issue, but not exclusively. 

For example, let's say that you have a media player that can slow down
everything, and I mean *everything*. Using this media player, you have
absolute control over everything that could ever cause a flicker. Even
if this is the case, chances are that you won't watch all of your videos
at 1 frame every other second. It's true that you won't have a seizure
at that rate, but in real life you're going to view them first in their
default mode, most likely. At the very least, I'd say that it is the
author's responsibility to either 1. mark up the content with a tag or
metadata that in essence says "this content flickers" or 2. provide an
overt textual reference to the fact (not in markup).

Hello,

there was a recent thread on the ERT WG mailing list about testing for 
flicker. [1]

Nick Kew and Phill Jenkins assert that flicker should no longer be a 
checkpoint in WCAG since it is now a user agent issue. [2, 3]

I heard back from Professor Harding and there is a system that checks
for 
flicker [4].  It's based on his research and produced by Cambridge
Research 
Systems.

Not sure how much it costs, how easy it is to use, or how well it works
on
web content...but I'll contact CRS to find out.
