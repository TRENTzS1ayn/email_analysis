At the May 30 telecon, Gregg and I took an action item to post a
compilation of meeting highlights. The new page is an attempt to capture
and highlight some of the most notable ideas and discussion points
addressed during the weekly phone meetings.

I've posted the new page at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/meeting-highlights.html and have added a link
to it from the meetings section of the WG homepage.
