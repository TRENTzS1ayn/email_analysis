More to the point, by using styling effects to convey information needed to
understand the page you are breaking the checkpoints that require seperation
of style and the page's information...

If your background image conveys information  it shouldn't be a background
image - it should be a part of the information of the page.

  No, it does not - unless the text is *essential* to understanding the page
  (few
  background images are however - they are mostly presentational).

  If the image is essential (does the page make no sense if you removed it?),
  then
  you could include separate text on the page, providing the same function of
  the
  image.
