I didn't suggest that art is less important than a bus timetable. Just that
bus timetables need to be understood in approximately the same way by a large
group of people. I agree with Jonathan that one of the things about good art
is that different people can understand it differently and it still works.
And I agree that it is an important part of life - sometimes much more
important than the bus timetable. As an aside I am encouraged to see the
development of art that does strive to be available to everybody in some
form.

Children love Lilliput, and never understand that the book is trying to
convey a heavily political political message. I imagine there are presidents
like that too.

Although as art this means that there is something that works, as
commmunication it is deliberately inaccessible to those who don't see the
inner meaning. And political satire in particular has at times had a very
carefully disguised inner meaning to ensure that it is not readily accessible
as political writing, much as it might be enjoyable by all people in some
way.

  Well I disagree with charles*, satire can be accessible, in the sense of

  Only AAA conformance has this facility, cf. lyrics & score.
  AA or A attempt a more rigorous relation.

  *To suggest that timetables are more important than art is a leg-pull,
  unfortunately one that has yet to dawn on the sponsors of w3.

  **if a can, can can-can, can it can-can with me?
  This may not translate well,  however a short animation is easily
  imagined, and provides a handle.
  This does not explain the pun, but does provide a place for leverage.

  ***The film 'Soylent green' is a re-telling of the very ancient story of
  mass-cannibalism, didn't Philip K Dick also write a version?
  The Cyclops,The Sirens, Circe, Lord of the Flies, and a host of others
  uncover our fear of the beast within.
