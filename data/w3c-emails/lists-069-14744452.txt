  Please think again Charles*, you're mind may be clouded by what is
  apparently do-able, and the needs of endless mindless beauracrats.

  Ancient truths are ancient because they are great if not immutable,
  unlike timetables.
  Incest, Patricide, Abuse are topics of our time and theirs, ones which
  "need to be understood in approximately the same way by a large group of
  people"

  Please take the time to view: http://www.respond.org.uk/help/index.html
  which is a valuable contribution, using a variety of materials
  efficiently, to discuss a difficult issue, effectively.

  Accessibility of art is an issue to be confronted, not dismissed lightly.

  thanks
