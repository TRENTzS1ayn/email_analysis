My suggestion was that we collect the things that have been proposed, and
work out if we can use them as success criteria - i.e. if they can be written
to be testable and true.

I suspect in some cases there will be different criteria for different
languages.

  Here are some of the comments I found in recent posts that I
  think we should grab and hold.   They are the suggestions I could find
  in the discourse.  And suggestions is what we need to work from.

  One of the suggested success criteria from the meeting in
  Melbourne was that the appropriate terms be used.

  Most of the suggestions have been to do with ways of writing a
  sentence or a paragraph. They are very similar to the suggestions we
  seem to accept of ways to structure a page or a collection of pages

  {GV NOTE:  I think he is saying that we should start collecting
  some of the ADVICE items not as success criteria but as the list of
  things you can do and should consider --- just as we did for structure
  etc.  Is that right Charles? - or did I miss it.}
