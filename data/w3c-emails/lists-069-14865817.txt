I need clarification

Are you saying that we would create guidelines that would preclude
museums and libraries from conforming at any level?

If so then we run the risk of having people walk away from them and make
their own.

I don't think that we should create guidelines that are not achievable
by basically everyone -- or these guidelines will not take precedence.
Others will need to be written for general applicability and we will
have fragmentation.

This is not an easy topic, but we need to address it carefully.
