I think it *should* be possible for poetry and other art forms to conform to
WCAG.  By this I mean that the guidelines shouldn't be written in such a way
as to put all artistic expression beyond the pale of accessibility.

It should then be up to poets and artists to decide whether they wish to aim
for conformance or not.

Back in the Fall the online journal I edit published an issue about the new
electronic poetry.  We had invited poets to submit new work for
consideration, and we pointed out that our editorial policy requires WCAG
(we don't specify a level) conformance.  Several people objected to this
constraint as a kind of unwarranted intrusion on artistic freedom.  My
response to that was that our journal (Currents) isn't by any means the only
outlet for e-poetry, and that poets who didn't want to play with WCAG didn't
have to; they'd just have to go elsewhere, because I wasn't going to put my
name on something I couldn't possibly have read (whatever "read" might mean
under these circumstances).

Stating what's required in order to make a conformance claim doesn't
obligate anyone to make such a claim (if they're in a position where
conformance is voluntary).  All it says is what they have to do to ground
such a claim if they *do* make it.

I need clarification

Are you saying that we would create guidelines that would preclude museums
and libraries from conforming at any level?

If so then we run the risk of having people walk away from them and make
their own.

I don't think that we should create guidelines that are not achievable by
basically everyone -- or these guidelines will not take precedence. Others
will need to be written for general applicability and we will have
fragmentation.

This is not an easy topic, but we need to address it carefully.
