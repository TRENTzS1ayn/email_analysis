liked that, rather too verbose.
did you hear the story about the trainee teacher giving a microclass to her
fellow students, and trying to show them the problems ldd students faced?

she wrote "put the pencil in the glass" in Greek letters on the blackboard,
and let them spend the class as they liked with 10 minutes at the end for
questions.

ps:    I studied Greek, not many have.
