If the thrust of 11.3 is to provide information according to users' preferences
but the information does not exist in languages other than English (for example)
- is the checkpoint met?  
 
More broadly - if there are no alternatives (e.g., language, content type, etc.)
for the user to choose from, is 11.3 in that case deemed "not applicable" or
must all content be provided in alternative ways?  Surely not the later.
