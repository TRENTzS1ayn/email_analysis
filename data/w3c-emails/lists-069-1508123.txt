Chas,

         It was interesting. But is there a tie back to the guidelines and 
checkpoint issues?

         On the matter of whether the commercialism of the web is waxing or 
waning, what will be will be. I was once a strong proponent for 
anti-commercialism on the Internet, but it all folded with the Web. 
Personally, if I need to get away from commercials, I look just to the 
right of my screen out the window into a view of the garden through the 
pussy willow and the apple tree. I'd rather keep my "real" view uncluttered 
than to be bothered with defacing others' property.

                                         Anne
