One more issue:

I don't know of any group, organization, government, legislative body or
anything else that has a solid set of standards for web captioning with
regard to

* font size
* words per minute
* lines of text per viewing frame
* capital characters versus lower case

Or anything else along these lines. There are standards for television,
but are there any for the Web? If there is a set of standards, should we
refer to them? If there isn't a set of standards, should we create one?
