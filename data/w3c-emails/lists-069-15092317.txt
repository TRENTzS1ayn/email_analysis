In compiling our notes from our teleconference last week, I realized
that one of the things we had talked about was items that contributed to
clear and simple writing, but that really belonged to other checkpoints.
Items such as:

- Structure your document well.
- Emphasize the structure.
- Include illustrations, etc.

It occurred to me that, perhaps we are wording 4.1 wrong.  Rather than
saying write as clearly as simply, perhaps the 4.1 should really be
talking about "Use clear and simple language".

I believe that this was a comment made by others earlier, but we somehow
didn't pick up on it the teleconference today.

Should we be changing this one to:

"Use language which is as clear and simple as [appropriate or possible]
for the purpose of the content."
