Jonathan,

         Don't let your knowledge of Greek get away from you over life. 
Keep it as a hobby. I once knew Latin, but can't do more than a Dominus 
Vobiscum anymore.

         Next Tuesday will be first day of school, and we are likely to 
have some children who arrive for Kindergarten without English. Last year 
one brave young Mexican child who found his first hour incomprehensible, 
began to cry loudly for his Mama. A staff member cradled and rocked him 
until lunch time. By the time he went back to Mexico for winter, he was a 
happy, curious learner!  It is not only the cognitively disabled who end up 
in comprehensible situations!

                                                 Anne
