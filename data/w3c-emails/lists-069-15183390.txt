Actually, there aren't any standards for these things in the broadcast 
world.  Font size is determined by the available technology; the rest are 
determined by individual captioning agencies in conjunction with viewers.

Including some common-sense pointers in the guidelines is a good idea--for 
starters  see http://main.wgbh.org/wgbh/pages/captioncenter/ccstyles.html-- 
but I don't think the WAI is the proper body to write a full recommendation 
about captioning.  Some caption agencies, including The Caption Center, 
have already put in years of research regarding caption timing, display, 
quality, comprehension, etc.
