 Although this question doesn't apply directly to working on the guidelines,
I thought this would be the best group to brainstorm with, as I hope to
avoid the entire state of Virginia creating a system that doesn't work...

 New legislation requires state agencies to post their meeting minutes
online.  It has been decided that, in order to make these minutes available
to the maximum amount of citizens and to preserve formatting, that PDF is
the format to use.  It's been my experience that PDFs are still a ways off
from being accessible, although they have a conversion feature that will
turn the PDF into a text document.  But in that case the formatting is again
lost.  Is it acceptable for a document to be of lower content quality and
still be compliant (any tables, charts, and diagrams in the PDF are lost but
the rest is readable as text)?
