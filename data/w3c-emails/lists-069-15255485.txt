this is a consultation paper, the link will tell you far more about it's authority than I can.
It certainly intends to help develop an understanding of what is undoubtedly a very complex issue.


Please note that 6 audiences have been addressed, and each has it's own leaflet.
'A guide for people with learning difficulties' is one of them. This is shorter, and in a larger font.
Each leaflet covers a slightly different selection of topics.


please take the time to have a good look, this could help inform development of suitable text based resources, of this type.
(>xenophon's expedition of cyrus, > john masters' bhowani junction, >and this a professional tool.)
How could the relation between the texts be expressed (semantically, if you must) in such a way as to aid understanding and future development?

thanks
