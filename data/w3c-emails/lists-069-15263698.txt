Hi,

I was looking to solicit any information on what people might see being
covered in the Script Techniques for WCAG 2.0 document (
http://www.learningdifficulty.org/develop/w3c-scripts.html )  I'm looking
particularly for scripts that are often used, but almost always lead to
inaccessibility.

Currently, I've only got these to add:

Plug-in detection - Almost every maker of a browser plugin presents this
script, I've yet to see one that work, and as the RNIB with their lookloud
Flash example have found just this week, they are highly inaccessible.  On
this does anyone have any research on how successful <object> fallback
</object> etc. actually is in today's implementations? As if that was
practical it should remove the need for the complicated scripting.

The problems described by the solutions in http://tom.me.uk/scripting/  by
Tom Gilder (URL may be wrong, it's from memory.)

Any others would be appreciated.

Regards,

Jim Ley.
