I understand where you are trying to get to, but this also gives an example 
of how important text is.

If I wouldn't know the WCAG background and the possible interpretations 
given to me in the list following the image, the image could mean several 
things to me. For instance, it could be: use international symbols for 
bathrooms to not confuse tourists. Or remember to keep women and men 
separate.  Or the guy things: "Which way should I go?" and then finds the 
answer: "Bodybuilders go to the left". And what if I come from culture that 
writes from right to left. Am I going to read the image that way too. So 
there are plenty of interpretations, and without the text or background 
knowledge it is quite impossible to know which ones to select.

Even if we take a cartoon, which is extreme as it has quite a lot of 
images, but it also text bubbles. If the text is written in a language that 
I don't know at all I can usually guess something based on the images, but 
cannot be exactly sure of what is happening. If I know the language a 
little, I can guess better. But the images alone seldom give me the whole 
understanding, unless they are standardized and I have learned the meaning.

Although I don't agree on your test setting I still think that images are 
important, for instance, in supporting the understanding of a text, 
motivating e.g. getting readers interested, and highlighting the most 
important things in the text.
