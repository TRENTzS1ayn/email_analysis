I've updated the Script Techniques for WCAG 2.0 document to include Tom
Gilder under 6.2.
and clear out a little excessive ebullience. I'll try to re-read it all
before tuesday.

has snork been upgraded, i hope we can find time to show me how it works on
tuesday pm, this should quite likely have more prominence, I had trouble
finding it.

I'd prefer, if at all possible to refrain from expanding too much on what
makes sites inaccessible, and concentrate on the positive.
for instance your very helful insistence on querying for keyword, before
testing for value.

seems like I may be the one editing this, again.... anyway should not be a
problem over the summer, if we have something to say.
