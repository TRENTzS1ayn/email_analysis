I am cross posting because this is a WCAG 2.0 definition that needs some
work.......
Currently in the latest WCAG 2.0 Draft "time-dependent presentation" is
defined as below......

<qoute>

Definitions (informative)
time-dependent presentation

(1)A time-dependent presentation is a presentation which
is composed of synchronized audio and visual tracks (e.g., a movie), 

OR
 
(2)a presentation which requires the user to respond interactively at
specific times in the presentation.

</quote>

.......I think that the (2) is a definition of "response time dependent
presentation", rather than "time-dependent presentation".  The response
time issue is very important, but different.

Also, I think it would be a good idea to provide language that includes
other sense modalities (tracks).  I realize that it is a bit premature
to include "synchronized smell" and "synchronized vibration" tracks,
but, I think we should have language that covers this eventuality.
