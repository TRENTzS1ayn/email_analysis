This is another term where I think it would be a good idea to provide
language that includes other sense modalities (tracks).  I realize that
it is a bit premature to include "synchronized smell" and "synchronized
vibration" tracks, but, I think we should have language that covers this
eventuality.

Media equivalents 
present essential audio information visually (captions) and essential
video information auditorily (audio descriptions).

captions are text equivalents of auditory information from speech, sound
effects, and ambient sounds that are synchronized with the multimedia
presentation. 
audio descriptions are equivalents of visual information from actions,
body language, graphics, and scene changes that are voiced (either by a
human or a speech synthesizer) and synchronized with the multimedia
presentation.
