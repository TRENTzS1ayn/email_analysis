Hello,

Would someone please volunteer to take minutes today?

I have created a template for minutes.  Here's how it works:

Load this page into your browser:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/,new

select the radio button for  "/WAI/GL/Templates/minutes.html (or: view/edit 
it first)"

then press "Continue"

Save this file to your local drive and edit.

Please attach this file in an email to the mailing list.

Thank you,
--wendy
