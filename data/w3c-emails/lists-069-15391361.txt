Jonathan I have to admit I am bit frustrated at you using this document 
as an example of good practice. I have been in several meetings where 
people with learning difficulties have severely challenged the whole 
nature of this document, especially its approach to accessibility.

For some unknown reason it appears that the people involved at the Lord 
Chancellor's Department did not listen to advice given by people with 
learning difficulties about the way the information was presented.

In any consideration of the document as an example of good practice it 
is essential that this is noted.
