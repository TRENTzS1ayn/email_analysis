Neil, how does the saying go?Any publicity is good publicity?
The number of (UK)government (or corporate) documents created for people
with LD is very limited indeed.

It was posted because of its (fairly unique) construction, addressing a
variety of audiences as it does.
And because it might 'inform development of suitable text based resources',
which is very different.
It was not posted as an example of good LDD practice, it is for others to
judge this merit.

Please continue to add something constructive to the debate, alternative
documents, would be very welcome, and let's not fight amongst ourselves.

thanks

jonathan

Jonathan I have to admit I am bit frustrated at you using this document
as an example of good practice. I have been in several meetings where
people with learning difficulties have severely challenged the whole
nature of this document, especially its approach to accessibility.

For some unknown reason it appears that the people involved at the Lord
Chancellor's Department did not listen to advice given by people with
learning difficulties about the way the information was presented.

In any consideration of the document as an example of good practice it
is essential that this is noted.
