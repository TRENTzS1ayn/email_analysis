I read the client-side scripting draft [1] and the html techniques for wcag
1.0 [2].  I don't see anything about coding drop-down menus so a user can
move from the menu to the next form field without having to tab through
everything else in the menu.  For example, the Virginia Commonwealth
Calendar [3] has several drop-down menus needed to access the government
meetings.  In order to select an agency, a screen reader would then have to
go through the rest of the options before the user could go to the next form
field.  Although this allows the application to be technically used, the
difficulty in going through 200 agencies makes it effectively inaccessible.

Could this be addressed in a future draft of the client-side scripting
techniques?  Or is it already there and I just missed it?
