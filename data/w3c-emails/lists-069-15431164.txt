Do you mean the user has to tab through each option in the menu? This isn't
normally the case if you are using validly coded HTML forms.

Could you explain the use case a little more please?

cheers

  I read the client-side scripting draft [1] and the html techniques for wcag

  move from the menu to the next form field without having to tab through
  everything else in the menu.  For example, the Virginia Commonwealth
  Calendar [3] has several drop-down menus needed to access the government
  meetings.  In order to select an agency, a screen reader would then have to
  go through the rest of the options before the user could go to the next form
  field.  Although this allows the application to be technically used, the
  difficulty in going through 200 agencies makes it effectively inaccessible.

  Could this be addressed in a future draft of the client-side scripting
  techniques?  Or is it already there and I just missed it?
