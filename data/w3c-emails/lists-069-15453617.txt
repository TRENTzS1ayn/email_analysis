i've already suggested on many occassions that ~10 links is enough per
page(or form in this case) if one is going to run to hundreds, then one
certainly needs to design a way to break them up.

w3 uses something in the navigation at the start of a page that allows one
to jump across links, perhaps it could include a warning, ie 200 links.
also one really wants an escape key.

visual navigation needs a different design criterion to auditory.
for instance at http://www.peepo.com i've arranged for the 'frame' content
which is on every page (ie the alphabet) to frame the pages visually, but to
be read last.

in the interim, i'd recommend arranging for these long lists to be at the
end of the page
