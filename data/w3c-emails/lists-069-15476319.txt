Highlights from our June 20 Teleconference

 

1.Regarding proposal for new checkpoint 1.5
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002AprJun/0459.html) 



a.Revised success criteria at the minimum level will read, 

"Text in the content must be Unicode or sufficient information is
provided so that it will be automatically mapped back to Unicode."


b.An additional success criteria for level 2 will be added. It
reads, 

"Symbols such as diacritic marks that are found in standard usage of the
natural language of the content and necessary for unambiguous
interpretation of words are present or another standard mechanism for
disambiguation is provided."



2.Cynthia and Lisa are going to be exploring whether language
translation software can already disambiguate words and could be used as
part of a tool to automatically add diacritical marks


3.Checkpoint 4.4 will be subsumed by the inclusion of the new 1.5
checkpoint.


4.The group confirmed previous decisions to rework guideline 5
according to Cynthia's proposals for the next internal draft.
