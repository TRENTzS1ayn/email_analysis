Well, with a list this big I would look for ways to break it up beyond a
single menu (a list of 50 states is as frustrating as I ever want to deal
with, since I live in "other - non-US" which is almost always at the end of
things I deal with).

But there is technology that doesn't require this whole list to be traversed.
In Lynx (since the early 90s) as soon as you have selected something you can
move past the drop-down (unless you configure it otherwise, and even then you
can page through the list). Other tools do this - I would be surprised if HPR
doesn't.

Cheers

Charles
