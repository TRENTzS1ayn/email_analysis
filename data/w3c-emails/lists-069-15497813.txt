To the best of my knowledge and after checking  a few pages that employ the
use pull down menus it is possible to tab out of the pull-down menu and
leave your selection in tact.  In the scenario of using a state list (50
states in the US), one could tab into the pull down menu, arrow down to the
desired selection (the state you wanted) and tab to the next part of the
form.  This is at least the case with Windows (95 and 98) as this navigation
scenario is driven by the operating system and not a particular screen
reader.

But, in my experimenting on a Macintosh computer a few years ago, the
operating system was not so navigational friendly.  Using OutSpoken on the
Mac (and as I said, a few years back) this would not have been possible.
Has the issue of Macintosh use been discussed in terms of the ways it may
read or be able to navigate web pages?  Sometimes we take for granted the
various operating systems and what they do/ or don't do for favorable web
navigation.
