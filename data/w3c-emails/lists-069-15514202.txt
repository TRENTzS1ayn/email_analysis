Imagine a directory http://www.google.com/dirhp?hl=en  with drop down lists.
how would we navigate it?
it would certainly be faster.

if there is an escape key, it is important that it is the same for all
applications,
Having to select a 'dummy value' is not transparently obvious, authors
frequently assume that there list are 'complete'.
One may well wish to tab thru the forms, to get a feel for the document.

Tab is not sufficient in itself. flicking thru the pages of a book is a very
different activity to perusing the contents or index.
tab is not well able to handle both these activities.

If we are to leave it to the author to create the 'semantic' equivalent of
these activities, the least we can do is provide decent accessible examples.
There are very few available on the web. (indexes frequently get rather
large)

how does one efficiently search a dictionary,or encyclopedia using hpr or
another screen reader?
that is in the sense of browsing one, ie noticing the juxtaposition and
relation of words related to their spelling(which surely enhances learning).
stumped, well the reason is staring us in the face, the interface is
deficient.

The peepo script* for using the keyboard is an important innovation(though
certainly a very small part any possible solution.)
I'm facing a very similar problem. Currently whatever letter you press you
go to the page for that letter, wherever you are.
in the future, due to the growth of peepo, your destination will change
depending where you are. This is a subtle but complex difference.
One that I am not sure, will be readily accepted or understood, but which is
to be tried and tested.

For nearly 2 years, we had a system where the 'enter' key was used as an
'escape' so that the next key was interpreted as a drop down the list rather
than a page move.
However it was not a standard, and involved too much training.
http://www.peepo.com/alf/a.html is a working example. type a letter and you
move a page. hit the enter key, then a letter(one related to an image
displayed,) and you visit that specific, offsite link.
Whilst this version did not pan-out, something similar could possibly be
viable.

It may be helpful to compare this with predicitve text messaging?

thanks

*typing a letter at the keyboard, selects a page to view, ie A is for apple
unless one is in a data input field, the a-z keyboard is effectively
dead-space, which is a peculiar use for it.

nb: obviously it is important that 'other' comes first, and this may well be
a necessary guideline/technique.
