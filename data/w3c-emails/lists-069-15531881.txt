My favorite way: access keys
If all form elements have a sequential access key, and your up to "j" press
alt "k" and move on.
I also put a page map at the top of each page (can be done invisibly) with
links to page sections. You can always use access key 0 to jump back to the
page map and reorentate yourself.
So if you find yourself in a lengthy section that you don't want to e in -
don't be there.
All the best,
and I must say, you seem on top of your subject.
