This is true. There are systems that have a way of dealing with this - either
by providing a defined way of reassigning keys (and finding out what got
reassigned) or by providing a pass-through mechanism - for example, a special
key in a screen reader that can be used to make the next command pass through
the screen reader instead of activating its normal function, so that the
underlying application processes it to activate some function.

  has a set of its own access )or maybe function keys), and any additional
  program would have its set of access keys.
