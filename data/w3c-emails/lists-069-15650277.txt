I rather like the following format, perhaps not as an only, but rather as an addition: 





3.10    It is also unlawful for a body responsible for an educational institution to discriminate against disabled students by excluding them temporarily or permanently from the institution on grounds of their disability. [s 28R(3)]

 

Example 3.10A

A college learns that a student admitted himself to hospital during the holidays because of an ongoing mental health difficulty. The college excludes the student from the institution because staff fear he may be dangerous. The college has no evidence that the student will be dangerous; staff have simply made an assumption. This is likely to be unlawful.

a.. 
a.. The Post-16 Code of Practice is available as a Word document, a Rich text Format document.

how do others feel about this?
I think we have already discussed, how it might be possible for the user to choose to view, (or not) the additional text.

thanks
