George Kercher calls it 'temporal' content.

Yes, 'presentation' is too display-smelling if you want to include the case of time-dependent
action opportunities.

<proposal>

Time-dependent content is content where the sense [or more generally operational 
effectiveness] of the content depends in some way on time differences as they are 
realized in the actual, concrete user interaction with the content.

Time-dependent content is sensitive to the time-flow fidelity of its realization in
the delivery context.

Audio and video streams, and time-limited promotional pricing are examples of time-dependent
content.  A synchronized bundle of time-dependent components such as a SMIL presentation may 
be regarded as one time-dependent content object, if the user perceives all the concurrent 
phenomena as part of an integrated experience relating to a common time interval such that 
time-coincidence is significant.

Playback time and nominal playback time need not be exactly one to one, but distortion of
the inter-component synchronization or playback rate beyond some limit may degrade or destroy
the comprehensibility or operability of the content when it is time-dependent.  See the
"slow playback rate" provisions in the standard talking book specification for an example
of such bounded-distortion playback.
