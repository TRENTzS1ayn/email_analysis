First, I think it is very fortunate that you didn't copy my image onto your
site and link it from there - that way when I start to add useful metadata
about the image whose URI is blahblahblah that will be known as the same
image that is in both our pages.

(I intend to do this soon - I have been playing around with a different
project along these lines).

Second, I have updated the page I did. Hopefullly the images themselves are
now carrying a bit more important information, and are a bit less liable to
be misinterpreted. The thing is still at http://www.w3.org/2001/08/mmcmn/

We still have a way to go - as Paul pointed out I think we have very little
information so far on how to make images themselves clear, simple,
comprehensible, etc. and I suspect that my test page is only a very rough
start in that direction.

One final note - I started thinking about how to apply checkpoint 3.4 to
checkpoint 1.1. If people want to look at an image (no aalternative content
yet - I must start doing these as SVG) that shows where I aheading, there is
a rough draft image at http://www.w3.org/2001/08/mmcmn/11a - this is clearly
in need of more work.

For people keeping score I have spent a bit less than 2 hours to do this
latest update, including about 30 minutes in updating the HTML page
(unusually slow).

cheers

  important, for instance, in supporting the understanding of a text,
  motivating e.g. getting readers interested, and highlighting the most
  important things in the text.
