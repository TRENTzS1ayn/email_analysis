All the documents on the TR page at w3.org have a 'latest' link in them that
is of this class.  For example http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10/.

There are two ways to do this.

The easiest is if you have a file system that supports soft pointers, and make
the URL lead to the soft-pointer that you can change.

There are other ways to do it in the server configuration data depending on the server.

The problem is that you want both an URL for the specific image and a logical URL
for the current role-filling image.

Another example is http://lynx.isc.org/current/
