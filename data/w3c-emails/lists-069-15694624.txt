Doing this with a server is also possible. Apache does it - there is a file
called .htaccess which can temporarily or permanently redirect what you ask
for (the URI of the current thing) to the particular instance (the URI that a
particular image lives at permanently).

  All the documents on the TR page at w3.org have a 'latest' link in them that
  is of this class.  For example http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10/.

  There are two ways to do this.

  The easiest is if you have a file system that supports soft pointers, and make
  the URL lead to the soft-pointer that you can change.

  There are other ways to do it in the server configuration data depending on the server.

  The problem is that you want both an URL for the specific image and a logical URL
  for the current role-filling image.

  Another example is http://lynx.isc.org/current/
