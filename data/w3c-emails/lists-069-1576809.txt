I suppose it's "covered" but an author who has created a style called 
"special" and then used that as the class modifier for a span is possibly 
unaware of the problem created thereby and not even aware that it has 
violated anything about "logical structure" or "separated content/structure".

I guess it can't really be pinned down in GL/CP so maybe a mention of 
"class abuse" in connection with CSS in the techniques might be appropriate?

So take it off the issues list if that's what folks want to do.
