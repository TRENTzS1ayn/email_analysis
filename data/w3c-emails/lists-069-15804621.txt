Hi Lisa,

 

According to the minutes from June 6th
(http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/06/06-minutes.html), there were no
objections to moving forward with publication on this checkpoint. 

 

As indicated in the reviewer's note at the end of checkpoint 4.1 in the
new draft, there is an outstanding action item for Gregg and I to
compile a list of ideas related to 4.1. This list will serve as a basis
for future discussion related to evolving this checkpoint.

 

-Ben

Hi, 

 

I just posted a new working draft for WCAG 2 that reflects the evolution
of the document since the April 24 draft. Please let us know if you spot
any errors, omissions or other items to be addressed so that we can
incorporate them before the draft moves on to publication on the W3C's
Technical Reports page, and subsequent public review.

Thanks,

 

-Ben
