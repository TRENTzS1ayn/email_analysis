sorry if I am being thick. I quoted the wrong meeting, - i meant HYPERLINK
"http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/06/06-minutes.html"http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2
002/06/06-minutes.html
?
but i see on the minutes there:
?
GV The 4.1 checkpoint be a rendition of "write as clearly and simply as
[appropriate | possible] for content." Not talk about audience. Then no
success criteria levels. provide a partial list of ideas and a note about it
being under development.

JS Maybe be a bit further and say that the list will be broken out into
different conformance levels. Give some indication of what might happen to
them.

then there is consensus taking.
followed by a slight change in wording to:
?
"write as simply as [appropriate | possible] for the purpose of the
content."
?
?
?
Thanks,
Lisa

Hi Lisa,

?

According to the minutes from June 6th ( HYPERLINK
"http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/06/06-minutes.html"http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2
002/06/06-minutes.html), there were no objections to moving forward with
publication on this checkpoint.

?

As indicated in the reviewer?s note at the end of checkpoint 4.1 in the new
draft, there is an outstanding action item for Gregg and I to compile a list
of ideas related to 4.1. This list will serve as a basis for future
discussion related to evolving this checkpoint.

?

-Ben

Hi,

?

I just posted a new working draft for WCAG 2 that reflects the evolution of
the document since the April 24 draft. Please let us know if you spot any
errors, omissions or other items to be addressed so that we can incorporate
them before the draft moves on to publication on the W3C's Technical Reports
page, and subsequent public review.

?
