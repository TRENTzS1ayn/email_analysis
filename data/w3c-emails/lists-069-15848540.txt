I'm not sure about all the cross posting, but training cds have used symbols
for decades now.
you may also have notices that tom and jerry, not only are very popular, but
there is masses of new current production.
much cinema is CGI and this must of necessity be regarded as symbolic, even
when realistic.
finally 'static' icons and individual symbols are used throughout all walks
of life.


images and music contain information that is not susceptable to textual
description.
Those who maintain a score will ever be as rich as what it indicates, fool
only themselves.

Also consider there is a large population of illiterates, who cannot
communicate using the written word, but can create, images, crafts and much
more.
We have a responsibility to communicate with them via their chosen modality.
