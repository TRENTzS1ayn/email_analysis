Hi Lisa,

 

I took a closer look at this when I got in this morning and you're
absolutely right. I've updated the draft to include the [appropriate |
possible] language and revised the Reviewers note at the end of the
checkpoint to reflect the fact that this checkpoint is still incomplete.


 

Thanks for catching this,

 

-Ben

sorry if I am being thick. I quoted the wrong meeting, - i meant
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/06/06-minutes.html

 

but i see on the minutes there:

 

GV The 4.1 checkpoint be a rendition of "write as clearly and simply as
[appropriate | possible] for content." Not talk about audience. Then no
success criteria levels. provide a partial list of ideas and a note
about it being under development.

JS Maybe be a bit further and say that the list will be broken out into
different conformance levels. Give some indication of what might happen
to them.

then there is consensus taking.

followed by a slight change in wording to:

 

"write as simply as [appropriate | possible] for the purpose of the
content." 

 

 

 

Thanks,

Lisa

Hi Lisa,

 

According to the minutes from June 6th
(http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/06/06-minutes.html), there were no
objections to moving forward with publication on this checkpoint. 

 

As indicated in the reviewer's note at the end of checkpoint 4.1 in the
new draft, there is an outstanding action item for Gregg and I to
compile a list of ideas related to 4.1. This list will serve as a basis
for future discussion related to evolving this checkpoint.

 

-Ben

Hi, 

 

I just posted a new working draft for WCAG 2 that reflects the evolution
of the document since the April 24 draft. Please let us know if you spot
any errors, omissions or other items to be addressed so that we can
incorporate them before the draft moves on to publication on the W3C's
Technical Reports page, and subsequent public review.

Thanks,

 

-Ben
