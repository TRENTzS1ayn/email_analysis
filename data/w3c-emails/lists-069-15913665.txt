I didn't want it to go by un-noticed,  but the really astute will have
noticed that there is a new editor listed on the latest draft of the
Guidelines released today

 

 

Ben Caldwell has been doing extensive work not just helping to maintain
the guidelines document, but also editing and working on language,
structure etc.   In recognition, the Chairs and Editors submitted his
name to WAI Director for inclusion as a formal document editor.

 

That was approved today and Ben was added as an official editor on the
latest draft.

 

Congratulations Ben,  

 

and thank you for all your efforts and contributions.
