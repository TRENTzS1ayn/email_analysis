At today's meeting it was agreed that checkpoint 2.1 should be
reworded slightly to bring it into correspondence with the other
checkpoints, i.e., to use the imperative mode. This involves adding
the words "ensure that" at the beginning of the sentence.

If there are no objections, this wording will be included in the draft
that is published to TR. Checkpoint 2.1 now reads:

Checkpoint 2.1 ensure that all of the
functionality of the content is operable through character input to the
content or user agent.

The working group resolved to delete the first example under
checkpoint 2.1; example 2 will be renumbered accordingly.
