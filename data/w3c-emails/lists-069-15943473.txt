Firstly my Hebrew is pathetic, so examples tend to be of the three letter
range, IE: words I know. My children all speak Hebrew better then me, so you
can assume these words are all in a 4 year olds vocabulary.

??? - with/together
??? - people,  nation

??? - till, until, forever, so much
??? - witness

?????? - used or exploited
?????? -  survived


translation tools:

http://www.babylon.com/
and
http://www.l.co.il/terus/terus/ is meant to be a good Russian to Hebrew
translator
I asked three friends of mine who work as translators, and they seem to
think that automated tools were not yet up to much, they do not use
automated tools to help them. Not a convincing study, but still.


All the best,
Lisa
