For those wishing to review a series of cartoons without text bubbles
http://www.peepo.com/alf/cartoons.html might be helpful.
http://www.demian5.com/005.html in particular is an easily understandable
story.
It is not essential for picture stories to have a direct correlation with
text.

the naming of things is an essentially human endeavour, non the less we are
also able to communicate the spiritual far better than through words alone,
humour relies on something other than the text and even political ideology
is not often well served by its commentators.
