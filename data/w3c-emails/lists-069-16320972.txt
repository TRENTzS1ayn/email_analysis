I forgot, what did we decide about this checkpoint?

10.2 Until user agents support explicit associations between labels 
and form controls, for all form controls with implicitly associated 
labels, ensure that the label is properly positioned. [Priority 2]
The label must immediately precede its control on the same line 
(allowing more than one control/label per line) or be in the line 
preceding the control (with only one label and one control per line).

Did we bother to figure out yet if we reached that "until user
agents" point?  Do we currently have a chart of all the "until
user agent" clauses that shows which ones have been reached yet
and which ones have not?

I checked http://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources/WAI-UA-Support and
there is "no information" on 10.2.  I got asked this in my web
accessibility class and I'm of the opinion to tell my student:

(a) Ignore 10.2 and just use <label>, and/or
(b) Set up style rules such that you have two labels, one before
     and one after, with appropriate media selectors, and/or
(c) Add redundant @title attributes on the form fields.

Is the UA-Support page being actively maintained?  We refer web
developers to it via WCAG, but for the majority of checkpoints
we give zero guidance.
