In response to today's teleconference and in fulfillment of my action
item, here is the revised text of checkpoint 3.2 with accompanying
explanation.

Note: I have split it into two checkpoints, one of which deals with
the issue that Lisa raised of providing appropriate structure in
suitable contexts. The question of labels has also been moved into the
new checkpoint.

Checkpoint 3.2: Emphasize structure through presentation.

Success criteria
(above the testability line)

1. Each type of structural element has a unique style, either provided
   by the default user agent processing of the content format, or,
   where there is no such default, explicitly by the author.

(below the testability line)

2. The style associated with each type of structural element is
   sufficiently distinctive that it can be easily perceived and
   identified by the reader.

3. Where the author considers it appropriate, customized styles are
   provided, preferably for a variety of output media (e.g., small and
   large screen displays, print, speech etc.) to enhance the reader's
   ability to recognize the structure of the content.

Checkpoint 3.2* (if this is incorporated into the guidelines it could
become the new checkpoint 3.3, or perhaps it could become checkpoint
3.4 so that it precedes the existing checkpoint 3.5).

Divide long sequences of elements such as paragraphs, lists or user
interface components into logically organized groups, which are
labeled appropriately.

Success criteria
(below the testability line)

1. Documents are divided into a logically organized hierarchy of
   sections, each of which has a descriptive heading.

2. User interface components are divided into a logically organized
   hierarchy of groups, each of which has an identifying label.

This checkpoint needs much more work, especially from those who have a
more detailed understanding of what the cognitive requirements are.
