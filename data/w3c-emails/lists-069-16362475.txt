I might, if I ever get off my butt and finish my last project related
to CSS-TECHS.

See, the problem is that WCAG 1 depends on the existence of this
document.  WCAG 1 is unusable as written without this document being
maintained.  I realize this will go away in WCAG 2, but for now it
means that WCAG 1 is way up in the air.  At the very least we should
put a notice saying "THIS IS NO LONGER BEING MAINTAINED" on the
page, and provide a strategy for web developers to deal with WCAG 1
until WCAG 2 is issued.

If nobody objects, I'll think about what we want to say there about
this and send it to the WG for consideration.
