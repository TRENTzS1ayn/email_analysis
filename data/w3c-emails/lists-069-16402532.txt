Hi

1.
In section 2 the statement 'Each requirement must be
easily verifiable' seems to be at odds with consensus
item N7 'normative items should not be determined by
how easy it is to test'

2.
In section 2 having a 'sample site' as a resource
would appear dangerous given that the site may change
and no longer be an appropriate example.

3.
I don't understand consensus item N3 -'normative is
determined by objectiveness - ease of establishing
consensus on fulfilment'.
Also, past discussions have not been unanimous on the
use of the word 'objective'. Don't like it myself. As
chaals himself said <grin> 'Objectivity is also a
subjective concept' [1]

4.
I have posted a couple of times [2] and [3] my
objection to consensus item G1
