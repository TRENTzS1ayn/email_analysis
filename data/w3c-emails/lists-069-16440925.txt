This is basically my question too.  As I read Checkpoint 3.1; "When an
appropriate markup language exists, use markup rather than images to convey
information" (Priority 2).

I take this to mean "use markup rather than gifs, jpegs, etc when
representing anything in text form".  And this could be expanded to use SVG
instead of GIFs & JPGs (when the technology is mature and widespread
enough).

That's how I interpret this checkpoint and priority 2 compliance.  Would
appreciate an enlightened view on this to correct me if this is not so.

Charles, what about using navigation icons which contain gif or jpeg
images of text, and also supplying text links as well?  The quality of
text effects you can get in CSS is woefully limited, thus reducing the
types of designs available to use.  However, having both highly
stylized gif/jpeg text _and_ text-only, scalable-size text links lets
you have your cake and eat it too, if we are talking about a single
UI/document model.
