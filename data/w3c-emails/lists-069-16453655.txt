I think the checkpoint is poorly worded in that it is all about
_not_ using something, instead of "providing alternatives". This is
an example of a buggy checkpoint, which is why we're having so many
problems with it.

Access shouldn't be about stopping doing something, but instead
supplementing what you're doing.  If you can work out some way to
deliver text images and still make the content accessible to audiences
who can't see those text audiences, then you should be encouraged to
go for it.  You should not be "marked down" any more than you should
be marked down for providing PDF _and_ HTML.
