Having pictures of the text and the real text should meet the requirement
(having pictures and alt text does not) but technically fails the checkpoint,
and in my very personal opinion is ugly enough to be worth avoiding...

  This is basically my question too.  As I read Checkpoint 3.1; "When an
  appropriate markup language exists, use markup rather than images to convey
  information" (Priority 2).

  I take this to mean "use markup rather than gifs, jpegs, etc when
  representing anything in text form".  And this could be expanded to use SVG
  instead of GIFs & JPGs (when the technology is mature and widespread
  enough).

  That's how I interpret this checkpoint and priority 2 compliance.  Would
  appreciate an enlightened view on this to correct me if this is not so.

  Charles, what about using navigation icons which contain gif or jpeg
  images of text, and also supplying text links as well?  The quality of
  text effects you can get in CSS is woefully limited, thus reducing the
  types of designs available to use.  However, having both highly
  stylized gif/jpeg text _and_ text-only, scalable-size text links lets
  you have your cake and eat it too, if we are talking about a single
  UI/document model.
