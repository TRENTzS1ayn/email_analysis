I consider this a flaw in WCAG 1 -- I believe it went overboard in
proscribing "this is the one and only way to do things" and lost track
of what we're actually trying to accomplish.  Whenever you have that
kind of regimented "only one way" kind of thinking you shut out
other solutions -- such as the bizarre and highly inappropriate
designation of audience-adapted UIs as as "last resort".
