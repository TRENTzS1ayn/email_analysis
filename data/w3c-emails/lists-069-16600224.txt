Could you explain why you have this opinion?  I find navigation bar text
is the least important text on pages I visit, I'm visiting pages for
content, I'm not visiting pages so as to find other pages through navbar
links "Home" "stuff" aren't links I click on. Links within the content and
links provided by search techniques are the links I find much more
important - It's only normally personal pages where I use the navigation
bar text links - and only then because it gives me a good insight into
what I'm on the page for (to get a better understanding of the person.)

Jim.
