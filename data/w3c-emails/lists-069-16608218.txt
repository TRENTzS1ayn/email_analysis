In some sense, neither do I, but this creates an interesting point, using a
deprecated means of displaying information, meaning deprecated in the light
of WCAG2 and WCAG1 P2.  But the designer has wanted to use text as images,
but has put in an extra effort to provide a more accessible alternative as
well.  Even though they have incorporated checkpoints in P2, the page as a
whole still breaks the spirit of P2.  I still don't see this as a AA page,
but there needs to be some way of accommodating and recognising the
designers effort.  Many designers use this type of approach, and it needs to
be encouraged, but they are still failing to see how this does not meet with
the spirit of WCAG2 and WCAG1 P2 (3.4).

Just for the record I don't disagree with anything Kynn said...

  Right, which is why it's a broken checkpoint.

  One thing we have to be careful of is that there are several types
  of "guidelines" which we may accidentally conflate together:

  * Those based on pure access to information
  * Those based on usability concerns
  * Those based on "style"

etc
