Jonathan,
         I stopped buying clothes online a) because I had to keep looking 
at the catalogue for usable pictures of the garments, and b) they weren't 
selling their petite line online; I had to call anyway ...

         I stopped buying groceries online because the sites didn't provide 
the nutritional and other details on the label.

         In the first instance, the problem was with the graphics and 
service, the second was the failure of the site to provide all the text 
available ... both can be a problem ... a person with various health 
problems that require a strict diet cannot shop without label information. 
And no woman is going to guy a garment without a pictures that show the 
styling .... and sizes! arggghhhh! Why don't online clothiers share their 
size charts???? (maybe they are now, I haven't checked in a long while)....

                                         Anne
