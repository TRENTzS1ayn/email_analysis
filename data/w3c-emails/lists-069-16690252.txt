I agree guys. I'd love to join some of the groups, but am unable to attend
the meetings, so I've held off because I don't want to be in bad standing.
We should think of a way to redo our meetings. BTW, I'm new to this group.
I'm also in the CSS group and the HTML group. I'm just learning things about
accessibility.
