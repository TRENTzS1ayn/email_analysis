Perhaps we need to identify which large communities have no 
representation in w3c.

Remarkably few non-profits, third world members, how about executive 
directors ie from other industries?.

Blue chip industry sectors seem to have a predominance, where are aol 
and redhat?

Is it fair to say that for the present, w3c can lay no claim to 
representing the interests of the wider world web.

thanks
