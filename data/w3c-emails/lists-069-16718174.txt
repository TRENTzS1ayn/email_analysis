I agree with this.  The success in the communication and impact of the
future release of WCAG2, I feel, will depend on such clarifying
documentation, Test Suites, and examples.

        [snip]
There is a lack of detail available from teh techniques documents in some
areas, and it
would be helpful to have a lot more specific examples of what does or does
not meet a checkpoint and why - working group consensus on annotations to a
Test Suite would be a good start. I feel that this  is a real problem
inhibiting implementation (as opposed to adoption in policy) of the
guidelines, and one that we as a working group should be resolving.
