Well, are those categories arbitrary?  If they are, I think you are quit
right.  But if those categories are grouped into meaningful collections,
then they no longer have arbitrary meaning; the category itself must then
have a meaning.  If not, then why does it exist?

Also; to meet a priority you need to fulfil ALL the checkpoints of that
priority.  If this is not essential to claim conformance, why call it a
priority?

My personal opinion:

What you should aim for is less dependent on what (arbitrary) categories
certain checkpoints were put into, and more dependent upon your content,
your audience, and your ability to meet the requirements of various
checkpoints.
