What Marja said was that she could easily misinterpret the images. She 
didn't say that images alone were sufficient, except as it applies to her 
and all folks who are like her.

Text and images work better than text alone for some people, perhaps most ....

What does that tell us about the accessibility needs of those who aren't 
like "most" .....?????
