Not quite

What I said was that I didn't know if it was possible to create a
number.   Live captioning is delayed for a number of reasons --
including allowing people to read and correct the captions before
transmission.   That delay is unavoidable today.   Yet that delay would
be unacceptable in a captioned movie.

Also, when doing training, you want the captions to lead any important
visual event.  That is, you don?t want the person reading the caption
when they should be looking at the screen to see something critical.
So having a time gap criterion may yield either an impossible goal or a
goal that is way too loose for general use.

Larry Goldberg or Geoff Freed would have the answer though.  Perhaps
there is a standard for Pre-captioned and another for Live-captioned.
I would suspect though that these should be recommendations or targets
(and should be in techniques) rather than sufficiency criteria which are
normative.

Geoff?  Larry?
