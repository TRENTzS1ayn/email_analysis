Hi Back from Vacation and catching up a bit

RE the length of the Executive summary...

I'd like to paraphrase Albert Einstein and say..

"It should be as short as possible,  but no shorter.

Lets write it and see how short it can be.   I think it is unwise to
debate or decide on a page length before establishing the content.

My suggestion of "two pages" was an attempt to get it down to two pages.
Maybe we can do one.  Maybe it needs to be 3.   Let's figure out what
all needs to get in there.

Remember an executive summary is not an introduction.  It is a summary
of all the important or key information in a document. It is designed to
stand alone.   For this doc that would have to include at least the
guidelines and checkpoints.


Also, when talking about a web page, I am not sure what "one page" or
'two pages" means.   Are these the number of pages that would print,
assuming a certain font?

I agree with Paul. If we can't summarise it in one page we should start
summarising again.

  How long should we make the Executive Summary? Gregg says 2 pages.

  I am still of the opinion that it should be as short as possible. Two
pages
  seems at least one page too long to me.
