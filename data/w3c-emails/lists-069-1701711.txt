 From a user perspective, it may be highly undesirable, but I am not 
convinced the WCAG needs to custom-craft a regulation that will 
prevent that from happening.

In fact, you may well want exactly that. Read caption; caption 
disappears; look at screen. The option suggested above is: No 
caption; look at screen; read caption.

I have witnessed both examples over the years. And in fact, you can 
check it for yourself-- watch _Martha Stewart Living_ for a while, 
which, it must be pointed out, is very much a training program.

Just say "synchronized," "closely synchronized," or "reasonably synchronized."

Geoff has written in already. He and Larry are not the only experts 
in the world, *God love 'em*. It would be excessive to infer that 
Gregg thinks only official WGBH opinion counts. I've been watching 
captions longer than nearly everyone on earth has been doing it.

But I don't want to ruin what was really quite a good day.
