You can't resize in Netscape 4, a program you should *not* be using, 
but in nearly every other graphical browser on the planet (IE, iCab, 
Opera), you *can* resize fonts. I haven't figured out how to do it in 
Netscape 6.1 on Macintosh yet. I think it might not be implemented on 
that platform as yet.
