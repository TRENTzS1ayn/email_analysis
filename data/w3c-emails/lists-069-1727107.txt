a few very popular media that seem to need images include:
video games (up to 18 hours per day)
television (average ~10 hours per person per day in US)
manga (accounts for 40% of all books and magazine sold in Japan. wired
magazine)

video games appear not to need text to be functional, and can be complex.

apologies for references,

I think the recognised popularity of these 3 media is sufficient to indicate
that whilst images may not be essential they are desired by the majority.

How we use them is very important, and we probably would benefit from a
separate document outlining this, in the meantime we can resort to texts
from other disciplines.

are just a few of the excellent books available
perhaps we should collect a suitable library?

a number of book have recently been published detailing how to create
computer icons, the ones I have seen are rather dry and technical.
