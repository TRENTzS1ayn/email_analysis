It would be entirely possible to say nothing on the point in the
guidelines and leave it to techniques, or to say that the media
equivalents (namely captions and auditory descriptions) must be
reasonably synchronized with the non-text content, then leave it to
the techniques to explain what is reasonable under various
circumstances.

On the other hand if there are clear requirements for synchronization
that can be readily formulated and are of general application, then
they could readily be included in the guidelines themselves.
