Hello
In response to the request for feedack posted to the
wai-ig list.
I have looked at the 'target audience' for WCAG 2.0.
Referencing the WCAG Charter at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/new-charter-2000.html

the target audience is initially defined in the
Mission as '...Web content authors and developers'

In section 2.2 'Intended audience for deliverables'
I am confused as to whether paragraph 1 is broadening 
the target audience for WCAG 2.0 or merely making
comments about WCAG 1.0.
The 2nd paragraph appears to be making tacit
assumptions about a wider target audience than simply
'Web content authors and developers'

That is
1. ....'with sufficient technical precision to be used
as a normative reference for Web content
accessibility' 
This would appear to be referring to a 'target
audience', perhaps policy makers? but it isn't clear
to me.

2. ....'and with language accessible to non-technical
audience' 
This would apear to be rererring to a 'target
audience' but I am not sure what the limits are on
this audience.

Now looking at the current draft of WCAG 2.0 the
Target Audience is summed up as follows....
'We expect that *policy makers* will use the Guideline
and Checkpoint level, while *developers* will dive
into Techniques and *managers* might only need to read
the Overview of Design Principles'

However I look at it I don't see a clear alignment
between the 'target audience' as defined 
in the Charter and that presented in the current draft
of WCAG 2.0

Why does this concern me?
At its most basic level if I were asked what the
target audience was for 'WCAG 2.0' I would have to
reply either
'I am not sure' or
'Well probably or possibly ......'

I am just looking to be able to answer this question
with more clarity in the hope that it will not only be
of benefit to me :-)

Cheers
Graham Oliver
