Gregg and all,

         Wanted to take a look at the Executive Summary as it is now, to 
contribute to it's rewrite, but I was unable to find the document in 
question. If it's on the front page of w3c.org , I missed it. Used the 
search engine and all I got were 2,000 some hits of email messages on the 
topic, but not a link to the document itself.

         What am I doing wrong that I can't find it?

                                         Anne
