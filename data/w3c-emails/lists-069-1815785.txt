And let me add that when a broadcast or cable program is captioned offline
(pre-produced, not live) caption tolerance is ususally specified as within
one frame of video (1/30 of a second). That is, the data path and hardware
should not delay the appearance of a caption for more than one frame after
the author intended it to appear.

But the author may in fact decide for any number of reasons how and when
they want the caption to appear.  geoff's right about "subjectivity" in
caption authoring.
