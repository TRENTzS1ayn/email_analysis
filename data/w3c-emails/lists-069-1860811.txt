Hello,

In order for me to have a chance to keep up with the issues on the mailing 
list, in the future could you please:

1. Look for existing issues in the open issues list that relate to your 
current concern.
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wcag20-issues.html
or
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wcag20-issues-sorted.html
2. If you find something similar, please include the issue number in the 
subject of your e-mail.
3. If you do not find something similar, please include "NEW" in the 
subject of your e-mail.  I will then add the new issue to the mailing list.

Also, if at all possible, if you are attempting to summarize an issue 
please put "summary" in the subject of your e-mail.  It would help if 
people attempted to summarize the discussion  from time to time.  I do try 
to read every single message to this list, but y'all are a busy 
group!  It's hard to keep up!  Especially to tease out the nuances of each 
issue.  Any help you all can provide would be appreciated!!

This policy might grow a bit, but this should at least help get us 
started.  Suggestions are welcome.

I have looked into bugzilla, a bug-tracking tool, since that could help 
automate the process.  It didn't seem flexible enough.  UA has their own 
tool, that seems simple and easy to use. But again, not sure how flexible 
it is. Any suggestions?

Thank you and be well,
