Open issues updated again to reflect Paul's comments last week re: the 
issues with his name.
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wcag20-issues.html
sorted: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wcag20-issues-sorted.html

Note that I am a week behind on catching up the issues list with the 
mailing list discussion. I will be leaving for vacation in a few hours and 
don't expect to get caught up before leaving.

However, I don't think we are lacking for things to discuss. <grin/>

Be well,
