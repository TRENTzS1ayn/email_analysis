If members took the time to study the resources that I mention they would be
in a better position to create and implement a multimedia experience.
Understanding is only a first step. reading the booklist, and contributing
other texts is a second step. Then  a few of us will be in a position to
criticize as well as create. peepo is my main attempt at authoring an
accessible multimedia experience. I am thrilled to view other members
efforts.
