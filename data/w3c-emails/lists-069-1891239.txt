Yep - and that is done.

Places it doesn?t work are
1) live presentations
2) group presentations
3) presentations followed by other presentations in a timed window.
(e.g. a show which is followed by another show or presentation where
this presentation must fit into a time slot.

Subject: RE: Caption synchronization tolerance

Why do captioned objects need to be the same length as uncaptioned
objects?
Why wouldn't it be possible (and even desirable) to allow captioned
versions
to pause the audiovisual long enough for caption readers to catch up?

Just wondering.
