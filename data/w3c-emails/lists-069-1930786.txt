Chas,

         What would *really* help would be for you to study the resources 
Jonathan posted. They aren't there just to look pretty in the 
archives!   They are there to help you understand the needs and how to 
address them.

         Didn't you recently post a reference to a personal opinion that 
commercial graphic design is dangerous to Democracy? If your purpose in 
that post wasn't to continue your anti-graphics campaign, why was it posted?

                                 Anne
