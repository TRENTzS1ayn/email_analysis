CMN: In the meantime, if people use it, they can go for things that already
work
(seems like there are a handful of numbers) or can hope that it gets fixed
and so use the spec as is.

GJR: actually, the accesskey palette need not be limited to either
alphabetic or numeric symbols/glyphs - it is possible to use
character-entity codes for non-alpha-numeric characters, such as those
widely deployed in programming/markup languages: at least, the at-sign (@),
the pound/number-sign (#), the dash (-), equals signs (=), greater- and
less-than signs, back- and forward-slashes, etc., some/many of which are
available/prevalant on handheld devices (depends upon the device, naturally)

in any event, i've attached a copy of a document that tests support for
non-alphanumeric accesskeys - it is part of the implementation tests i
marked up for UAAG - note that the test portion of the page is complete; it
is only the preamble that is incomplete - please note as well that i didn't
change the mailto link in the "How to Provide Feedback" section to point to
the GL or xtech lists - it still points to the UA list, so exercise due
caution when providing feedback from within the document...

gregory.
