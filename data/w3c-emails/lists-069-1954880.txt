aloha, again - forgot that the file points to an external stylesheet, which
i forgot to attach...  not that it would have mattered anyway, as the
current archiving protocol breaks linked files when it provides each
attachment with a distinct URI using a scheme that signifies that the file
is an attachment to a certain emessage in the archives...  so, at the risk
of incurring the wrath of the listowner, i'm reposting the file with the
stylesheet inserted into the HEAD of the document...  i apologize for any
inconvenience. gregory.
