AG: So for the moment, _don't_ populate TITLE in A especially
on text links if you care about the Jaws users in your audience

GJR: hmm...  i couldn't disagree more - i care about Jaws users, since i am
one of them, but i use "title" and "alt" correctly (that is, according to
specification) because this is an implementation bug that has been reported
to Jaws' developers on numerous occasions.  when does developer
responsibility become an issue?  rather than misuse markup, someone other
than me needs to contact freedom scientific to ask them why one can't toggle
between "display hyperlink text", "display title", and "display alt" - not
only in the list-of-links, but on-the-fly, as well. and, if the answer
received from the company formerly known as henter-joyce is "we can't get
the information from the IE-DOM", then the issue needs to be brought before
the microsoft reps in our midst.  and if it turns out that the information
is readily available, then that (technically detailed) information needs to
be funneled back to AT developers.  it is that simple.

so, if you "care about the jaws users in your audience" you will raise holy
hell until jaws' implementation is improved/fixed, and NOT abuse/misuse
markup. gregory.
