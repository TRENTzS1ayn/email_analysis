Chas,

there are many use cases where the captions aren't the same length as the
content, or where it is desirable to pause the rest of the presentation -
this is also the case in audio-described content, where it takes extra time
to put in the audio descriptions.

SMIL 2 was designed to handle these cases better in various ways. For
example, it is possible to have audio descriptions (for example) which, if
they are played, force the presentation to wait at key points (this is
related to the way that it controls synchronisation failure, but also to
some more purpose-designed functions it introduces).

Of course there are other cases where this is not desirable. Enabling a user
to choose between slowing the overall presentation, and keeping it running in
real time, is a nice choice to have when people are getting a live
transmission. The technology exists (not just in SMIL, but also with
conventional TV) for making this choice at multiple points, and going from
one mode  to the  other by various means (fast-forward through buffered
content, or just jump to current real-time point, or ...)

cheers

  Why do captioned objects need to be the same length as uncaptioned objects?
  Why wouldn't it be possible (and even desirable) to allow captioned versions
  to pause the audiovisual long enough for caption readers to catch up?

  Just wondering.
