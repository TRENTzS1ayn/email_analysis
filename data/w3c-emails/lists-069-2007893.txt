CMN Well, we rely on all the expertise we can find. Now that you have joined
the group we have more people who have experience in this area. (there are
others as well, who are less visible on lists, but the more we have, the
less likely I think we are to make silly mistakes).

JC
  If it's inaudible, how do we know it's mumbling? When mouth movements
  are unaccompanied by voice, a caption along the lines of [no voice]
  is customary.

CMN Correct. But this example explicitly states that mumbling can be heard.

about

JC
  It should be expressly permitted to record an audio description.

CMN Anything the guidelines does not say must be avoided can be done - this
is implicit. But there have beena  few comments along these lines - perhaps
we should try to make it a bit clearer.

Certainly examples could say something like "an audio description or caption
track is not required for this case, although it will still be useful to some
people so may be provided".

Cheers
