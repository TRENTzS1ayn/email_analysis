technical nit-picking:

Nope, it isn't SVG (yet) and the new images are differnt from the old one so
the URI hasn't changed. At some point I am likely to write some metadata that
explains the old one is superseded, so smart systems will be able to see the
histroy of the ideas (which is why I didn't just replace them).

           But I like how Chaals has taken your comments and made a new
  version of the graphic that doesn't include the international symbols....
  See what you think of his new one (link in Chaals' post) !  It uses a
  business graphic as the illustration, plus he put the good and bad symbols
  over them to show which is which....  also, he reduced the size of the
  graphics so you can see them as a whole on smaller screens ... (and since
  it's in SVG it should be stretchable)

           According to Chaals, the way I hooked up his graphic means you can
  see the new version in the "simulation" without my doing anything <grin>
  .... hey Chaals, this IS neat!

if you change the URI of the first image from .../34.png to .../34a.png you
get the new one.

Some time when I ahve a few days I will explain how the rather cool annotea
system allows me to make the linking between the old and new work
automatically.

Cheers
