Chas,

         Both Jonathan and I have been working on these issues far longer 
than you've been around. How can you presume to call either of us a troll? 
If there is a troll on this list, you are looking like it.

         Your first two points were fine. The rest went downhill from 
there. Please look back in the archives and see how your "issues" have 
already been refuted. Children learn to draw before they come to school, 
and during the early years, there skills are honed and refined. In any high 
schools I've been in, the art classes were full to capacity..... And it 
makes no sense to say that those who need graphics can't have them because 
someone in a third world country can't download them. That simply isn't 
fair, and it isn't what the guidelines are about.

                                         Anne
