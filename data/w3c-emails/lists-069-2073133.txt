I didn't. In fact, I said just the opposite. Read my post.

I'm glad to see that I passed muster on at least a couple.

It is customary to provide URLs when referring to archived posts. Which
posts specifically refute my comments? You point to them, I'll read them.

I don't believe that anything I've said has been refuted, only disputed.
There is a difference.

Not to anything approaching a professional level. And immediately after
those early years, those skills are most often left to decay. Almost
everyone I know can write (though a few can't spell). Most of the people I
know don't consider themselves anywhere close to proficient at drawing or
graphics (and the graphic designers I know seem to agree). Do you have
evidence to support your claim?

Now, I think that these skills are latent, and that they can be developed.
That's why I'm advocating a significant increase in the amount of
information regarding use of graphics, etc. in the techniques document. Read
my post and you'll see. Point 12.

Oh, in my high school, too. Full of people who wanted an "easy" class, who
were trying to avoid yet another writing-related class. There were real
artists in there, too, but they were the exceptions, not the rule.

Are you saying that students spend as much time studying art as they do
studying how to write? As much time drawing as writing? I'd be amazed if you
could produce evidence to show this.

Oh, I agree. See my post. I never said anything about denying graphics to
people who need them -- for any reason. In fact, I think I said just the
opposite, that graphics, audio, video, etc. were vital (see points 1 and 2).
What I did say was that graphics should be used judiciously -- that means
wisely and carefully -- so that we do not unnecessarily deny access to
people who can't afford fast access and the latest technology. It's not the
same thing at all as saying "no graphics." Really.
