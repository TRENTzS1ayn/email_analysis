Hello all

Abstract
========

This document explains how to design accessible applications using
XML, the Extensible Markup Language. Compared to the HTML or MathML
languages, XML is one level up: it is a meta syntax used to describe
these languages, as well as new ones. As a meta syntax, XML provides
no intrinsic guarantee of device independence or textual alternate
support. It is essential, therefore, that XML formats and tools
designers are provided with guidelines that explain how to include
basic accessibility features - such as those present in HTML, SMIL,
and SVG - in all their new developments.
