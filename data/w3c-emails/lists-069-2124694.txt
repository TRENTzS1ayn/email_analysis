The reason to add images, etc. should be because you have it and it's 
relevant. Do you want to deny access to large numbers of disabled persons 
to accommodate those with old equipment? The presence of a graphic on a 
page does not deny the page to the person, only the graphic. It's only when 
the graphic isn't there that something is "denied" ....

What makes you think that the rest of the world isn't waiting for the 
graphics as so many Americans did?

If you'd read the archives you'd see that I've said often that once we say 
firmly that graphics have to be there, we can talk about the best way to 
accommodate them to all users ... Until then, we have no reason for a say-so.
