I'm not sure that judicious use of graphics will accommodate the folks who 
need it so much as a comprehensive use of graphics to enhance 
comprehensibility on we pages ....

Helen Keller was added to the Virginia SOLs this year, and I made a page 
for her on http://www.geocities.com/apembert45/History/Keller.html .. At 
the bottom of the page are links to the AFB site for a whole gallery of 
photos of Helen, Anne, and the many people in Helen's life ... and one of 
the second grade teachers in today's workshop linked on those pictures, and 
was ooohing and aaaahing all over the place . HER students will be visiting 
that site this year!!!!

Carefully and wisely sound constraining. There is no reason for constraint 
when you are meeting the needs of disabled persons, at least according to 
the purpose of the guidelines.

I don't. If you don't have the technology, you just get a message it isn't 
there. If the guidelines are followed, you will have a text alternative if 
it doesn't work. So access is denied to no one with older technology ..... 
(hey! the school I work at has ancient MAC III classics some idiot thought

they?) I was online back when it was all dos on an apple, before a 386, 
486, and onward .... I know what it can't do, and when it can't pull in a 
graphic, you DON'T have the download time!!!!! If you pay extra for 
download time, you turn off images to pull in a page, and get it cheap ....

Again, are these people served if they have no choice of image or not? If 
it's not there, the user is dis'ed ....

You are confusing content with presentation. Graphics that are there to 
make a page pretty are part of the visual presentation, they are not 
content ....

Actually, the non-First World is catching onto computer better than onto 
TV, doncha know ... chat I had with a prof in Cuba was that computer with 
email access were happening in the colleges, not yet the K-12 schools, and 
not yet the web. Interesting that after we exchanged mutually exclusive 
political position, he sent a picture by e-mail ... which I responded to in 
kind. He cannot see my web pages, but we can exchange pictures with this 
Third World country ...

The story of my friend in Cuba .... sending me his picture early in the 
correspondence, reciprocated by picture of hubby and I <grin> ...

Again, if you don't want images you can de-select them. But, if they aren't 
there, you don't have a choice .... give the user the choice!!!!!

Pictures work for the poor, Hispanic, Spanish-speaking people with 
cognitive disabilities or not, right here in Dinwiddie, Virginia. Do they 
count? I'm trying to make it so .... How about you?????

Have at, it Chas!!!! You are a worthy opponent .... But can I suggest we 
take some of it offlist and spare the group the flames?

Go probably got the gist of it!  The discussion tends to repeat itself when 
new folks come into the group ... that's why I want to create a simulation 
that gives new folks a chance to see what it's like to hit a wall of text 
with no clue what it's about ...  And, I've been off this summer, mostly 
making the web pages I did at the presentations today ... but in May, the 
kids were pretty much where I wanted them to be --- independent in using 
the computers on something instructional .... which left my lunch time and 
breaks free for e-mail ... which was usually Guidelines ... My time will be 
limited beginning a week from Monday til October ....

Now, regarding when we should talk about the best way to accommodate

When checkpoint 3.4 actually says that graphics need to be there, we can 
move forward. Not until. If we cannot recognize the need for these 
elements, we cannot obstruct their use by those who recognize realities.

A picture is worth a thousand words, so you will have to cut out a thousand 
words to balance the loss of a graphic ....

Not a problem, but remember we are only talking about the graphics that are 
content .... the presentation graphics, such as backgrounds aren't content ....

The correct way to do this is to put the small (resampled) version of the 
graphic on the page and link it to the full-sized version.... after all 
some people want to see the details in faces in graphics of a large 
painting ... see 
http://www.geocities.com/apembert45/FamAmer/Pocahontas.html and look at the 
painting of Pocahontas and John Smith and tell me that five year olds will 
get anything out of that image if you reduce it to a width  of 100 pixels?

Yep, Jonathan has talked about the need to keep pages short and sweet, and 
he is working with the adults of this disability (whereas I work with 
children whose needs are not always the same) ...
download in a flash is dependent on your connection ... I'm on a rural line 
and sometimes I get less than 14000 even tho my modem can handle much more 
.... downloading time is time to load the dishwasher, etc.....

Of course, do you see clutter on my pages? 
http://www.geocities.com/apembert45  and especially in the pages for the 
individual Famous Americans from 
http://www.geocities.com/apembert45/FamAmer .... ?

Again, look at what that looks like when her suggestions are followed 
without limiting the use of graphics to illustrate the content on: 
http://www.geocities.com/apember45/History ..... if you look at all the 
pages from http://www.geocities.com/apember45 are all consistent - same 
layout, same background .... but the graphics are there (and there are 
text-only links that are waiting for graphics ... have two weeks to finish 
them up ) ...

Yes, Chas .... it is working ....
