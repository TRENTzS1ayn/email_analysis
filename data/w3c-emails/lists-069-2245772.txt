Haven't I made it clear enough that the recommendation for multi-media is 
for ILLUSTRATION? Then let's try again, all together now .... add 
illustrations to text to aid comprehension.

Depends on the purpose of the site. If it is *the* comprehensive page on 
ole George, then if you have fifty pictures, you need to put all or most of 
the fifty pictures on the site. No, not all on one page .... Although I 
haven't counted them, there are probably more than 50 pictures of Helen 
Keller on the AFB site .... Are you suggesting that the AFB "wasted too 
much band width" sharing all of those pictures? Library of Congress has 
thousands of historical photos online. Are they "wasting band width" 
keeping all those images that are so heavily used in historical research?

When 3.4 is written correctly, it will specify that the graphics be 
illustrations, eliminating your concern about random additions.

Interestingly, since I am downloading at a very slow speed recently, I had 
no trouble comprehending your page because I read it while it was 
downloading, and the hummingbird background was the last element to load. 
Worked nicely. You ended up making a comprehensible page when you were 
trying for an incomprehensible one <grin> ....

That sounds like a good technique to go with the checkpoint.

This is one of those issues that seems obvious, is hinted at in some 
checkpoint details, but I've never seen it proposed as a checkpoint. But, 
what would you tell the AFB about all that bandwidth they are using to 
share Helen's life with the world, or the Library of Congress not to share 
the publicly paid for photographs and art work that tell the history of our 
nation?

And nicely described in the alt text which displayed while I read the 
loading page. Oh, couldn't you think  of anything better for the background 
than netscape grey?

With a more visible caption, this is another really an effective 
illustration for your point.

>I also added

This one didn't work. An animated arrow zooming at the text would have 
worked better.

>I admit that I added

Then make a page about flowers and move the rose there .... I do that quite 
often with my pages .... get to building something and discover I've got 
more content than that section needs, and another section gets started ...

Nope, you page doesn't upset much in the guidelines, especially since you 
avoided using the music as background and put that link on the page. You 
were not as outrageous as you could have been! <grin>

>(Perhaps text *is* sometimes necessary to get the point across.)

It is not the purpose of the guidelines to avoid the learning lessons of 
those new to the field. At one time everyone was new to the field, all at 
once even .... now, at least those coming in new are spaced out and 
everyone isn't all trying to learn at once.  My biggest splash into 
graphics was when I started using Publisher to design page sets,  and 
finally learned to do what was useful in Front Page and drop the excess 
coding and constrictions in Publisher (I still design some pages in 
Publisher then convert them to Front Page after the presentation is 
right)... but those splashy pages bugged me and I took them down this 
summer and haven't rebuilt that part of the site yet, but happier with them 
down for now ... The medium is still growing and we all grow with it ....
