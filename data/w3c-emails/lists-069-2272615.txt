No, I was probably reading with emotions left over from the flames that 
made me view any modifiers as limiting.
Bad thing about flames, they sometimes re-kindle ignobly ....

Text is not enough for poor users, but if the graphics aren't there the day 
after the poor user gets a better computer, they are no better off for a 
new computer!  Yes, there are people in third world countries with 
cognitive disabilities and they will not be able to access the web with an 
older computer ... Turning the graphics off is a choice. Someone with a 
slow connection who is cognitively disabled will have to wait for the 
graphics to come in - but for them there is absolutely no advantage to 
turning off what they need so they to get in faster what they cannot use. 
And again, if the graphics aren't there, they have nothing to come to that 
web page for anyway .....

No matter how you cut it, if the graphics aren't there, NO ONE benefits, if 
they are there some benefit now, some later.

Bandwidth-intensive content cannot deprive anyone of anything. It is the 
receiving hardware that deprives. That is the point of saying "Include 
Illustrations" .... if they aren't there, everyone loses no matter which 
world they live in.

Sorry, can't say it all in two paragraphs anymore than you can .... you 
have to take each point ....
