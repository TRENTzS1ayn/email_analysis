Bandwidth is a problem for people. There are bandwidth-intesive ways to send
content (the overblown PDF that some tools generate is an example) that are
unnecessary, and that cause problems for people who live in areas where
infrastructure is poor.

I am not sure that we should have a blanket checkpoint on this, anymore than
I think a blanket checkpoint saying "add multimedia" is good, although both
of these things are clearly good principles to keep in mind.

Do we have anywhere a list of the things we think are good ideas?
