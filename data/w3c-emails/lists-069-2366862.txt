Chaals,

         Thanks for you input here.... hadn't thought of PDF in that light, 
but is a nuisance. I think it is used to keep documents similar across 
various media. It seems to be very popular in government offices - much of 
what we get from the state dept of ed these days is in PDF format ....

         Is PDF more of a bandwidth hog than graphics, or about the same?

                                         Anne
