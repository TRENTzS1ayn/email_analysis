I don't buy it. I fail to see how adding graphics appropriately (including 
excessively when its appropriate) can deprive any one of access other than 
to the pictures themselves if the user chooses not to download them.

Choose a better word than judicious .... it takes too much to qualify that 
term in this usage.  Also, as Chaals pointed out to "Illustrate" is more 
than to add graphic illustrations, it needs to include sound files that 
illustrate as well as still graphics and multi-media.

As I said before, when you have too much for a page, branch it out onto 
another linked page, create a page set or site (or whatever you want to 
call a subsection of a web site).

You my consider graphics a luxury, but those who need them do not. Do you 
want to deprive some so others won't feel left out?

No one, anywhere in this argument has insisted of flashiness of any kind. 
And, as long as you keep insisting that is the result of illustrating a 
page, we will never come together on the issues.

Again, the only time anything is denied to anyone, is if it's not there. 
Would you like it if someone came and collected all your food, you have 
more than you need, and there are people without. So you can't eat until 
everyone in the world is a well-fed as you?????

One possibility is to combine 3.3 and 3.4 and perhaps others into one 
guideline that addresses content itself, and can balance the needs. Yes, 
graphical and sound elements need to be as clear and simple as the text. I 
have never said anything but .... (as long as you don't get silly and say 
photos aren't clear and simple and shouldn't be used, which was proposed at 
one time).
