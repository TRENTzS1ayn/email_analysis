No I was not confusing the terms. My use was quite clear. The determination 
of how many graphics are too many goes to the purpose of the site. Don't 
forget that you can use break up any content (text or sets of graphics) 
into smaller pages, which increases the comprehensibility of the individual 
pages, and the comprehensibility of the site as a whole. Imagine a site 
that sells men's shirts. Do you want to limit the user to one or two 
pictures instead of showing pictures of all the different styles?

The point I was making is that the site author has to consider more than 
what goes on any individual page. The purpose of the site determines the 
content. The purpose of an individual page on a site governs the content.

See my last note about combining the text and non-text content issues into 
a checkpoint, and put "clear and simple" in the techniques for both ...

Archive sites don't always provide thumbnails. Usually it's text 
descriptions and you get one size of the picture. If you download it, you 
can make it any size (within pixel limits, of course).

                         Gotta go.

PS: Not sure if I will be able to access mail at work, and I'm headed to 
the airport right from work, so this may be the last from me until I get 
back from Wisconsin Monday night.
