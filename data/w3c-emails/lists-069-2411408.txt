You must be aware that anything written can be made incomprehensible with
very little effort, it does not even require intelligence. Your efforts
would be far better spent trying to produce something, or alternatively
linking to something that demonstrated in a positive way what is possible.

In fact there are already multimedia aids that teach many computer subjects,
there is no reason why accessibility cannot be one of them, it merely
requires dedication. If you have never tried one I recommend them to you.

it is cheap to buy.
One learns through doing, ie watch the mouse being dragged across the
screen, then try it yourself.

The idea is not that everyone has to do all of this but that they are aware
of it, and can fathom the benefits of doing it accessibly.
Waitrose a shopping chain has what I believe is a particularly effective use
for small images:

fs.jsp?merchant_rn=2071&branch_rn=0
They help the purchaser ensure that the correct goods are being shipped.
unfortunately I cannot get this site to work with jaws, there seems to be
some interference with the tabbing function.
Indeed the tabbing does not work ideally with the javascript in this
instance....

We need to learn as quickly as possible some of the ways to help people who
are trying their best in a difficult and competitive environment.
