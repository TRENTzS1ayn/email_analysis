Chas:
This will be my last comment on this issue since it appears futile to pursue
it further.

The above example says "if someone came and collected all your food." The
key word here is "all." I have never said, nor will I, that all graphics
should be removed from the Web. I have said that superfluous graphic should
be avoided.

Even if we remove the word "all," it's not a very good analogy. But just to
set the record straight, if I have food beyond what I need for maintenance,
I *do* give it away. And if everyone on the planet could be ensured enough
food to eat, yes, I would give all of mine away. My life for the survival of
hundreds of thousands? I should be so lucky.

Chas.
