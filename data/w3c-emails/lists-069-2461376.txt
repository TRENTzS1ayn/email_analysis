Chas,

         Back from my weekend, and re-reading what I read on the road ....

         Your term "superfluous" is problematic. While you demonstrated on 
your "ugly page", what you may mean, it isn't at all certain that you are a 
person who could clearly distinguish between what is "superfluous" to one 
person, but useful to another ...

         Chas, you urged me to get better acquainted with the problems and 
challenges of programmers who may have to dip into graphical design. I 
spent the weekend getting better acquainted with a programmer who is also a 
skilled graphical designer (in bytes, not on paper) .... She had to study 
the "guidelines", probably version 1.0 in her course work, and was truly 
shocked that the W3C's WAI may be having difficulties accepting the basic 
needs for graphics, especially in the disabled population (she was a 
teacher before she became a programmer), but in the educational community 
and general public as well. Perhaps I can prevail upon her to join the 
effort here???

                                                 Anne
