Jason,

         First of all, the programmer in question is my sister who is by 
blood, entitled to know my angsts. Putting these issues into priority 3 for 
the first version flies in the face of the definition of priorities because 
the groups of people who need graphical support to use the Internet is a 
very large group, such that it should clearly be a priority 1. Further, the 
constant challenges to attempts to make even 1.1, 3.3, and 3.4 say what is 
needed instead of mushing around the issue, complaints and flames that have 
contributed to the constant delays, all make it quite clear that this is a 
major stumbling issue.

         If we are going to solve the problem, we need to face it squarely, 
and without the foolishness over whether we "should" accommodate all 
peoples, or the infighting to see how little we can give them. Hiding the 
real issues from folks who may be of help isn't going to get us anywhere.

                                                 Anne
