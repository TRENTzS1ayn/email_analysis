I would like to suggest the following possibility for
the definition of 'content'.
Split 'content' into

'Passive content' - Content that requires no action
from the user (such as 'normal' text or an image or a
background sound)

and

'Interactive content' - Content that requires action
from the user (such as a link or a button or an image
map)

and the following rewordings of the first 3 Design
Principles

1. Create 'passive' content that allows presentation
in accordance with users' needs, abilities and
preferences.

2. Design 'interactive' content that is easy to use
and performs in accordance with users' needs,
abilities and preferences.

3. Create 'passive' content that is easy to
understand.

My reasoning is
1. There is a clear distinction in the world of web
site creation between (the (passive) content creators
and the programmers / designers). 
The rewording seeks to mirror that distinction.

2. The WCAG document seems to use the word 'content'
to mean different things (what I have termed 'passive
content' and 'interactive content')

One apparent consequence of this is to move checkpoint
2.6 into section 1 (if the user has no control over
the frequency of the flickering)

Also ,the 'ease of use' moves from '3' to '2'.

Note that I have also added the word 'abilities' to
the first 2 principles.
This mirrors comments I heard recently from Neil Scott
from the archimedes project at Stanford
http://archimedes.stanford.edu//
Increasing focus on abilities would appear to create a
more 'powerful' statement of 'working with' rather
than 'working for' people with disabilities.
