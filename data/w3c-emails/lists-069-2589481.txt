Hello all,

I just realized an error on the F2F agenda [1] that was causing some 
confusion.  For Wednesday it used to say, "The Authoring Tool Accessibility 
Guidelines Working Group will join us Wednesday afternoon then is holding 
their own meeting on Thursday. Refer to the AU WG agenda for more 
information (once available)."

What it should have said (and what it says now is):
The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines Working Group will join us 
Tuesday afternoon then is holding their own meeting on Wednesday. Refer to 
the AU WG agenda for more information. [2]

Sorry for the confusion,
--wendy
