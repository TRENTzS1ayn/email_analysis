Jay,

IBM SpeechViewer III does not provide access to software or hardware. It is
a stand-alone software product for speech therapists. You can remove it
from your list.

For accessibility testing, you should probably also include Bobby
(http://www.cast.org), Window-Eyes (www.gwmicro.com), ZoomText
(www.aisquared.com), and IBM ViaVoice.

Subject: Accessibility Testing Lab Software/Hardware?

What items should be part of an accessibility testing lab?  Are there
better
alternatives to these products?
