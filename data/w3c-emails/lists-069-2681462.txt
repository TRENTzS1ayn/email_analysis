Techniques Drafts
JW HTML published this evening, PDF earlier today.
WC Would like to compare the 3 techniques documents. Very different. What 
format should they take? How do success criteria relate to 
techniques/technology-specific checkpoints.
JW I can take an action to write up a proposal and capture the issues.
KHS Take existing 3 differences, which is good for each and how they should 
organize the documents.
GV I think of them as being A, B, and C. A = general, non-technology 
specific, B = technology-specific things you had to do, C=in WCAG 1.0 is 
techniques, but notes about how to do it, code, informative info.
Action JW: Write up issues with technology-specific information and 
relation to non-tech info.
