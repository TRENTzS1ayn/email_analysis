Indeed script is not a javascript thing, however ECMAScript bindings to
the DOM are, and the DOM is, the document is more refering to issues of
using the  DOM (which is not an ECMAScript thing, and wholly the remit of
the W3C)  If you're suggesting that the examples should contain the ever
popular TCL script, then I think that would be nothing but an irrelevance
which would do a strong disservice to the aims of accessibilty, by making
the document inaccessible to the majority of web developers.

Jim.
