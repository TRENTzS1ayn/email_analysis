Javascript/ECMAscript aren't at all defined by W3C, but ass you point out DOM
is. I was going to make the fairly nitpicky suggestion that this could be
clarified a bit - I am happy to propose something in a while when I do a real
review.

  I gu?

  Indeed script is not a javascript thing, however ECMAScript bindings to
  the DOM are, and the DOM is, the document is more refering to issues of
  using the  DOM (which is not an ECMAScript thing, and wholly the remit of
  the W3C)  If you're suggesting that the examples should contain the ever
  popular TCL script, then I think that would be nothing but an irrelevance
  which would do a strong disservice to the aims of accessibilty, by making
  the document inaccessible to the majority of web developers.

  Jim.
