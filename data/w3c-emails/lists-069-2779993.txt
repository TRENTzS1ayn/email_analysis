John Mullen is a gold mine of knowledge.  He is a dyslexic math professor. 
Epitomizes all my favorite theories, in a way.

In any case, since I consider him a high quality window into a
little-illuminated world (at least in our understanding level) and he
mentioned
a good book in this post to EASI-SEM, I thought I would pass the message
along.

An introduction to EASI-SEM is available at

 <http://www.rit.edu/~easi/lists.htm>http://www.rit.edu/~easi/lists.htm

but there doesn't seem to be a web archive for this list.  It's been very
quiet
most of the time over the last two years.

>Dear Tom,

>Difficulties/Disabilities in the area of reading and writing.
>At this time I became interested in exploring the potential of adaptive

>computers - or the funding had disappeared and I was not working at all. So,
>I just kept reading and hoping I would sometime have the chance to explore

>about the learning/teaching of reading (in particular) and am working with

>experiences with print, I am aware that there are older high school students
>(beyond my physical reach) who could benefit from adaptive technology which
>could impact positively upon their reading and writing
>difficulties/disabilities. I have not yet been able to set-up, for these

>of anyone's experience in this matter - with?? students of whatever age.
