Eminent good sense.

The justifiable complaints about WCAG 1.0 were directed at *its* 
accessibility/usability and more of the same will suffer the same.

That (normative semi-regulatory-sounding) already got done and has led to a 
spate of referring-to-it laws/regulations/policies which, not that they are 
engraved in marble don't need a lot of chipping or even cleaning. *They* 
got the idea.

"Normative" is no longer in the hunt but "informative" is de rigeur - which 
is what CMcCN has been saying over on ATAG - "keep those techniques coming, 
folks".

As Trummy Young sang "'Tain't Whatcha Do, It's the Way Howja Do It - That's 
What Gets Results." If you would hear this use the "result-oriented" link at
