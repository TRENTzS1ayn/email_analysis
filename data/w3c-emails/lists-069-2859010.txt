Yes, but it is rather vague and very hypothetical--sorry Al. The WCAG
2.0 draft gives a very good indication of what this working group has
aimed to achieve by writing general guidelines and checkpoints that
don't address specific technologies. If there are problems with this
draft that result from the design decisions which the working group
has made in this respect, then it would be important to ascertain, in
concrete terms, what these are. Specifically, is it possible to read
the current draft with Al's arguments in mind and identify significant
problems that are likely to hinder comprehension or application of the
guidelines, bearing in mind the technology-specific layer which is
presently being written? In part of course, the "usability testing"
proposal will provide data on which to make that assessment, but given
the issues which Al raised in his message I find it very difficult to
derive concrete, verifiable hypotheses regarding the current draft,
the validity of which can be tested to determine whether there really
is or is not a problem here.
