Not anymore. Several drafts exist already, and they are to be
discussed at the face to face meeting next week.

At the outset of this process, the working group decided to generalise
the guidelines and checkpoints, and to separate them logically from
the technology-dependent requirements and examples. That is the
premise on which the development of WCAG 2.0 has proceeded, and I hope
these decisions do not need to be revisited now.

From the requirements document (http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wcag20-requirements):

<blockquote>
WCAG 2.0 requirements should be expressed in generic terms so that they may
apply to more than one markup language or content format.

2. WCAG 2.0 must clearly specify the minimal requirements necessary for
conformance. Each requirement must be easily verifiable. The WG will provide
resources to help readers evaluate conformance, such as technology-specific
checklists, sample sites, sample renderings (aural as well as graphical), and
processes for determining conformance (e.g., in conjunction with the ERT and
EO WGs).
</blockquote>

The WCAG 2.0 draft is intended to satisfy the first of these
requirements and, by providing success criteria, part of the second.
The remainder of the second requirement is to be met by (as the
Requirements Docuemnt indicates) technology-specific documents and
checklists, working examples, etc., the development of which is
underway but lags behind that of the guidelines themselves. This is
why much of next week's meeting is devoted to techniques and
technology-specific work.

Could we at least postpone discussion of this issue until the
technology-specific documents have started to stabilize, and we know
what "views" of the documents we plan to provide to readers? After
that we can check, with the aid of usability testing, to find out
whether there are any problems that haven't been addressed.
