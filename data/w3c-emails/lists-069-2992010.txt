As I read the list - I am struck with how much text is flowing.    I
find myself wanting to skim at times -  and I am a chair.   How about
the rest of the listmembers.

Now skimming would not be a problem, - except for the fact that there
are good ideas and bits buried in the long emails.   I fear that these
will be lost - (even by those who read the emails) - since no one wants
to go back and reread everything to find the good points again.

Secondly,  it appears to me that there are some areas of agreement that
keep getting swept aside in the discussions about what is not agreed on
(or understood).

Thirdly - we seem to be discussing abstract concepts more than specific
recommendations. It is very hard for the editors to put the thoughts
into words if not words or specific suggestions are made.


I would like to make a few suggestions.

1 -  Let's try to have more specific proposals - rather than just
discussions of concepts.    Note that I did not restrict discussion to
proposals. We need the concept discussions as well.  But we need to know
what people are proposing  by their discussion.  This is not always
clear.

2 - Let's have people put their key points at the top of their email --
then proceed with the rationale.   I know there is some danger that
people won?t read the rationale... but it is no greater than the danger
of people not reading the long text at all -- or losing the nuggets
afterward.    An alternative would be to summarize what you are
proposing at the end.      AGAIN -- please focus on what you are
proposing -- not just summarizing what you don?t think.

3 - Try to start with what you think you agree on -- the common ground.
Then focus on what you see as differences.  And look for ways to try to
come together.  (I know this can be hazardous at times.  No good deed
seems to go unpunished.  But try.  And try to be gentle with each
other.)


Thanks much

Gregg Van
