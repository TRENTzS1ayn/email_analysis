Further to Gregg's suggestions:

Before raising an issue or criticizing the guidelines, I would suggest
attempting to answer the following questions and including, so far as
possible, these answers in your e-mail message:

1. Precisely what is the problem or concern?

2. What parts of the working group's deliverables are affected by it?
   Try to be specific regarding guidelines, checkpoints, the
   conformance scheme, the techniques, etc.

3. Why is there a problem and what evidence is available to show that
   it exists. If there isn't any evidence or cogent argument that
   comes to mind, what steps should the working group take to
   determine whether there is an issue that needs to be addressed?

4. What are the options for addressing the problem or issues? At the
   very least, try to specify what, in your view, would constitute a
   solution. If possible, make a specific proposal (e.g., the creation
   of a new checkpoint, a change to the success criteria, a
   reorganisation of the documents along particular lines, etc.).
   Proposals for specific wording are of particular benefit to the
   editors and are, therefore, most welcome.

It is of course  legitimate to raise issues without addressing
these questions. However, by taking them into account you can
significantly enhance the effectiveness of your contribution in
enabling the working group to improve and refine its deliverables, and
to achieve the mandate set forth in its Charter.
