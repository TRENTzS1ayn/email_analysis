Does Gregg and Jason's approach makes sense, even though it is logical?

The fact is that to construct a piece of art, one does not go through this
process.
Not everything is codified yet, and the reductionist approach does not suit
all goals.
We have no satisfactory way to describe a tree (say) via this route.
It works, but other ways work at least as well.

It really is time for an 'as well as' consideration.
