   <wendy> GV How to make them accessible to more people, not accessible.
Always a line.
   <wendy> CM (Charles Munat) Is not boolean.
   <wendy> .. making them MORE accessible, not accessible.
   <wendy> .. other agencies help people provide ATs. We can't do everything
to make things accessible.
   <wendy> RN A goal - to make a site that is accessible to ATs
   <wendy> ? by itself but also w/ATs.
   <wendy> GV Gets into UA/designer issue.
   <wendy> JM Like the idea of introducing of "degrees" of accessibility.
   <wendy> .. some readers have a hard time coming at it.
   <wendy> .. oftentimes, accessibility considered boolean. it is or it is
not.
   <wendy> WC how about, "...creating Web sites that are accessible to more
people." also deal with in conformance.

             chaals starts minuting
<chaals> CS would be fine having a subsection, likes having how to read in
TOC
<chaals> JM familiar and standard phrase
<chaals> This is getting chopped around a lot.
<chaals> ... might be a good idea to chop it at some point and rewrite it so
oit flows.
<chaals> ...using what is there.
<chaals> JM volunteers to rewrite intro.
<chaals> CM doesn't know when to keep his head down.
      <Jo> CM is thrilled to offer his rhetorical skills to the effort.
<chaals> RN missing: difference between structure and presentation piece was
really strong and that is important to understanding the document.
             chaals thinks we should quit with the jokes already ;-)
<chaals> GV: doing intro should include collecting notes about how to re-do
it, and wait before we start on that process.
<chaals> ... trying to do it too many times might take some attention away
from developing the content. When we think it is full, good idea.
<chaals> JM Right. take it off the table for now, and concentrate on other
stuff.
<chaals> ...also some material may belong in other places. But canbe visitied
later.
<chaals> GV let's not worry about wording, and note down the things we want.
<chaals> RN We could generate a TOC, and fill it in later.
<chaals> TOC == Table of contents
             chaals wants an abbreviation bot
<chaals> GV do we pull intro now or later?
<chaals> CM Now would be good - as long as it is there ist is a distraction
<chaals> WC we talked about making it a chapter - we can bypass it.
<chaals> CM Anything that focuses on guidelines themselves will be helpful.
Also, writing any doc the intro s the last thing you write.
<chaals> GV there is usually something
      <Jo> Chaals: thinks its important that the stuff in the intro is
available to the public as our attempt to explain where the doc is going,
what's missing, etc.
<chaals> CMN It is important for reviewers to have info about where the
document is up to, and what is the difference between things that aren't
there because we haven't finished them and things that aren't there because
we havent thought of them.
<chaals> GV Want to freezeintro until rest of doc is nearly ready.
<chaals> WC before that. We need something - make it a seperate chapter
<chaals> GV take "how to read document, target, drafts in non-web format' and
put them in that category.
<chaals> ASW that assumes we are all in agreement
<chaals> GV Good to have questions raised when they are issues about content
not just wording.
<chaals> ASW seems that the group are not in agreement about audience
<chaals> ASW charter says audience is authors who have some familiarity with
markup languages
<chaals> chartered audience: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/new-charter-2000.html
<chaals> GV the stuff in the document is a rough idea, not an attempt to
define the audience
<chaals> CM Do we need to define a target audience in the doc?
<chaals> CS If our target is tech implementors I don't think our writing
style is right.
<chaals> RN We have several audiences
<chaals> GV Theere is a different between target and intended audience -
there is the ones who need it and the others who will use it
<chaals> s/intended/actual/
<chaals> Bob: In my experience there are a lot of people using it. largest
group are people being told - here is the stuff you need.
<chaals> that audience is really imortant.
<chaals> ...one way to deal with that audience is to provide links to other
parts. We do need to recognise that this is used as the basis for a lot of
policy stuff - it has to be readily transferred.
<chaals> s/transferred/transferable/
<chaals> JM keep in mind role of support document. This may be the place that
people get lost. maybe some audiences can be supported by supplementary
documents
<chaals> GV Maybe shouldbe pointer to WAI EO section
<chaals> CS At CSUN meeting I agree with what was decided. There is a
mismatch in that and the charter.
<chaals> WC charter needs to be updated. It says we have expired...
   <wendy> s/wc charter has been updated...need to make sure you have the
right one.  we expire 2002/ previous()
      <Jo> CMN: the supplementary docs are critical.
<chaals> CM CM it is kind of impossible to adress every audience in the same
document. I think some readers are assuming this doc will answer all
questions. I think it is important that WCAG 2 maintains a tone appropriate
for a technical audience, but we are also going to need to have some stuff
that isvery simple.
<chaals> key is tie it in places like intro - e.g. for managers read this
bit, for developers read that bit....
             chaals notes that Johan Hjelm wrote a book with a very good
example of doing this
<chaals> GV Remember this will be a normative document. People will ahve to
meet this, sothey will read this.
<chaals> CM To enable that vocabulary etc must be carefully done.
<chaals> GV Pointing to individual documents will be hard, pointing to places
is good.

<chaals> 3. dc must stand on its own. additioal how-to info can still be
provided.
<chaals> s/dc/document/
<chaals> JM can it stand on its own without techniques?
<chaals> GV In old doc we had checkpoints that were normative, and techniques
where there were lots of ways.
<chaals> we now have three - do you mean where it says you can do it like
this, or tech-specific checkpoints?
<chaals> question is whether tech-specific checkpoint should be normative.
<chaals> Will be discussed shortly...
<chaals> GV It has to stand on its own to be a W3C Rec.

      <Jo> CMN documents can rely on other standards but the collection of
what you have as the recommendation cannot rely on scribbled notes that you
keep elsewhere. if you can't make the thing work without those, then it's not
enough to be a recommendation.
<chaals> GV Chair: scope and usability goes into open issues for intro...
<chaals> GV How far did you mean by intro, Jo?
<chaals> CM up to the guidelines
<chaals> general agreement.
<chaals> GV introductory material, not introduction "proper"

<chaals> ASW. If scripts and applets can be made accessible they shouldn 't
need an alternative
<chaals> GV what if the device doesn't support scripts
<chaals> ASW how do we make that decision
<chaals> GV goes back to our assumption of HTML underneath everything
<chaals> CS Propsed that we require scripting in browsers - still an open
discussion
<chaals> WC It is open.
<chaals> CS A lot of success criteria will hinge on baseline capabilities.

   <mcmay> CM Disagree. There are ways to write it such that it would be
impossible. Al Gilman has suggested hypertext - it would be difficult to make
a document like that normative.
   <mcmay> GV W3C/WAI lobbied to get people to use this document, rather than

   <mcmay> ASW If people are to comply with this, it has to be normative.

   <mcmay> CM Wendy said this is what the charter is, etc. There seems to be
movement in a direction that wasn't chartered.
   <mcmay> The Web is a fluid medium. Just because the W3C set out to do
this, isn't necessarily what we should do. Charter may be too limiting.
   <mcmay> Do we need a WCAG 2, or a number of separate documents to support
a database-like structure?
   <mcmay> We're in a straitjacket in believing we're creating regulations.

shouldn't limit ourselves because that's what's in our charter.

 <oedipus> aloha, all - sorry i'
   <mcmay> We are not really going with guidelines or regulations. If we

what can be regulatory.

a mess.
 <KatieHS> welcome, gregory
 <oedipus> aloha, katie
   <mcmay> GV We studied why people create accessible products. There was
only one factor: profit/ROI.
   <mcmay> We thought another factor was regulation. Regulation is society's
way of moving something into profit.

regulations to look the same.
   <mcmay> If industry has no direction, they'll freeze. Two differing blind
groups will cause companies to freeze.
   <mcmay> CM Can we agree that regulators should be able to use the
document?
   <mcmay> (unanimous)
   <mcmay> ... then we should determine which is usable and which is not, and
move what is not usable into another document.
   <mcmay> CMN By usable, do we mean regulators can use this as their basic
reference, or that they can say "this is the regulation"?
   <mcmay> RN WCAG should be something that is definitive. Keep management
overview in EO

   <wendy> CMN believe you'd have universal consensus on that.
   <wendy> CS Issues w/WCAG 1 that are difficult to do, many people discount
entier thing (based on one).
   <wendy> LGR Believe this is strongly related to conformance. Could
structure to make it reasonable.
   <wendy> ...also to address CS's issues.
   <wendy> CS A list of everything one could do, would be interesting, but
not appropriate for this.
   <wendy> GV We seem to consensus on what we're trying to achieve.
   <wendy> ..they should be usable in some way by people who write
regulations.
   <wendy> ..they should have a harmonizing effect on people writing
regulations.
   <wendy> ..different words, different countries, things done differently,
but the effect on companies
   <wendy> .. is similar.
   <wendy> ..i don't beleive we have consensus on whether we should put
everything in, including all the hard stuff, or jsut put
   <wendy> ..what is practical.
   <wendy> ..hard and practical, but not hard and inpractical.
*** mcmay has signed off (Connection reset by peer)

   <wendy> ..we have a continuum.
   <wendy> ..things to require, but not sure how.
*** TimLa (~timlaranc@199.108.188.138) joined #wai
   <wendy> ..Another dimension - measurability.  we know we can do it, but
don't have a ruler to measure.
   <wendy> ... people ought to write things simply if they can, but we don't
know how to do that.
   <wendy> RN 2 yrs ago, i was adam ant.
   <wendy> .. wanted to keep them simple.
   <wendy> .. now, my thoughts have changed.
   <wendy> .. put them out there, w/everything in there.
   <wendy> .. let the countries and companies incorporate what they want.
   <wendy> JM the sum up is accurate.
   <wendy>  (she's talking as loud as she can....)
   <wendy> ..it's already in the draft requirements.
   <wendy> KHS propose, along with QA, shouldn't require anything we can't
show good techniques for.
  <oeddie> we have good techniques, they just aren't supported by the extant
technology
  <oeddie> what "mainstream" ua supports CSS2 in toto? these are the problems
- 508 is just a handy stick with which to beat people over the head
   <wendy> CMN we argue about philosphy way too much.
   <wendy> BR 508 effects what's going on at Macromedia.
  <oeddie> in order to get accessibility "out of the box" we first need to
get it into the box, via canonical specs
   <wendy> GV To get a hybrid, we ought to think about:
   <wendy> .. do kind of what we do in 1.0.  Includes all the info about what
would make things accessible.
   <wendy> .. then hi-lite what is critical in a short list.
   <wendy> .. perhaps short list is (previously P1-3). was
impossible/hard/helps, but somethings put down a level other than pure
definition.
   <wendy> .. sometimes you can do it, sometimes you can't.
   <wendy> .. might have a doc that could be used by others to figure out
what is essential and also
   <wendy> .. provide full range of things to move towards.
   <wendy> .. as tech changes they won't disappear.
   <wendy> .. one reason govnt did not include cognitive in 508 was that they
did not feel there was any way to measure.
   <wendy> .. part of this could be handled by structure.
   <wendy> .. objective, and others to address , but no criteria for success.
  <oeddie> accessibility isn't quantitative - it is qualitative (quality +
ative)
   <wendy> .."do what you can..."
      <Jo> gv - Perhaps aim for a document that includes all the information
about what makes things accessible, and highlight things that should be
critical in anyone's shortlist. We aimed for this in 1.0 with priority 1,2,3.
if we could figure out how to do that, then we'd have a document that can be
used by others (regulators, etc.) and can also provide the full range of
things that we ought to be shooting for. So that as technologies change, it's
still on the table. So we do
   <wendy> foood foood foood foood foood foood foood foood foood foood foood
foood
   <wendy> foood foood foood foood foood foood foood foood
   <wendy> foood foood foood foood foood foood foood foood
   <wendy> foood foood foood foood foood foood foood foood
      <Jo> gv - don't have to throw out the things that we don't have the
technology, techniques to address.
