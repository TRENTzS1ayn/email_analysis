Interesting minutes.

A quick suggestion: move "scripts" out of checkpoint 1.1. They are
covered by checkpoint 4.4. The result is that an implementor can
choose whether or not to provide an alternative to scripts, and
therefore decide to comply (or not to comply) with checkpoint 4.4,
without being regarded as having failed checkpoint 1.1, which everyone
agrees is a much more fundamental requirement.

I would also like to have a summary, after the meeting, of the
proposals which are put forward.

Wishing you much success at the meeting,

Jason.
