WL: If  it's cheaper to hire a human "screen reader" (assistive techbology 
"wife 2.0") than to buy a software one ("JAWS 9.x") then we don't need WCAG?

12. Accessibility vs. usability

WL: The use of "vs." here is weird? these are clearly members of one another.

11. Do we intend guidelines to be used by regulators and 
requirements-setters (e.g., in companies)?

WL: Whatever the "intent" might be, this will happen - can't be stopped. We 
may not choose to encourage such use but intent probably is of little 
import. Awareness of this probability may or may not figure into the 
deliberations about the document's language.
