I agree that scripts are covered seperately. I disagree that 1.1 is more
fundamental, but that's philosophy that only needs to be considered if we
disagree.

  Interesting minutes.

  A quick suggestion: move "scripts" out of checkpoint 1.1. They are
  covered by checkpoint 4.4. The result is that an implementor can
  choose whether or not to provide an alternative to scripts, and
  therefore decide to comply (or not to comply) with checkpoint 4.4,
  without being regarded as having failed checkpoint 1.1, which everyone
  agrees is a much more fundamental requirement.

  I would also like to have a summary, after the meeting, of the
  proposals which are put forward.

  Wishing you much success at the meeting,

  Jason.
