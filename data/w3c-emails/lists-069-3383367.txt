Right. I wuld expect onfocus and onmouseover to be used analagously, and it
is true that a user agent can quite easily collapse the two as required.

onclick is only triggered with a mouse (big bug in my opinion) although there
is an onactivate in DOM 2 and in SVG and SMIL 2 which is designed to be
triggered by click, double-click, keyboard activation, or whatever is
appropriate for the user interface in question.

  onMouseOver and an onFocus are more likely, click isn't defined only for a
  pointing device is it?

  If they are identical scripts handlers for the two events point to the
  same function, then a UA could collapse them to one, the same as
  collapsing icon and text links could be done, so the approach is possible,
  it needs to be mentioned in the specifications.
