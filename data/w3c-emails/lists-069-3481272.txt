I don't agree with what al has to say on this.*

This definition of repurposable is highly questionable.
ASCII may be more repurposable than kanji, however this is a remarkably
reductionist viewpoint
Moreover the issue is not which is more repurposable rather an other rather
to raise awareness that all are useful representations.

did anyone read any of the link @?
the or perhaps a point being that whilst it has an absolute meaning namely
'at a cost of' it has cultural idioms, one currently prevalent being 'at the
domain of'. Another being the rather more abstract naming of the symbol
which has a cultural value.
Now even words are names in themselves and share in this culture. Images
seem to share far more richly, and are thus find more successful repurposing
in complex situations. A reading of 'A Smile in Mind' would help here.
A not so humourous imagery follows:

*Uncle Sams trousers with a plane flying into them, makes little sense in
text however it is a powerful image.
Uncle Sam serves very many illustrators, and will continue to do so.
Not everyone is an artist, however the collage of images is relatively
easily achieved.
The current repurposing (by machines) of images abilities are similar to
amazons suggested book readings, not awful, but barely intelligent. There
again screen readers are not human in their skills, and certainly navigation
can be quite painful via this route.
