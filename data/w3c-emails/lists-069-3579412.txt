I was astonished when nearly all the news sites became unavailable.
Then slowly came back with a single frontpage and no or very little
navigation.
A real warning of what could be to come.

Noticeably peepo and a number of other sites I maintain were running
normally or even better, perhaps apparently.
This seems an aspect of the original design of the web, not too well thought
through. There is little opportunity for 'parasitism'.
that is you can visit a site I set up a few months ago http://www.panjir.com
Now for obvious reasons, I'd be happy to host, and field some hits there,
but don't have the opportunity to easily mirror content, in an emergency,
and thus spread the load. No easy solutions.... But command and control, in
a strategic sense, must be difficult in these situations.  One of the few
instances where small groups have a very definite advantage.
