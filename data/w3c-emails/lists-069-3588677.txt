Al, yes, we can agree on that much.

         Now, how to say so in the guidelines clearly and unambiguously ... 
Do we address it in an existing or new checkpoint in guideline 1, or do we 
leave it only suggested by confining it to guideline 3?

         Play with re-wording this ....

         1.6 Provide image equivalents for text. (Note: an image of text is 
not an equivalent for text)
Clearly associate the image equivalent to the text in the structure of the 
document (is this doable? In CSS? elsewhere?). When an image is too large 
to associate with the text, use a small version of the image on the 
document linked to the full-sized version.

         I did not include sound files as an equivalent for text, although 
they can function that way, I don't think sound meets needs as well as 
images .... (I am not referring to sound from speech readers, but sound 
files on documents).

                                         Anne
