Using e-mail to create archives does pose a problem for accessibility, just 
as any database and even large bodies of text shared on the web pose the 
same problems.

What is the solution? Try to illustrate large blocks of text after the fact 
and do it badly, or just decide on less than full accessibility a goal? 
With what we know, we cannot label an all-text presentation as "accessible" 
What to do?
