Well, like images, sometimes sound is not as helpful, but sometimes it is
much more helpful. And it is one of the media commonly used to convey things
that are difficult to express in words or pictures - that's why it is so
common in movies to have additional sound tracks.

I am strongly in favour of including it, despite the fact that at the moment
it is the highest-bandwidth component of much multimedia and is not easily
repurposed.

Let's start without the assumption that what we do every day is accessible -
it may or may not be best practise.
