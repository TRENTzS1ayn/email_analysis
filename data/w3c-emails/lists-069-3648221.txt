Thank you, Charles, you are right!

         I am not a person who can interpret music to the same words as 
most ... I need to know the title of the piece, or the words if a song .... 
but I am not everyone by any means ....

         Do agree that sound is often most useful as background, a third 
dimension to meaning .... I've tentatively added a background music to our 
personal homepage, http://www.erols.com/stevepem, a patriotic tune 
appropriate for my mood and the mood of the country .... but other than 
that, I only use background music if it has meaning to the content of a 
page ..... someday I'll get one of those controls to turn it off and on, 
but til then I'm concentrating on when to use it ....
