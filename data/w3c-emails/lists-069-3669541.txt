Should one name should be enough for those cases where duplication is not
desirable?

It seems that if one wishes onmouseover and onfocus to point to the same
function, and one wishes to find out the name of the object which has focus,
(for a linked image) one needs a name in the 'a' tag for onfocus, and a
separate name in the 'img' tag for onmouseover.
Whilst one can see the reason for being able to name each object this does
lead to confusion, and will make it hard to maintain code.

I've constructed a drag and drop via tabkey (and arrow keys), or mouse page,

Please accept my apologies if this seems a minor issue, it has caused me
considerable trouble.
