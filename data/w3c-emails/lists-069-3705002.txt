[Blind copied to CG for coordination.]

May I suggest the following process for this issue.

Would the GL Chairs please test for the sense of the meeting in GL, and report
to PF (or CG) the sense of the meeting in GL, on the question "would GL
like to
have a bacward-compatible means of introducing stronger definitions of 'class'
tokens, symmetric equivalences between text and pictures, and the like, if it
can be arranged?"

In the mean time, and as available subject to the advice of GL on the
desirability, I would suggest that PF take the action to work with HTML WG on
what sorts of information structures can be accepted as a friendly amendment
and what constitutes a change requiring the full Recommendation process.? For
example, it could be that clarifying the specification-conforming use of the
'profile' attribute in an erratum, could enable its broader use.? Can we have
'profile' link to a RDDL document that leads one on to informative assertions
in RDF?? Or is this a violation of the specification that requires a new
release to enable?? I believe that the HTML WG should be the next to take a
position on this, and PF should be the ones to represent WAI in that dialog.
