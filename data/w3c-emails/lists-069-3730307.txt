However, both Mozilla and IE have implemented it firing with a keyboard
enter on the focused element, Opera 5 doesn't, it should be encouraged
to, as you say a big bug, there's no DOM2 way of detecting a navigate on
a click for example - other than specifically intercepting keyboard and
click links. I've not looked at other browsers, but I believe Konquerer
is the only other relevant browser to implement much in DOM2 and ISTR
that does, but don't have it to hand to check.

OnActivate is also, where implemented, not implemented as a substitute
for onfocus in any case.
