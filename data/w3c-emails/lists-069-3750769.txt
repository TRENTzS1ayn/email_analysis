AG:: not surprising.  I never read the script.

What I liked about this example is the fact that the information that is
presented in the flyout submenus that depend on running the scripts is still
available in the destination pages if you turn scripting off and just follow
hyperlinks.

That is the characteristic of this page that I found meritorious.  If there is
a better way to script it, do let's find an example of it done the better way.
