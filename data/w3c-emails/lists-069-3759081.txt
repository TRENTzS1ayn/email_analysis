I was presenting UAAG and WCAG in a talk, and I realized that the borders are 
getting very fuzzy to me. In particular, some of the WCAG guidelines feel like 
they are really UAAG guidelines (which may just mean I don't understand the 
implications of the guidelines for content).

For instance, providing text search as a navigation technique seems like it is
a UA issue, not a content issue. We don't really expect the content to provide 
the search function, do we? It does need to present text that is searchable.

And can the guidelines addressing change in context (checkpoint 2.3 and 2.4) 
be addressed by content, or can they only be addressed at the UA level? Does 
the content let the user configure how long they have for a timed response? 
Can the content handle input errors like misspellings?

Perhaps the border is getting fuzzy to me because scripting really changes the 
nature of content. Are our guidelines starting to require scripting, at the 
same time that we are wrestling with how to make it accessible? Or perhaps 
these only become issues when someone is using scripting?
