Thursday, 20 September, 20:00 UTC, 4 PM US Eastern etc., on the
W3C/MIT Longfellow bridge (+1-617-252-1038):

The purpose of the teleconference is to discuss the list of
"consensus" and "consensus-candidate" propositions which have emerged
from the face to face meeting. Gregg plans to post a revised list
before Thursday. If there are any objections to the items marked as
representing groups consensus, please raise them at the meeting, or on
the mailing list beforehand.

We also plan to discuss the upcoming face to face meeting in Australia
to confirm attendance and discuss relevant logistics.
