IMG shouldn't have a name attribute IMO, the decision of the W3 to
include it, pretty much destroyed a lot of respect I had for the
organisations ability to deliver rational recommendations in the HTML/DOM
area. It was added (in 4.01) purely to make existing scripts validate and
work in Netscape 4 - there is no other reason, and purely introduces
complexity and confusion of the nature you're having.

There's no reason to use name, ID is a much more appropriate attribute to
use, but that doesn't directly solve your problem.  an A, and it's child
elements must be distinguishable.   Your endeavouring to provide the same
result after a keyboard focus and a mouseover, I can understand why you
see this as valuable, but it's not necessarily the only option - and
attempting to solve your problem in the user agent is not warranted, you
say the firstChild solution is a "touch of the lamp" but it's safe.

These aren't DOM recommendations in any case are they?  In any case focus
doesn't bubble, rightly so, since whilst you can mouseover more than one
element, only one element can have focus at any one time.
