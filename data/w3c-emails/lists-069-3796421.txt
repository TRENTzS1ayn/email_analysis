I certainly don't know of any that are both good examples of scripting
and accessible, if however what an accessible menu might look like could
be communicated to me, I'd gladly script one up to act as an example -
The main problems are how the fallback works in situations where
CSS/script is not available on the page with the menu.  Not the where
just script is missing.
