Well, the following fuzzy idea may take XML as opposed to HTML to do directly,
perhaps.

But the general approach that I have been keen to see someone play with is
roughly as follows:

- the menu contents is all in the XML source and the script permutes the
visibility and or placement -

The general idea is that the stuff should be there so that you can get to it
pursuant to UAAG 2.3 and not only under 1.2.

That may be idealized a bit, but where the contents of the menu has an HTML
equivalent, it doesn't seem that much to ask.

SVG might provide a better data model for the bacdrop (content matrix) in this
exercise than HTML.

Please note that it is not really a requirement that the theme+variations
dynamic structure of the page with flyout submenus be re-created for voice-out
access.  Fewer stops in the 'expansion' sequence are OK, populated with static
hypertext.  This is not a bad design.  Compare with the DAISY talking book.

For browsing in speech, folding and unfolding individual branches of a tree is
not that good an idea; probably better to have a table of contents with one
global depth parameter and then browse the top n tiers of the contents tree. 
Talking book just has one table of navigation with whatever depth is in the
book ToC and the fully expanded contents modulo notes sidebars and a few
oddball conditional content classes like that.  But those things are always
navigable and their level of inclusion in the reading stream is modable.
