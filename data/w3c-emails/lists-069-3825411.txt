  Thursday, 20 September, 20:00 UTC, 4 PM US Eastern etc., on the
  W3C/MIT Longfellow bridge (+1-617-252-1038):

  The purpose of the teleconference is to discuss the list of
  "consensus" and "consensus-candidate" propositions which have emerged
  from the face to face meeting. Gregg plans to post a revised list
  before Thursday. If there are any objections to the items marked as
  representing groups consensus, please raise them at the meeting, or on
  the mailing list beforehand.

  We also plan to discuss the upcoming face to face meeting in Australia
  to confirm attendance and discuss relevant logistics.
