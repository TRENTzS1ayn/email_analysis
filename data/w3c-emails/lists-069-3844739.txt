As reported earlier, at the Face to Face meeting last week we tried to
work on a number of big issues to decide where we had consensus and
where not.

We referred to the list of issues as the "Elephants".   We were only
able to discuss some of them.

I will be sending 3 emails right after this one.

The first will have the current Elephants or  BIG ISSUES.
The Second will have those items we reached consensus on.
The Third will have those items we did not reach consensus on at the
meeting.

Please look over all 3 and provide comments as noted.
