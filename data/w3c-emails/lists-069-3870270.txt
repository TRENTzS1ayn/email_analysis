CANDIDATE CONSENSUS STATEMENTS
ITEMS THAT WERE MENTIONED BUT GROUP HAS NOT CONSENSED ON.

THESE ARE POSTED HERE FOR DISCUSSION AND POSSIBLE EDIT OR ADOPTION OR
DISMISSAL

- things that are not normative should be in a separate doc. (or at
least not listed as guidelines)

- things that are not normative should be kept in the same doc.
(not remove from guidelines,  keep it prominent,  but make
separate/clear/??? that it is different.)

- that our guidelines should not be limited to only that information
that could or should be required today.   They should talk as well about
what would make web content more accessible where and when it is
possible - even if it is not possible everywhere today.    But it should
be clear what things are which (what is possible and reasonable today
for general application vs what may be possible in the future or
applicable only on some sites).

THREE ALTERNATIVES DISCUSSED.
  -  conformance levels should be based on user needs only (and not ease
of implementation or ease of measurement/testing)
  -  conformance levels should take user factors and testability into
account.
  -  conformance levels should take user factors and testability and
ease into account.  (at least on a gross scale).

  -   conformance should be linear



================================
THE FOLLOWING ARE THINGS WHERE THE GROUP THERE WAS NO AGREEMENT.  THERE
WERE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES.

1)  No decision on whether priority should be determined by ease of
implementation

2)   there was also no agreement on how to separate information that is
more important from that which is less important.
