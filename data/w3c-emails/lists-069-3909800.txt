Sorry, but did you try navigating using the keyboard only, with javascript
enabled?
in mozilla~0.9.3 and ie6 tabbing takes focus to the main 4 links but I
cannot seem to make the drop down open, or indeed navigate via the keyboard.
I do hate being expansive, as something that I've said is bound to
be'wrong'.
