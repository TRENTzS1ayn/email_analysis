AvantGo, and PocketIE which are currently palm sized devices and I think
are likely a better example of currently used and future mobile devices
than the failure that is WAP, both have reasonable scripting support,
although only really in the area of forms, and core script, other DOM
methods are generally unavailable especially in AvantGo.

I am absolutely horrified by the notion of requiring scripts, we have CERT
advisory's stating scripting should be disabled, we have a level of
scripting ability amongst developers that is pathetic, most can hardly
make scripts that work, let alone scripts that work and are accessible.
There's little that scripts give that make otherwise inaccessible content
accessible (are there some examples or even just ideas?)

I've now read and participated in most usenet and other community
javascript groups for 3 years or more, I've got a lot of scripting
knowledge and an interest in good scripting, what I see is little thought
of accessibility (even when the interest is there, appreciating how your
script may effect others isn't easy.)  I also have to be honest and don't
believe from reading the previous minutes etc. that the group currently
has the knowledge of scripting to provide example and techniques in the
script arena that would be required to even explain how scripting could be
used accessibly let alone how it can be used to make inaccessible content
accessible.

I'm extremely pro-scripting, but it cannot and should not be relied on in
webpages.

Regards,

Jim.
