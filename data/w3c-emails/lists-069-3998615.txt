William,

         It always amuses me to read about "separating" content, structure 
and presentation .... when what we want is content that can be presented 
according to user needs, and structure which can be flexible to user needs. 
If the author provides the flexibility in presentation and structure, it is 
immaterial whether or not they are separated ....

         Incidentally, my precocious student was in the lab today, and had 
already looked up Duke Ellington on the web since I told him that was who 
was in the top hat on the web site... I sat him next to me, and pulled up 
the site and let it download while he was working on a game (that was not 
challenging to him) ... and he listened to all the spots - his favorite was 
the wa-wa trumpets .... but he also listened carefully to Mercer's piece 
.... studied the pictures, and commented on the guy in the upper right 
corner (not online now so don't have the name), and why he looked so "ugly" 
... I told him that when he got old, he would look just like that (this is 
a freckle-faced boy with sandy hair who can ignore the obvious difference) 
.... and he said, but he really needs a shave .... Thanks for sharing that 
site !!!

                                                 Anne
