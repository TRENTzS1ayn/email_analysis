Gregg,

         Here is your original list with the concensus/no concensus 
markings ....

         There are 15 issues. Two are clearly CONCENSUS. (8 & 9)  Two are 
partly CONCENSUS. ( 7,13) One was discussed with NO CONCENSUS (6) . Ten 
issues remain in their original state.

         I'm a bit unclear on the meaning of the acronym URI ... I 
originally assumed it meant URL, but have seen it used such that it 
suggests it may be the web site rather than the specific page address that 
can contain any equivalent versions ... This was under Elephant #11 ... and 
if it means that a URI is a web site (an address and it's subdirectories, 
etal) it will neatly suit meeting the needs of all disabled persons without 
having to draw a line anywhere ....

                                                         Anne

No concensus

Concensus on some, non concensus on others, no mention of needing normative.

Concensus (on should test, but not on how to test)
