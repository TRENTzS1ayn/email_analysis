Gregg,

         I see problems with this .... if it is applied to the inclusion of 
illustrations, it would be easy to fulfill by adding graphics, but 
determining the illustrative value of the chose graphics may not be 
objective. Likewise ... an alt tag may be determined as a string of text in 
the right box, but determining the equivalency of the alt tag will not be 
objective ...

         Seems some guidelines/checkpoints could have both normative and 
non-normative attributes and techniques ...
