I believe that the idea is that "providing the flexibility" is another way 
of stating what is meant by "separating" them. The problem in older HTML 
versions is that there are elements that don't permit ascertaining the 
semantics of the presentational content.

If items on sale are indicated only by their color/font then the 
information that they are on sale is unavailable to someone who can't 
determine that there's different visual presentation.

As to needing a shave, perhaps your precocious student could see the 
picture of me on the "Peter" site? Of course Santa doesn't shave! (I get a 
lot of Santa Claus takes from little kids in supermarket lines).
