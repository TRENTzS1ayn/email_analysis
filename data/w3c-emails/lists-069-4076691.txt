William,
         Briggs saws the Peter and the Wolf site last week and didn't 
comment on your picture. Your beard is neatly trimmed, whereas I think he 
was seeing a heavy "five o'clock shadow" on the other picture.

         I understand the example on separation, but I don't think that 
asking for "separation" will tell the web author what we want them to do. 
What we want them to do is consider presentation as more than visual, to 
provide the presentation features so that they can be repurposed if used in 
a sound only presentation. What are the ways in which this can be done? 
Yes, style sheets that can put the sale prices in a special class that 
displays them in a certain color or font, but what does that add to the 
non-visual presentation? I think it can allow a speech reader to identify 
the classes as they occur in the reading? How else can this be achieved 
without style sheets? Perhaps adding a graphic (a bubble that says "sale" 
and is alt tagged as "sale") ...  If this is a valid solution, I don't know 
that telling someone to "separate" presentation from content will lead to 
such a conclusion/action.

                                                         Anne
