Also, we tend to think of "normative" and "informative" as opposite sides 
of a coin. In everyday usage whatever we put in there (including whatever 
we choose to label "normative") is "informative".

A really big problem is that "normative" is a VERY HEAVY "what's that mean" 
word in most vocabularies - even among those who do this stuff for a 
living. If what it connotes can't be readily communicated, watch out!

One little problem with the concept is that "normative" acquires the sort 
of status that chiseled stone has: even if there's only little errors of 
punctuation/spelling/grammar, the ability to change them is fettered by 
process.
