In part it means that the author's employer makes appearance demands that 
MUST be satisfied and sometimes these interfere with the user's NEEDS. How 
things "look" (a retinal conceit) often transcends their accessibility in 
the market place.

Same with clarity/simplicity - author's peers are put off by use of 
less-than-lofty phraseology.
