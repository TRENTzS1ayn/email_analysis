Though one can model it quite easily in RDF:-

   @prefix log: <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/log#> .
   [ log:uri [ log:startsWith http://example.org/ ] ] .

Not all that helpful in this context, perhaps...

URL is becoming more and more of a deprecated term within the development
community, and hopefully that will speard over into the "non-geek" world,
although don't bet on it.

For those still wondering what URIs and URLs are... Dan Connolly recently
wrote a good piece on URIs, URI References, and all of the terminology:-

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Sep/0273
   - URI terminology demystified

and there's more at the W3C's addressing site:-

Hope that helps,
