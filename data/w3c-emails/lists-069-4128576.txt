Al and Sean,

         Thanks muchly for the help.

         May I suggest that URI be used sparingly if at all in the 
guidelines, or perhaps used as "URI/URL" so that the non-geeks will 
understand what is being said. The audience for the guidelines includes the 
development community, but goes way past it.... to the non-geek development 
community <grin> ...

         I would also like to see other common word usages incorporated in 
an effort to simplify the language to reach a wider audience than the 
"geek" web development community. In the non-geek web savvy world, it's a 
URL .... it the non-geek web savvy world, it is a web page, not a document 
.... and in the non-geek web savvy world, the opening page of a site (or 
root URL) is the Home Page .... I'd favor use of the non-geek words as much 
as possible with links to the geek-world words in a glossary....

                                         Anne
