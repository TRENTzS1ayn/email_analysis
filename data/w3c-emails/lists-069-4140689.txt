When I first 'met' you on Usenet, Jim, I had pretty-much given up ever
seeing useful scripting on web pages.  However, you have shown me a
range of really worthwhile script-based techniques that can be applied
at the _client_ side irrespective of the page-authors' intentions ;-)
that can help with accessing the (variously misguided) authors'
content.

By and large I'm afraid I have to agree with that verdict (after all,
if most of the page-provided scripts are notable only for their
nuisance value, and a not-insignificant small fraction are for
exploiting security holes, is it any wonder that users disable
scripting or filter it out?); but you've shown a number of useful
techniques which the client can apply, and it seems to me this has
considerable prospects for further development and exploitation.

all the best
