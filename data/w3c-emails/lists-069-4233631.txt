This, and the problem of loss of core functionality in
the windows environment when using accesskey in IE 5, are examples of the
same problem. - implementation bugs in the users agent/system .

I think we have to differentiate between :

a, backwards compatibility (e.g. some systems have not implemented CSS
(style sheets) - so make it useable with out) and,
 b,   miss-implementation - were a platform or system or software implements
something incorrectly and against its specification.

I vote that the former is something that is quantifiable and therefore
something that we can deal with.
But, to attempt to know, document and address each miss-implementation  of
specifications -  well, how long is a piece of string? - unless we only
address implementation quirks among market leaders (read that last bit a a
horrified voice).
