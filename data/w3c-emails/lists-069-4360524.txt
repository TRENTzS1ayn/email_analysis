Jonathan, it's customary on this list to wrap a little commentary that's
relevant to WCAG around flames and sniping. They generally don't hold up on
their own. Hope this helps.

Now, everyone, can we _please_ go back to discussing the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines for which this working group is chartered, and skip
the snotty one-liners, or at least stop cross-posting them from IG? It's
counterproductive and unprofessional.
