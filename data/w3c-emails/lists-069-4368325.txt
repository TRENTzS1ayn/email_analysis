This is a cool rant sent to www-validator, specifying why it is good to
validate markup. Perhaps GL can coordinate with the author and incorporate
some of the text into WCAG 2.0, or at least make sure that all of the
rationale and principles behind the article are expressed therein?

> Well, firstly there is the very practical issue that non-valid
> pages are (by definition) relying on error-correction by a
> browser.  This error correction can and does vary radically
> across different browsers and versions, so that many authors
> who unwittingly relied on the quirks of Netscape 1.1 suddenly
> found their pages appeared totally blank in Netscape 2.0.
> Whilst Internet Explorer initially set out to be bug-compatible
> with Netscape, it too has moved towards standards compliance in
> later releases.  Other browsers of course differ further.

> There are also three specific questions we should deal with here:
>
> (1) The novice (or non-technical website owner) question:
>     "my site looks right and works fine - isn't that enough?"
>
> The answer to this one is that markup languages are no more than
> data formats.  So a website doesn't look like anything at all!
> It only takes on a visual appearance when it is presented by
> your browser.
>
> In practice, different browsers can and do display the same page
> very differently.  This is deliberate, and doesn't imply any kind
> of browser bug.  A term sometimes used for this is WYSINWOG -
> What You See Is Not What Others Get (unless by coincidence).
> It is indeed one of the principal strengths of the web, that

> trouble and expense of preparing a separate edition.

> It is perhaps unfortunate that the best-known browsers - Netscape

luxury?
