I disagree on both these points, and I think the developers of languages
like MathML are with me. One goal of the W3C is to oversee the construction
of the Semantic Web. It's not in anyone's best interest for this group to
say they really shouldn't do that because it's all been done before.

Those are usability enhancements to me.

MM
Not to me. It's a fault of the language if it's not designed to work with
assistive technologies. For its part, JavaScript (1.0) was barely designed
at all.

I'd be very careful using the word "incompetent" with respect to authors.
The vast majority of web developers may be seen as incompetent with HTML 4,
much less script. This can also be a fault of the languages providing
ill-advised features which become standard but commonly hinder accessibility
(tables, frames, document.images, window.status).

MM
What JavaScript does is pretty basic compared to what CC/PP will do. This is
what I meant by rudimentary.

MM
To most people, it is.
