Personally, yes, I would like to investigate the proposed options: using 
div to group related items, using rel on a, and using the label/labelfor as 
with form controls.  This would be very useful for associating text with 
images as well as associating a text transcript with a link to an audio 
clip or movie.

We can put this on our issues list - I suggest this is just an HTML issue 
and thus goes on the HTML Techniques/technology-specific checkpoints issue 
list.  Thus, why I have included [HTML Techs] in the subject.

How quickly do you need a response from us?  It is my understanding that 
your question is:  does the WCAG WG support the case that HTML attributes 
and elements could be redefined to support associating images with text, 
alternatives with media, etc.

Is this also related to using classes to provide semantics?  If so, the 
working group does not consider this needed.  Refer to our current open 
issue that we are waiting from confirmation from William (who originally 
raised it):  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wcag20-issues.html#4

In our last discussion of the issue, we felt that the scenarios that were 
being used to make the case fell under the requirement to use style sheets 
with HTML in a way that when style sheets fail, are not supported or turn 
off that the content is still readable.  For example, a sidebar should fall 
into the flow of the content (likely at the beginning or the end).

The only other place where we've discussed semantics of classes was with 
identifying navigation bars, but we got support in HTML to use the map 
element for this.

Thanks,
