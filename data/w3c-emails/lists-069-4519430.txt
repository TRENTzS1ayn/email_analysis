ok. fine.

no, i was not suggesting a server should accept whatever it is sent.

I did. Security and user experience. Both of which do not create 
accessibility issues - if done correctly.

Yes, these are UA issues.  However, the examples I gave were used as 
stop-gap measures <em>before</em> UAs did these type of things.

No, the page was authored with appropriate standards.  It was using data in 
a data table.  To more easily read the data, the user was able to read by 
row or column - since these are the appropriate groupings of data.  This is 
how tables are read - comparing data between cells.

Please keep in mind that this was created <em>before</em> user agents or 
assistive technologies provided this functionality.  Let me emphasize my 
point: I used this example to show that client-side scripts had been used 
to help make content more accessible due to inadequacies in the UA/AT. It 
was not to show that client-side scripting should be done <em>instead</em> 
of UA/AT support.

Then, as I alluded in my previous message, I misunderstood your intent.

OK. I understand now.  I agree.  Sorry for the confusion.

cool. I look forward to that.

Now...how did we get onto this tangent from gregg's original message?
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2001JulSep/1048.html

Scenario A: until user agents - blech.
Scenario B: yes, technology-specific implementation info should be at the 
technology level.
Scenario C: no, technology-specific support info should not be incorporated 
in the Guideline level of the doc.

In regards to the first two not being normative and therefore not making it 
to the developer.  I disagree. I thought we had agreed (as recently as 2 
weeks ago) that technology-specific checkpoints were to be 
normative?  Giving us 2 layers of normative info??

This is where Al's suggestion to scrap Guidelines and preserve and expand 
upon success criteria comes in.
