Yes, this is an issue in WCAG 1.0 which is why in WCAG 2.0 we very 
carefully say, "Checkpoint 4.4 Ensure that content remains usable when 
technologies that modify default user agent processing or behavior are 
turned off or not supported. "  This is also why in my explanation I only 
called out HTML since it does have a default rendering.

Issuing an erratum for 1.0 is a good idea.  Do you agree it can be based on 
the work we've done in 2.0?
