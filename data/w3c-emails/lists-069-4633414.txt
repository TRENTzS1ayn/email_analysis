Whether Sean is objecting to that idea or not, I am. Many people don't 
think of what they get from the browser as being decreed by an 
often-unassailable "pseudo style-sheet" that the browser uses as a default. 
I believe that this rendering is arbitrarily left to the tender mercies of 
messrs. IE, NS, and Opera et al so that when WCAG comes out it must not 
assume some base default rendition has been a part of the HTML spec all 
along but merely another pit on the road to accessibility. Their "default 
style sheet" might not even be in the "cascade" for all we know?
