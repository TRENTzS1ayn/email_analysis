Really? PF seem to have agreed on the former question enough to have
published it in XML GL:-

[[[
3.1 Provide default style sheets for multiple output modalities where
possible.
]]] - http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-xmlgl-20010829

We didn't tend to put things in XML GL that we didn't have at least a rough
consensus on (even with the "no endorement..." clause), and I don't recall
anyone causing a fuss about this particular checkpoint. If there had have
been a fuss, we should have delayed publication.

The latter question would also appear to be a bit of a no-brainer. In any
case, these are important questions and should they not have been answered,
then I think that it more than befits GL to give the groups a little/big
prod into action.

I think that one of the more important and relevant questions in this case
is actually, "how much is a default presentation a standard presentation?",
and that's something that is pertinent to the F2F agenda. And of course,
pre-reading and pre-dicussion (collectively: "preparation") is normally
nothing but useful.

Cheers,
