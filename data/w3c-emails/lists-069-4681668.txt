Web page authors have a responsibility to provide script information in a
fashion that can be read by assistive technology. When authors do not put
functional text with a script, a screen reader will often read the content
of the script itself in a meaningless jumble of numbers and letters.
Although this jumble is text, it cannot be interpreted or used.

Is this correct?
-    Do screen readers often read the script itself?
-    Does this relate to the absence of functional text?
personally i feel this may have been thrown together in a rush.

Access Board's info:

It doesn't say this. Section K (which is not in the contents), and makes no
reference to javascript or scripting states:
 A text-only page, with equivalent information or functionality, shall be
provided to make a web site comply with the provisions of these standards,
when compliance cannot be accomplished in any other way. The content of the
text-only page shall be updated whenever the primary page changes.

This (again) seems to be hasty, possibly  a reference to, or attempt to
include the <no script> attribute/tag.
 I'm not at all convinced this meets what seems to be the popular wai
'universal' idea.

Is it a reasonable request?
I think it is possibly a misguided one.
