Thanks for the clarification.

I interpret a "default stylesheet" as nothing more than a slightly
loaded way of describing the browser's default rendering.  For a
CSS-supporting browser, that could indeed be a tangible CSS
stylesheet, while for a non-CSS-supporting browser it was merely an
abstract concept inherent in the browser's presentation design (in
most cases adjustable by some browser-specific preferences dialog).

(And, by the way, stylesheets for HTML don't _have_ to be in CSS.)

Certainly a desirable property, except in the most rudimentary browser
implementations.

Are you really advocating that a browser which has not been given an
external stylesheet should refuse to present the HTML content in any
way at all?  I'm confused.

I have this awful feeling that we're talking entirely at cross
purposes.  The whole point of decoupling the stylesheet mechanism from
the logical markup (as presaged by the HTML2.0 specification) was to
enable different stylesheets to be applied for different presentation
situations and needs.  After all these years, that is finally coming
to fruition,

Sorry, I'm trying hard to understand you, but I'm still baffled as to
what this "myth" might be.

Are you by some mischance basing this on the assumption that there
would be one single ideal "default" presentation - irrespective of
browser or browsing situation?  Dreadful thought.

I'd be glad to discuss "it" if I only knew what "it" was. I'm afraid
it's only too obvious that there's something here that I'm still not
grasping.  Sorry.

all the best
