Of course! Built in stylesheets rarely. But external ones tend to be CSS;
XSLT isn't often supported...

Don't be. HTML is now very established, and I certainly don't advocate that
statement now... but I would have done if the Web were just starting up. At
any rate, that is the situation for XML (some browsers show the parse tree,
some just render the text as if it were all inline, some just render
nothing), so that's good. People have obviously gotten so used to the built
in styles... but it didn't have to be that way. And it doesn't have to be
that way for XML; it won't be that way for XML.

Yes, but I don't see how that is relavent to our discussion.

Blimey, I know that my writing style is at best awful, but I'm suprised
that anyone could jump to that conclusion :-) I'm saying that XML language
authors should come up with a default stylesheet hint, UAs may or may not
implement this, but certainly shouldn't be expected to, and that authors
can apply any style that they want to their instances. The "author
proposes, user disposes" axiom still stands.

I agree.

Well, I'm saying a few things, one of which is that default presentations
*expected* in all UAs is not good Web architecture. XML and CSS were
designed to try to solve these problems, and now we can use them. But the
danger is that the problems associated with HTML will carry on over to XML,
and that people will expect things like default stylesheets in the UA for
XHTML 2.0. The benefit of XML and CSS is that you don't need default
stylesheets built into the UA. You just use an XML and CSS compliant
browser, and get the author to piece it together.
