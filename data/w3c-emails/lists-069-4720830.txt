Thursday, 27 September at 20:00 UTC (4 PM US Eastern, 10 PM France, 6
AM Eastern Australia) on the W3C/MIT Longfellow bridge:
+1-617-252-1038:

The purpose of the meeting is to consider and, if appropriate, confirm
the consensus items which emerged from last week and the face to face
meeting, and to discuss more of the "big issues" (listed below) which
were not examined at last week's meeting.

These issues are:

6. Implementation
(Should difficulty in implementation affect priority.)

9. Access for absolutely all?    - If not, how to draw line
(one suggestion was  "BEST EFFORT")

10. Guidelines for all sites vs. special sites

12. Accessibility vs. usability

13. Conformance - why do it? How to test?

14. Author and user needs conflict

15. User and user needs conflict
