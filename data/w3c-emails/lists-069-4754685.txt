XML, of itself, is a language for defining markup languages.  It
doesn't inherently have any presentation, so I agree with your
conclusions.

But once you have used your mata-language (SGML or XML as the case may
be) to define a markup language, then that language has semantics in
terms of real content.  The semantics of HTML are publicly defined, so
anyone would be free to devise one or more styles for presenting that
markup.

It can't be that way for XML, at least for the reason I just

Excuse me, I wasn't attributing that mistaken belief to you - I was
trying to draw you out on whether you were trying to attack that
mistaken belief, in order to better understand what you were saying.

Indeed.  There already exist such stylesheets for HTML.

But now you are talking about the authors of the markup language,
rather than the authors of document instances, no?

And the reader can choose to use them, or not, or apply their own, as
they need (or merely "as they please").

Indeed.

On the one hand, if you have used XML to define a new markup that
doesn't have generally-known semantics, then the UA clearly is unable
to offer any useful default presentation in end-user terms.

But if, on the other hand, you are using some (incidentally XML-based)
markup that _does_ have generally-known semantics (let's assume that
others will become popular aside from HTML), then I'm still a bit
confused why you seem to be intending to deny the UA designer the
option to offer some default presentation of those known semantics.

Anyhow, thanks for the clarification.

All the best.
