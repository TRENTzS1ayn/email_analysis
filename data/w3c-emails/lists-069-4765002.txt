Well, my first bet is that at this stage not a lot of people will want to
include this.

But that doesn't mean we should not explore the topic further - I think there
are fairly good justifications for investigating it.

Since I have no idea how to write a guidelines or checkpoint for such a
thing, I am hoping that someone will come up with at least a first
example to start discussion...

On the other hand, I do suspect that this would be another case where culture
and language make a difference. There are many languages where the customs
about the 'tone' used are much more important in general than they are in
English - French, Spanish, Italian, German and Japanese are examples that
spring to my mind (which means that the five languages I speak enough of to
know if it is important are languages where it is much more important than
in english).

  For what my view is worth, tone like emotion is central to accessibility.
