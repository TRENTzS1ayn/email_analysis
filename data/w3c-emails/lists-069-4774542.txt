Why is it not a viable approach?  What is the specific reasons that makes
it non-viable, the ability the site developers is pretty much all I can
come up with.

Of course we should, I've never said otherwise.

How can these sites insist that, there's no requirement for UA's to
support javascript, and there's no requirement to implement the relevant
parts of the Object Model.   Javascript is an excellent tool for adding
usability and accessibility enhancements,  of course if you could come up
with an example I'd have to withdraw all my remarks, but I've yet to see
one.
