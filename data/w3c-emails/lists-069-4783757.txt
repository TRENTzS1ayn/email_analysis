Hmmm.

I went over it twice, and I am not sure exactly what it means. Basically it
is not clear if it is assumed that assistive technologies can read scripts.

If a script processor is considered an application on the client side (and
that is how I understand it) then most of them would fail the requirement
1194.22(m), which applies "when an application, plug-in or applet is required
on teh client side". In particular, most javascript processors I know of fail
1194.21(a), 1194.21(b), and 1194.21(d).

However, since this is primarily a legal requirement and not a technical one,
I would suggest that the answer should be provided by lawyers and not us.
Alternatively we could ask the access board what their intention was in
framing this requirement - what is there in the documents doesn't seem
decisive one way or another, so makes for poor input in determining this
question for ourselves.

We should also ask them why they chose one way or another...

I plan to answer Jonathan's pertinent technical question in a seperate thread

cheers

Charles

  Web page authors have a responsibility to provide script information in a
  fashion that can be read by assistive technology. When authors do not put
  functional text with a script, a screen reader will often read the content
  of the script itself in a meaningless jumble of numbers and letters.
  Although this jumble is text, it cannot be interpreted or used.

  Is this correct?
  -    Do screen readers often read the script itself?
  -    Does this relate to the absence of functional text?
  personally i feel this may have been thrown together in a rush.
