Thanks Chaarls,
Really it is worth considering for the quicktips, or something similar that
is purely qualitative.

Proposed guideline:
Please consider the spirit or tone that would introduce your content to best
effect?
An inappropriate tone could alienate your audience.
People from different have very different expectations.

when I get a moment, I'll try to dream up a few more tones.
In the meantime any suggestions welcome.
I'd expect a decent collection to help us expand this rather minimalist
guideline.
so far:
dissonant from DP
confrontational
authoritarian
entertaining
educational:
academic
childish (talking down)
commercial(heavy sales)
inappropriate (content, humour...)
technical(jargon laden)
