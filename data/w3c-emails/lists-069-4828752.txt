Yes, I think that in terms of qualitative things like the quicktips it is
easy to make a statement. I am wondering if we can get a bit more precise
(ever trying to get "more specific" <grin/>). I think that we could probably
give more useful advice still, and we could in particular find information
about how to assess what the tone of something is, and how to change it.

I am not sure how critical this is to accessibility - I know that it does
make a difference in some cases, but whether it is the sort of thing that we
have called a priority 1 requirement - a total block for people - or whether
it is somewhere closer to priority 3 - it is helpful to people is something I
think we need to think about more as we go along.

This is going to be particularly challenging in the area of WCAG. But
interesting and worthwile nonetheless. I look forward to more thinking on
this.

I think this might be one of the things that helps us understand what we can
do and think about with regards to email. I wonder where it will lead us...

cheers

Charles

  Thanks Chaarls,
  Really it is worth considering for the quicktips, or something similar that
  is purely qualitative.

  Proposed guideline:
  Please consider the spirit or tone that would introduce your content to best
  effect?
  An inappropriate tone could alienate your audience.
  People from different have very different expectations.

  when I get a moment, I'll try to dream up a few more tones.
  In the meantime any suggestions welcome.
  I'd expect a decent collection to help us expand this rather minimalist
  guideline.
  so far:
  dissonant from DP
  confrontational
  authoritarian
  entertaining
  educational:
  academic
  childish (talking down)
  commercial(heavy sales)
  inappropriate (content, humour...)
  technical(jargon laden)
