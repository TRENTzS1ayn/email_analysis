Chaals,

         With very little to go on other than my experiences, I would 
suggest that tone could be an important consideration with emotionally 
disabled folks, with autistic folks, and with folks who have or have had 
communication disorders (I am thinking of the difficulties with a teenager 
who was given a computer for an artificial voice and hooked into email at 
the same time. Ten years later, he still has difficulties with tone leading 
to frustrations, but they are much diminished from when he was first 
introduced to the world of communication.)

         Yes, e-mail has significant problems due to the inability(or 
failure to use what exists) to express tone, and it's awfully apparent in 
the aftermath of September 11th.  Smiley faces were once a commonly-used 
indication in e-mail that you weren't to be taken too seriously, but they 
fell into disuse. Some mailers provide icons, or emoticons, and then there 
are the chili-pepper flags that I found to be conductive of arguments. 
(folks who used them sent their first draft under the flag instead of 
cooling off and replying carefully - my personal observation 
<grin>)  [Incidently, I use the term <grin> instead of a smiley face 
because I have too several correspondents who use speech readers so to keep 
from checking the "to", I use the word instead of :-) ] .... and when I am 
writing in "stream of consciousness" .... I use four dots instead of commas 
and periods ... these are my conventions, and my correspondents have not 
adopted them from me, so they aren't terribly universal ...

         The concept of tone may be a checkpoint of its own, or it could be 
a detailed recommendation under 3.3 on writing clearly and simply ... I do 
not think tone can be tested, certainly not as "scientifically" as 
readability.  It's OK to "talk down" to young children, but it's very 
inappropriate to do so with adults who have cognitive abilities measured in 
children's ages/etc.

                                                 Anne
