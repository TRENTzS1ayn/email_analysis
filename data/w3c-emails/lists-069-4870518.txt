Chas,

         Just a thought .... but suppose we built the site for 
accessibility/usability .... maybe using Williams recent thoughts ... 
something that changes dynamically to respond to newly-known needs .... and 
changes again as various user agents and authoring tools make such concerns 
past tense ....

         And built the "carved in stone" guidelines from the dynamic 
response to needs.

                                                 Anne
