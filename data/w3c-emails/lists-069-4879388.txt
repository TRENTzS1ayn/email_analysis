I considered it such a "given", that it didn't need mentioning,  I still
see no reason why it should be required.

Which is an example of some poor scripting techniques (Browser detection
being the most obvious, have you looked what happens in Opera or Konquerer
for example?)

A stylesheet added to the two lines which say:
OutString += '<html>';
so that they say <
OutString +='<html><link href="style.css" type="text/css"
rel="StyleSheet">'

then you just have the style.css which says something like
body { font-size:14pt;}
Of course not using fixed sized fonts but setting up your Mum's software
so it uses large fonts would make more sense, a user stylesheet here would
make most sense.

Most of the problem is with the authoring, not least due to the way the
developments have gone, most of the assistive technology problems can be
overcome, (especially as they tend to be on IE, so as a last resort we can
just modify IE itself to cope better with the script.)  Because though
that there have been such huge changes between versions the same "page" or
code doesn't work with all the browsers so users are either forced to
decide to use inaccessible means to achieve user agent support or do only
support a subset of browsers.
