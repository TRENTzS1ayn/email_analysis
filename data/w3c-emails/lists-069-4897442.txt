It should be encouraged as often as it is built correctly, or when it makes 
otherwise useless mess useful.

Whatever needs to be done to encourage people to do it correctly should be 
employed ....

Is that why it's Freeware? What can I do to make it usable? No, I don't 
have Opera and never heard on Konquerer ... this will run on my sister's 
computer, either the laptop in Mom's room, or the desktop at Terry's home, 
depending on what works best and the weather in Wisconsin ...

As it is, the script makes stuff that is fairly useless to K-2 education, 
though it could be with better control of font and size in both display and 
input ...

Can I do it without stylesheets. Terri will be using her work laptop to 
take to the home if weather doesn't let her take Mom to her home. What 
software would Terri need to use stylesheet with IE? This is a web 
application that has absolutely no universal appeal .... I make it in 
Virginia, for Terri to take to Mom in Wisconsin ... with four other sisters 
watching how it works out ...

But, if I use this software with my students, I may want to do it with 
style sheets, even if I have to set up stylesheets for K-2 on 20 computers 
one by one ... so I'll save the code til I start doing real educational 
stuff with it ....
