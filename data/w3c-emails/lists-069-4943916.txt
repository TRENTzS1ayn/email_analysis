If there is not a specific proposal to change the guidelines, then this 
thread is not productive and should stop.  If you would like to discuss a 
concrete proposal for a change to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 
2.0, please make a proposal.  Otherwise, please take this discussion off of 
the list.
Thank you,
