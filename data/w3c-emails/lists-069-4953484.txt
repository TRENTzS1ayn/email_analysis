The proposed guideline:
>Please consider the spirit or tone that would introduce your content to
best effect?
>An inappropriate tone could alienate your audience. People in different
cultures have very different expectations.

So far we have:
Jonathan, Anne, David P and CharlesMcN have expressed opinions inclined
towards something like the proposal, and recognise that it represents a
change.
CharlesFM considers it a good recommendation, but perhaps unattainable in a
set of 'normative' guidelines.
Wendy and Judy appear to be querying whether the proposal is in earnest.

I don't have any record of other opinions.
What reason can there be for calling a halt to what is a very positive and
helpful guideline?

I'd be grateful for a further development of this proposal.
It may well need examples, or expansion.
