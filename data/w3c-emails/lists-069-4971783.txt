I find myself very uncomfortable with this guideline. In general, the further 
we go in the direction of advising authors about what to say and how to say 
it, the less confidence I have that we can be effective.

Unless we can provide authors concrete advice about how they can recognize 
what sorts of things will *inadvertantly* alienate the audience, or what the 
different cultural expectations are that they need to accommodate, I can't see 
how an author could apply this guideline.
