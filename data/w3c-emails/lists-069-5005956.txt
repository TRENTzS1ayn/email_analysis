Wendy,

         Per your note, I'd like to ask those interested in this discussion 
to let me know private email: apembert@erols.com and I will arrange for a 
mailing list to discuss the issue. In addition to Jonathan, Chaals, and 
David P., and Lisa, I hope for input from William and Al ...

         For those who don't see relevancy, consider the number of times 
someone gripes about a "best viewed in xxx" note on a web site ... what is 
a non-confrontational way to tell you how accessible the site may/may not be?

                                                         Anne
