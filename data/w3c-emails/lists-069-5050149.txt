In the call today we created the following consensus points around big
issues 6, 9, 10, and 12


======  NEW  CONSENSUS STATEMENTS  =========



N-8 If techniques or examples for a normative checkpoint (guideline)
are not generally applicable across web sites, then the checkpoint or
guideline must be qualified/restricted to those conditions where the
techniques would work.

APPLICABILITY - COVERAGE OF GUIDELINES
A-1  Cannot make products accessible to all
A-2  How to draw the line?  As accessible to as many people as we can
create the techniques and criterion
A-3 We should expend our best effort to identify techniques, criteria
and examples that would cover the greatest range possible

N-9 Our normative portions would (as qualified) apply to sites in
general. Our informative portions can give information that may apply to
sites in general or to special targeted sites as long as they are
clearly labeled.

G-2 Accessibility and usability are intertwined and vary between people
and tasks.   We think that our distinctions and decisions about
normative or importance will be based on something other than
categorizing them as an "accessibility" or "usability" items.


======== BIG ISSUES CLOSED =========

6. Implementation
(Should difficulty in implementation affect priority.)

{ We decided that if something wasn?t doable, then we wouldn?t have any
techniques or examples.  If it was only doable or needed in certain
cases, then it would be qualified.  Beyond that we decided that we
couldn?t answer the question because we hadn't defined priority -- but
that ease of implementation in general shouldn?t affect a rating of
importance to do.  See N-8 above  for CONSENSUS statement dealing with
this. }


9. Access for absolutely all?    - If not, how to draw line
(one suggestion was  "BEST EFFORT")

{see A-1 to 3 above}


10. Guidelines for all sites vs. special sites

{SEE N-9 above }

12. Accessibility vs. usability

{SEE G-2 above}
