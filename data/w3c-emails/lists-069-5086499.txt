Well, there are two approaches.

An example is that some users prefer well-animated content, and others prefer
non-animated content.

In some instances this can be decided by the users themselves - decent
browsers allow the user to specify that they don't want content to be
animated, or even that by default they don't want types of content that are
likely to be animated.

And the other approach, as Lisa pointed out (beating Kynn to the jump - hi
Kynn <grin/>) is to serve different versions of the content for different
users (It isn't just Reef doing this - big names include IBM, smaller ones
include adaptive media, and most people who started marketing to mobile
devices).

The benefit of the first appraoch is that it is very simple for authors, but
users have to do more configuration, and therefore need to know they can, and
how.
