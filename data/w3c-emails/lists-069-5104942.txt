This introduces complexity, you need some way to manage the choice of the
users, whilst I acknowledge there's a CC/PP proposal, we have no
implementations (and I hope we never do, it goes against my own views on
accessibility) so you have to provide a user interface, this interface is
likely be its very nature to be confusing and complicated for a user to
relearn on each site they may visit, and that's where the site designer
is happy to compromise their basic interface/design of what the site's
actual content is about to provide these additional options.

For things like animation, the solution surely has to rest with the user
in the UserAgent, I can't see how any recommendation could credibly
suggest that it be done on a page by page basis.

Indeed, but it solves for every site, and not just the one where the
author understands the principles of accessibilty and is willing to make
consideration.  There's always the opportunity for a page designer who is
interested in doing this to provide details of how a particular UA could
be used to change the feature.
