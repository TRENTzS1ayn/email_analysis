Jim raised concerns about 1.1     To author an accessible page that includes
a script:


he wrote:
you create an accessible page, then if you feel
accessibility (including functionality) could be improved with script,
then implement it, but you start with accessible HTML, then add script,
you don't start with "I want some script on my page..."

I do see the problem, but no solution as yet.
I usually do start from a different place to you.
example:
I considered that alphabetical links might aid learning, and speed access.
This means typing a single letter to reach the next page.
sound on mouseover was a requisite as it was possible and greatly aids cause
and effect learning.
Then found a way to implement it and am currently in the process of (over a
number of years,  suitable links are hard to find) selecting links. During
this process I had to ensure that it works without scripting, and decided
that having letters around the page might be suitable. Some students, young
adults decided that this was offensive, so using style sheets, they were
greyed out, tabbing makes them visible one at a time.
Accessibility is for external users in the main(many use applemacs), and to
satisfy my concerns.

This may seem topsy turvy, however testing the site with my clients demands
scripting in the main, of course good links are also essential.

Is it possible to write the HTML without having thought about the scripting
first?

Perhaps we don't need to specify the order of work rather the order of
validation?
