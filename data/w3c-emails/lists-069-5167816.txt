I was trying to look the WCAG checklist 
http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/full-checklist.html from a new user's point of 
view to whom this is one of the beginning points of getting started in 
making his or her Web page accessible. This user is very much in need of 
concrete examples.

I suggest that if still possible we add a link directly to the techniques 
from each checkpoint so that users can more directly get to some examples 
e.g. if they are looking at 1.1 they can get to 
http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TECHS/#tech-text-equivalent. If not 
possible to make that change at least we could do that with WCAG 2.

Even better would be if we also could have a link to the curriculum 
examples, but that is probably more difficult as it is material outside the 
guidelines. Unless annotations are used to create the links.
