The one you send them to isn't really "concrete examples" either - no code.

By putting the checklist into tabular form
http://rdf.pair.com/xpos.html
it's two clicks deep to
http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#link-text-images
from checkpoint 1.1. Some have found this layout more fun than the 
checklist document itself?

If WCAG2.0 is ever stable, I will do similar presentation for it.
