Script or not using tables could be used to solve this, how many of these
screen readers are there really in use whereby they have screen readers
who can't manage that, for windows I could write a table reader in about
an hour, would be about a 5k download and cost nothing, if there are
really are users with that limitation, please put me in touch I could help
them a lot...

There are plenty of representations that "professionals" manage without
resorting to tables that linearise very poorly, this kind of HTML is the
result of authoring tools generally, rather than human design, in any case
what exactly are you suggesting of CSS that really fails that often?

Jim.
