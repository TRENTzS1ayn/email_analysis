It would also be trivial to write a proxy that changes tables into CSS
which could be accessed by people with screenreaders -- screenreaders
which don't linearize properly are, in my opinion, a Solved Problem.

Now, that doesn't mean _tables which don't linearize properly_ aren't
still a problem, and by that I mean poor HTML coding.  I myself have
been guilty of that in the past, once with a proposed redesign for an
employer's site, which went:

START OF TABLE

ROW ONE:

CELL ONE:

Header A

CELL TWO:

Header B

CELL THREE:

Header C

ROW TWO:

CELL ONE:

List of items in category A

CELL TWO:

List of items in category B

CELL THREE:

List of items in category C

END OF TABLE

Now, if you'll notice, that's actually fairly "correct" HTML.  It's not
really broken via spec, but it's borken when it comes to interpretation
by screenreader.

(It's actually a limitation both of HTML and of screenreaders that the
above didn't work correctly; the screenreaders can't take the full blame
because the HTML spec is far too loose for the kind of data association
we need here.  More on this if I can make Reef's single authoring markup
languages public.)
