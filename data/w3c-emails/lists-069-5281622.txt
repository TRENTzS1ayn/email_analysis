A favor please.

If you are answering a post from the list - and you are responding back
to the list,  -  Please don?t RESPOND TO ALL.

Just include the GL address in the TO: line (unless you are listing
someone who is not in the GL working group).       All you do is end up
sending 2 copies to everyone on the list of names in the TO field who is
also on GL.

Thanks
Gregg
