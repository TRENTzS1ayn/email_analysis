Matt and Kynn,

         Studying the conformance scheme ideas .... I think when Kynn says 
he wants it to be flexible, he means with little or no conformance scheme - 
put out the guidelines and let everyone pick and choose what to follow? 
Such a scheme would lend itself to a variety of interpretations by 
policy-makers as well as by those who direct the web designers' work. The 
alternative is a priority scheme (which is the task this week) ....

         If we go with flexibility, how do we label the various guidelines 
so that intelligent choices can be made? Do we identify each checkpoint by 
identifying the characteristics/disabilities of the users serve? Do we 
estimate the numbers?
Or should we do that internally?

         I'm thinking that if we created a matrix for internal use, we 
could look at it and start making some concrete decisions about what to do 
to move forward on defining a conformance scheme.

         We really do need a minimal conformance level, one that covers 
addresses all input and output variations and all major groups of persons 
with disabilities .... flexibility could apply above that level.

                                                 Anne
