Hmmm

The discussion of 508 as being weaker etc is somewhat troubling to me.

It is less complete because it (for regulatory reasons) left out all
cognitive -- and some other pieces.    There are other things we learned
from it to improve 2.0.    And things we learned about weaknesses in 1.0
when they tried to use 1.0 in crafting 508.

At this point let's just say that 2.0 had better be better than both of
them when we get done with it -  since we have the advantage of both 1.0
and 508 to learn from.

Someday 508 will be revised.  Let's see how good we can make 2.0 so we
can get some additional convergence (and international harmonization)
between the future 508 and the future 2.0.
