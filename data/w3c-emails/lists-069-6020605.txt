Hi
As part of the process to determine principles for
establishing the minimum conformance criteria I have
been talking to the person in NZ who took a leading
role in creating bricks and mortar accessibility
legislation here.
His first point to me was 'Identify accessibility
problems rigorously'.
My question for the list is 'Do you think that we have
done that'? 
That is, got enough feedback from people with
disabilities on the difficulties that they actually
have using the web?
The Nielsen-Norman report could be very important in
this respect.


Cheers
Graham
