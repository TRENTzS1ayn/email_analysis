OK well in response to this week's request.

Principles for 'Minimum Conformance'

1. All Guidelines that are needed to enable 'access
to' information (as opposed to 'understanding of')
should be included

2. The Minimum should be at least as 'strong' as the
current 'Single A'

3. Any Guideline that is needed to prevent adverse
health consequences should be included.

4. The inclusion of a Guideline in the minimum should
not disadvantage anyone.

5. The more people that benefit from a Guideline the
stronger the case for inclusion in the Minimum.

6. The Guideline must be easy to implement

7. The Guideline must be easily verifiable (this is
part of the Draft Requirements)

8. The Minimum Standard must be relatively
straightforard to adapt to changes in technology.

9. No Guideline in the minimum must be 'technology
specific'

A related point is that if a guideline meets the
requirements for inclusion in the minimum but does
*not* meet 6. and 7. due to technology limitations,
then the guideline should be flagged.

The flag indicates that when and if the technology
advances to allow compliance with principles 6 and 7
the guideline will be slotted into the Minimum.

Cheers
Graham Oliver
