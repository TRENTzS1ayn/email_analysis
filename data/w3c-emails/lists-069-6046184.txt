No minimum conformance will be acceptable without inclusion of the needs of 
the cognitively and reading disabled population. It makes no difference 
whether a blind person is faced with a page of graphics without alt text or 
a reading disabled person is faced with a page of text without 
illustrations, they are equally inaccessible to the respective users.
Either situation presents as "no access" to the user.
