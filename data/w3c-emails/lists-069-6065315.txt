Jim,

         You test for illustrations the same way you test for alt text.... 
You can only test that it is there, not whether or not it is adequate.

         As for the ease of illustrating, it is really no harder than 
writing alt text or long descriptions, or scripts that accompany 
multi-media. In fact it is much easier than the last.

         Last time the argument of illustration content came up, back in 
the spring if I remember right, Wendy took the "obtuse subjects", searched, 
and found numerous sites illustrating these subjects.

                                                 Anne
