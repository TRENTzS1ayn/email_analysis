HTML is structural, you could at most associate an image with its parent
and sibling elements, there is no "visual association" on a page, because
there is no visual rendering of HTML, that's down to the User Agent, and
any _suggestions_ via stylesheets etc.

Indeed, I have no argument against that, my argument is purely that it is
not possible to provide effective examples or more importantly
testability of this category so it can't be normative.  I also believe
it's not possible to produce a single set of illustrations which work
across the whole (English speaking even) world, which is another problem.
As this is also Alternative content, it should be provided in a manner
which the display of can be controlled by the user.  (what is the alt
text of these images - is it not the text which is already on the page?)
There needs to be some HTML mechanisms for providing multimedia
alternative content before this can be normative I feel.

I'm sure it is, my inefficient searching is obviously not turning it
up...
