Jim,

         If you can test for alt text, you can also test for the graphic 
the alt text applies to. That is all the testing that is needed to insure 
that images are provided ...

         It is no more difficult to collect a set of images that speak 
across cultural lines than it is to collect a set of words that speak 
across cultural lines .... We cannot hold images to a higher standard than 
we do words.

         So it is both easy to include images and trivially easy to test 
for their presence.  But the most important reason to include these is that 
perhaps the largest numbers of disabled folks will be affected by the 
inclusion or omission of these guidelines.

         On your search for the examples we looked at last spring, it was 
probably in April because I discussed the discussions with a friend who 
visited in mid-May, but it could have been late March or early May as well. 
I think Wendy started a new thread with it, but can't remember the subject 
line. The challenge was then, for some topic in advanced physics, and on 
her first set of hits she got page after page with good illustration on a 
topic that was said to be too deep for illustrations. Not sure that will 
help your search.

         Over the past two years I've put in a lot of time searching for 
sites that can be used by students who are pre-readers to emerging readers 
.... and I've seen an increase in the number of sites that are illustrated. 
It may be that education will provide the leadership in this matter instead 
of the WAI. That will be most unfortunate because the needs of disabled 
adults are not the needs of children. Adults, even those whose intellect in 
measured in children's ages, need adult subjects and information. The 
kiddie stuff is OK for a start, but would YOU want to be limited to a diet 
of Disney and Bob the Builder? (And I don't want to get into how well 
illustrated XXX adult fare is by comparison!)

                                                 Anne
