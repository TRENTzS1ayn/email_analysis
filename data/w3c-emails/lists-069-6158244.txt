I would also like to remind participants that the question currently
before the group is: what should be the defining characteristics which
distinguish checkpoints that belong in the minimum set, from those
which don't.

The question of whether specific checkpoints belong in the minimum set
(e.g., checkpoints 3.3 and 3.4) will be decided after we have settled
upon criteria for including checkpoints in the minimum set.

Thus, discussion of whether checkpoints 3.3/3.4 should or should not
be in the minimum set is out of scope for the moment. Furthermore,
this group has agreed that checkpoints won't be included in the
normative document unless they are accompanied by adequate, testable
success criteria. The impact of that decision on checkpoints 3.3 and
3.4 is a topic for later deliberation (it should be noted that some
members of the group doubt the adequacy of the success criteria
associated with these checkpoints; checkpoint 3.4 in particular
currently has no success criteria at all).

To facilitate discussion and consensus building, please keep the
discussion at a general level, i.e., what should be the basis for
including checkpoints in the minimum set?
