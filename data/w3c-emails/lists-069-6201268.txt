I don't believe this definition is adequate, it also smacks of jargon.
Isn't it the case that we are all agreed that alt text is great, and one can
test for its presence but not its relevance?

It may be we need to spend more time trying to sort out what normative is
intended to mean, before attempting to close off discussions.
