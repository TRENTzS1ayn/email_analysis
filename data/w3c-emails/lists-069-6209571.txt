If you can provide an algorithm to test for this I'll gladly implement
it, I don't believe you can, there's no way to test that the
illustrations apply to the text, even in the most well structured HTML

I completely disagree, the English Language even in its most diverse has
a large common subset that is understood by nearly all speakers
especially in conjunction with a dictionary.  The same is not at all true
for symbols which have different meanings to different cultures.

Their presence yes, but that's meaningless, almost all w3.org pages have
an image on them, yet they aren't illustrated, you can't say that this is
trivial to test fro, without some proposal of how that test is to be
done - You've obviously already thought of this or you wouldn't say it
was trivial - please explain your methodology.

The idea for minimum conformance is about testability and examples, this
I don't believe is available for illustration of content, I'll be happy
to be proved wrong, but some practical suggestions of how to do that, and
some real world examples are needed first.

Jim.
