Hi Lisa

My responses to your responses between <GO> and </GO>

<GO>
This was taken from the information that I received
from the person here in New Zealand who was
instrumental in the introduction of the bricks and
mortar accessibility guidelines.
It was (I believe) a principle accepted by the New
Zealand disabled people involved in that process.

<GO>
Could be a misunderstanding here. I am not talking
about the number of people that 'suffer' from a
disability. Rather I am looking at the
'universability' of a guideline.
The idea that the 'curb cuts' help everyone, that kind
of thing.
Perhaps a better way to express 

5. The more universal the benefit that arises from a
Guideline the stronger the case for inclusion in the
Minimum.
</GO>

>> 6. The Guideline must be easy to implement

>Well, there goes WCAG

<GO>
Just want to check that you think this is ok?
</GO>

>> 7. The Guideline must be easily verifiable (this

<GO>
Don't think they should be left out in the cold at
all. But if we don't make guidelines that are part of
the minimum easily verifiable then how do we ensure
confomance?
</GO>

>> 9. No Guideline in the minimum must be 'technology
>> specific'

> Why?
<GO>
Don't know, scrub it <grin>
</GO>
