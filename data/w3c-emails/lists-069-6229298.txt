Hi Wendy
I am sorry but I reread this parapgraph alot

<START>
The minimal set consists of things that only the
author knows or can provide.
The secondary set are things that could be derived
using a tool.
In other words, as long as the author has infused the
markup with as many semantics as possible, then a tool
could be used to do some extra processing to increase
accessibility.
<END>

and I couldn't understand it.
Would you mind expanding on it a bit.

Cheers
Graham
