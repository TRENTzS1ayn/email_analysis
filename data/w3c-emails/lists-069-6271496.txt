Interesting...
Could you elaborate on why you think testability is an academic
criteria?

I'd say it's just the oposite.  If I can test that I've done the thing,
the thing is practical.  If I can't, the thing is academic. 

If the thing is academic, we can have long philosophical discussions
about whether or not I've done it (I'll bring the red wine <grin/>).  On
the other hand, if the thing is practical, each of us can apply the same
test, and agree that I've done it.


Separate point,
I don't anyone has said "difficult to test" is the criteria for not
being included in the minimum set.  I think we've said "impossible to
test".  That's a big difference.

Again, I am disagreeing.
If the only thing that allows people to access a page, or not be misled,
is a difficult to test checkpoint, should they be left out in the cold,
on a academic criteria. Again,  minimum conformance will be the end
point for many content providers.
