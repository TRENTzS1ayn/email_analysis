You're not going to believe this:-

http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/cn/20011025/tc/msn_com_shuts_out_non-microsoft
_browsers_1.html

What can I say? I've tested it on Mozilla 0.9.5 and I get the following:-

[[[
Attention: Web Browser Upgrade Required to View MSN.com

If you are seeing this page, we have detected that the browser that you are
using will not render MSN.com correctly. [...]
]]]

Ugh. I won't comment further until I have my facts sorted out, but comments
like the following, if true, just baffle me:-

[[[
"All of our development work for the new MSN.com is...W3C standard," said
Bob Visse, the director of MSN marketing, referring to the World Wide Web
Consortium, which is developing industry standards for Web technologies.
"For browsers that we know don't support those standards or that we can't
insure will get a great experience for the customer, we do serve up a page
that suggests that they upgrade to an IE browser that does support the"
standards.
