Here is a variation on the  "Only the Author can supply" approach
proposed by Wendy.


OTACS - 2   (Only the Author Can Supply)

The minimum set for compliance (equiv to single A rating today) would be
composed of those items which cannot be derived or deduced by a tool or
the reader with a disability and must therefore be supplied by the
author.



NOTES:
1- By deduced by a tool, we mean deduced by a tool commonly available at
low or no cost to the person with a disability.

2- Information that can be deduced by user or generated by a tool would
not be in the minimum set.

3- What can be deduced by tools will change over time.    The guidelines
would be modified over time to accommodate and reflect these changes.

4 -We do not have a good way to handle the advances that occur after the
guidelines are released and before the next revision.   This looks like
"until user agent"  type problem.  (Someone suggested that we put these
into a special Minimum Plus category which indicates that you must do
these today but that they may not be needed in the future).   (Graham
suggested that there were some things that might be added to minimum
over time as they became practical or functional.)

5- This basically only requires authors to provide the minimum that they
must because someone or something else cannot provide it.

6- We might have one or more levels above.
