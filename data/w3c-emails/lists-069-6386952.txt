Gregg,

         A couple of minor points --- not sure if they are 
deaf/hearing-impaired related or general usage.

1) Use "Pager/  -------  Wireless Device"  instead of "Wireless ------ 
device/Pager" on the line for the pager number.

2) consider addition of another input box to include directions for page if 
needed (hubby's pager - you have to know to enter your number, then the # 
sign for it to go through) ...

                                                 Anne
