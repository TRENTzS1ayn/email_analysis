User Related Requirements (URR)
[or as I like to call it TUIK - The User Is King?? ; )??? ]
?
The minimum set for compliance (equivalent to single A) would be
composed of those items without which a user could not be reasonably
expected to access the content and functionality of the site, due to
restrictions such as disabilities or technical environments.
