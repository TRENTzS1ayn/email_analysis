Speaking of "testing" do we mean automated tests, or tests by the
author, or user tests, or what?  I think we are using the very vague
word "test" in a sloppy manner, and at the very least the term when
used should be qualified with an adjective.

Otherwise our discussions will become even more muddled.

I think there are practical matters which cannot be "tested" but in
which a "judgment call" must be made.  As a trivial example, "appropriate
alt text."  (We all know that "existence of alt text" is easily testable,
but applicability is not a "test", it is a "judgment call.")

The suitability of a given judgment call can be tested in practice
by suitable user testing but can't really be checked in any other
appropriate manner.
