Add another note:  This also assumes that the author is using a markup
language which supports the information provided.  This is problematic
because there is a great deal of accessibility-related information which
only the author can provide -- but which cannot be encapsulated into
HTML effectively.  The addition of author-created XHTML modules makes
things even more questionable, of course.
