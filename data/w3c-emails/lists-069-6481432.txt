I agree that there are differences, but I don't agree that this group --
which is not at all representative of those audiences -- should be the
ones to issue guidelines for those groups.  W3C should not be in the
position of dictating requirements in areas for which we don't have the
appropriate expertise to comment.

Higher education web developers and policymakers should set educational
web accessibility standards.  Government web developers and policymakers
should set government web accessibility standards.  E-commerce web
developers and policymakers should set e-commerce web accessibility
standards.  And so on.

And they should do so using the WCAG 2.0 framework as a basis for
setting those policies.
