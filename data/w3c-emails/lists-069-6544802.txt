Yes.

Why must we do this?  If the truth is that certain things are difficult
(or easy) but are absolute requirements for access, then we need to
not say "this is too hard, therefore, those people over there don't

In a previous email I described a modular scheme which could be used
to "assemble" accessibility policies.  A "legacy data" accessibility
policy would be an excellent "sample policy" in a collection of
WCAG 2.0 applications published as a W3C Note.
