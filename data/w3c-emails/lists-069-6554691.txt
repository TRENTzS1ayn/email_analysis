The term "Modules" as in "Modularized XHTML" would seem to be useful
here.  This allows us to define subgroups of checkpoints and then
make a statement such as:

      A minimally accessible web site "MUST" follow WCAG 2.0 modules
      A, B, and D.

This allows additional modules to be "added in" to a policy or perhaps
even replaced as appropriate.  Look at the XHTML modules (this is not
a new suggestion) and there's clear models including simple and
complex table modules, as well as required core modules.

One can claim compliance with XHTML Basic -- where XHTML Basic is
simply a specific set of XHTML core and required modules.
