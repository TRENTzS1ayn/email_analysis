I strongly agree.
I've been trying to understand this term for ages and
I am _extremely_ highly motivated to understand it.
Clearly it serves a purpose for some but I think that
we need to find a way of presenting the concept in the
document without using the term.
I would like to present an alternative but I am still
sufficiently confused by its meaning within the
Guidelines to offer one.

Cheers
Graham
