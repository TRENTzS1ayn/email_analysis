Despite being engaged in the process of coming up with
a set of minimum conformance criteria I have a lot of
sympathy for Kynn's view.
My reasoning may be slightly different however.
As stated in this post [1] which went unanswered, how
much do we know about the difficulties disabled people
have using the web?
Do we know enough to create a set of minimum
Guidelines which will effectively meet the needs of
those (disabled web site users) for whom they are
designed to benefit?
Having bought the Nielsen Norman report and having
skim read it I have been astounded by how relevant it
is to what we are up to in this group.
Can we afford to ignore it?
No, I am not on commission <grin>

Cheers
Graham
