Kynn,

         I agree with your principle here. Each domain should set their own 
guidelines, but I choked over the notion of higher ed setting guidelines 
for K-12. The needs of the two levels of education are very different, 
especially as you approach the younger students. K-2 may need an 
illustration density of one illustration per 10 words, while higher ed 
could do nicely with an illustration per 100 words. The needs for 
educationally disabled folks (cognitive, learning, and reading 
difficulties) is somewhere between these extremes.

         Sadly, although some of us have struggled to keep good faith 
instead of hard numbers out of 3.4, it seems it will be necessary in order 
to include the affected folks at the supper table.

                                                 Anne
