OTACS-2 is difficult to elucidate / explain.? Its
premise has moved away from users and their access due
to disabilities.?
Appears to be appeasing developers/ content authors,
when I believe WCAG's primary aim to help user groups,
and our secondary aim is to make it as easy as
possible for the authors.
eg. what is the theory behind this (as explained to a
business manager)?

Yes I agree with this point.
Perhaps if Wendy elucidated her rationale for the
distinction she came up with that would be helpful.

Cheers
Graham
