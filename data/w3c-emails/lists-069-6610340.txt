I mean human testing or machine testing.

Basically, I mean that a professional software test organization could
build and execute a reasonable test plan based on the guidelines.
Additionally, that two professional software test organizations could do
so, and come up with something pretty similar.

For anyone who is not familiar with the practice of software testing, I
highly recommend this book.

Speaking of "testing" do we mean automated tests, or tests by the
author, or user tests, or what?  I think we are using the very vague
word "test" in a sloppy manner, and at the very least the term when used
should be qualified with an adjective.

Otherwise our discussions will become even more muddled.

I think there are practical matters which cannot be "tested" but in
which a "judgment call" must be made.  As a trivial example,
"appropriate alt text."  (We all know that "existence of alt text" is
easily testable, but applicability is not a "test", it is a "judgment
call.")

The suitability of a given judgment call can be tested in practice by
suitable user testing but can't really be checked in any other
appropriate manner.
