This is a good question.  I think this is how I see it:
1. the CHECKPOINTS describe how to make content accessible for people with disabilities
2. the PRIORITIES help the content provider determine where to start.

Every checkpoint should help make content more accessible.  Ideally a content provider would conform to all of them.  However, a list of ten is easier for the content provider to swallow than a list of 21.  We don't want to overwhelm them or they won't do anything.

The OTACS-2 minimal set puts priority on those things that only the content provider can provide.

Thoughts?
