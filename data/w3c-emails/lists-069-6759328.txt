Agreed, I didn't mean to imply that I was defining normative (heh)
chunking, but rather giving an example to illustrate that _we_ should
not be the ones setting the standard for someone else.  As it is now,
that's pretty much like what we do now. :p  If college admins aren't
qualified to set accessibility requirements for 3rd graders, then it's
even more clear that this tiny group of people on the working group
is not qualified to decide on the needs for every audience out there.
