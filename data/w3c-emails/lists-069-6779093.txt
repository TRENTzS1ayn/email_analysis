The most common reason would be if someone has a specific disability
by which the default presentation is inaccessible -- maybe it's too
small, for example.  Such a person would create a user-defined style
sheet -- which is a VITAL part of the CSS specification -- which would
override user styles.  This is supported in Internet Explorer and Opera,
and somewhat in Netscape 6.

There are some platforms which some people use -- such as Linux --
where the content might only be available if you are using proprietary
formats where the "free plug-in" is only available on different platforms.
For example, everything seems to be available to Windows users, but not
necessarily for Macintosh or Unix users.   So someone might very well
complain because they are denied acess.

What?  Those users should just use Macintosh which has the built in
ability to read text out loud.

Now, see, I'm not REALLY arguing that, I'm just pointing out that such
arguments are very easy to make but very problematic in practice.

Does it work with all ATs?  Or is that the correct metric to use here?
