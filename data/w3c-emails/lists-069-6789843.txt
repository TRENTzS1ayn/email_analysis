This definition causes extreme problems in practice among web developers.
Very few people who are not involved in the recommendation creation
process (and who are thus not accessibility experts themselves) can
discern the subtleties of this distinction.  In order to understand why
something is "impossible" vs. "very difficult", someone would need to
be at least as knowledgable on accessibility issues as a member of this
group.

Therefore, to the outside world, a checkpoint is Priority 1 and not
Priority 2 because it is _more important_ to do.  It is a "MUST" (as
defined by RFC whatever whatever) because it should be done, and the
other is just a "SHOULD" and thus is _less important_.  This is a
perfectly natural and reasonable way to understand the WCAG priority
levels.

And unfortunately it's completely and utterly wrong.  Priorities in
WCAG 1 do not mean this, they mean exactly what Jason said above.  But
the distinction is meaningless to most people and near impossible to
teach, and leads to absolutely incorrect assumptions about web
accessibility.
