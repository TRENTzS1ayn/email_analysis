You are correct except for one word.  This is more accurate:

"the PRIORITIES help the content provider determine where to STOP."

This is a true and accurate statement of how WCAG 1.0 priority levels are
used, and it is a danger to increased accessibility -- and therefore
I feel it is a problem we _must_ correct in WCAG 2.0.

This isn't necessarily true.  21 is not necessarily "too many."  It
all depends on organization and presentation.
