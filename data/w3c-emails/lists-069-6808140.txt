If a tool can solve this, then it becomes an Authoring Tool or a User
Agent issue, not a Web Content issue.  If a tool can correctly process
the information then such a tool can be run on the user's side, and it
is not the author's responsibility.

Therefore, there should be absolutely no WCAG 2 checkpoints/guidelines
which are not "minimum set" via OTACS-2.

Is this correct?  Do you agree or disagree?

My take on web accessibility is that ultimately the question of
accessibility boils down to:

(a) Knowing what information you need to provide (as an author), and
(b) Knowing how to properly encode that information so it can be
     utilized by the end user.

I maintain that the set of all checkpoints which fit this definition --
and which fit OTACS-2 -- is equal to the set of all checkpoints which
belong in WCAG 2.  There are no checkpoints which do not meet OTACS-2,
which should nevertheless be included in WCAG 2.

Therefore, this is a poor choice for distinguishing a "minimum set" of
WCAG 2 checkpoints.
