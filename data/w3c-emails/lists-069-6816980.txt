Haven't seen a MAC has a built in Screen Reader - but I don't think we have 
any newer than the G-3's. Further MACs seem more costly than Windows or 
Unix machines, which probably offsets the free speech reader, unless you 
need a MAC for some other reason, such as for certain ATs.

But, yes, I see your point. What may seem perfectly reasonable from afar is 
a major obstacle for an individual ...
