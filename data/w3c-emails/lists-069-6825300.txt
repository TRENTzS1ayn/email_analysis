Kynn,

         Thanks for sharing your experience with the presentation.

         As much as I advocate illustrating everything, I have some links 
on the kids' pages that aren't illustrated, and I've noticed the kids just 
skip over the unillustrated links and try those with an illustration ... 
What is important is that we can learn from each other and from our own 
experiences.

                                                 Anne
