I just noted this minor semantic error when searching the latest draft.

In the following text relating to natural language, Change intelligible to
unintelligible

 Oftentimes, phrases from various languages are interspersed in writing.
When these phrases are identified, a speech synthesizer can voice text with
the appropriate accent and pronunciation. When they are not identified, the
speech synthesizer will use the default accent and pronunciation dictionary
which can make the phrase intelligible.
