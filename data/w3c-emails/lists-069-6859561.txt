The user groups who is expected to be accommodated by 3.4 are those with 
cognitive, reading, and learning disabilities. They have no need to prefer 
SVG over JPG, GIF, etc Rastor Images, unless they are also Visually 
Impaired .... therefore, requiring SVG for 3.4 is impractical ... it has no 
purpose in the intended benefactor group, although it may have benefits to 
peripheral groups ...

Further, as it is presently, downloading an SVG reader does not result in 
the intended benefits. It's still vaporware, and I've heard it said it's 5 
years away from reality .... that is far past the scope of WCAG 2.0 ....
