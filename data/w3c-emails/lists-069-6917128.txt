This is simply untrue. Cognitively disabled users who are looking for
animated content have every reason to prefer SVG over other formats, or at
least every reason that can be advanced for using flash.

SVG is not vapourware, it works in animated form now using a readily
available plugin, it works in at least two static form that supports
accessibility features.

To make general handwaving assertions about how hard things might be is not
helpful. We need to assess the technologies available, and the solutions they
can provide, and then what is on the horizon that we should think about in
order to provide a better solution as the technology improves.

Otherwise we would be using text-only browsers.

  purpose in the intended benefactor group, although it may have benefits to
  peripheral groups ...

  Further, as it is presently, downloading an SVG reader does not result in
  the intended benefits. It's still vaporware, and I've heard it said it's 5
  years away from reality .... that is far past the scope of WCAG 2.0 ....
