Al,

     Downloading and installing an SVG viewer isn't an obstacle .... either 
the user or the caretaker/teacher/parent will assist in downloading and 
installation as needed. As I said most of those who need/want or prefer 
illustrations do not necessarily have needs related to the format.

         So far, I just haven't seen much interest in converting to this 
format, and I don't think that requiring it, or even just hinting it will 
save you a few minutes in setting an alt text, are much encouragement to 
someone who is comfortable with existing graphic tools .... Plus SVG can't 
handle photos, and I've been told it isn't likely to in the near future. 
SVG will be wonderful someday, but until then lets recognize that as bad as 
raster images are to some, they are a currently-available ticket to dinner 
for many others.

         Yes, illustrations open up more channels to communication than 
plain text, whether presented on paper or as a lecture. So does sound, in 
it's variety of possibilities ... Any modern teacher will tell you that the 
greater number of ways you present the information, the greater is the 
chance that you will reach all your students, even if all don't learn from 
the first lesson ...

         All users will benefit from the variety in web content .... And 
yes, supply an alt tag!  Supplying an alt tag for images is trivial 
compared to multi-media requirements under 1.1 ....  Perhaps that is why 
the examples of 1.1 for multi-media content on non-regulated pages is 
typically absent???


                                                 Anne
