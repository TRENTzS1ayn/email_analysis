Chaals,

         Good news that SVG is progressing past vaporware! It is still not 
an easily-available option for a page author, especially one who does not 
have a pioneering sense about digital design ... Anyone who uses SVG on 
their page needs to provide a link to download the viewer if they don't 
want to frustrate users with a blank screen ...

         Unless you count e-mail readers as early browsers, there was no 
beginning of Internet hyperlinking before images were included ... but do 
correct me if my memory is faulty ....

                                                 Anne
