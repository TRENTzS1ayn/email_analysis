Sounds somewhat exclusionary for groups of end users for which there
is no identifiable "assistive technologies" which are in widespread
use.  I'm specifically thinking of cognitive disabilities here, but
also --

Question:  Does this mean that a "don't trigger photo-epileptic attacks"
checkpoint would not be part of the minimum set?  It's priority 1 in
WCAG 1.0 and is required by Section 508.
