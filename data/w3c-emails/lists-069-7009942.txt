Nowhere did I suggest they did, I hypothesised about the situation where
the content author prefers SVG, because they can generate it, now
providing content only in a tech which requires a plug-in (and a very poor
one at that requiring hugely more processing power than Flash for
example.) is a no-no, however my proposition is that in giving alternative
content, it may not be unreasonable, to require a plug-in, it's a
reasonable enough expectation of users IMO.

I think I'd use the word Ludicrous, that wasn't the point I was trying to
make, hopefully I've clarified it, I think it was a mistake choosing 3.4
for the illustration.
