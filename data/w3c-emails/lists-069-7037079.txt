At last week's meeting [1], there was a call for volunteers interested in helping to move the CSS Techniques document [2] forward.  A couple people have volunteered so far.  I wanted to send a message to the list for those of you who may be interested but did not catch the request in the summary of the minutes.

Ideally, we'll have a small team of folks who feel responsible for moving this document forward.  It includes creating examples, testing them on a variety of browsers and with a variety of assistive technologies, then documenting the results.

Let me know if you're interested.
