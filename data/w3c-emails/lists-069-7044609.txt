When we last engaged in this discussion, there seemed to be some
measure of agreement that the guidelines ought not to prescribe which
technologies authors should and shouldn't use, except in those cases
where it is not possible to employ a certain technology in an
accessible manner. The argument was, as I recall, that if we were to
make such prescriptions, they would be at best ignored by developers,
and at worst counter-productive.

I don't think this amounted to a consensus position, and the issues
related to user agent support are very complex. The suggested approach
was to provide information regarding how to use various technologies
in an accessible manner, and to include, where available, details of
any implementation issues or other factors that might make the
required degree of support unavailable to certain users, leaving it
ultimately to the author (and, realistically, regulatory bodies) to
strike an appropriate policy balance.
