Hello all,

sorry about the delay in posting details - I have had difficulty in
coordinating them. But here they are:

TUESDAY 13 NOVEMBER
Conference Room 1, 1/242 Exhibition Street, Melbourne

WEDNESDAY 14 NOVEMBER
Conference Room 1, 11/35 Collins Street, Melbourne

These are both locations in the centre of the city (near the Parliament train
stop, at the top (East end) of the city. Public transport is readily
available.

These details will be posted to the Meeting page in a few hours, along with
some more general information about Transport, where to serach for Hotels,
and so on. Remember that it will be the start of summer - although it can be
wet and windy, it is more likely to be warm - 20 to 35 degrees C or 65-90 F

cheers

Charles
