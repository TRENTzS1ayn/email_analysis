Is there part of w3c that considers file extension names?
I was trying to download an .rpm (something like: redhat packet manager)
today and found that Real Player Media opens and tries to play it.

I've been careful to not specify any default applications, and don't appear
to have set this up, Real are currently investigating...
Obviously as time goes by this type of issue could become more prevalent.

btw: I tried to set iexplore as the default for .rpm and this naturally sent
it into an infinite loop, anyone have an idea about how to differentiate
these very different files under windows?
