It is common to use the vertical, |, to separate links.  (Example, in the
New York City website:  http://www.nyc.gov/html/hia/home.html )

I would add test cases using verticals (one or two, offset from surrounding
hyperlinks by one space or nonbreaking space) to separate links, to the five
existing cases.
