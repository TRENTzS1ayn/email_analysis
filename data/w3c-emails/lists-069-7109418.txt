I have not seen an agenda as yet.
There was a proposal to revue:
Script Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0
http://www.learningdifficulty.org/develop/w3c-scripts.html

If this is still intended, please could someone advise me asap what time has
been set aside?
What with clocks changing I've no idea, but imagine it'll be in the middle
of the night here.
