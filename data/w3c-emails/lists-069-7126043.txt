Agenda

1. The agenda of the forthcoming face to face meeting
   (http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2001/11/f2f-agenda.html).

2. Document for review: the Education and Outreach working group (EO
   wg) has requested that we review and comment upon the following
   document:
Business Benefits of Accessible Web Design:
   http://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/benefits.html

Any comments need to be collected and forwarded to the Education and
Outreach working group before Friday.

3. Conformance: how to define the "minimum set" that will be required
   of implementors in order to make valid WCAG 2.0 conformance claims.
   This issue has occupied much of the working group's recent e-mail
   discussion and was considered in detail at the last meeting.
