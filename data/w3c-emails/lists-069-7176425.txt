I really don't like Jason's officious tone. If this is a registered mime
type issue, where do I report it to?

when I click on a link on a page such as
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3581
hoping to download a file, and instead another application opens and tries
to play it as a media file.

This is clearly an accessibility issue, and needs a guideline.
If I have misunderstood something please explain, as It is not clearly
offtopic to me.
