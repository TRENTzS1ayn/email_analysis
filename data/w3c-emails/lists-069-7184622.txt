I have turned it over in my mind and slightly
paraphrasing your note 2 gives the following

"Any checkpoint which results in a certain group of
users' being _unable_ to read, understand, interact
with or navigate content would qualify for inclusion
in the minimum set."

How does that sound as a rephrasing of the overall
principle?

Cheers
Graham
