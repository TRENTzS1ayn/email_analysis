In the spirit of the moment I have decided to give the
updated version of these conformance principles a
name, in the vain hope that they don't fall off the
map completely.
In case you are wondering WAMO stands for What About
My Ones <grin> and there are now only 8.
Each principle is followed by a summary of comments
received and anything else relevant.
At the least the current OTACS-2 reformulation does
not include principle 3 below.


They are as follows

1. All Guidelines that are needed to enable 'access
to' information (as opposed to 'understanding of')
should be included.

The above is a less strong version of the current
OTACS-2


2. The Minimum should be at least as 'strong' as the
current 'Single A'


3. Any Guideline that is needed to prevent adverse
health consequences should be included.

Some 'support' for the above in this post [1]


4. The inclusion of a Guideline in the minimum should
not disadvantage anyone.

Response to the above in this post [2]

5. The more universal the benefit that arises from a
Guideline the stronger the case for inclusion in the
Minimum.

6. The Guideline must be easy to implement

7. The Guideline must be easily verifiable (this is
part of the Draft Requirements)

8. The Minimum Standard must be relatively
straightforard to adapt to changes in technology.
