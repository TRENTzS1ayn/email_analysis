Sorry sticky fingers, sent the last before I had
finished.

5. The more universal the benefit that arises from a
Guideline the stronger the case for inclusion in the
Minimum.

This new version was reworded due to point raised in
this post [1]

6. The Guideline must be easy to implement

The above caused considerable debate. Definitely no
sort of consensus.


7. The Guideline must be easily verifiable (this is
part of the Draft Requirements)

This also caused considerable debate. This post looked
at what is meant by verifiable [2]


8. The Minimum Standard must be relatively
straightforward to adapt to changes in technology.

Cheers
Graham
