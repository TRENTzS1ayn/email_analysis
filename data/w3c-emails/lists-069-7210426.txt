I must be getting tired, sorry another go

"Any checkpoint which, if not followed, results in a
certain group of users' being _unable_ (with the aid
of any applicable client-side software and assistive
technologies) to read, understand, interact with or
navigate content would qualify for inclusion in the
minimum set."

Cheers
Graham
