Hello,

We'll have a quick meeting tomorrow to discuss who will be doing what and when on the CSS Techniques for WCAG.  This will occur 3:30-4:00 Eastern (the 1/2 hour before the weekly WCAG WG meeting).  Note that the call will be on the Tobin bridge (+1 617.252.7000), WCAG calls are usually on Longfellow (+1 617.252.1038). 

I will take minutes on IRC. This will also give people a chance to participate by IRC if unable to phone in.

port: 6665

Agenda:
- Timeline for next draft 
- Divvying up the work

Details:
** Timeline 
I would like to see how much we can accomplish before the F2F meeting in Australia.  We also need to think about when we will publish our first public working draft.

** Divvying up the work
As I see it, we have the following needs.  People can do more than one of these roles and more than one person can do each role:
- creating examples
- testing examples (variety of browsers, platforms, assistive technologies, settings, etc.)
- documenting examples
- editing and piecing together
- maintaining an open issues and bug reports list 

Initially on our plate:
- incorporating edits and comments received since the last draft (July 2001)
- incorporating edits and comments received since last public Note was published (november 2000)
- creating examples for each technique
- creating success criteria or some way to test each technique
- test each technique to determine how it works, where it breaks, how it breaks, etc.

Comments and edits received since last draft:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2001OctDec/0085.html

Comments and edits received since November 2000 draft - too many to list right now.  This could be someone's first task - to collect all of the feedback and questions sent to w3c-wai-gl and w3c-wai-ig over the last 2 years and make an issues list.
