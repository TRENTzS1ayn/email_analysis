I think the main argument is that the cost is very low for much of the
guidelines (obviously there are expensive ones especially if you're
including multimedia ones.) and as they cost so little, and do increase
visitors and improve marketability of the site they must be worth doing.

Ignore WAP, it's an irrelevant failure pretty much noe, however, AvantGo,
PocketIE are not, they don't get a special rendering, they get the site,
show them how it looks on a Palm, or IPaq or something, then point out
the demographic who use these devices, and talk up the "future proofing"
of the accessible techniques.

CSS is surely just as time consuming as the HTML 3.2 approach to achieve
the same?
