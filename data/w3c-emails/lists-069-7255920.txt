Regrets - I will not be able to make the meeting.

For the forthcoming face to face I would like to see the group work on
resolving the issues that came from the ERT group - this is a dependency ATAG
has that has been waiting a long time. I would also like to review the script
techniques proposed - whether at the meeting or at some point in the grou's
near-term agenda. I would like to repeat the discussion of resolving issues
in WCAG 1.0 and publishing the Resolutions of the working group. (I need
ansers to these, so I will just keep adding it to agendas I guess).

Chaals
