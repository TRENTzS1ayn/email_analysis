There is an issue here - that of correctly configuring software. The problem
is either that the Web server is sending incorrect information about the type
of the content (you should be able to find out by looking for file
information or similar in your browser, or by using a tool like Lynx or
libwww to get the Header information) or that you browser is not respecting
that information and trying to guess on its own.

The W3C does not deal with file extensions at all - they are only used in
Windows and some unix applications anyway. The issue of sending and
recognising content types is about how to implemenet http, which is now
developed by the IETF. I presume in the server-sde techniques for WCAG we say
that servers should be configured correctly - this is one of the things they
can really do wrong.

  Is there part of w3c that considers file extension names?
  I was trying to download an .rpm (something like: redhat packet manager)
  today and found that Real Player Media opens and tries to play it.

  I've been careful to not specify any default applications, and don't appear
  to have set this up, Real are currently investigating...
  Obviously as time goes by this type of issue could become more prevalent.

  btw: I tried to set iexplore as the default for .rpm and this naturally sent
  it into an infinite loop, anyone have an idea about how to differentiate
  these very different files under windows?
