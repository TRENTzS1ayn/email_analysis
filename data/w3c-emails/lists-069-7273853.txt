I understand from discussions with Matt that the forthcoming HTML
techniques draft will contain proposed resolutions for these issues.
If this draft is available by the face to face meeting, perhaps the
issues could be considered by an HTML sub-group during the techniques
session which will be held as part of the meeting.

If we have sufficient attendees with interest in the area we can also
consider  the DOM and script-related techniques.
