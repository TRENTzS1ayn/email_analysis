I am interested in doing this in EARL (see below) which would mean having a
URI per test case. I have iCab in Mac OS 9 and 10, and a few other obscure
browsers - if anything has CSS support I'll look, as well as something that
doesn't (like links or wannabe).

  <classy> Is there capability in either Adobe or Corel to take a bitmapped screen shot and object-recognize it into SVG?  Then we could make the screen shots faithful but WAVE like annotated, too.
  wc reads classy's question
  js interesting question.  good idea.
  wc who wants to follow up? .. al?
   <classy> Let's see if Chaals knows anything.  He's double dipper on this one, AU and SVG Techs.

There are several tools that will do conversions from bitmaps, and others
that will convert fonts to SVG fonts.

  wc need matrix of browsers/platforms/assistive technologies.

CMN The results for this would be a good use case for EARL. Sean Palmer might
be able to help us make a bookmarklet or similar to generate the right code.
