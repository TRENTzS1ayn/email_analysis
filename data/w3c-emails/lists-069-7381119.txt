Yes, I think some idea of why it is worth doing more than level-A (at least
for WCAG 1) would be a good thing for this grop to contribute to, both at a
technical and where practical a business case level.

A particular point is that there are some groups who are apparently not well
served by low levels of accessibility,and for whom it is particularly
imortant to have a sufficiently high level that they can participate in
relevant activities.

  I think it would be interesting to make a case for "general / minimum
  accessibility" and a separate case for total AAA+, state of the art,
  accessibility. , and see if we can not undo some of the "I am bobby
  approved and that is enough" attitude.

  All the best,
