Folks,

         Sadly, I have had to make a decision that I've been worrying with 
for a couple of months. My mother is in a nursing home and new arrangements 
need to be made which will take up more of my time. In addition, I've had 
new responsibilities added at work, decreasing the time I can devote to the 
guidelines.

                                                                 Anne
