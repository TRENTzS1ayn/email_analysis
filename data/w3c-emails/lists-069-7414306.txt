I have been trying to register on the web site since Friday 2 November to
attend the discussion/meeting session on Tuesday afternoon. 

I enter my email address and do not receive an email with a VERIFICATION
code anywhere in the text. 

I have been communicating with Dominique Haza?l-Massieux - W3C's Webmaster
at MIT to try and resolve this issue. 

Can you register me please?
