Thanks, Chaals. Yes, by all means let's make use, whenever possible, 
of the test suite that exists. [1] The purpose of the preliminary 
test page I was working on [2] was narrow: I wanted to test which 
units of font measurement allow easy resizing of text by the user in 
various browsers (emphasis on the "easy" -- using a clearly labeled 
"size" button in your browser's toolbar qualifies as easy; whipping 
up a little javascript to custommize your browser's behavior does 
not). I was also interested in seeing the effects of different 
DOCTYPE statements on the way certain browsers (mainly IE for Mac) 
handled font sizes.

Here's some previous correspondence with Joel on that subject, for background.

All of this should be considered preliminary, and I would appreciate 
input from people who know more than I do. Thanks!
