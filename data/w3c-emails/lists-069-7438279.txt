Thursday, 8 November, 21:00 UTC (4 PM US Eastern, 10 PM France, 8 AM
Friday Eastern Australia) on the W3C/MIT Longfellow bridge,
+1-617-252-1038:

This will be a short meeting to set the scene for next week's agenda
and to consider how best to address issues of conformance, success
criteria and technology-specifics. If you are not entirely sure where
we stand in relation to these or other issues, please bring questions
along to tomorrow's meeting. The aim is to ensure that everyone
understands the issues and is ready to discuss them, on the merits,
next week.
