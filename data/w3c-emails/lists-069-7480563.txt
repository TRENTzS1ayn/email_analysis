Is this part of the guidelines?
should it be?

I'm finding it very frustrating when I visit large sites, and cannot find
out what other resources there are by knocking of the end.

for example:
http://news.bbc.co.uk/low/english/entertainment/music/newsid_1580000/1580273
.stm
I'd like to know what else was in each directory, what is the meaning of
low, etc
