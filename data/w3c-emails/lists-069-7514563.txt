Hi all;

I'm writing up the code for screenshots on my five assigned units for the
"CSS Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2." document. I'm
responsible for the first sections of this document:

1. Fonts
2. Color
3. Units of Measure
4. Text style effects
5. Text instead of images

My question: does anyone know of a list of CSS Level 1 and Level 2 property
values that also cross-reference the property the value can be used in?
Here's my dilemma: I'm identifying the proper use of color, according to the
CSS Recommendations and that demonstrate the WCAG 2.0 CSS Techniques
document. It makes sense, I think, to hit the use of color as an attribute
of (insert CSS property here: font, border, background, etc...). 

To accomplish this, each of the five areas I'm taking has a large table with
the CSS Property and associated values below them. Columns across are links
to the screenshots - all using the same code so we can compare user agent
support. However, for me to crawl through both the CSS Recommendations in
search of every instance of a color value ... you get the picture <grin>.

Hoping someone has seen such a reference so I can cut the research for these
tables and screen shots down considerably.

Thanks! Have a good weekend.
