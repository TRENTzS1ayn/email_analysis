joel
you could try the evaluation version of TopStyle
http://www.bradsoft.com/topstyle/download/index.asp
which may contain the reference you require.

or the equivalent from Western Civilization
http://www.westciv.com.au/style_master/download/download_windows.html

This is the other place that may be useful
http://www.blooberry.com/indexdot/css/index.html

Cheers
