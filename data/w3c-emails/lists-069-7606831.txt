"Applies to" is difficult because for some values there are no
strictly machine readable definitions (e.g. "all elements, but see
prose"), and for others, you can't implement it as a domain, because
the solution for what this property applies to may be based on other
property values (e.g. "positioned elements"), or something else. Well,
in that case the domain would be the set of selected elements that has
these certain properties applied to it.

By "defining classes for the elements", you're of course right, and
this would mean modelling CSS2 selectors in RDF... obviously, because
if you want to use this as other-than-documentation-only, then you're
going to want to port all of CSS2 over to RDF.

Yeah...

Good point... I should have specified a schema for it; here's a
fragment of it that will cover your concern:-

   :inherited rdfs:domain css:Property .
   css:Property rdfs:subClassOf rdf:Property .

Same domain for all the properties...

   css:Property [ daml:inverseOf rdfs:domain ]
      :values, :initialValue, :appliesTo, :inherited, :percentages,
:mediaGroups .

I'm not even going to bother with the ranges: just let me know when
RDF Core is decided on what it wants to do with datatypes!

Let's charter a new WG! :-)
