Note:? This is from a thread on the GL list.? William suggested it is an idea
we should share with the Device Independence group.

The summary is a version of "make what you send strict and what you accept
loose."

The "send strict side is that all media you use shall be squeaky clean per
specification."

The "accept loose" side is to accept the incomplete deployment of

else.? The way we do this is to "treat ill-supported media features the way we
treat modality-limited media: ensure that there is an alternative that works
well."

In other words it is a parallel application of "eliminate or provide paths
around predictable failure modes."

The rest below is quoted from a message to GL, which was sent with
