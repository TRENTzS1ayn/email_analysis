Hi Jim

The consensus is Human testing.    Automatic is of course acceptable and
great where possible -- just not required.

Gregg


PS  - My definition of objective is that 8 or 9 out of 10 people (not
experts) who understand the rule (and have read the techniques document
which explains it) would come up with the same judgment.
I would like to go for 9 of 10.  Will see how well we do.
[NOTE: this definition of objective has NOT been proposed for consensus
so I have no idea if there is consensus on this definition or not]

What the heck.  This can be a posting.  People's thoughts on
'objective'?

Gregg

What is the consensus definition of testability? - Automatic? Human? and
what confidence in the test is acceptable?

Jim.
