KYNN WROTE:
Question:  Does this mean that a "don't trigger photo-epileptic attacks"
checkpoint would not be part of the minimum set?  It's priority 1 in

GV: - it wouldn?t be excluded because having a seizure definitely
prevents you from "reading, understanding, navigating or interacting
with the content"
