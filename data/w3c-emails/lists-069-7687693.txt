In looking at the topic of AT it occurs to me that we might have
different levels of AT and ability to use technology

Perhaps we have three levels
1 - the ability to Access using any existing tools
2 - the ability to Access using standard browsers and moderately priced
AT.  (less than $300 ??)
3 - the ability to Access using browsers and AT in their default
settings.

(this last one is added since most people don?t know how to custom
configure their software)
