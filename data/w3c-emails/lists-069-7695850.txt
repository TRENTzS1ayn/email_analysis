Hello all,

Here are the details.  Sorry I didn't get them out sooner.

The phone call will begin at 5:00 p.m. Eastern US (22:00 UCT) Monday 12 November (9 a.m. Tuesday 13 November) here in Melbourne.  Those on the phone will attend for 4 hours then drop off.  

To find out what time it is in your Time Zone, here is a time zone convertor. http://www.timezoneconverter.com/cgi-bin/tzc.tzc  Be sure to use the Melbourne time since that is the one I am surest about. <grin/>

We will use the new W3C bridge named Zakim.  You dial the number, then will be asked to enter a passcode.  +1-617-761-6200 passcode 7000

We will hopefully have an IRC channel open and take minutes there.  
server: irc.w3.org
port: 6665
channel: #wai-wcag

This will be especially crucial for you attending by phone. You can "raise your hand" or let us know if you can't hear us well enough.  For more info on IRC, refer to http://www.irchelp.org

I have the following people registered to attend by phone:
William Loughborough
Andi Snow-Weaver
Loretta Guarino Reid
Gregg Vanderheiden
Katie Haritos-Shea
Tim Lacy
Annuska Perkins

For an hour on Monday evening (U.S. and Europe/Tuesday a.m. in Oz), we will hopefully be joined by the IMS folks to discuss what each of our groups are doing.  More on that when the time comes.  http://www.imsproject.org/

Be well.  Let's have a great meeting.
