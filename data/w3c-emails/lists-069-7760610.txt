I think that the notion of businesses as being *only* concerned with the 
"bottom line" is misplaced. Several representatives from major corporations 
participate in the EO WG and have affirmed that many corporations recognize 
the notion of "*enlightened* self-interest" as typified in the document GL 
is reviewing for EO that discusses gains from implementation of WCAG 
principles.
