 Based on some comments and suggestions received, I have updated my
white paper that outlines potential ways of specifying communication
preferences via web forms.

The white paper, sample form, and other  related documents can be found
at:

 http://www.geocities.com/moorechi/accessibility/index.htm

 Updates and Changes recently made:

1) Included population segment 'Speech-impaired' within the white paper
to broaden the number of individuals that could benefit from better
identification of communication preferences.  Footnotes and other
references were updated to reflect the inclusion of the aforementioned
population segments.

 2) Index.htm page contains links to the modified white paper and
contact
form, along with a copy of the original suggestion for historical
purposes.

 3) Change log.  Which summarizes changes to either or both the white
paper
and contact form based on comments/suggestions received.

If you should have any problems, questions or concerns, please don't
hesitate to contact me via email at: moorela@ameritech.net

 Thank you for your time and assistance.
