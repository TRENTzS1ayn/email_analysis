Hi all,
?
Definition of Dependence: In order to benefit from Guideline X,
Guideline Y must be implemented.
Definition of Benefit: Where benefit is specified under each guideline.
?

*  4.1
   Choose the technologies that support the use of these guidelines

   *  4.2
      Use technologies according to specification'
   *  1.1
      Provide text equivalents for all non-text content
   *  2.4
      Either give users control over how long they can interact with
      content that requires a timed response or give them as much time
      as possible

      *  
         1.2
         Provide synchronised media equivalents for time-dependent
         presentation

   *  
      1.5
      Separate content and structure from presentation

      *  
         3.2
         Emphasise structure and presentation, positioning and labels.
      *  
         1.3
         Use markup or a data model to provide the logical structure of
         content

   

?

*  3.5
   Annotate complex, abbreviated or unfamilair information with
   summaries and definitions

   *  
      3.3
      Write as clearly and simply as is appropriate for the content

?

*  2.5
   Use device-independent event handlers? - Mutually dependent on -
   4.3
   Design user interfaces compatible with assistive technologies

   *  
      4.4
      Ensure that content remains usable when technologies that modify
      default user agent processing or behaviour are turned off or not
      supported

Checkpoints without dependencies:
?
2.1
Provide multiple site navigation mechanisms
?
2.2
Provide consistent and predictable response to user actions
?
2.3
Either give users control of mechanisms that cause extreme changes in
context or warn them of impending changes
?
2.6
Avoid causing the screen to flicker
?
2.7
Handle input errors, such as misspellings
?
3.1
Use consistent presentation
?
3.4
Supplement text with non-text content
?
My comments:
I think that the best way to go from here is to think of several
possible test cases. ie:

*  site built entirely in HTML
*  Flash navigation site
*  site built without style sheets

and then determine if these dependencies hold true, and more importantly
if other dependencies arise.? I believe we will find that for certain
tasks there will be very specific dependencies, and once we have
identified these we can set about figuring out a couple of sets of
conformance criteria, depending on the task at hand.? Then we can have a
stab at Charles' suggestion which is to have the checkpoints listed in
certain orders depending on what the site aims to do, and this list of
checkpoints should correlate with the dependencies.
?
And my last comment: have fun Charles!
?
Cheers,
Gian
