As far as I am able, I agree with you Jim.

However i believe you have made a good case for including something about the 
whitespace issue, ie find another way; How do we say this succinctly?

otherwise a search for "whitespace dom-2 javascript" only turns up the rather 
convoluted others?

i should be posting my snippet in a few days, its brewing 
fine, if not for the ifs.

Thanks again,
