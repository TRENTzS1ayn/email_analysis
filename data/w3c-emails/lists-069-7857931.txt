Just to note, it would be pretty trivial to create a script which
allows someone to go to a web form, check off which modules to
apply (with minimal sets pre-checked, and pre-reqs accounted for)
and then generate a list of requirements.  The only reason I haven't
put this together yet is that I'd like to see what you all think of
the approach in general.
