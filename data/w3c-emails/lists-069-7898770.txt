PS:

Please don't refer to me as part of any "politburo" because of specific
terms I threw together on a proposal that is meant to illustrate not
my "vast knowledge" of captioning but rather a specific technique.  In

instead of toward your desire to be an asshole to people just because
that's what you like to do.
