Hi,
?
It was great meeting some of you at the face to face last week.
?
I am away at a conference (another one!) this week and then am on leave
until December.? Unfortunately I won't be able to participate while away
- however I will try to comment (and not too harshly!) when I get back.
?
Cheers,
Gian
