I figured that would be the case -- I threw those in to say "hey, we
could do modules about PDF" but I don't have the expertise to say what
those modules would be, and on that I defer happily to you.

Yes, I'm not sure about how to do this, which is why I gave various
example of "how it could be done" with the intent to illustrate
possibilities.  I'm not sure I like how it came out exactly; I think
some work on the "dependencies" is necessary, as well as specifically
on the issue of technology-specific modules.  That is why this is a
rough draft. ;)

On the issue of abbreviations, as I see it, there is a non-tech
dependent way to do the checkpoint -- indicate abbreviations as
we do in plaintext -- and a tech-dependent which is "use the ABBR
tag."  The two modules are meant to reflect this but maybe it is
not clear.

It probably is. :)

However, ideally what you'd have is something using this approach
to CREATE the actual policy which humans are meant to use, and that
should be arrangable in any way desired.
