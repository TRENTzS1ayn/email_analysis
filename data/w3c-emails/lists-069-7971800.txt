At Jason's suggestion, I looked at the techniques in the PDF document to see 
whether we could cast them as technology-specific success criteria. Here's the 
outcome:

PDF Checkpoint 1: Ensure that the text of the document is accessible
1.1 Render Characters and Words in Reading Order within the page
1.2 Separate words explicitly with spacing characters
1.3 Use soft hyphens and hard hypends appropriately
1.4 Use the ActualText attribute where appropriate
1.5 Ensur that all charcter codes map reliably to Unicode

Conclusion: There is no obvious WCAG2 Guideline for which these are the 
success criteria. This may be because the problem of making the text content 
of a document accessible is not much of a problem for most mark-up languages. 
These might be considered success criteria for Checkpoint 1.5, "Separate 
content and structure from presentation", or we might need a new Checkpoint.

PDF Checkpoint 2: Provide Text Alternatives for Images and Graphics

Conclusion: This is a PDF success criterion for Checkpoint 1.1

PDF Checkpoint 3: Provide Structural Grouping
3.1 provide logical structure
3.2 Tag artifacts in the page contents with /Artifact

Conclusion: These are PDF success criteria for Checkpoint 1.3

PDF Checkpoint 4: Design for User Control of Color and Contrast
4.1: Avoid drawing rectantangles behind text that are not background elements
4.2 Text should not be placed on top of images
4.3 Avoid the use of Color as the Only Means to Convey Information

Conclusion: These should be success criteria for a checkpoint, but I can't 
find what we did with this between WCAG1 and WCAG2. Perhaps we need to add 
another checkpoint, or I need to understand which of our checkpoints is 
supposed to cover color-blindness issues.

PDF Checkpoint 5: Identify the Natural Language of all Text in the Document
5.1 Identify the document's primary language
5.2 Identify when a language change occurs on the page

Conclusion: These are success criteria for Checkpoint 1.4

PDF Checkpoint 6: Provide document navigation aid
6.1 Use bookmarks
6.2 Use links
6.3 Provide alternate descriptions for links when appropriate
6.4 Provide clear descriptive names for all form fields

Conclusion: These are success criteria for Checkpoint 2.1 (although they may 
not be complete)

PDF Checkpoint 7: Provide Expansions for Acronyms and Abbreviations

Conclusion: This is a success criterion for Checkpoint 3.5

PDF Checkpoint 8: Set Document Protections to Permit Access

Conclusion: There is no WCAG Checkpoint for which this is a success criterion. 
 Perhaps this fits somehow with compatibility with assistive technology?
