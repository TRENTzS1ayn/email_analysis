Can you send the script where you're seeing this behavior?  I'll see if
can repro it.

Not quite ready to start a guidelines for scripts thread, however...

Is it right that tabbing does not enable srcelement/target to raise the

If so doesn't this directly conflict with device independence

If I've just goofed, could someone provide a url.

thanks
