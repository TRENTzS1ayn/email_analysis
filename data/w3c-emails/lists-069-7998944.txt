This requirement is very badly worded in every version I've seen. Why 
can't we just say:

If the user must take an action within a specified time, authors must 
do one of the following:

a. let the user disable that feature entirely
b. let the user set the specified time to infinity or an 
extremely large figure
c. let the user set the specified time to any arbitrary figure

Allow the user to restart the timing process as many occasions as is 
necessary for the user.

When issuing a warning that a response period is about to expire, 
timing of the response period must stop until the user can react to 
the warning.



This approach (which we can and will tweak):

* Lets people opt out of timed responses.
* Lets authors whose systems cannot accommodate such an opt-out but 
*can* accommodate a high time value use that instead.
* Lets people give themselves as much time as they need while still 
keeping a lid on things. (This might come up in E-learning testing; a 
timed response may be required, but accommodation may be made for 
students who need more time.)

I'm very firm about stopping the clock when warning that time is 
about to run out. By definition, if the basic or underlying or 
original timed process is hard for a person to keep up with, a 
quickie dialogue box that says "Hit this special button within five 
seconds or you lose your shopping cart!" ain't gonna cut it.

That's why God gave us accesskey and tabindex.

It's the best one so far. I seem to recall Al Gilman's shaking us up 
a couple of months ago. This is the first *concrete proposal* we have 
in hand.

Oh, please. You can't wash the stripes off a zebra.
