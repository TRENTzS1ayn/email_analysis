There are 2 issues:
I've created one URI:
http://www.peepo.com/2k1/mousewheel/srcelement.html

onmousewheel and srcElement snippet
You need IE6(javascript enabled) and a mousewheel.
This snippet uses the onmousewheel event to expand or contract the picture
below.
Move the cursor over the picture and roll the mouse wheel up and down.
Move the mouse off the image.

Now try tabbing to the image, click the alert, or keypad 'enter' and try to
zoom using the wheel.

2 problems:
-    no ID
-    no mousewheel

thanks again

ps: Part of the problem is to find a way to tab to an image that doesn't
have an href (any ideas)?
