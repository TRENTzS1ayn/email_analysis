Try the attached html file (sorry for the attachment, I don't have
access to an external server to post it on right now)

I removed the <a href> and added a tabindex to the <img> element.  You
had focus on the <a> element, not the <img>.  Since the id and the
onmousewheel script were both on the <img> instead of the <a>, you
weren't able to get to them from the <a>.  

You can use tabindex on most tags to add them to the tab order.  Here's
a reference to the use of tabindex in IE

There are 2 issues:
I've created one URI:
http://www.peepo.com/2k1/mousewheel/srcelement.html

onmousewheel and srcElement snippet
You need IE6(javascript enabled) and a mousewheel.
This snippet uses the onmousewheel event to expand or contract the
picture
below.
Move the cursor over the picture and roll the mouse wheel up and down.
Move the mouse off the image.

Now try tabbing to the image, click the alert, or keypad 'enter' and try
to
zoom using the wheel.

2 problems:
-    no ID
-    no mousewheel

thanks again

ps: Part of the problem is to find a way to tab to an image that doesn't
have an href (any ideas)?
