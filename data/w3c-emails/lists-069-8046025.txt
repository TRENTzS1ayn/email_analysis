I changed the subject line, because Joe is making some good points
about timed responses that need to be discussed separately from the
FWAP proposal.

I don't disagree with anything Joe says below -- I'm just adding on an
important scenario which I think is easy to overlook:

This is my gut reaction too, but I am concerned that there are other
factors beyond simply the idea of online testing or shopping cart
problems.

What I'm thinking of, for example, are things like timed auctions --
how do you make something accessible if they connect to an auction
site and there's 3 minutes left to bid on that item, and it will
take the user 5 minutes to comprehend the information and issue a
bid?

According to both WCAG 2.0 draft (and 508, and Joe's proposal above),
there's no way to do it, really, and still be "accessible".  In fact,
it may even be _true_ that there's no way to do it accessibly; it
may be a lost cause?

I'm not saying I have the answer -- and in fact, my own attempts to
phrase things were self-admittedly poorly worded too.  But I do think
that "timed events such as auctions" (or even "this sale lasts until
Tuesday" or the like) are what we need to look at as test scenarios
in addition to arbitrary ("keep your shopping cart!") or not-so-
arbitrary (e-learning testing) time limits.
