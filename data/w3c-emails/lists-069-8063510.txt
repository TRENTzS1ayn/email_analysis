I think that there are 2 categories of time bounds which must be
distinguished in our guidelines:

1. Universal, user-independent absolute deadlines (e.g. "This auction
ends at 16:00 hours UTC.") For such limits there is no practical way,
with currently available technology, to reconcile accessibility with
fairness to other bidders. The guideline should specify that
user-independent deadlines remain acceptable at this time.

2. Time-outs relative to user actions (e.g., your shopping cart
vanishes if you don't submit complete billing information within five
minutes after you received the check-out page.) The service will
not qualify as "accessible" unless users can obtain an exemption from
such limits. In situations (such as e-learning/e-testing) where
response-time is used as a measure of performance, the fact that the
user obtained such an exemption may be included in the subsequent
report of the user's score.
