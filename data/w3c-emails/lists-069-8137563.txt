Hi all.

As you may all know, I am a new member of the WCAG working group.  I just
thought I would send out a hello to all members.  Thanks for letting me
join.

Unfortunately, I too will be away for the next week or so.  I am absent from
today until December 5.  During this time, I will be riding more than 561Km
on a bicycle from the NSW border, through the mountains in northern Victoria
and on to sunny Melbourne.  They call this the Great Victorian Bike Ride
(2001).  I call it madness... but I agreed to do it anyway.

So, during this time I will not be in email contact.

Hope to speak to you all again at the next phone meeting after the ride.

Cheers.

Mat.
