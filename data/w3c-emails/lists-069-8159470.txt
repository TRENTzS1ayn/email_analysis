I would like to add the obvious one, that :
1, pictorial representation should be provided of each instruction, (if you
can not do it in one picture, it is time to split up the instructions)

2, diagrammatic representation should be provided for relationships and flow
of ideas. The subject could be shown at the center, with the various ideas
radiating outwards. Branches and sub-branches indicate the hierarchical
relationships between ideas, and visual cues are used to associate ideas
with easily recalled symbols
