 I am not providing alt tag because alt tags are what I originally wrote.

May I point out that there are spelling mistakes in the picture. and
probably in my email too, all of which violates WCAG. Instructions for how
to make accessible sites do not necessarily make it easy for someone with a
disability to produce one.

Although there are many non sited people in this group I feel it would be
hypocrisy gone mad to insist that they be bard from joining these
discussions because they can not produce pictorial representations of their
ideas.

However If they are making a web site and chouse to make it accessible for
the cognitively disabled, may I recommend that they find someone to
illustrate it.

I hope you get the point.
