Surely this is alternative content? and therefore needs to be marked up in
such a way so that those of us who do not understand images well compared
to text do not get distracted - how do you do this within current HTML
implementations alternative pages?

Again confusing unless it can be removed easily for those who do not
understand images, this is alternative content, it is not content. (and as
such is covered by other parts of the guidelines than clear and simple
writing.)
