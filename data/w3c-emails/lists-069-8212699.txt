Firstly I would be surprised if I misunderstood Will  - Will your comments
please. - maybe better not.

Secondly you do not need  alternate content. I do not know who is distracted
by non animated, relevant, illustrative pictures. It does not distract from
text but illustrates it. If text works for you, great ignore the
illustrations. but allow me to include people who are not like you.
Accessibility does not mean removing or minimizing pictorial content.

Let us say that again:

Accessibility does not mean removing or minimizing pictorial content.


However If I am wrong on that, feel free to actually read Charles email from
a few hours ago on what we did in Melbourne and you will see a nice example
of a code snippet of Ruby used for just these type of problems.

All the best,
Lisa
