I am, I have distinct problems with illustrations, they make content
(which can be explained clearly in text) difficult to understand, at the
same time I appreciate images so cannot disable all images, cartoon like
"descriptive" images that are all I see are especially distractive. (I
have a similar problem with music, I can only understand words..)

They're distracting, I'm not saying don't include them, but I'd like them
to be included in a manner which leaves the content accessible to me
(especially as I'm more of the audience for WCAG guidelines for example
than the cognitively disabled.)

> Accessibility does not mean removing or minimizing pictorial content.

Nope, of course not, it means providing multiple alternative
representations for content so that different groups with differing needs
can access the content, that means whilst pictorial content works well for
some it distracts some - just like animations work well for some (maximise
understanding) are a limitation for others, you can't say that having
images always shown yet are nothing but alternate content to the text -
remember we don't insist images alternate text content be permanently
shown, so why do you say that text's alternate content is permanently
shown - why are one group made special by having their needs have a
negative impact on anothers group?

Ruby can be used to hide images - in which user agents, can you describe
exactly how a user agent should control this (I'm happy to author a user
agent to do it, I do need though there to be some mechanism recommended
that users can use for providing alternate non text content for text.)
