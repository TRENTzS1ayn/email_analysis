I am sorry, when did I say they should be permanently shown?

Personally I love alternate renderings, and I agree that often one groups
needs will interfere with another (see previous email -when user groups
needs conflict)

I did not know that this was a case in point. but now I do. Thanks.

Just because that is true, There is  no need not to say that illustrations
will help  many cognitive disabilities  (at least 12 million Americans).

Illustrations help millions of people gain accessorily to content.

Using Ruby is one way for web authors to provide alterative within a single
site, but with XML alterative renderings get better and easier.

Yes we need more practical techniques. I am happy to acknowledge that.
But that does not implied that I should not say what I said
