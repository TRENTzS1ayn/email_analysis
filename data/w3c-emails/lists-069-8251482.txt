To: Web Content Guidelines<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>

I suggest, for the moment, that we separate the task of collecting
techniques and solutions in this area from the question of what should
be required of web sites for purposes of conformance.

Thus, taking checkpoint 3.3 as an example, we should first reach
agreement on clear, testable success criteria and techniques which we
have good grounds for concluding (on the basis of relevant research)
are of real and substantial benefit to people. Charles and Lisa have
made a start in this direction.

Only after we know what the relevant techniques are, should we
consider what it would be practical or reasonable to require of all
web sites, and how checkpoint 3.3 best fits into whatever conformance
scheme is devised for the guidelines

Similar comments apply to checkpoint 3.4.

As co-chair I would like to postpone discussion of conformance-related
issues in respect of checkpoints 3.3 and 3.4, until there is consensus
as to what these checkpoints require, what the success criteria should
be, and what techniques are available to content authors.
