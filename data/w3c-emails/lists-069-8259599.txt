Hold on a sec here.  I was with you until the "do not get distracted"
part.  I haven't found any reason to suspect that the standard behavior
built into web browsers isn't sufficient for allowing those "who do
not understand images well compared to text" to avoid distraction.

Is there even such a group that's readily identifiable, by the way,
or is this merely yet another knee-jerk reaction to the idea of
illustrations on web sites?
