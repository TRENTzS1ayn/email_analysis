I also think this needs to apply to our own demands for self-
conformance as well.  In other words, I think it's premature for
members of the group to demand "dogfood" at this time, and I think
it would DEFINITELY be a shame if people are demanding "dogfood"
as a way of say, when it's not readibly provided, "aha, then the
requirement to illustrate is bogus."
