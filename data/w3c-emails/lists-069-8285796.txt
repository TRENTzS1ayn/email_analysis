Are you arguing this because you have an actual disability and
inability to use the web, or are you arguing this because you are
a web developer who does not wish to have the burden of illustrating
web pages placed upon him?  (Or if you are part of neither group,
which group's cause are you champioining here?)

This may sound like a direct attack but really it's more of a
challenge -- when we are debating such things, it's useful to know
whether or not someone is inventing on the spot a disability group which
does not exist outside the bounds of this discussion.

Note also that personal preferences do not constitute a valid
disability group either.

So what do you propose to solve this supposed problem?  It wouldn't be
too hard to figure out, if we're actually committed to solving this
particular problem.

What would serve your, uh, needs for illustration-free text?
