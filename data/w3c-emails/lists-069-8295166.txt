We are trying to gather as much information on cognitive disabilities as
possible.
Although I was aware of Hyperlexia, were text is often more useful then
illustrations, I was not aware of a disability group whose perception was
impaired by illustrative non animated illustrations.

Could you provide more information about this Jim.
It is exactly the kind of information that we need to include as many
disabilities as possible.
Thanks,
L
