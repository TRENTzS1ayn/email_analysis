Yes, images and multimedia illustrations are alternative content, just as
text alternatives are. It is important that users can get rid of them.

This is recognised by the User Agent accessibility guidelines, which provide
checkpoints requiring just that. In the meantime there are many browsers
available that enable these users to work with a minimum of distraction.
Emacs/W3 can be used by anyone, seperately of the emacspeak package that
makes it a very useful browser for folks who can't see the content. Links,
Lynx, Wannabe, W3M are all browsers which provide text-based access, with a
link and helper-application mechanism to enable any multimedia content to be
presented in an appropriate application if the user chooses. Opera also makes
it easy to hide the images and have the text rendering, and switch between
the two.

cheers

  Surely this is alternative content? and therefore needs to be marked up in
  such a way so that those of us who do not understand images well compared
  to text do not get distracted - how do you do this within current HTML
  implementations alternative pages?
