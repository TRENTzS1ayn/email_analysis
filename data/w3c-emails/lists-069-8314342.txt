The distinction is that images are often the best way of me understanding
something (photographs/illustrations/ graphs (in their "statistical" type)
are all much more useful than prose, but illustrations to ideas which are
represented clearly and "best" in text do a lot to confuse me, there needs
to be distinction (in my mind) between those images which are content and
those which are alternative content.  I get much out of a photograph of
the city I'm visiting, but get confused by images which try to illustrate
what is already well represented in text.  Especially when the ideas are
more technical which is my main use of the web.

I have my own browser which is well set up for my uses, what I'm asking
for is clarification of how you provide these illustrations in a manner
which I can easily remove this alternative content, whilst leaving images
which aren't alternative content.

Jim.
