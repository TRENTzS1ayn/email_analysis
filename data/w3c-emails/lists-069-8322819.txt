I only know of my own experiences, it's not a disability - in that it has
no effect on my life, we live in a text (and speech) world.  All I know is
that illustrations which try to give understanding generally cause me
confusion, because I begin to doubt what I've read.

There's a game I've played where you have illustrations which are very
similar to those suggested for illustrating ideas.  I don't understand
them, even after I know what they're trying to portray, yet I'm quite good
at the game, because it's done with lots of people guessing at once, and I
get it from their words, rather than the illustration itself - in fact I
found it easier to not look at the illustration at all.

It doesn't disable me - I can do everything I need, the current
suggestions are that these alternate illustrations help "everyone" and not
just some, so it's okay if they are shown to everyone (only needing to be
hidden if _all_ images are hidden.)

Jim.
