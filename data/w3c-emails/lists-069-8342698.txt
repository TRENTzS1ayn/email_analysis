Funnily enough (under the circumstances) I have just come across it.

Williams Syndrome - an extract on the information sheet I am just reading...

"children with WS can be easily distracted by extraneous visual stimuli.
Thus beginning reading books which contain many detailed pictures and colors
on the same page as the printed word(so) are far from ideal. It is better to
use books which have a few simple pictures or outline drawings which are
less likely to distract the child. "


I do not know how this works with adults, I am writing to the foundation to
find out
