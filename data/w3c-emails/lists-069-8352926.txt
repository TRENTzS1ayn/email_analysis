Another attempt:

Checkpoint 2.4

For events whose expiry depends on user actions, do either of the following:

* Give users control over how long they can interact with the content.
* Give them as much time as possible.

For events that occur in real time independent of user actions, warn 
the user when the event expires.

[Edited to remove the impossible-to-understand multi-clause
run-on sentence, a major failing of all WCAG documents, which
need to use simpler, less pretentious, more conversational
terminology]



Success criteria

You will have met the requirements for cases involving user actions 
if any of the following is true:

* The user can deactivate automatic timeouts or updating altogether.
* The user can set the timeout to a figure up to 10 times the default 
timeout period.
* The user is warned before time expires and given at least 10 
seconds to extend the time available.
* The user is allowed to set how often the content is updated. 
[removed "in seconds"]
* The user is given as much time as possible.

In all cases, the user must be able to freeze moving text.
