I think Kynns FWAP approach resolves many of the problems discussed at the
FTF on the conformance issue.

I would like to see them further split up into modules that deal with site
construction process. Typical retrofitting options and site building
options.

For example, when building a site we may recommend starting with the modules
relating to page and site structure, clear and consistent navigation. These
are not things that most people will find it easy to retrofit later.
However if you have an existing site, you consider a module package of
retrofitting solutions such as fill in your alt tags and provide a site map.

If  EO could put together sample module packages, for policy makers as what
may be appropriate for the case of retrofitting a site

  May I recommend that people read the minutes of the discussion, and see if
they agree with this approach.
