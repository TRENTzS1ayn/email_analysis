Joe -- I like it, I think.

Agreed regarding the sentence construction.

I think we also need an explanation of what we're talking about here,
too.  Is this the checkpoint that covers:

      This page has been updated.  You will be automatically taken
      to the new page in 5 seconds, or if that doesn't happen, you
      can follow the link below:

           Go to the new address

In such cases our advice is likely either (a) just use automatic
redirects (i.e. in the HTTP headers), or (b) remove the automatic
forward and just leave the link.  We don't necessarily want to
suggest that a button which says "add 10 seconds" is going to be
better, and that may be how some people might interpret this.

We may have multiple cases here with different suggestions and
success criteria, which may be a good measure of when we need to
break into more than one checkpoint.

Your thoughts on this?
