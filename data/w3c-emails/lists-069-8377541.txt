The discussion on the list is good -- but people are beginning to take
shots at each other.   They aren't too bad yet -- but before the
progress..

It is fine to suggest alternate or improved wording for something
without denigrating the previous version.   Just propose the new wording
and leave it to the group to evaluate.    You can talk about the
strengths of yours of course.  But you don?t need to use negative
descriptors for the other.

Also please do not characterize other people's motives in their taking
one approach or stand or another.      Please confine your comments to
the content of your suggestions or to technical comments or weaknesses
you see in other propositions.   Do not ascribe motive to other people's
positions or critiques.

Thanks

Gregg
