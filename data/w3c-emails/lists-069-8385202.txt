Hi Joe


Can you think of a another work for expiry.
Synonyms I found were "expiration" and "termination"

Substituting "expiration" I get

For events whose expiration depends on user actions.....

Is that what you meant?   If so then I don?t think it is getting at the
same thing as was covered in the previous item.

Most of the time, the problem is events that expire without user action.
Rather they expire because of a time limit.    In some cases the time
limit is a period of time in which the user has to act or a default
selection is made for them.   In other cases, it is a time which they
are given to comprehend something before it is removed.

Could you try a reword to encompass these?

Also in the second part you suggest warning them when the event expires.
Did you mean alert them when the event expires or warn them that the
event is going to expire?

Thanks
Gregg

Another attempt:

Checkpoint 2.4

For events whose expiry depends on user actions, do either of the
following:

* Give users control over how long they can interact with the content.
* Give them as much time as possible.

For events that occur in real time independent of user actions, warn 
the user when the event expires.

[Edited to remove the impossible-to-understand multi-clause
run-on sentence, a major failing of all WCAG documents, which
need to use simpler, less pretentious, more conversational
terminology]



Success criteria

You will have met the requirements for cases involving user actions 
if any of the following is true:

* The user can deactivate automatic timeouts or updating altogether.
* The user can set the timeout to a figure up to 10 times the default 
timeout period.
* The user is warned before time expires and given at least 10 
seconds to extend the time available.
* The user is allowed to set how often the content is updated. 
[removed "in seconds"]
* The user is given as much time as possible.

In all cases, the user must be able to freeze moving text.
