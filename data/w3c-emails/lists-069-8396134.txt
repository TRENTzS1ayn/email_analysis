Yes, I agree that correct usage is important. In some languages it is very
easy to create confusion by using common spoken forms. I suspect this is
related to the problem of providing vowels in languages where they are
optional, such as hebrew and arabic.

  I would like to see an explicit emphasis on "use correct grammar,
  punctuation, and spelling" (according to the rules of whatever
  language the document uses). Item 19 seems to allude to a separate
  set of grammar-based success criteria, so my comment may be redundant.
