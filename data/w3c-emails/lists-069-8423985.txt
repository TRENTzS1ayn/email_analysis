I agree, but in the development phase we run up against the same problems as
the rest of the world - we have to figure out what to concentrate on first,
and this group happens to work mostly in text. (I am sure we have more
graphic talent in this group than we are seeing demonstrated, but since it is
fairly time consuming to produce graphics I have not done a lot of trying to
illustrate things which don't seem stable).

I did try to illustrate 3.4 a bit as an example - the current version of the
results are at http://www.w3.org/2001/08/mmcmn which includes sound and
images, and tries to show that ideas can be represented in several ways at
once. It probably does show that I am not a great graphic artist capable of
communicating the idea perfectly, but then we haven't managed to commmunicate
it perfectly to everyone yet so I don't feel so bad <grin/>.

cheers

Charles

  Saying this is hypocritical unless you *do* it in this very document.

  This would be the quintessential example of eating our own dog food.
