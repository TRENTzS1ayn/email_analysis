But that makes repetition, with images disabled and the alternative
content visible (which is the normal idea, longdesc on a link, title as a
popup...) then I get "Don't drop litter, Don't drop litter" - ok that may
well be useful to re-enforce the instruction not to drop rubbish  but
repetition of every idea would soon get annoying.
