Aaah, that depends on how you encode this. If you have

...don't drop litter <img src="nolitter" alt="dont drop rubbish"
longdesc="nolitterDesc" />

then that is indeed what you get. But what we are looking for is smart ways
of doing this, and it is clear that isn't the best we could do. Here are some
alternatives:

<ruby class="c:illustrate"><rb>don't drop rubbish</rb><rt><img src="image"
alt="don't drop rubbish" longdesc="nolitterDesc" /></rt><ruby>

then we have two stylesheet alternatives:
ruby.c:illustrate + rb { display:none }
or
ruby.c:illustrate + rt { display:none }

In a CSS2 capable browser (well, it only actually needs to implement
selectors + CSS 1) we get one or the other of the options. As an alternative
we could run through a proxy that strips out the version we don't want, or
provides both if we do want them.

We could use object markup and the UAAG requirement to be able to select more
than one of the alternatives.

or we could work out something better (I have spent about 10 minutes thinking
about this so I presume we can do better collectively).

cheers

  But that makes repetition, with images disabled and the alternative
  content visible (which is the normal idea, longdesc on a link, title as a
  popup...) then I get "Don't drop litter, Don't drop litter" - ok that may
  well be useful to re-enforce the instruction not to drop rubbish  but
  repetition of every idea would soon get annoying.
