I am not sure that using tools is a defining characteristic. But I think that
if we are looking for a price barrier we should set it at zero. There are a
lot of open-source solutions available, which rival commercial offerings.
What money is worth is extremely varied - in the US $300 may only buy an hour
or two of someone's time, but a person with the same knowledge and support
will be available for less than $300 a month in another country.

I agree that there is an issue of what is available in a default
configuration.

  In looking at the topic of AT it occurs to me that we might have
  different levels of AT and ability to use technology

  Perhaps we have three levels
  1 - the ability to Access using any existing tools
  2 - the ability to Access using standard browsers and moderately priced
  AT.  (less than $300 ??)
  3 - the ability to Access using browsers and AT in their default
  settings.

  (this last one is added since most people don?t know how to custom
  configure their software)
