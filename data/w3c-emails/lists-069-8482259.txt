Do we need a guideline to describe what is the 'expected' relationship, as
one switches between using various I/O devices?
Would it be useful to have a user control, such that all I/O devices relate
to current window status, and most recent event?

These could be UA issues, or possibly IG, so let me know if it should be
moved.


I've been trying to investigate whether it is possible to tab to a link and
then use mousewheel, focused on that location.
In win'98 it seems this may not be possible(the mouse position appears to be
the definition of event.srcElements generated by onmousewheel events),
whereas in winXP it may be. The current test is:
http://www.peepo.com/2k1/mousewheel/tabindex2.html

This relates to an earlier problem, why when one tabs and mouses, the mouse
is updated by the tab, but the tab is not updated by the mouse.
That is if we tab and the screen moves, the mouse continues to work wherever
we end up, whereas if we scroll, or anchor click, to a new area, tabbing
retains its 'history'.

Can some kind soul make sense of this and explain to everyone else including
me in English?
Cynthia and Jim have both helped enormously, however any errors are mine.

Thank You
