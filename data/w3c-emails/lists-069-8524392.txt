The list items are still marked up inside <li> and </li>. It may be 
inconvenient to lose the start value in no-stylesheet viewing, but 
the structure remains.

Also, could I just say here that it is high time we stopped 
pretending there are very many devices out there that cannot 
understand stylesheets? It is absurd to hamstring 95% of Web-browser 
users (it's more like 98%) because Lynx and a few non-Web devices do 
not understand CSS.

If anything, we should require that tools and devices *understand* 
CSS, not force authors to twist themselves to accommodate backward or 
maldesigned devices that don't. And this is coming from someone who 
uses Lynx for hours a day and owns a Newton. It's time to grow up a 
little. Technology marches on.
