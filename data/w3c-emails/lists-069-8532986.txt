Yes, that page was a list of the ideas we put together in a small group in a
short breakout session. If they are useful for people who are not sure where
to start then that's good going, and I agree with Joe that we could use more
expertise.

What I know comes from believing usability folks and people who teach
technical writing and writing for journalists. Although I don't think it is
"anti-writing" as Joe suggests, it certainly does put conveying information
on a higher priority than writing with style and flair. We should be
explicit about that. In the breakout session we discussed the role of art,
and agreed that it was a wider issue than just writing style, and that art
may not be completely accessible (although that doesn't seem like an excuse
not to make it accessible at all, and many museums are working on doing just
that).

Real experts in the craft of writing will recognise this information for baby
steps and will rely on their own skills, but they are few and far between. At
the moment I think we are at the stage of techniques that we can provide,
which are a clear beginning.

cheers

  guidelines, which betray an anti-*writing* as opposed to an
  anti-*text* bias. Talented, experienced, and/or professional writers,

  setting requirements and listing examples that are unrealistic and
  betray inexperience.)
