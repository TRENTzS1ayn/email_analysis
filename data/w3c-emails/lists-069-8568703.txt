We had in mind limiting this one for instructions. I think criteria for
instructions can/should be more figures.

OK let me explain that instead of being obscure.

For example: I got a visa over the internet. There were quite a few lines
and steps involved, but it saved me half a day.

It seems ridicules, that someone with cognitive disabilities should be bared
from using online services such as this because the instructions are
confusing.

If instructions are step by step, with one relative clause in each step,
with illustrations, well, it is probably accessible to anyone who could
theoretically understand the information.


 All the best,
Lisa
