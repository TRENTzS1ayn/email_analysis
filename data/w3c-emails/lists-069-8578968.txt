Hi Jonathan,

I've read your working draft of Script Techniques for WCAG 2.0 and I must
say that it was very interesting and it gave me some ideas how to improve my
pages, which are not very accessible :-(

A few unordered comments:

onfocus/onblur: These two events are widely underused on the web and these
are as you wrote great for accessibility. Keyboard navigation if often
something that the programmers do not think about.

Separation of content, style and behavior is another great tool for
accessibility. This allows the content to be the same for all targeted
platforms and it also makes the pages easier to maintain.

If it wasn't for MS behaviors being a non standard thing I would say that
they are awesome for making accessible content.

tabIndex and accessKey are two great attributes/properties and are way too
seldom used

noscript is another widely underused method. A good example is something
like this:

<script type="text/javascript">
document.write(generateMenuSystemHTML());
</script>
<noscript>
<a href="menu.html">Navigation Menu</a>
</noscript>


That's it for now.

erik
