Hello all,

I have compiled the minutes and they are available.  Note that this is the first publication of minutes from 14 November.
Notes from Tuesday, 13 November: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2001/11/13-minutes.html
Summary: Discussion of conformance
Notes from Wednesday, 14 November: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2001/11/14-minutes.html
Summary: Summations from breakout sessions afternoon before (Technique specifics, dependency tree, comprehension success criteria), Discussion with IMS, planning and next steps.

The only piece I am missing is the summation that the first group did on Wednesday morning.  Who took notes for this bit?

Thanks,
--wendy
