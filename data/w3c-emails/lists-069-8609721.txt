Hi Chas,

CSS can do it but only if there is a standard way to mark the
supplemental graphics. Right?
 When we looked at this before I thought the response was  
a) there isn't one
b) we aren't supposed to designate any classes in advance like this.

Are these still the answers?

If so ? any other ideas on how to mark the graphics.  (even proxy
servers would need to know which ones to show ? and how would they be
included but hidden? )  

Any ideas anyone?

Yes, that is the question we are now grappling with (assuming we agree
that
it is a desirable goal - that seems so, although there hasn't been any
statement from the chairs yet).

In terms of looking at CSS-capable browsers it is fairly straightforward
- we
can write stylesheets that will do the job. For browsers that are not
using
CSS I think the best options are fast becoming the use of proxy-based
systems, such as that available for tablin, although getting people to
upgrade browsers (and authoring tools for that matter) is the ideal
solution,
if not something that will happen - but that is really a whole issue on
its
own, that of "baseline capabilities".

Cheers

Charles
