Checkpoint 2.4 beta 3

For events whose deadline is set by the page author and depend on
user actions, do either of the following:

* Give users control over how long they can interact with the content.
* Give them as much time as possible.

For events that occur in real time independent of user actions, warn
the user when the event is set to expire.

If the content includes an error or warning message that will itself 
expire or disappear, give the user the ability to delay or prevent 
the EXPIRY (!) of the message itself. Systems that allow error or 
warning messages to dismiss themselves after a certain interval must 
allow the user to set that interval.



Success criteria

You will have met the requirements for cases involving user actions
if any of the following is true:

* The user can completely deactivate automatic timeouts or updating.

* The user can set the timeout to a figure up to 10 times the default
timeout period.

* The user is warned before time expires and given at least 10
seconds to extend the time available.

* The user is allowed to set how often the content is updated.

* The user is given as much time as possible.

When warning messages appear, give the user the same options as above 
if the warning message will itself expire or disappear.

In all cases, the user must be able to freeze moving text.
