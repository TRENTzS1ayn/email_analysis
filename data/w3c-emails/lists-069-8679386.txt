There are two answers to this question which emerged from today's teleconference:

1. Initially, the question of whether 80% or more of informed
   evaluators would agree, is to be decided hypothetically by the
   working group: do we think that 8 out of 10 testers familiar with
   the relevant language/format specification(s), when given the content,
   would agree on whether or not the checkpoint had been met.

2. Later, of course, the issue will be decided by assessing the
   results of usability testing, in which actual content evaluations
   will be carried out in application of the guidelines.
