Right,

The purpose of those qualifiers is just to eliminate having people fail
to agree because we picked people who don?t understand what they are
doing.  It is to make it easier to achieve the "objective" label.


This isn't something that goes into the guidelines by the way.   It is
something we use as part of our testing to see if something does go in,
or rather does go in as an objective measure or criteria.   So we
(whomever is doing the testing) will be picking the people.  We/they
just need to pick people who, if they disagree, disagree because the
criteria or whatever is ambiguous, not because they don?t understand
what the question is.

There are two answers to this question which emerged from today's
teleconference:

1. Initially, the question of whether 80% or more of informed
   evaluators would agree, is to be decided hypothetically by the
   working group: do we think that 8 out of 10 testers familiar with
   the relevant language/format specification(s), when given the
content,
   would agree on whether or not the checkpoint had been met.

2. Later, of course, the issue will be decided by assessing the
   results of usability testing, in which actual content evaluations
   will be carried out in application of the guidelines.
