I like this, with the exception of having a success criteria of "as much time
as possible" - I think that is too hard to test.

In practice we should simply set some minimum amount of time to request
further time. Joe suggests 10 seconds. I don't know what the field
requirements are but I believe there are people in this group who do - is 10
seconds about right?

Should there be a minimum amount of time that should be available for the
whole process, or for each interaction (reading a paragraph, selecting among
7 related items, ...)? This might be set based on the time being extended.

cheers

  Checkpoint 2.4 beta 3

  For events whose deadline is set by the page author and depend on
  user actions, do either of the following:

  * Give users control over how long they can interact with the content.
  * Give them as much time as possible.

  For events that occur in real time independent of user actions, warn
  the user when the event is set to expire.

  If the content includes an error or warning message that will itself
  expire or disappear, give the user the ability to delay or prevent
  the EXPIRY (!) of the message itself. Systems that allow error or
  warning messages to dismiss themselves after a certain interval must
  allow the user to set that interval.



  Success criteria

  You will have met the requirements for cases involving user actions
  if any of the following is true:

  * The user can completely deactivate automatic timeouts or updating.

  * The user can set the timeout to a figure up to 10 times the default
  timeout period.

  * The user is warned before time expires and given at least 10
  seconds to extend the time available.

  * The user is allowed to set how often the content is updated.

  * The user is given as much time as possible.

  When warning messages appear, give the user the same options as above
  if the warning message will itself expire or disappear.

  In all cases, the user must be able to freeze moving text.
