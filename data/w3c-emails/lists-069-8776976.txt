I don't think it is useful for us to do a hypothetical assessment - I would
prefer that we assume for now that we don't know, but that we don't have
sufficient grounds to accept or reject something based on how well the
requirement is specified (as opposed to whether it deals with something that
is an accessibility requirement) until we have done the testing.

  There are two answers to this question which emerged from today's teleconference:

  1. Initially, the question of whether 80% or more of informed
     evaluators would agree, is to be decided hypothetically by the
     working group: do we think that 8 out of 10 testers familiar with
     the relevant language/format specification(s), when given the content,
     would agree on whether or not the checkpoint had been met.

  2. Later, of course, the issue will be decided by assessing the
     results of usability testing, in which actual content evaluations
     will be carried out in application of the guidelines.
