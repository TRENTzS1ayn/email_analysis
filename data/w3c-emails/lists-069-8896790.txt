Thanks Jonathan,
I think that this is one of the documents included in the review paper. In
fact a lot of the wording is identical. But there are clearly checkpoint
that are currently omitted from WCAG.

If we can all help out in this, contacting local authorities/organization
and asking if guidelines exist for helping comprehension for the cognitively
disabled, that would go a long way.
