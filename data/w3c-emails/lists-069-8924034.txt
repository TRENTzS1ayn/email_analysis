As Al Gilman pointed out recently [1], the presence of a title 
attribute causes JAWS to ignore the alt attribute completely and read 
only the title. Has anyone tested to see how WindowEyes, HPR, etc. 
handle the presence of both title and alt? (We have referred to this 
behavior as a JAWS bug, but it may simply reflect the way that IE 
treats title and alt.) In practical terms, this would simply mean 
that if one is including the title attribute for a particular image, 
one should not count on users being able to hear or see what's in the 
alt attribute.
