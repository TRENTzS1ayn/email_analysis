It is a useful technique, and belongs in the technique document.

What I believe is in and I often use, is the title on anchors to provide
context or other information that is provided though presentation. Or as
WCAG puts it " content developers may specify a value of the "title"
attribute that clearly and accurately describes the target of the link".
For example, a link may be under the subheading "corporate customers". To
provide this information, and so that non corporate customers do not waist
their time following non relevant links,  add this information into the
title tag.

Try it on a screen  reader, it is great for information hiding.

The HTML techniques document does give the example of using title for
abbreviations acronyms and framesets. More interestingly it also recommends
it for tables,  to describe the nature of the table in a few words when a
caption is overkill. -  Same idea

all the best ,

Lisa
