What he said.? TITLE is a resource; we need to use it well.

And furthermore, we need the behavior defined in XHTML 2.0.

In the past there have been occasional disasters such as a screen reader
passing over link text and only using the TITLE on hyperlinks when the
TITLE is
populated.

It's going to sound complicated until we get it all spelled out, but all the
conditions of UAAG Guideline 2 apply to how to profile what of the various
information assets show when.? The language should provide the author with a
default profile, the author may revise this but what the author provides is a
default profile with a basis in declarative properties.? User policies rewrite
the profile based on the declarative properties and the user can, if they find
they need to, reprofile what shows and what remains hidden by drilling down
locally and peeking at what remains hidden.

Quote "the ALT vs. TITLE mess" unquote is on the list of ugly little nitty
gritty areas that we need to be cleaning up.? Part of the answer belongs in
the
XHTML 2.0 specification.? How it works is UAAG 1.0 plus WCAG 2.0.

XHTML 2.0 issues heap in the wai-tech-comments archives.? The current
thread on
wai-ig on how to sneak extra orientation text into a page so it is there in
aural rendering and not there in visual rendering (give or take).? All these
content control scenarios need to flow from one master policy framework.? See
