I agree.

What would you suggest as a good way to explain the difference between
"alt" and "title" on images?  "longdesc" is pretty simple to explain
("it's the url to a page with a longer description of the image"), but
what would distinguish a proper "alt" from a "title"?

I'm looking for something like:

      * Here's an image: <blah>
      * Here's what the "alt" should be
      * Here's what the "title" should be

I'd like to hear what you think and hopefully we can use that to build
consensus for inclusion.

(BTW, looking at things like XLink, I think it's very possible that we
may see "title" replacing "alt" as a generic human-readable-text
attribute in future XML development.)
