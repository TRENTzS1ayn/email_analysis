Hi,

It might be helpful to look at test cases which have been used for
researching usability of the web.  Also taking a look at the test
cases used by Neil Jakobson in his recent research on web page
accessibility might be useful.  Rather than starting from scratch,
looking at test cases used by other people could give some insight
into useful characteristics of test cases.
