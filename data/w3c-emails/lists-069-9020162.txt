And these are not really very good guidelines.

No, we need to write to spec. Faulty devices, whether they be 
Netscape 4 or some version of Jaws, must be fixed by the makers. For 
this same reason, I no longer recommend that people separate links by 
a printable character to make up for the deficiencies of old screen 
readers. I know perfectly well that not everyone can upgrade-- I ran 
entire Web sites on an old PowerMac 7100 for years. But at some point 
we have to accept that the benefits of standards-compliant handling 
outweigh all the effort expended to kludge around the bugs of 
noncompliant devices.

On any given page, either all images have titles or none should. 
Consistency is important. (I give the same advice for links-- all 
have title or none do.)

In some cases, alt and title will be the same, which is not so bad. 
In other cases, titles can be different.

This, in effect, is my advice.

Very unusual!

And best repaired by using a stylesheet:

ul { list-style-image: url(image-URL); list-style-type: disc }

>1. Use the alt attribute to describe the image (e.g.. alt="bullet")

No, alt="*" should be the only alt text ever used for bullets. I 
suppose that title="" would be appropriate here. (Blank title is as 
valid as blank alt. Absent title is slightly less deplorable than 
absent alt.)

I cannot really figure out the HTML examples given. I think it has 
something to do with

<a title="LINKTITLE"><img title="IMAGETITLE"></a>

where the question becomes "Which title prevails? Inner or outer?" 
Ideally, we should have access to both, but the inner one is clearly 
the most specific and should prevail. I have a test file that I 
experimented with, and I found that generally the innermost title 
*does* prevail.

Always use an alt!

Aha!

This is fair.

This is also fair. I would nonetheless be consistent within a page, 
and duplicate alt text into title if necessary.

Can we kill off D-links forever, please? Like longdesc on the frame 
element, they never made sense. Description of a whole page or a 
frame is pretty much irrelevant to blind users. Devices must directly 
support longdesc anyway; I tire of hacking around incompatibilities.

>2. When title= is used, screen readers often ignore the contents of alt=.

Such screen readers need to be bitch-slapped until they shape up.
