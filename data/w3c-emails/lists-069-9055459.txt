Hi
My training as a facilitator tells me that to be
successful a group needs at an absolute minimum 2
things

1. A Purpose
2. An agreed group culture ('how we agree to behave in
our interactions')

We have the first through the charter.

I don't believe we have the second.

I find myself sometimes offended by posts but unsure
how to act.

Of course, I can exercise my perogative and choose not
to follow posts by certain people, withdraw from the
group, appeal to a higher authority etc.

None of which appeal to me.

I firmly believe that as a group we need to take
responsibility for creating and looking after our own
agreed culture.

As, such I am prepared to take on the task of
facilitating the creation of an agreed culture.

I would be interested in getting feedback from people
(postitive or negative) to this idea, because it has
to have strong support to have a chance of success.

Cheers
Graham
