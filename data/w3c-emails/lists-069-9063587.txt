Aside from style issues, I'm not sure I agree with these definitions.

The idea that alt, title, and longdesc are a hierarchy of information
is, in my opinion, confusing and not to spec, specifically when talking
about the @title attribute.  @title has a specific definition in HTML,
and it's not "intermediate information" when applied to a graphic.

Apart from the style, the content of these definitions is lacking.
For example, you have redefined @alt so it's no longer "a text
equivalent" but is now "the function or purpose" in a minimal
way.  The @title is now "nice-to-know" but this gives me little idea
when to use @title and when not.  The @longdesc definition makes no
reference to the fact that, unlike the others, it's a URI -- and
what's more, "encyclopedic information" is still not quite what
longdesc is for, since it's not necessarily true that @longdesc
is everything you ever wanted to know.  For example, few people
would state that @longdesc needs to describe who snapped a picture,
with what type of camera, what software was used to process it, on
what platform, etc., but conceivably that's "encyclopedic
information."

I don't mind the informal _style_ at all but i think the specific
definitions need work, as I don't believe they're usable or useful as
a recommendation to web developers.
