The "spec" is 
<http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/global.html#adef-title> and 
says "This attribute offers advisory information about the element 
for which it is set." In other words, anything goes.

Welcome to reality. That is consistent with all advice on the use of 
alt. longdesc is also a text equivalent. So how would *you* 
differentiate them?

That was my one and only attempt to define these terms. I give up. 
I'll leave the task in the evidently-more-capable hands of others.
