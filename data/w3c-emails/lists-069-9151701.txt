hello,

Jason and I discussed success criteria for an afternoon while I was in Australia last month.  The purpose was to begin thinking about which success criteria were technology-specific and which were "core" - in terms of the Core Techniques for WCAG 1.0 [1] where there are examples and tests that are not technology-specific.

We also thought about how the Gateway to Techniques for WCAG 2.0 might look.  Refer to the Gateway for WCAG 1.0 [2].  This draft is a bit of a combination of them both, but without all the content.

This draft [3] is really rough, and really no more than a collection of our notes.  It's not formatted, has no date, status, etc.  It's more just to publish our initial thoughts and perhaps stimulate some discussion or work on the various areas.  Also, it's another chance for me to mess with XSLT. <grin/>

Please send comments to the list.  If you would like to volunteer to begin collating this information please let me know.  Since this document is generated using XSLT, if someone wanted to fill in information, it would be a matter of editing the XSLT. [4].  There is quite a lot of information in the various drafts that we have that could be pointed to.  This was a quick first pass.

Thanks,
--wendy
