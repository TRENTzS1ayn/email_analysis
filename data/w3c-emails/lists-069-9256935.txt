If there is no Title certainly, but if there's a TITLE attribute that
will be shown instead.

Netscape Navigator 4 had the same behaviour, Mozilla (last time I checked
0.9.5) completely hides the ALT information if the image is displayed -
this is certainly a bug in Mozilla, and I believe that it should show it
quickly and availably on tooltip if there's no title since I often don't
understand some images, and quick access to something that would aid my
understanding is very useful to me.  Most people appear to disagree with
me though, and believe it should _not_ be shown in an attempt to educate
people about the use of title.

Jim.
