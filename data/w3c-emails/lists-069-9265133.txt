Certainly perhaps as default, but I certainly think there's nothing wrong
with a user agent to display more than one of them at once, a users
usability of images may be limited (perhaps by colour blindness, or
cognitively) but still can get good value out of some images, so wants
the best of both worlds, ALT displayed for the difficult images, but the
images displayed for those that are there - it's a UA issue rather than
an authoring one though.
