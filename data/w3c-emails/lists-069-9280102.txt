Well, this is really a reaction to broken implementation in browsers, 
though admittedly I do not know how to handle every combination of 
bounding-box size, alt-text length, and font choices.

My own advice (copied from somewhere else, I forget where) is to 
limit alts to 1K in length.

Or in status-line displays (iCab) or on special screens (titles on 
links only in Lynx).

This again is broken device behaviour. alt and title must both be 
available to the user if present. (In a graphical browser where the 
image actually successfully loads, alt should not be available.)

Let's be very careful about saying "all."

No one using actual longdescs (not that there are many of them) 
explains every colour of every object. How do you do that with a 
photograph? How about a set of 50 photographs?

Also, there is a consistent misunderstanding of colourblindness. The 
fact that a specific colour is seen as something different by a 
colourblind person is neither here nor there in accessibility. The 
issue is *confusing* the object with that colour with something else. 
I suppose a photograph of a traffic light would be an example of 
this, but such examples are rare if not contrived.

Such behaviour is counter to the spec and should be discouraged. I 
think they fixed it in Windows IE 5 and later anyway. Netscape 4 
remains broken in an unending list of ways.

This is certainly the *correct* behaviour in *all* visual browsers. 
alt is an *alternative*. Just as summary on table should never be 
presented visually, alt should never be presented visually if the img 
or area is actually present.
