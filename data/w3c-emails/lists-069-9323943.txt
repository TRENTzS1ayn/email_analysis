These groups should use title. alt should remain a replacement.

alt should remain a replacement. These highly unusual cases should 
not be accommodated by altering the default interpretation of an 
image *alternative* text. These groups-- and only a minority of 
low-vision or cognitively-disabled people are affected-- can and 
should rely on title.

Also, you're forgetting that attempting to simultaneously display an 
image and an alt text of up to 1K characters in length will destroy 
page layout. Not only will designers actively rebel, destroying page 
layout makes pages hard to understand, particularly for... low-vision 
and cognitively-disabled people.

Every conceivable function should not be collapsed on one text 
equivalent when we've got three to work with.
