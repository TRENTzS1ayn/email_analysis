Thank you, Adam, for starting this thread this way.  This is a model we
should
all aspire to follow.

[CS] This is user-configurable, at least in Internet Explorer.  On the
Advanced tab in Internet Options, check the "Always expand ALT text for
images" checkbox under accessibility and uncheck "show pictures" under
multimedia.  The image placeholders will be expanded to fit the ALT
text.

AG:: This discussion puts the priorities backward.  Yes, the ALT should
be
succinct.  But it should also be sufficient.  Any user agent that
doesn't
allow
one to display the whole ALT instead of just what fits in the layout is
broken,
per the User Agent guidelines.

Succinctness is of value, here, to aural and to visual users.  One
should also
think about front-loading, so that in the case that the reserved layout
region
crops the ALT, the part that shows is usually sufficient to get the
general
idea.

Do screen readers read the cropped ALT display or the ALT as in the
source
code?  How does this work in screen reader scenarios where there is a
visual
layout on the screen and an aural readout based on how the user drives
the
reading cursor around?

[CS] There's another issue with the length of both ALT and TITLE.  As
attributes, they can't have line-breaks in them.  Unless he has a tool
doing a line-wrapped view of the alt-text, this places a practical limit
on the length of ALT or TITLE text that an author can reasonably
maintain.  In my experience, that practical limit is somewhere around 10
words (2 or 3 inches of screen real-estate when viewing the HTML).

The logical model in HTML 4 is not adequate.  This is written up at

 behavior matters (why is a TITLE not a title?)

The discussion that you offered used format-neutral language in part,
but the
discussion is specific to HTML 4.

In SVG we simplified things to a 'title' and a 'desc' which are both
syntactically sub-elements but are neither one normally shown and both
function
as attributes, giving properties to the 'g' object that they are in.
Nowever
the specification language describing this 'title' property is the same
ambiguous "advisory information" language as in HTML 4 which does not
disambiguate a) something that could replace the object and b)
supplementary
information that depends on the prior comprehension of the object.

So this is on the list of problems for possible reform in XHTML 2.0.
Because
of the popularity of the toolTip or onMouseOver behavior, it seems to
make
sense to preserve the capabilty to put in a construct for amplifying
remarks
that will flash at you or be peekable on command.  My current leaning,
however,
is to do here what I have been trying to get people to do with CAPTION
and
SUMMARY in TABLEs in HTML.  That is to say define the SUMMARY as
supplementary
to the CAPTION and recommend that in cases where the SUMMARY is to be
displayed, to display the CAPTION, if any, first.  That would give
authors a
target to shoot at that they can deal with.

Similarly, here, for navigation purposes we want for any notable thing
in the
navigation space we want a title which is a fit standalone replacement
for
that
thing.  What you would put in a table of contents.  But based on the
behavior
of the legacy HTML binding to behavior, the TITLE attribute is authored
as
supplementary, not titular.  Maybe this means we add ALT to lots of
things. 
This is eating my words, but I am ready to learn.  From a PF
perspective, we
should come up with a "highest and best" logical model which covers
alternative
behaviors in different delivery contexts, and figure out a migration
path from
what we have in HTML and browsers today to XHTML 2.0 and UAAG 1.0
behavior in
the future.

For the longer descriptions, and for your delectations in writing what
you are
working on, please also read through the case study at

 affective messaging and effective mode-crossing
