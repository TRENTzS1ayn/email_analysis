Title simply isn't sufficient to bring understanding, it's a title, it's
not a replacement, there's nothing wrong with displaying "alternative" and
"actual" content at once, what is surely important to a designer is that
their page is understood, the only way some users will understand is if
they can display alternative and actual at once.

What's the default interpretation, my interpretation is ALT is the
alternative if the image is not usable by the user, if that's because this
image happens to rely on red/green colour or because it relies on some
concept that a cognitive disability may not grasp readily, or ... any
other failure of the image as content.  Alternative does not mean that
only one could be displayed, it suggests only one could be understood.

They certainly cannot rely on title, otherwise TITLE and ALT would be
redundant we could just use one.

Will it?  My implementations certainly don't destory page layout and can
be easily understood by me, I can't understand why you're arguing that a
user should not be able to display more than one of the alternatives at
once, it is of course a UA issue, but it's not one that's a problem, and
it's not one that designers have ever had a problem with, with both NN4
and IE4 having done it.

Yep, but they all have distinct meanings and you can't change the meaning
of title for some without making designers duplicate ALT and TITLE in any
case (which is clearly wrong.)
