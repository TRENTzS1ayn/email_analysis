This is somewhat circular.

Something that is not objective is not testable.  At least not testable
fairly.

But I agree that we leave defining "objective" to dictionaries and just
work on the testability of our guidelines / checkpoints / success
criteria.

Right. And I was under the impression that what we actually agreed to
was
that requirements had to be testable. So it seems we are on the right
track.
