This as true of metaphor as it is of tone.

Communication is very much more difficult and diverse than the current rather 
tecchie version w3c/wai supports. I find it impossible to contribute to eo 
documents, they support a heirarchic and business approach, which I believe 
is antithetical to the meaning of accessibility. It would appear to exclude 
all but the 'power brokers'. For me this is merely an indication of how 
incapable our efforts are of appealing to the masses, our end users, and an 
attempt at a rationalisation.
