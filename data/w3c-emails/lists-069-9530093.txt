WCAG working group -- whose job is it to respond to these?  I have a
response below, which I have written and sent to you, but not to the
original querent, since I'm not sure what our protocol is on responding.

I'm not sure I understand the purpose of such a page, though; for what
is it intended?  Is this to put a silver box with a blue border on
the page?  If so -- is there any particular meaning associated with
it, or is it just a blue box of a particular size?

That's incorrect, as a default font is always defined in CSS, and
should be based upon the user's default settings.  Is there some reason
the size of the box should not be relative to the rest of the presentation?
The user may have chosen, for example, to increase the font size to some
large number.

What kind of application do you envision in which the exact size is
necessary and cannot be provided in percentages or em units?

This isn't necessarily true -- there are many things you can do within
the context of the specifications which may lead to accessibility
errors.  They are allowable via the spec (CSS, XHTML, whatever) but
they can produce inaccessibility for many users.

However, this may be a point in which the techniques should be
clarified -- "pt" or "cm" should be acceptable within certain media
types (for example, setting a left page margin to 2 cm in print
media).  This is implied in the techniques document for CSS at
http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-CSS-TECHS/#units

The problem is that a desire to "get font size *right*" implies a desire
to override the user's preference for default font size. What makes you
think that "smaller" or "bigger" are device-dependent?  Font values of
"smaller" or "bigger" do not limit the portability of a page; they
encourage it, more than explicit, fixed font sizes set with "pt".

Why do you think it should be excised?  Without such a guideline, users
with visual disabililties who need to change their default font sizes may
not be able to do so.
