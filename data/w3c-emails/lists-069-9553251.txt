All.

What are your views on the use of automatically refreshing frames/pages?

Many blind users of screen readers have difficulty with sites where there
are reloadable 
frames that refresh the pages every minute (literally).  This is especially
frustrating with eCommerce and Online shopping sites.

"It just makes it a bit hard when it's always placing you at the top of the
page again."
This happens because when the page is refreshed, the screen reader places
you at the top of the page as it normally would when you browse to the page
for the first time.

What are your current views on site features such as this?

Does anyone know how to prevent the browser from reloading automatically, or
does anyone know how to cause JAWS to change the way it behaves when a page
is reloaded so that the user is not pushed to the top every time.

I know that we have to push user agent manufacturers, adaptive technology
manufacturers and web developers to all comply.  However, the status for
many users NOW is a status of inaccessibility for more reasons than just
non-compliant web content.

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

Mat.
