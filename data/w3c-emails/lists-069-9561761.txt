Hi. Well there is checkpoint 7.4?Until user agents provide the ability to
stop the refresh, do not create periodically auto-refreshing pages.

I actually think it is nice to be able to avoid auto-refresh. So I use Lynx
if I find a page which causes problems (and even as a visual user theer are
times when I ahve problems) since it waits for me to refresh the page.

Actually what I would like is a simple option to have the page only refresh
manually. Should be simple XSLT or proxy filter...

  What are your views on the use of automatically refreshing frames/pages?

  Many blind users of screen readers have difficulty with sites where there
  are reloadable
  frames that refresh the pages every minute (literally).  This is especially
  frustrating with eCommerce and Online shopping sites.

  "It just makes it a bit hard when it's always placing you at the top of the
  page again."
  This happens because when the page is refreshed, the screen reader places
  you at the top of the page as it normally would when you browse to the page
  for the first time.

  What are your current views on site features such as this?

  Does anyone know how to prevent the browser from reloading automatically, or
  does anyone know how to cause JAWS to change the way it behaves when a page
  is reloaded so that the user is not pushed to the top every time.

  I know that we have to push user agent manufacturers, adaptive technology
  manufacturers and web developers to all comply.  However, the status for
  many users NOW is a status of inaccessibility for more reasons than just
  non-compliant web content.

  Any thoughts would be appreciated.

  Mat.
