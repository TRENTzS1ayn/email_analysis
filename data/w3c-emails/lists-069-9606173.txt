I think it may be a good idea to just collect these "other thoughts" for
now and perhaps we can use them in a section of the guidelines or
techniques doc or somewhere to create "additional things to consider"
list.


As to being normative but not checkpoints.  I'm not sure what that
means.  It is an interesting thought.  At first it seemed like
everything normative needed to be checkable --  but thinking further it
would seem that only those things required for conformance would need to
be testable checkpoints.     Maybe we can have normative suggestions
that are not required.  

Hmmmmmmmm
