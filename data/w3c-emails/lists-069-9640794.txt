Shouldn't it be:

<style type="text/css">
  .icon { width: 20pt; height: 20pt }
</style>
...
? <object class="icon" data="mm_tool-svg" type="image/svg+xml">
? ? <object class="icon" data="mm_tool-raster" type="image/png">
? ? ? A multimedia tool
? ? </object>
? </object>

(NOTE that I included CSS class for PNG image inside)
That should scale better.  :-)

Aren't width="20" and height="15" depreciated in XHTML?
Of course you can use them, but using CSS properties instead of width and 
height attributes is much better practice, IMO.
As you define class "icon" for SVG picture, I guess you can re-use it for PNG 
as well.

Please let me know if such re-written example scales better for you.
(BTW: what is your testing environment? Opera? )
