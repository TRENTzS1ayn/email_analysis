This Thursday's meeting will be held on Thursday at the usual time
(2100 UTC, 4 PM US Eastern etc.) on +1-617-252-1038. The agenda is as
follows:

1. Success criteria (continuing last week's discussion), starting with
   checkpoint 2.2.

2. Face to face meetings: the Education and Outreach working group has
   requested a joint meeting with WCAG at the CSUN conference in March
   next year. There are issues of schedule to be considered. Also,
   where and when should we meet after CSUN?
