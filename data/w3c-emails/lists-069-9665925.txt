  This Thursday's meeting will be held on Thursday at the usual time
  (2100 UTC, 4 PM US Eastern etc.) on +1-617-252-1038. The agenda is as
  follows:

  1. Success criteria (continuing last week's discussion), starting with
     checkpoint 2.2.

  2. Face to face meetings: the Education and Outreach working group has
     requested a joint meeting with WCAG at the CSUN conference in March
     next year. There are issues of schedule to be considered. Also,
     where and when should we meet after CSUN?
