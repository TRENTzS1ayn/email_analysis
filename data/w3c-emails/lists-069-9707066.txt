All.

According to WCAG 1.0, labels for form controls should appear immediatly
before the control (or above it if there is only one control on the line).
This usually means the label should appear just to the left of the control.

This is fine for text entry fields and boxes and pull-down menus.  However,
for checkboxes and radio buttons, you often want to place the label to the
right of the checkbox or radio button.  Does doing this violate the
guideline?

What are the current views of people on this issue.
