Hi Jonathan,

I believe that this is still a bit of an open question about what would be
best (it certainly is a good one). Amaya has a tree-based navigation system
that should apply to SVG eleents but I haven't played with it for a while. I
willl have a go at it this weekend and see what I find out. (there are also
commands for scrolling the browser - I am not sure how this works in other
SVG browsers. You might like to ask on the www-svg list).

cheers

Charles

  Has this been implemented?
  ie how one would navigate and select via the keyboard?

  If not and assuming SVG became popular, keyboard users become yet more
  disadvantaged...
