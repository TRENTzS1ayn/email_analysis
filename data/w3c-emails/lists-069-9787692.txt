I do wish we could find a way to phrase this that separates the appearance on 
the page from the way the information is presented to or by the screen reader. 
For instance, in PDF, I can place the label before the radio button in the 
structure tree, even though the checkbox is to the left of the label. I 
realize that mark-up languages may not have this flexibility.
