I believe screen readers expect to find and look for the prompts for radio
buttons and checkboxes to the right of the controls. The assistive
technology when speaking in "forms  mode" decides how it is going to speak
the gathered information. With a check box and the "prompt" to the right of
the checkbox:

HPR: prompt checked
JFW: prompt Check Box Checked
Window-Eyes: Check Box Checked prompt.

Window-Eyes is not speaking it that way because the prompt is on the right;
they treat all controls the same way,

Window-Eyes: Edit Box prompt

When the "prompt" is to the left of the INPUT of type text.

This is also the way these three AT's speak form elements when the LABEL
element is used with the for attribute.

I do wish we could find a way to phrase this that separates the appearance
on
the page from the way the information is presented to or by the screen
reader.
For instance, in PDF, I can place the label before the radio button in the
structure tree, even though the checkbox is to the left of the label. I
realize that mark-up languages may not have this flexibility.
