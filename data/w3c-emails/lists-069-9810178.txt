Well, PDF is a markup language. Some others have the same flexibility, some
do not.

We have a technique for doing this in HTML, using the label element. It
relies on the manufacturers implementing the specifications - otherwise we
have to guess what they will implement and try to code that instead, which
leads to a mess.

If the group could decide that user agents now associate labels with form
controls, the checkpoint would no longer be applicable anyway. Do we have
some data and a way of determining how to make the decision?

cheers

  the page from the way the information is presented to or by the screen reader.
  For instance, in PDF, I can place the label before the radio button in the
  structure tree, even though the checkbox is to the left of the label. I
  realize that mark-up languages may not have this flexibility.
