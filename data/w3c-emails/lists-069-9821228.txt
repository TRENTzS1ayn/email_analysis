Well, if User agents can associate labels with form controls the checkpoint
is not applicable anymore. Otherwise yes, the checkpoint says 'label before
control', so not doing that violates it.

  pack. Radio button unchecked. 2 packs" etc.

  All.

  According to WCAG 1.0, labels for form controls should appear immediatly
  before the control (or above it if there is only one control on the
  line).
  This usually means the label should appear just to the left of the
  control.

  This is fine for text entry fields and boxes and pull-down menus.
  However,
  for checkboxes and radio buttons, you often want to place the label to
  the
  right of the checkbox or radio button.  Does doing this violate the
  guideline?

  What are the current views of people on this issue.
