No, the reason that I scaled it based on the font size is that for icons the
font size that someone chooses is a useful baseline for working out sizes. I
am currently working in the AU group on icons, and it seems that one of the
members of the group uses quite a small text size, or uses small icons. I
prefer the icons larger, but if I magnify my text I want to magnify icons to
match, where possible.

(The example I used assumes that the pg won't scale very well but the SVG
will - and assumes that PNG and Gif images will also be deprecated in favour
of SVG in the real world - I suspect that won't be completely true in teh
next few months though.)

Cheers

  |     </object>
  |

  Shouldn't it be:

  <style type="text/css">
    .icon { width: 20pt; height: 20pt }
  </style>
  ...
  ? <object class="icon" data="mm_tool-svg" type="image/svg+xml">
  ? ? <object class="icon" data="mm_tool-raster" type="image/png">
  ? ? ? A multimedia tool
  ? ? </object>
  ? </object>

  (NOTE that I included CSS class for PNG image inside)
  That should scale better.  :-)

  Aren't width="20" and height="15" depreciated in XHTML?
  Of course you can use them, but using CSS properties instead of width and
  height attributes is much better practice, IMO.
  As you define class "icon" for SVG picture, I guess you can re-use it for PNG
  as well.

  Please let me know if such re-written example scales better for you.
  (BTW: what is your testing environment? Opera? )

  |
  |     .icon { width: 2 em ; height 1.5 em }
