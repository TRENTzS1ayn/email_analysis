I see.
Problem is value of 1em if none of fonts installed (or default font is 
terribly broken, which happens quite often, especially in bad Linux 
installations)
I also agree that my solution is also not perfect - authors should probably 
use  
<style type="text/css">
  .icon { width: 30mm; height: 30mm }
</style>

Problem with measurement in 'mm' or 'cm' ('inch') that most computer-based 
devices have problems with correct settings of dpi (and determining screen 
size)
As far as I know, neither Macintosh (Mac OS) nor MS Windows can report 
correct dpi settings and real screen size (in cm/mm)
Recent XFree86 builds (say, releases after XF 4.1.0 ~ spring 2001) can 
auto-detect dpi and screen size using (I guess) VESA extensions - but not for 
all cards.
Despite this fact, Mozilla/Linux and Opera/Linux do not respect correct dpi 
settings - so I hardly believe common acceptance of such "broken" browsers 
and platforms (hardware base+operating sustem) helps to promote really 
device-independent, layout-based web designs. :-((

I guess you can do that via custom CSS stylesheet, no?
You can define custom CSS like:
  
  p  { font-size: 150% !important }
  object { width: 150%  !important ;  height: 150%  !important  }
  img { width: 150%  !important ;  height: 150%  !important  }

I am not sure which browsers will support this correctly.
But most likely recent builds of Mozilla should support this, as well as 
Konqueror.
If you have some testcase to try (1K-2K in size), I can make experiment with 
it.

Besides, I think you can do such magnification dynamically - via DOM/CSS 
cssRules methods.
I guess you can "scan" existing CSS stylesheet, search for 'font-size', 
'line-height', 'width', 'height' properties and *increase* them via 
JavaScript or another scripting method.
Galeon (based on Mozilla, http://galeon.sourceforge.net) supports "JavaScript 
bookmarks", so you can call such "magnification* method via Bookmark Toolbar 
(very convinient, IMO)

ah, such an optimistic view! :-))
I wish that was true - but IMO we are 5-8 years from that time.
Despite existance of PNG for several years already - most web sites use GIF.
And, number of 1x1 "transparent" gifs on real-world websites is enermous, and 
it doesn't decrease - in particular because *leading vendors of authoring 
tools* support such practice and auto-generate code with 1x1 gifs.
And this is not only Microsoft/FrontPage to blaim here - IBM, Macromedia, 
Adobe - all they are guilty...
