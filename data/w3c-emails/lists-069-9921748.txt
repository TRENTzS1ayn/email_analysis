I agree to the participation criteria (4 hours minimum per week, providing
deliverables in a timely fashion, phone meetings. - my only concern is face
to face meetings. I live in NC and I'm not sure where these meetings are
held. If there is alot of travel involved I may not be able to afford it.
I'm also unsure of the time frame involved. The charter mentions that it is
18 months thru May 2002. Would I be able to join now or need to wait until
the next 18 months?) Charter dated 2000/11/27.

Additional Info:
I am the lead content developer at my company and develop content daily,
maintain standards for my team and follow W3C, WAI, and section 508
standards closely. I push accessibiltity issues  when sites are being
engineered to make them as user friendly as possible while having cutting
edge designs and graphics. I work extensively on goverment sites. www.ed.gov
<http://www.ed.gov>  and www.cbfisap.sfa.ed.gov
<http://www.cbfisap.sfa.ed.gov>  are two sites I've worked on recently. I
feel that I could contribute to this group since I work fulltime as a
developer. Currently an issue that I found while developing the FISAP site,
and worked through with various individuals in the forum, is going into the
2.0 HTML Techniques. I also feel that I can benefit from the group by
knowing what the leading issues, concerns and solutions are.
 
Thank you for your consideration,
