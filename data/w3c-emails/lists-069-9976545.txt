I think the wording in version 1 does require the labels to follow the
controls. I don't know what is best, but if we can establish that the label
element works well enough we can simply publish that information and point
out that therefore the checkpoint is no longer applicable in 1.0

I would note that the requirement to position the name t the right breaks
i18n requirements anyway...

cheers

  I think we need to separate this into two questions.

  1)  what does WCAG 1.0 actually say.

  2)  what should it (or WCAG 2.0) say.


  I think that 2.0 should NOT require radio buttons be to the right.  This
  is not according to convention -- and often won?t work well visually.

  1.0 should not require it -- but the wording may imply that.  If so we
  should post a note that the position rule is not to apply to radio
  buttons or checkboxes as a requirement for compliance.
