Just looked at  the guidelines for autism from David Potter of the UK National Autistic Society . It is a short document, but hear is what I found us to be missing, or was well done by them: ..



use clear and simple language, avoiding metaphorical language which may be understood literally by people with autism.  If you do use metaphor or irony or another style which may be misunderstood, consider adding an explanatory note.  This is done well by the author of the satirical article "Institute for the Study of the Neurologically Typical", who has added a note to explain the humour for people who might read it literally.  This is just the same principle as adding an ALT tag to an image so that people who cannot see the image do not miss out on the information it contains.

      
?      Many people with autism and Asperger syndrome find the Internet an invaluable medium for building relationships and sharing information with others. Therefore any website designed for this user group based on the SPELL principles should aim to introduce visitors to the wider Internet community by means of links (in the WWW sense) and textual references to other on-line sources of information.

Web developers, however, have a responsibility to vet websites for suitability before creating a link to them.  Web users with autism may be less able to gauge the reliability or appropriateness of information on the Web.




Hmmmm......
That is an interesting debate

All the best,
