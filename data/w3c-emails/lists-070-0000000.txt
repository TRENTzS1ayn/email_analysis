I think it's not just the name on the list that's all that important,
but it is important to recognize that many of us are volunteering our
time (and our expenses) to participate, too.  Those of us who are
active -- and I'm not saying I am or am not, only questioning how
the rules are applied -- should at least receive recognition.

I'm more concerned that the W3C procedures don't seem to be followed
except in part.  This leads me to some confusion at to how exactly
the working group is being run, and whether or not that will be a
barrier to getting more and/or more-interested people involved.

Please keep in mind that the question of "who is on the list" was
not raised by anyone wanting to be on a list, but rather by the
working group chairs publishing -- for whatever reason -- a list
of "members in good standing."

PS:  I currently have an action item pending, and I was planning to
      take time out of my writing schedule this week and get it off
      my plate.  However, as I am not a member of this working group,
      according to the official record, I am not sure why I should
      take the time to do so.  No, I am not here purely for the
      public recognition, but on the other hand, if I'm told I am
      not "in good standing" -- then why am I spending any time on
      this?
