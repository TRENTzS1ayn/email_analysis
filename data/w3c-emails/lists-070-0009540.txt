I am a disabled user who must utilize special accessories to operate my PC. 
My reason for joining The Group was to learn about and possibly contribute 
toward the formation of useful guidelines regarding accessibility issues on 
the Web. I guess that I'm not in good standing because I have not attended 
any online meetings, face-to-face sessions or meetings. Hopefully, I be able 
to attend in the future.

I am not a Web scholar or designer, but I did submit a webpage for Web 
Validation last year located at: 
http://geocities.com/gwendolyn_lane/LeverLiftStory_Photopage.html. It is slow 
and somehow duplicated itself and definitely not up to your standards. 
Nonetheless, I enjoyed building it. And, despite the fact that now (as 
opposed to those 1986 photos) I am severely crippled, and wheelchairbound, I 
am still able to "soar like an eagle" just about anywhere on the WWW.

So, thank you Active Participants for helping me understand some of the 
complicated steps involved in making the Web more accessible for all of us.

With Great Appreciation,
Gwendolyn
