Hi,
?
I have tried to step out of this conversation and see the various points
of view, hoping to be persuaded ; )
?
However, nothing I have read has convinced me that having a navigational
bar that consists of images breaks level AA or level AAA.
?
I do not really wish to argue the point. However I think that this is
one major fault with the way accessibility is currently dealt with: how
can we expect developers and project managers to implement our
guidelines properly, when we can't even agree as to whether a certain
design breaks a certain guideline?
?
Cheers,
Gian
