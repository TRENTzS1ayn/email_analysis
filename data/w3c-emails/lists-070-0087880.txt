Subject: Agenda

Thursday, 24 January, 2100 UTC (4 PM US Eastern, 10 PM France, 8 AM
Eastern Australia, etc.) on the W3C/MIT Longfellow bridge:
+1-617-252-1038

Agenda

1. The requirements document - any controversial issues to discuss or
   queries regarding changes that have been proposed? We aim to
   publish the revised text relatively soon, preferably during the
   next week.

2. Success criteria (checkpoint 3.1 onwards), and the action items
   that were assigned last week. Note that many of these action items
   have been completed, and the results summarized to the list: see
   the mailing list archive for details.

Participants in the teleconference are also welcome to raise any
process-related concerns regarding membership in good standing or
other issues affecting the working group.
