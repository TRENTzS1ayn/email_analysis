I think ugly was an unfortunate phrase, but scaled images, are less
readable, and understandable than unscaled ones, scaled text doesn't
suffer the problems, so if you're using text it makes sense to only use
text and not images, it is an accessibility point.

Images in text won't make a site inaccessible (any more than any other
single fragment, accessibility is access to content.) however text in
images will make that portion of the content less accessible than just
using text.

Jim.
