CSS Selectors Test Suite Announced

   17 January 2002: The CSS Working Group is pleased to announce the
   first release of the "CSS Selectors Test Suite" written by Daniel
   Glazman (Netscape/AOL), Ian Hickson, and Tantek ?elik (Microsoft)
   for "Selectors" and the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) language Levels
   2 and 3. Ian Hickson developed variants for all kinds of XML and HTML
   in a format invented by Tantek ?elik. The original CSS1 Test Suite
   has been converted to the new format. 'object' elements allow the same
   tests to be used in different test suites. The Working Group welcomes
   comments. Visit the CSS home page.
