see checkpoint 3.2: When an appropriate markup language exists, use markup
rather than images to convey information.

and the discussion recently, and the discussion on the topic in the archives
for the end of 2000 - there are a numbner of threads there that are relevant.

If a navigation bar consists of *images of text* then I think it breaks that
checkpoint. If it ha  images with it, then I think it doesn't, and in
addition it helps fulfill other checkpoints I think are important.

As Kynn has pointed out, a page that has a text version (in the rendered
content of the page) of text that is also provided in images doesn't break
the spirit of the checkpoint, but might break the letter...

Debating the points is important if we are going to produce a specification,
and not just be a question-and-answer help list (there is a place for that,
but I don't believe that is what WCAG is chartered to do).

just a thought.

     ?Hi,

     However, nothing I have read has convinced me that having a
     navigational bar that consists of images breaks level AA or level
     AAA.
