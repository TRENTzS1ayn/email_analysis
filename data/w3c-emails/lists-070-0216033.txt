8. Text in images - clarification of checkpoint 3.1. 
Added: 3 January 2001 
Type: Clarification 
Refers to: Checkpoint 3.1 in 5 May 1999 version. 
Description (and correction). Checkpoint 3.1 should be reworded to read, "When an appropriate markup language exists and is supported, use markup rather than raster-based images to convey information. [Priority 2] 
For example, when supported, use SVG to create graphics, MathML to mark up mathematical equations, and CSS for text-oriented special effects. Avoid where possible using raster-based images to represent text -- use text and style sheets. Raster-based formats such as .gif and .jpeg paint the text as a series of pixels. When magnified the text becomes distorted. The ability to magnify text is critical for user with low vision.
You may use text in images when: 
the text does not convey its literal meaning but has a more graphical function, such as a logo and 
the effect can not be achieved with CSS and 
you have provided a text equivalent for the image. 
Refer also to Guideline 1, Guideline 6 and Guideline 11.

Does this help any?
