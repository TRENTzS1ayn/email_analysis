The success criteria for this checkpoint come from the XML Accessibility Guidelines (XAG) [1].
This point in particular has been edited in their most recent draft to read, "3.4 Use a device-independent interaction and events model / module. " and "3.5 Allow for user control of interaction timing - rate of change, external events triggering document changes, etc. "

Perhaps the best way to move forward on this checkpoint, is to make sure that the checkpoints in XAG are testable and then refer to them.  If not, we can work with PF to tighten up their spec.
