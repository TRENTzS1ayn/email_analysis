Checkpoint 2.2 again calls up the reliance on scripting with the
"rollover and popup menu" effects, yet there isn't an accessible
version of a popup menu in the techniques document (or in existence it
would seem.)  I don't think a popup menu can be mentioned without a
technique on how to create one - which would need some sort of
consensus on whether script that will be inaccessible to some be used
so long as those users are still able to access the content by
disabling scripting support.

For example, I understand
http://jibbering.com/accessibility/menu.html doesn't work with Jaws in
certain modes or with "ignore colours suggested by webpage" in the
browser, yet there's no way I can see of making it work in those
situations, and they certainly can't be detected.

Checkpoint 2.3 examples seem to be wholly UA issues, are there any
more authoring informative examples that could be used?

If I use scripting to add navigation mechanims or increase
usability/accessibility for mouse users, using "device independant
event handlers"(Checkpoint 2.5) isn't appropriate IMO I'm giving
something extra to mouse users, or keyboard users, (or perhaps in
other enviroments with other events helping other groups, such as
onmousewheel which is even more specific.) 2.5 encourages (forces?) me
to create a 1 size fits all approach rather than letting me tailor my
response to the device itself.

Checkpoint 2.7 "where possible, the user is allowed to select from a
list of options rather than generate text. "  I would prefer "where
possible, the user is allowed to select from a list of options
_aswell as_ generate text."  Since lists are also not always
easy to use (especially with a reasonable number of options.) and also
lists so often do not include what I need to respond (perhaps due to
internationalisation issues or similar not realising my title, or country
is an option.)

Jim.
