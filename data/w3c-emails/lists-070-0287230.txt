If you ask which sections I would like to work on, can you please send me a
list of the sections that require work so I can choose which ones I may be
best fit for?

If it is more open ended, I would like to write something concerned with
this thread.  My concern is the interpretation of what is A, AA, and AAA
compliant.  I am quite concerned that the novice, new to WAI, or with some
passion or interest, wants to embrace it's best of practice, goes and looks
at all the sites that are strongly associated with the W3C WAI movement, and
forms an observation from close discernment which is not the "Best of
Practice".  Often this alienates good people, and we need to be rigorous and
disciplined enough to be able to show best of practice in our own work, and
also to be able to show the huge business advantages from doing so.

I am willing to write clarifying documentation on this, test suites,
examples, whatever, but most of all, it may be more important, at this
stage, to be concentrating on what the priority work at hand is, so I leave
it to you and Charles to make suggestions as to what the priorities are, and
what they need?
