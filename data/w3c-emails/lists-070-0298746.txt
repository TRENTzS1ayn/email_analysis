I think this is much better, much clearer, as we need to expand these
checkpoints in some for of documentation to show; clarification, reason,
rationalisation and example.

I also feel we need to show not to be discouraging the use of appropriate
graphics and multimedia, but to be encouraging using SVG and other
appropriate tools.

Please note that the following appears in the errata for WCAG 1.0:

8. Text in images - clarification of checkpoint 3.1.
Added: 3 January 2001
Type: Clarification
Refers to: Checkpoint 3.1 in 5 May 1999 version.
Description (and correction). Checkpoint 3.1 should be reworded to read,
"When an appropriate markup language exists and is supported, use markup
rather than raster-based images to convey information. [Priority 2]
For example, when supported, use SVG to create graphics, MathML to mark up
mathematical equations, and CSS for text-oriented special effects. Avoid
where possible using raster-based images to represent text -- use text and
style sheets. Raster-based formats such as .gif and .jpeg paint the text as
a series of pixels. When magnified the text becomes distorted. The ability
to magnify text is critical for user with low vision.
You may use text in images when:
the text does not convey its literal meaning but has a more graphical
function, such as a logo and
the effect can not be achieved with CSS and
you have provided a text equivalent for the image.
Refer also to Guideline 1, Guideline 6 and Guideline 11.

Does this help any?
