Geoff asked "can you please send me a list of the sections that require work so I can choose which ones I may be best fit for?"  Others might be asking themselves the same question.  Here is my quick response of what needs work.  I haven't sent this by Gregg and Jason first, so they might have a slightly different opinion, but here is my point of view.

1. 
In your response you mention clarifying A, AA, and AAA. However, the group has not decided that we will use the same conformance scheme in WCAG 2.0 that we developed in WCAG 1.0. Therefore, I'm not sure what there is to write, unless you are interested in working on a FAQ for WCAG 1.0.

If you are interested in recent discussions about conformance refer to the mail archives and minutes from previous meetings.  A summary of previous discussions and  a proposal for how to move forward would be helpful. Although, we've put off this discussion until the success criteria are more solid.

2.
How about creating examples?  We need examples and clarifying text for every technology that we are creating techniques documents for.  You could look at these documents and find where you might be of help.  I think the only document that is well covered is CSS Techniques.

3.
We have the following issues list for WCAG 2.0. Do you see anything in here that you could help clarify?
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wcag20-issues.html

4.
Or what about some of the issues contained within the latest draft that need clarifying? (do a text search on "issue." e.g. "Issue: it has been proposed that we provide multiple, automatically generated "views" of the guidelines document for different purposes, using XSLT. What are the different "views" of the document that we should make available? Should we also have versions that include techniques or technology-specific success criteria (i.e., the technology-specific layer), along with the guidelines, checkpoints and generic success criteria? "

Does that help?
