I would argue that due to Netscape and its ability (or inability) to
display CSS as required, using text in an image would not violate 
When an appropriate markup language exists and is supported, use markup
rather than raster-based images to convey information.
simply because it is "not supported".

Please note that the following appears in the errata for WCAG 1.0:

8. Text in images - clarification of checkpoint 3.1. 
Added: 3 January 2001 
Type: Clarification 
Refers to: Checkpoint 3.1 in 5 May 1999 version. 
Description (and correction). Checkpoint 3.1 should be reworded to read,
"When an appropriate markup language exists and is supported, use markup
rather than raster-based images to convey information. [Priority 2] 
For example, when supported, use SVG to create graphics, MathML to mark
up mathematical equations, and CSS for text-oriented special effects.
Avoid where possible using raster-based images to represent text -- use
text and style sheets. Raster-based formats such as .gif and .jpeg paint
the text as a series of pixels. When magnified the text becomes
distorted. The ability to magnify text is critical for user with low
vision.
You may use text in images when: 
the text does not convey its literal meaning but has a more graphical
function, such as a logo and 
the effect can not be achieved with CSS and 
you have provided a text equivalent for the image. 
Refer also to Guideline 1, Guideline 6 and Guideline 11.

Does this help any?
