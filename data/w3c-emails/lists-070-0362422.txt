Jim,

I think you'll find that if you save the images as higher than 72dpi
they will scale when under zoom.

I often use a user stylesheet in IE5.5 with zoom:150% (IE proprietary
but
is basically an AT for shortsighted) this makes text as images look
terrible whereas text scales nicely. - test yourself.
