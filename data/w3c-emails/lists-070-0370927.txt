Hi all

Per the previous note we have tried to compile a listing of the people
whom we have been able to identify as contributing significantly to the
WCAG efforts.  We went back over the last 5000 postings and checked
meeting minutes.    However we undoubtedly have missed someone ? so let
us know if we missed you or you see someone we have left out.   It is
hard to look at a list and see who is not there.

Also listed below is an updated list of the Members in Good Standing and
our New members.    

See you on the web.

The WCAG Chairs

Oh, one more thing -- Please correct any misspellings and also please
send me an email (not on the list) with the correct international
characters for your name if it is incorrect below.   Mostly these are
lifted from email and I know by looking at them that some are not
correct even though I can't accurately repair them.  Thanks.
