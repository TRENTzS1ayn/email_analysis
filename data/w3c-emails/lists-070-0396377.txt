Kia Ora (Maori for Hello)
Current consensus item G1 reads 

G1 - Our document should be written as clearly and
simply as is appropriate for the content, with links to
definitions. We should go with the clearest and
simplest language that someone can propose as long as
it is accurate.

I still have difficulty with the first part of the
statement, namely

'Our document should be written as clearly and simply
as is appropriate for the content'

I simply don't understand what it means.

Could somebody please provide some clarity on what it
means? 

Cheers
