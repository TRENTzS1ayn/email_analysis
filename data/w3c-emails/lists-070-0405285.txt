Wendy
Issue number 55 

http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wcag20-issues.html#55

talks about the accessibilty / usability conundrum.

I would like to volunteer to do the following

1. Suggest several ways of creating the distinction
between usability and accessibility based on prior list
discussion and my own 2 NZ cents worth (remember thats
not much in your money :-)

2. Post this to the list and try and reach consensus on
what we mean by accessibility and what we mean by
usability, in terms of WCAG 2.0.

Helpful?

Cheers
Graham
