Annuska,
thanks for doing this.

is your proposal:
a definition or link to a definition is provided for phrases, words, acronyms and abbreviations for the first occurrence.

question:
the first occurrence in the site or on each page?

agreed.

In other words, summarizing the table within the text of the document? Or are you saying some other reference to the table is made within the text of the document?

My concern with summarizing the table within the text of the document is then there is not an explicit relationship between the summary and the table.

I think it depends on what the table includes.  If the table is one large set of data, a summary is very useful (sometimes necessary? Jason - do wish to comment further? I remember you having strong feelings about summaries).  If the table is only used for layout I think it is less necessary, but depending on the complexity of the layout could be helpful for someone using a magnifier who has difficulty "wayfinding" in a large table.  Anyone else wish to comment?

I think we need more research here. Anyone wish to volunteer?  Annuska?

That is more precise. Good.  Although, does it cover everything?  What about number of cells?  If a table has more than 20 cells (a very arbitrary number - more thought ought to be given to the exact number), a summary should be provided.  Or, if it has more than 3 columns and/or rows.  We played with these types of definitions a bit during WCAG 1.0 when trying to define "complex table."

Perhaps if the HTML algorithm to determine headings for cells fails to find any headings then the relationship is not obvious.

I second Jason's question, is this covered by checkpoint 1.1?

Thanks,
