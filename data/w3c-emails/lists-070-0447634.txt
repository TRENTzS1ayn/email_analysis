It has to be page (there is no first occurance of a site, users may
arrive anywhere.), also there isn't necessarily a first occurance on a
page, although this depends if we believe UA's should be duplicating such
definitions etc.

Do people who follow this link
 http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#new-tech-degrade
not need expansions (that would with the proposal only be done on their
first occurance.)

<LABEL FOR> or <CAPTION> seem appropriate?

Jim.
