Hello,

This is to announce that our next face-to-face meeting will be held 23-24 March in L.A., California, USA.  A draft agenda and information page is available at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/03/f2f-agenda.html

This meeting occurs after the annual CSUN conference.
http://www.csun.edu/cod/conf2002/index.html

The registration process should be active next week. I will send a notice as soon as it is available.

Also, information about meeting rooms will be available next week.  

We at least wanted to give appropriate notice of the meetings.
