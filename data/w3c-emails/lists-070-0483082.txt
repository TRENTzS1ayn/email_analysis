* summary:

While I offered a potential restatement in response to Graham's question, I
myself do not find this a drop-dead issue or that the document as it stands
says anything wrong.  Graham is correct that it may be something we agreed on
but it is still vague enough to be a weak guide to what we need to do.

We want the language of the document to be as easily understood to as wide an
audience as is possible while still expressing the necessary distinctions
concerning web content.  The face toward the content governed must be
effective; the face toward the human readers being informed  should be
efficient.  We don't (at least going in) plan on sacrificing accessibility
achieved when the guidelines are followed for teachability or readability of
the guidelines.  But we do count increased teachability or readability of the
guidelines as an important win.

Note that distinctions include better/worse distinctions as well as good/bad
distinctions.

* end summary

"Appropriate for the content" _is_ circular language and should ultimately be
fixed.? Because 'content' is ambiguous, it refers to sign in some contexts and
to sense in others, it does not suffice to identify what is meant here.? See
the thread running on WAI-XTECH at this time.

This is a clause affecting the sign (signs, structures, or signage) used to
convey a given sense, and the 'appropriate' clause is trying to say make it as
easy as possible to extract the sense from the signs you use, without
distorting anything essential in the sense that is to be conveyed.

To understand this guideline we do have to go back before McLuhan and act as
though there is some difference between the medium of language and the message
of thought, that it is possible to make significant differences in the
readability of the language at the same time as making negligible differences
in the thought, particularly evaluating the thought in terms of the web content
that it accepts and rejects, praises and deprecates.

In the case of requirements for this specific document we can be much more
concrete in articulating just what it means to be 'appropriate for the content'
as compared with content to be published to the Web in general.? Appropriate
for the content means anything such that we still statisfy the MUST
requirements.? That web content construction practices are divided up into the
right buckets of right and wrong, the right axes of better and worse.? For this
document, "the content" is the structure imposed on the domain of web content.?
It is the practical effect of understanding the document if you have understood
it.

alternative materials that illustrate the ideas in simpler terms.
