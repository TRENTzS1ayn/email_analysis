Actually, there's talk that this shouldn't even be a checkpoint, as
all current assistive technology seems to do this, plus there are
solutions (e.g. proxies) which cover the rest.

Talk where?  If it's talk about changing WCAG 1, that's not going to
happen -- the W3C process for WCAG doesn't involve changing checkpoints
in WCAG 1 years after they've been issued.  If you're talking about
WCAG 2, I haven't heard such talk, plus also note that it has not
been decided yet what "priorities" will look like WCAG 2 -- they might
be WCAG 1 style "priority 1" et al, or they might not be.
