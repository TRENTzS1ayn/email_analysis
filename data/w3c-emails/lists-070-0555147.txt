Summarizing information which is not new:

Another danger of emphasizing the "audience" is that web developers
are notoriously bad at knowing their audiences outside of an Intranet/
Extranet/login-for-access situation, and many times you will find
people saying, "oh -that's- not my _intended_ audience, therefore i
don't have to write for -them-."

Such arguments invariably prove to be harmful to general access by a
broad audience.  Therefore it's appropriate to speak of "content",
in this situation.
