Kia Ora Kynn
I am sympathetic to this type of argument but don't
agree with it in this case.
Content must be tailored to an audience or audiences
otherwise how is it going to be effective?
I believe encouraging content providers to focus on
intended audience will be beneficial because.

1. It is a basic rule of communication to consider
intended audience and for us to ignore that in our
document may help to undermine our credibility. 

2. It will help to focus content providers on who they
are excluding. 
For example, Government can't exclude anyone in its
provision of services on the web, can it?
But, a commercial organisation can and will. 

It seems to me a fundamental issue that 'intended
audience' is too often ignored on the web and that is
why we get so many inaccessible sites.

Cheers
Graham
