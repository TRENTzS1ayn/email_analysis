I don't agree with consensus item G1 as it stands.
I can't agree with it because I don't understand it.
However, I am more than happy for the document to be
published.

I think that we need to clearly separate 'education'
from 'guidelines'.
Otherwise we may end up not saying what we mean.

you want to increase the number of people who can read
your content, write as simply and clearly as possible
or provide alternative materials that illustrate the
ideas in simpler terms.

(GO)
Yes it needs clarifying for me but as stated above have
no objections to publication of the document as it
stands.
