Hi Jason 
I am confused <grin>.

1.
I got a different response from Wendy on this issue 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002JanMar/0193.html

2.
In relation to your statement
'Thus I would suggest making your argument without
relying on this supposed distinction'
I have no 'argument', the intended work was to put
forward a number of ways of distinguishing between
accessibility and usability. That was it. 
The intention being that this would be in some way
useful to the working group.
I was responding to Wendy's request to get involved
where she refered to the to the issues document.
The specific issue being number 55.
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wcag20-issues.html#55

I certainly don't want to engage in work that is not
necessary, so would appreciate if you could give me
some *joint* guidance on this.

Won't do anything until I get your response.

Cheers
Graham
