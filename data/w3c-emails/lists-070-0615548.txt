Hi Graham  

Jason is correct that we decided after a long discussion at one of our
weekly work sessions that trying to differentiate between them just
wasn't going to work --  and that it didn't help us solve the issues
before us anyway.    We found that if we worked on the wording and
concepts of the individual items -- that we made more progress.  Hence
his suggestion.

If you are interested in all the details you can look up the minutes but
the long and short of some of the major items were:

1) Something that is categorizes as usability to someone with more
ability may be the thing that enables someone with less ability to use a
product or web site at all --- hence it would be accessibility.

2) Accessibility can only be talked about in the context of specific
people.  Products are not accessible.  (That is, they are not usable by
everyone).   They are accessible to this or that person or those people.
Or they may meet this or that accessibility standard.   But they are not
accessible as an absolute status since not everyone can use them.

3) Accessibilty is also context or activity dependent.    The same
person may not need to enter numbers quickly on their TV remote control,
but may find that slow entry on their workstation if they are an
accountant would cause them to lose their job.  The system would not be
considered accessible to them if the means of access was so roundabout
that it took them 10-20 times as long to enter numbers as their
colleagues.


Now each of these statements can also be debated  and/or tuned for
wording etc.  So we decided to not go any further in trying to
differentiate the two since it was clear that some members clearly did
not see them as separate while others thought they might be.     So we
decided to move on and develop guidelines without trying to separate
them into one category or another.   

If you feel that you have the clear distinction -- please do go ahead
and post it.  But the working group decided not to debate it anymore at
this point based on what it knew.

Regards,

Gregg Van
