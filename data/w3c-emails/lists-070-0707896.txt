Just curious here.

"S1 - Serving content in different forms in order to meet different user
needs or preferences is an acceptable way to comply with the guidelines,
--  as long as equivalents for all of the information are provided in
the different forms, and it is all available from the same URI.
(Accessible, findable links to alternate form(s) is allowed.) (Server
side solutions are acceptable - as specified.)"

Many times I've heard the argument that the blind or deaf can have someone
translate the information for them. Still it comes from the same URI. I
realize this avoids the standards we are attempting to provide. However, how
do we defeat this rationalization of the uneducated?

Thanks,
Lee

Subject: Resolutions on Changes to REQUIREMENTS DOC



Here is a quick summary of the changes to be made to the Requirements
Doc based on last weeks Working Session.

Each change is separated by dashed lines for clarity


--------------------------------------
In section 2 the statement
'Each requirement must be easily verifiable'
will be changed to:

Each requirement must be verifiable

----------------------------------------

Change
"WCAG 2.0 will clearly identify the target audience of each
requirement."
to:

WCAG 2.0 will clearly identify who will benefit from each requirement"

--------------------------------------

Combine A-1, A-2, and A-3 into one item that reads:

A -1  The working group acknowledges that accessibility to everyone is
not possible.  Our target is to make things as accessible to as many
people as possible given then need to have practical techniques and
criteria.  We will expend our best effort to identify techniques,
criteria and examples that would cover the greatest range possible.

--------------------------------------

In Section 2
"Sample Site"
is changed to
Sample content

--------------------------------------

Remove [N3]    Replace it with a placeholder that states:
N3 --  [Deleted during consolidation.]

---------------------------------

Tune up S1 so that it is clearer what is meant.  It would now read:

S1 - Serving content in different forms in order to meet different user
needs or preferences is an acceptable way to comply with the guidelines,
--  as long as equivalents for all of the information are provided in
the different forms, and it is all available from the same URI.
(Accessible, findable links to alternate form(s) is allowed.) (Server
side solutions are acceptable - as specified.)

--------------------------------------


If anyone has any concerns with these please let us know.   Else we will
be posting after this Thursday's session.


Thanks

Gregg
