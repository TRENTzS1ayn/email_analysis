This used to be a Priority 2 checkpoint, and with the advances of
screen-readers it was moved to a higher level.
?
This checkpoint was written for those screen-readers that cannot read
cell to cell and only read left to right, regardless of columns or rows.
Newer screen-readers read cell to cell.

   10.3 - Until user agents render side-by-side text correctly provide a
   linear text alternative (on the current page or some other) for all
   tables that lay out text in parallel, word-wrapped columns.

   Shouldn't this checkpoint be a priority 1 point? It seems that there
   has been talk about making layout tables a priority 1 point.
