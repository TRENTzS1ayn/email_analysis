Wendy,
 
I'm considering issue #35. I've got RoboHelp and I've used it recently in a
project that required strict 508 compliance. From everything I read, tested,
attempted to verify, it _should_ be accessible to almost everyone. The only
problem is I'm not entirely sure exactly what you are wanting "help" to. Is
this a Help feature just for the Guidelines that points out where certain
information could be found and references other documents? Or is it a
mini-help within itself and actually contains snippets of information? Or is
it something else entirely? 
 
Please clarify and let me know if this is something I should pursue.
 
thanks,
Eugenia
