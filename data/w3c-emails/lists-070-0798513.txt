Sure. I'll put Help on the back burner for now. Is there a certain
techniques document that you had in mind or that you know needs work right
now?

Eugenia,

There has been ongoing discussion about making it easy to find information
in the WCAG suite of documents.  I'm glad to hear you are interested in
working on this, but I don't think there is much to do until we have more
content.  Would you be interested instead in working on one of the
techniques documents?

problem is I'm not entirely sure exactly what you are wanting "help" to. Is
this a Help feature just for the Guidelines that points out where certain
information could be found and references other documents? Or is it a
mini-help within itself and actually contains snippets of information? Or is
it something else entirely?
