Eugenia,

There has been ongoing discussion about making it easy to find information in the WCAG suite of documents.  I'm glad to hear you are interested in working on this, but I don't think there is much to do until we have more content.  Would you be interested instead in working on one of the techniques documents?

From everything I read, tested, attempted to verify, it _should_ be accessible to almost everyone. The only problem is I'm not entirely sure exactly what you are wanting "help" to. Is this a Help feature just for the Guidelines that points out where certain information could be found and references other documents? Or is it a mini-help within itself and actually contains snippets of information? Or is it something else entirely?
