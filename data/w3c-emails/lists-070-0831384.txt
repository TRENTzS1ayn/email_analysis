The list of techniques documents is available from the WCAG WG home page at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/#20-techs

Note that there are several documents not started.  Currently, the most momentum is behind CSS and HTML, although we are always looking for help.  Do you know SMIL or SVG or are you interested in learning?   If so, there are accessibility notes that could be updated and transformed into techniques documents.  

Also, feel free to review any or all of the existing documents and give feedback.

We have an issues list for the CSS document and one for HTML Techs is in the works.
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/css-tech-issues.html

Are you able to draft a proposal for any of these issues?  Keep in mind that on 1 November we divided the 15 sections of css techs into 3 groups.  Joel took responsibility for the 1st five sections, Jo for 2nd set of 5, and Matt the 3rd set of 5 sections.  They'll be coordinating the coding and testing of techniques for those sections.  Therefore, check with them first.
