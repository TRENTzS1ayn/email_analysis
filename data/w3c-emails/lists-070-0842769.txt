1. The requirements document: outstanding issues prior to publication.
   The question regarding server-side techniques raised by Charles is
   being addressed by the editors, and a proposal will be posted to
   the list prior to the meeting.

2. Success criteria: remaining checkpoints. We plan to discuss the
   action items that were assigned at the 17 January teleconference.
   See
