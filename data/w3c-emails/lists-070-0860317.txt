In terms of:
S1 - Serving content in different forms in order to meet different user
needs or preferences is an acceptable way to comply with the guidelines,
--  as long as equivalents for all of the information are provided in
the different forms, it is up to date, and the information is available
from the same URI.  Having an accessible, findable link from the URI to
the alternate form is an acceptable approach.

all I have to say is that 
Having an accessible, findable link from the URI to the alternate form
is a necessity in order to comply with accessibility guidelines.

Cheers,
Gian

Hi Charles,

S1 was supposed to state clearly that having a link to the accessible
version from the inaccessible version is allowed.  (That content
negotiation is not required).  

However, it is clear that the current wording was not clear.  

How about

S1 - Serving content in different forms in order to meet different user
needs or preferences is an acceptable way to comply with the guidelines,
--  as long as equivalents for all of the information are provided in
the different forms, it is up to date, and the information is available
from the same URI.  Having an accessible, findable link from the URI to
the alternate form is an acceptable approach.
(in short - Server side solutions are acceptable - if the accessible
forms are up-to-date and findable by going to the main URI.)
