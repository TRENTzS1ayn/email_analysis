I agree with Gian. I think that the point could be shortened to read

  S1 - Serving content in different forms in order to meet different user
  needs or preferences is an acceptable way to comply with the guidelines,
  -- as long as equivalents for all of the information are provided in the
  different forms, it is up to date, and there is an accessible, findable
  link from each version to the others.

without losing anything except the idea that all URIs must be the same (thisi
is not how all such systems work in the real world, although there are single
URIs that can be provided which offer the variations)

  all I have to say is that
  Having an accessible, findable link from the URI to the alternate form
  is a necessity in order to comply with accessibility guidelines.
