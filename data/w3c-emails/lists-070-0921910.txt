I agree with Charles and Gian on the content, though the wording is 
still somewhat difficult. Can we use bullets in the Requirements 
document? If so, a possible rewording might be something like the 
following:

S1- Serving content in different forms to meet different user needs 
and preferences is an acceptable way to comply with the guidelines, 
as long as the different forms
- are complete (i.e., they provide equivalents for <em>all</em> the 
information [content?]),
- are up to date, and
- can be reached via accessible, easy-to-find links in the other 
versions of the content.

Edits welcome.

Jo
