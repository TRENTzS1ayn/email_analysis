Yep, I like the way Jo has phrased this. Note that the question of the
difference between information and content is the subject of a glossary
discussion at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/wai-xtech/2002Jan/0002 and
following, especially because there are cases like this where the difference
is meaningful.

  I agree with Charles and Gian on the content, though the wording is
  still somewhat difficult. Can we use bullets in the Requirements
  document? If so, a possible rewording might be something like the
  following:

  S1- Serving content in different forms to meet different user needs
  and preferences is an acceptable way to comply with the guidelines,
  as long as the different forms
  - are complete (i.e., they provide equivalents for <em>all</em> the
  information [content?]),
  - are up to date, and
  - can be reached via accessible, easy-to-find links in the other
  versions of the content.

  Edits welcome.
