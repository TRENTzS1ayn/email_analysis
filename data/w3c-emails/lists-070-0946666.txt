Thursday, 31 January at 2100 UTC (4 PM US Eastern, 10 PM France, 8 AM
Eastern Australia) on the W3C/MIT Longfellow bridge: +1-617-252-1038

1. The requirements document: outstanding issues prior to publication.
   The question regarding server-side techniques raised by Charles is
   being addressed by the editors, and a proposal will be posted to
   the list prior to the meeting.

2. Success criteria: remaining checkpoints. We plan to discuss the
   action items that were assigned at the 17 January teleconference.
   See
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002JanMar/0106.html
   for the list of actions. Note that Lisa's action item regarding
checkpoint
   3.3 was discussed last week.
