I don't think I am satisfied with that. I think it is an explicit requirement
that a user who is on one version can, by an accessible means, get to a
version that suits them.

I am not sure that this requirement expresses that - "easily" doesn't really
say enough about whether that requires the user to reconfigure their browser
propoerly (users should, but I don't think we can rely on it in the next two
years) or whether they should be able to do it from the content...

So for the moent I disagree.

  In today's telecon we resolved to move forward with the following wording:

    S1- Serving content in different forms to meet different user needs
    and preferences is an acceptable way to comply with the guidelines,
    as long as the different forms
    - are complete (i.e., they provide equivalents for <em>all</em> the
    content),
    - are up to date, and
    - can be easily selected according to user preferences.  Note: We will not make any assumptions about the method that is used, whether it be content negotiation or a link.
