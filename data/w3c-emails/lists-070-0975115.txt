yes, we stated that - "according to user preferences"

we don't want to assume how it will be done.  this will be covered in techniques.  all we want to state right now -- in the requirements document for WCAG 2.0 -- is that in WCAG 2.0 we believe server-side magic to help users easily find something that meets their preferences is a good thing.

please propose rewording or I think we will move forward with publishing this working draft, considering that we had consensus with those who were on the call yesterday.
