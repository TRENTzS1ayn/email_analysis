  yes, we stated that - "according to user preferences"

I don't think this clearly enough states the point I am trying to make - that
there is a real issue in where the user states their preferences (via the
browser configuration, or directly during browsing).

  we don't want to assume how it will be done.  this will be covered in
  techniques.  all we want to state right now -- in the requirements
  document for WCAG 2.0 -- is that in WCAG 2.0 we believe server-side magic
  to help users easily find something that meets their preferences is a
  good thing.

I would like us to make an assumption in this case. If I am the only one, I
think the best thing to do is note that as an issue / dissent / whatever, and
publish.

  please propose rewording or I think we will move forward with publishing
  this working draft, considering that we had consensus with those who were
  on the call yesterday.
