I also have some reservations, but I think they would be covered by
adding another proviso, about what happens when urls are exchanged.

If I'm on accessible to me page http://moomin.invalid/text/ and I wish to
tell someone else of this resource, I must be able to do so just by
giving them the url I'm on.  Exactly how this might be worded is not
something I'm up too...
