Before adding new issues to the issues list [1], I summarized the issues 
received on the 22 August 2002 WD of WCAG 2.0 [2].

The next step is to sort, divide, and combine the comments to end up with 
the following groups of comments:
1. by checkpoint
2. by overarching issue (e.g., we received quite a few "general comments")
3. editorial comments that can be dealt with by the editors.
