I would prefer to avoid introducing the term "text alternative" into
the guidelines, if this can be avoided, as it runs the risk of
creating confusion and is yet another term requiring definition.

This is paradoxical: what it says is that content that can't be

This is redundant with (1) and (2). The phrase "where possible" could
be criticized on the ground that it makes the requirement
non-testable, and leaves it open for the implementor to introduce some
criterion of practical possibility other than the one we intend,
namely that the content can be expressed in words, which is exactly
what success criteria (1) and (2) provide.

My suggestion:

1.1 For all non-text content provide a text equivalent, or, if the content
cannot be expressed in words, an identifying label.

Level 1:
1. Non-text content that can be expressed in words has a text
equivalent explicitly associated with it.

2. Non-text content that cannot be expressed in words has an
   identifying label explicitly associated with it.

Any further clarification that may be needed belongs in the
informative notes following the checkpoint. The definition of "text
equivalent" remains unchanged.

This proposal will, in turn, doubtless be subject to comment.
Criticisms and alternatives are welcome.
