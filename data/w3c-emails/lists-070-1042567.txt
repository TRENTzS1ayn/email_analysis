So here we have a dilemma. There is a loss of presentation quality if text
is rendered as images. There is a loss of presentation quality if people use
Netscape, and the author "correctly" uses CSS to style the text.

Do we have a mechanism for working out whether one of these is a bigger
problem in terms of accessibility?

  8. Text in images - clarification of checkpoint 3.1.
  Added: 3 January 2001
  Type: Clarification
  Refers to: Checkpoint 3.1 in 5 May 1999 version.
  Description (and correction). Checkpoint 3.1 should be reworded to read,
  "When an appropriate markup language exists and is supported, use markup
  rather than raster-based images to convey information. [Priority 2]
  For example, when supported, use SVG to create graphics, MathML to mark
  up mathematical equations, and CSS for text-oriented special effects.
  Avoid where possible using raster-based images to represent text -- use
  text and style sheets. Raster-based formats such as .gif and .jpeg paint
  the text as a series of pixels. When magnified the text becomes
  distorted. The ability to magnify text is critical for user with low
  vision.
  You may use text in images when:
  the text does not convey its literal meaning but has a more graphical
  function, such as a logo and
  the effect can not be achieved with CSS and
  you have provided a text equivalent for the image.
  Refer also to Guideline 1, Guideline 6 and Guideline 11.

  Does this help any?
