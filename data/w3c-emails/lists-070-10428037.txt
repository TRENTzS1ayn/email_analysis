Current wording.
'For all non-text content that can be expressed in words, provide a text 
equivalent of the function or information the non-text content was intended 
to convey.'

Suggested rewording.
'Whenever possible, provide text equivalents.'

Rationale.
My brain aches when I try to understand the current wording and I eat, 
sleep and dream accessibility <grin>.
If I were doing a presentation I would *have* to translate the current 
wording into something that at least made sense to me before I even tried 
to explain it to anyone else.
This is what has prompted this email.

Cheers
Graham
