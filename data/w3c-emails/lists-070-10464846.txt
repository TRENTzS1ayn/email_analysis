My action item from last week was to draft a Level 3 success criteria for
Checkpoint 1.2 that covers the scenario currently described as the
following Note in the informative section:

Note: Time-dependent presentations that require dual, simultaneous
attention with a single sense can present significant barriers to some
users. Depending on the nature of the of presentation, it may be possible
to avoid scenarios where, for example, a deaf user would be required to
watch an action on the screen and read the captions at the same time.
However, this would not be achievable for live broadcasts (e.g. a football
game). Where possible, provide content so that it does not require dual,
simultaneous attention or so that it gives the user the ability to
effectively control/pause different media signals.

Here is a proposal for discussion:

3. the presentation does not require dual, simultaneous attention with a
single sense.

We should probably include an example in the informative section. Here's a
proposal:

A cooking video shows a closeup view of a chef preparing a recipe. A voice
describes each step including the ingredients. A screen displays the
ingredients and process for each step prior to the chef demonstrating it.
In this manner, deaf users are not required to read voice captions while,
at the same time, watching the demonstration.
