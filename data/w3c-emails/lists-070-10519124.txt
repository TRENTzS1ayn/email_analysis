So on Tuesday, after voting, I go to the California Secretary of State 
web site and start browing around. One of the links was under a blue 
"wheelchair" sign and said "Know Your Voting Rights."

So, okay, that's cool -- the state of California has a special Web page 
that tells disabled people how to exercise their voting rights. Cool.

I read further and discover the page has links like this:


"Know Your Voting Rights" Brochure

The information in this guide describes the voting rights of those who 
are elderly or disabled.

*Click here to view our on-line version of the "Know Your Voting 
Rights" brochure (in PDF format)
*Click here to order copies of the brochure: Order form for "Know Your 
Voting Rights" Brochure



Well, I wasn't interested in the PDF version (although I did look at 
it), and I certainly would have preferred an HTML text version. But I 
went to the order form instead and filled it out.

When it asked how many copies of the brochure (which is otherwise 
available only in HTML) I wanted, I typed in:

Number of copies of the brochure you would like:  1 in Braille

I then went to the voter information pamphlet page. This is sent out in 
paper to all citizens, reminding them of the dates, telling them where 
their polling place is, providing a summary of all initiatives with 
arguments for and against, and publishing statements from candidates 
who have supplied them. In other words, it's an essential piece of 
information to be an informed voter.

Unfortunately, it was all in PDF:


PDF files of the Voter Information Guide for the November 5, 2002 
General Election are available below. The html version of the Voter 
Information Guide will be available soon.


Sigh. But that wasn't the worst of it. Today, I got a phone call...

Caller Id read ST OF CA SECRET 916-657-4753:

Kynn:
"Hello?"

ST OF CA SECRET:
"Hello, I am calling for...I don't know how to say her [sic] name. 
Keenuh? Kine?"

Kynn:
"'Kin.' And that would be me."

ST OF CA SECRET:
"Ah okay! You went to our Web site and requested a copy of the 'Know 
your rights' document..."

Kynn:
"...yes.

ST OF CA SECRET:
"But you want it in some format called... Bray-lee?"

Kynn:
"Yes."

ST OF CA SECRET:
"We have not heard of this bray-lee here. I have checked with my 
supervisor, and we only have English, not bray-lee."

Kynn:
"..."

ST OF CA SECRET:
"Do you want me to send you an English one? I am sorry I cannot help 
you. What is bray-lee? Do you know?

Kynn:
"Uh, that's okay. Don't worry about it." *click!*


Good lord.

No wonder this state is so fucked up.
