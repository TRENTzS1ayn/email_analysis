As I read this, it appeared to suggest that people should be able to
understand what is happening from the captions alone. This might be true if
the captions include the audio description, but otherwise as Joe says people
are going to look at captions and the video, and the more they can multi-task
that the better they will understand the presentation.

I think that the last paragraph is misunderstanding the statement. Reading
open captions but ignoring the rest of the presentation would seem to me to
be something the requirement is suggesting should be feasible, and lead to
understanding what is going on.

This is perfectly possible. The URI
http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/QuickTips refers to a handful of different
things - in this case versions of the quicktips in different languages. The
technology for providing files of different formats at one URI is
well-established and used (for a trivial example in serving W3C images in
different formats, or for serving various bits of information as either HTML
or RDF). Does the group mean by this that content-negotiation must be
automatic, or is having human-readable links to different versios at the same
URI considered an acceptable way of meeting the requirement?

CMN
No, just pointing out that internet radio (and most radio, since it is
generally not captioned) is not accessible - in particular to people who are
Deaf. This shouldn't be much of a surprise, and it should be clear to policy
makers in particular that they need to decide how to set requirements. That
is, as I understand it, the purpose of this note.

There seems to be a terminology mismatch here - as I understand it Joe uses
captions to refer to a visual component of a presentation, such as a movie,
whereas on the Web it is possible and often the reality that captions which
can be presented visually are a seperate resource from the thing they caption
- just as closed captions are, until they get merged onto a screen.

CMN
I don't think Joe's comment is accurate for reasons I described above.
However I don't think that this is a valid exception - it seems to suggest
that if a policy body in some location decides that it isn't important to
caption something, and a broadcast is made there without captions, then one
can comply with this checkpoint by copying that. My objection is that this
confuses meeting a policy with meeting technical requirements for
accessibility. I don't think this exception should be retained, since the
case is covered by the Note above that says policy-makers (or in their
absence content producers) can decide what accessibility requirements to
actually meet, or require.

If the resource has synchronised equivalents then doesn't it already meet the
requirements? That should mean that it is not an exceptional case unless
those equivalents aren't actually meeting the requirements. And in that case
it should fail in my opinion.
