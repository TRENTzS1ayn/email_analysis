Amended as per discussion at yesterday's call:

Level 3 success criteria

3. The presentation does not require the user to view captions and the
visual presentation simultaneously in order to understand the content.

and the modified informative example would be...

A cooking video shows a chef preparing a recipe. The chef describes the
ingredients and the process for each step and then performs the step.
In this manner, deaf users can read the voice captions first and then watch
the demonstration.
