Woops, apology -- I didn't mean to send this to the working group.  I 
looked
at my mail archives to grab someone's address, and I guess I must have 
cut-
and-pasted the group's address instead of my friend's address.

While I don't MIND you guys reading this, it's off-topic for the list 
and
the final comment from me wasn't appropriate for this working group, 
and so I
humbly apologize.

Sorry folks, I will be more careful in the future.
