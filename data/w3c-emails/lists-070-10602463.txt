To The Group -

There were some potential confusion areas with regard to yesterday's 
teleconference.  I was not always sure I was on the same page as 
everyone else  But, I feel Andi did a nice job in her response to Joe 
and the group about what she felt was meant by checkpoint 1.2 at a 
level three success criteria.  So - my two cents worth is to agree that 
the checkpoint at a level three only indicates that this would the very 
best scenario "practice", if the a given technology would allow.  

This is a tough issue as everyone has expressed, especially for 
Web-based radio and other live streaming audio.  But, it will all work 
itself out over time or so I hope.
