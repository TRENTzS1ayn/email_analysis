I have a handful of questions...

Does this mean that I should be able to read the captions file without the
video, then watch the video, and understand what happens, or is it just that
sufficient pauses are inserted in the video itself?

Looked at another way, is the assumption that I recall everything important
from the captions file, or just that the presentation is broken into chunks
small enough that this is feasible for a given chunk?

Do I need to see both the video and the captions (albeit one after the other)
to understand a compliant presentation?

Does this checkpoint prohibit having the captions (and the sound they are
conveying) simultaneously with the relevant action? (If so, that redundancy
is an important technique for conveying information and I would argue that
the criterion as written should be removed)

cheers
