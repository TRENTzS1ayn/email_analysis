I apologize for not having made the telecon this past Thursday-- I was
attending the same conference in Boulder where Wendy presented.  So I got to
see and talk with her, but failed to send advance notice that I wouldn't be
on the conference call.  Sorry.

I'll miss the next one as well-- I'll be at another conference.
