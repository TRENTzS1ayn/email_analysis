Hello Charles, and all the others!

There are two reasons for adding extra comment to this (rather old) 
message/thread:
1)  10 months passed.
 SVG is still far away from being very common  :-(
 And GIF is not deprecated :-((
2) I released BlueSphere SVG Icons theme.
Details:
http://freshmeat.net/projects/svg-icons/
Project page on SF (incl. screenshots):
http://svgicons.sourceforge.net

I uploaded tarballs in pre-built format (.png), as most of existing 
open-source renderer still fail on some of source SVG files.
To install: you need just unpack tarball (either .tar.gz or .tar.bz2) in
$KDEDIR/share/icons
(/opt/kde3/share/icons in my install)
and select BlueSphere icon theme in KDE's Control Center.

I have tested many KDE apps with 32x32 and 48x48 toolbars, and can tell you 
that *it feels great*! I really enjoy 48x48 toolbar, and such kind of 
experience is lacking in Microsoft Windows.

I don't have much time to work on WAI at a moment, but would be pleased to 
answer your questions, if any.
If you want to follow progress with development of these SVG icons - I 
encourage you to subscribe to <svg-icons> mailing list on Sourceforge:
 http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/svgicons-devel
and/or to new releases on Freshmeat. 

All icons are released under BSD-like license, so you can reuse them in both 
Open-Source and Closed-Source projects, without any royalties (just put 
copyright notice into your project, and URL to my project, that's it).

Cheers,

Vadim

|    |   In fact I prefer to have my images also scaled based on my personal

|    |
|    |   example code for XHTML with a fallback for an image that is known
|    | not to scale well:
|    |
|    |     <object class="icon" data="mm_tool-svg" type="image/svg+xml">
|    |       <object width="20" height="15" data="mm_tool-raster"
|    | type="image/png"> A multimedia tool
|    |       </object>
|    |     </object>
|
|    Shouldn't it be:
|
|    <style type="text/css">
|      .icon { width: 20pt; height: 20pt }
|    </style>
|    ...
|      <object class="icon" data="mm_tool-svg" type="image/svg+xml">
|        <object class="icon" data="mm_tool-raster" type="image/png">
|          A multimedia tool
|        </object>
|      </object>
|
|    (NOTE that I included CSS class for PNG image inside)
|    That should scale better.  :-)
|
|    Aren't width="20" and height="15" depreciated in XHTML?
|    Of course you can use them, but using CSS properties instead of width
| and height attributes is much better practice, IMO.
|    As you define class "icon" for SVG picture, I guess you can re-use it
| for PNG as well.
|
|    Please let me know if such re-written example scales better for you.
|    (BTW: what is your testing environment? Opera? )
|
|    |   combined with the CSS rule
|    |
|    |     .icon { width: 2 em ; height 1.5 em }
|    |
|    |   Cheers
