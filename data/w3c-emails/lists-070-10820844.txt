Good.

I think we could use these that was discussed years ago:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999AprJun/0161.html

Using:

((PICS-version 1.1)
 (rating-system "http://www.w3.org/WAI/wcag20-conformance")
 (rating-service "http://www.w3.org/WAI")
 (icon "wcag1A")
 (name "W3C WCAG 1.0 Conformance level")
 (description "The W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0
               (http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/)
               Conformance level Rating System. Claim are not verified
               by W3C. Content providers are solely responsible for
               the use of these logos. ")

 (category  (transmit-as "c") (name "WCAG Conformance level")
  (label  (name "Level 1") (value 0)
          (description "All Priority 1 checkpoints are satisfied") )
  (label  (name "Level 1+") (value 1)
          (description "All Priority 1 and some Priority 2 checkpoints are
satisfied") )
  (label  (name "Level 2") (value 2)
          (description "All Priority 1 and 2 checkpoints are satisfied") )
  (label  (name "Level 2+") (value 3)
          (description "All Priority 1, 2, and some Priority 3 checkpoints
are satisfied")
  (label  (name "Level 3") (value 4)
          (description "All Priority 1, 2, and 3 checkpoints are satisfied")
)))

This content must be put in the file:
http://www.w3.org/wai/wcag20-conformance.rat

Then, as in the old message, the usage in the pages will be the follow:

<meta http-equiv="pics-Label"
      content='(PICS-1.1 "http://www.w3.org/wai/wcag20-conformance" labels
        exp "2002.12.31"  for "http://www.foo.com/foo.html"  by
"jow@foo.com"
        ratings (c 1))' />

So, as for other pics services, is possible also to archive the declaration
of conformity. This is also important because i think there is a need of a
service that could be contacted if some DOC ("Declaration of Conformity")
are considered not correct (this for assure the web developer to have not
wrong "examples" of accessibility level reached).

"Conformance profile" is good.
