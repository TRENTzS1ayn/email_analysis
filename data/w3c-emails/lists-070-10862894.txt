[Al, here]

You are assuming that W3C is certifying the claims, when you say "the real
claim."  The way one encodes the substance of the claim (EARL) is
independent of who says it is true, and how one says that they really say it
is true (XMLDSIG).

We should separate certification issues from representation language issues.

Yes, if the W3C has signed a copy of the conformance report either as 'seen' or
as 'corroborated' that signature will serve as a sufficient key to retrieve the
report if you query the W3C authority as to "What was in the document that you
signed thus: (publicKey, digiSig)?"  Assuming that W3C has agreed to serve 
as such a repository.

But this would be done using standard signature techniques which leave us free
to use what language we wish for the expression of the claims being signed.

And the architecture of the Semantic Web is such that one doesn't need a
central authority compiling a registry.  The entire URI namespace is the
index space of Web storage, and the claim as seen and signed (by whoever, no
matter who) can be served from anywhere and the signatures will confirm the
authority of the assertions with high confidence.

The issue as to whether or not W3C would take on the role of a certifying
authority is a matter that I should perhaps defer to the Director of the
International Program Office (Judy).  However, the WCAG group can and should
create the expressive language so as to be completely independent from any
certification process assumptions.

EARL (check me here, Wendy) has been designed to be usable in the absence of
any certification process and pre-existing trust relationship with an audit
and certification activity.  It links the claims with a description of the
actual conformance checks performed so that a third party receiving the
claim can readily confirm or deny the claims for themselves.
