Sure... this is no competence of WCAG Group but i have explain this for
focus attention to the possibility (that is done a lot around the web also
for other W3C validation and claims) that some web developer uses claim
logos without having the full conformance for this logo usage. At this
point, we (as W3C - i spoke also as AC Rep. for IWA/HWG) need to define some
procedures for let users to have the trust of logo usage.

Sure but the problem is: is people able to understand claims? I see for
experience that people consider a valid HTML, XHTML, CSS, WCAG 1.0 A, AA,
AAA valid web sites if they see the logo put in the website...
