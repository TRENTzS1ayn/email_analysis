I agree to your action. My suggestion is also due especially for the
developing of accessible web sites for Public Administration Campaign
launched by EU that have endorsed the WCAG 1.0 Guidelines. The problem is
that a lot of developer don't knows the guidelines and they claim the reach
of an accessibility level (1, 2, 3) using only validation tools like Bobby:
if they see the logo "Bobby Approved", for example, they don't check the
"priority user check" and this could be done in good faith or in bad faith
(more accessibility level could mean more money from Public
Administration... and we need to find something for control this wrong
"accessibility business" because as i wrote in my previous message, a wrong
logo usage could cause wrong emulation in web developers.

I agree in this. Is important not only to set the reccomandations but also
have a support for grant the right use and mantain good quality for the
logos. I have also seen something in the QA (http://www.w3.org/QA/).

Tomorrow will start the three days AC Meeting and i follow it in IRC... i
hope that could be possible to discuss also about this.

Ok... i talk with the "WAI girls" .-)
