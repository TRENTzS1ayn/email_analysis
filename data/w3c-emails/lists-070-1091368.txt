I'm aware of issues like this. Still, the line has to be drawn somewhere, as
we're reminded constantly in going over these guidelines. I think it's
perfectly reasonable to expect the vast majority of those who need a package
to increase accessibility for them to either request it from their
administrators or procure it otherwise. Holding back to accommodate browsers
like Netscape 3, which is well under 1% in worldwide browser share, prevents
full adoption of CSS, which in my opinion represents a much greater
potential benefit. We can pick apart edge cases all we want, but I think the
greater good here is crystal clear.
