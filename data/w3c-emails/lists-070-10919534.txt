While I agree with Al in principle, I would also expect resistance
from those who aren't competent in the use of metadata, or who have
the concerns of such authors in mind. As a result we will probably
have to allow textual claims as is customary, though continuing to
emphasize the advantages of Earl. A set of supplied Earl to XHTML/SVG
etc., XSLT transformations would help to ease the transition, too.
