Hmmm.  Do you have complete URL to that posting?
I am re-subscribed to www-SVG mailing list again (just few days ago), but 
haven't seen that mail.

Is it Bad or Good?
Good photography is about 15MB-30MB in size.
Do you really want to put such image on web, especially in SVG wrapper?

My experience shows that SVG can be scaled quite well, but not for small 
sizes.
I am having problem producing 16x16 and 22x22 (pixmap) icons from source SVG 
file (which is designed for 128x128).
At small size, you face problem of grid-fitting, hinting, etc. - which is 
similiar to hinting procedure in fonts (for rendering of glyphs at small 
sizes)

From my expereince, scaling images to small sizes doesn't work well.
I have tried different packages, differetn filters- and it's all the same.
Either you have enough pixels (high dpi value) or you don't.

Indeed, they rescale.  Looks interesting ;-)
Why don't you use SVG graphics than?
I think it would be more natural.

|  ps: Vadim
|  great to see your lovely icons.

Do you want me to help with some of icons?
That site looks like quite inetresting.  Where do you get current pictures 
from?
