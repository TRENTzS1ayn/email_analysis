Yep, EARL supports point-by-point conformance statements to any set of points
that each have a URI.

That means you can give a URI to double-A conformance, and have a one-line
statement. You can add conformance for any particular checkpoints above that.

People can describe the checkpoints they need for their own use, and search
for things that are described in EARL as meeting that particular set of
checkpoints.

EARL, because it is RDF, can readily understand that if you meet WCAG level A
then you meet checkpoint 1.1, and other such obvious requirements.

And you can query EARL and then get a text statement or logo.

Cheers
