I agree.  These are very similar problem-spaces, and we should address them together.

AG:: We should re-label 'server-side' techniques as a work area to
'network-hosted' techniques.  Origin WebServers with growth to middleware
graphs.

Where the proxy is actually maintained by the business entity that provides the
origin server, as with BETSIE, the appropriate approach is one like that taken
in UAAG: this site, taken together with the service it is partnered with on
iCan.com, is accessible.

This kind of policies for deployment strategies should be considered by the
same group dealing with server-side adaptation, just because we don't have the
critical mass to address these issues separately, and the policy analysis is in
part common.

Anything that we can work up in this direction is of interest at least to NCITS
V2 and the Grid Computing Environments Working Group (And Protocol Architecture
Working Group) of the Global Grid Forum, by the way.  The Grid Forum is
directly concerned with middleware issues and V2 would like to understand them
better.
