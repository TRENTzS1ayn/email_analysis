In his comments on WCAG 2.0, Ian suggested using the term "provisions"
rather than "success criteria" throughout the document, for
consistency with the terminology used in the User Agent Accessibility
Guidelines 1.0.

This would in no way be a substantive change to WCAG, only a
terminological alteration. So far, the working group hasn't decided
whether to adopt this suggestion.
