Hi Joe,

First I would ask that you not post any more emails to this list with
that tone.  
It is not helpful and doesn't cause people to listen more carefully to
your comments.  It is also disrespectful - and we have entirely too much
of that today.

Second, you have a number of assumptions wrong.  And some backwards.  If
you have questions about things then it would be good to express them as
questions.   

You will not be able to fully understand a complex discussion from
snippets of minutes.  They are not complete and they sometimes are
misleading since notetakers must scramble to keep up with discussions.
If something in the minutes does not make sense, then ask about it.   Do
not assume you have the full context or that the snippet is in fact
complete or necessarily always accurate.  

We are posting key decisions or questions separately - to make it easier
for those not at the meeting to monitor decisions and provide input.  I
would focus on those - and not the random notes of the meeting (unless
you just want to get an idea of what was discussed so you can ask
questions).

If you would like to repost any questions or suggestions in an
appropriate form I'm sure the team would be happy to address them.   You
might post different questions or issues in separate emails with
appropriate subjects (as per earlier request) to facilitate discussion
threading.  

Thanks.
 
Gregg
