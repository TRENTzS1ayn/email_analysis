Dear Mr. Clark -

With all due respect - the sort of thing I try to always treat others with
(by the way), I was shocked to read your e-mail.  Maybe it was not so much
what you said but how you said it.  There comes a point in written
communication or any communication for that matter where people turn off
those who are seemingly disrespectful of others.  You, obviously have strong
views/opinions on accessibility issues and that is your right.  I can only
speak for myself, but I will find it difficult (if not totally impossible)
to read any more of your e-mails if written in a like tone.

Because you have not been a part of the on-going dialogue with respect to
our meetings and the subsequent written minutes - you are not in a position
to "second guess" where our actual conversations have lead us.  In some
cases, we may even agree with some of your points but to lash out in the
manner you have chosen ONLY serves to lessen your ultimate message.

Hopefully, you can in the future use a more respectful approach when
addressing those with whom you might like to have listen to your message.
My assumption is, hypothetically speaking, that you could care less.  If
that's the case then we are on equal playing ground.

Respectfully yours,

Doyle
