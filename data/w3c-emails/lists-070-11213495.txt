Sorry to chime in late on this...
While this is likely to make me unpopular with my own working group... 
<grin/>
I agree with Roberto. I much prefer the term "success criteria" over 
"provisions". While the entire audience of UAAG, I believe, is apt to 
understand what a "provision" is when they stumble across the term (and 
it should be noted that within the UAAG document itself, they are not 
explicitly noted as "provisions", but only referred to as such from 
other sections), I think that the audience for WCAG needs a simple, 
accurate term here.
