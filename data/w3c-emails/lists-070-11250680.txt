Yes, we need to remember the differences here, as well as the similarities.
In timed-text work that may be undertaken by W3C it might make sense to point
out the need for formats that can handle differentiation between captions and
subtitles, and a nice feature might be the possiblity of writing one combined
set of captions/subtitles that can be presented as either. (This isn't going
to be easy for a naive user to do, but then neither subtitling nor captioning
are easy for naive users either).

Oh. From time to time I qualify in that list (although I wasn't on that

Actually you are asking for people to use the systems developed in the late
20th century such as SMIL and SVG animation, which envisage precisely this
kind of use case.

The examples produced by NCAM allow you to pause the whole presentation, but
could be readily adapted to allow pausing of the video through an interaction
control written in SMIL, and therefore playable on a current-generation
player.

Agreed.

I don't understand why this is excluded. It may be one of the most common
cases where people look for an exemption from the requirement due to the
difficulty of meeting it, but I find it hard to understand why real-time
audio is different in what people need from it.

(I have a dream. I dream that one day little children will be able to listen
together to the great orators of their time together, even though one relies
on speech recognition and conversion to signed language, plus their ability
to use signed versions of spoken languuages as well as their own sign
languages...)

It would seem to me that time-dependent things are any which reauire

Napster and Internet Radio are Web applications. Just not HTTP applications.
And while many of them won't get captioned in the near future, this just
keeps them inaccessible.

You seem to be misunderstanding what WAI does. Explaining how to make
something accessible (even in principle, where the technology is not readily
available) isn't claiming mandate, nor authority in the sense of some control
or power.

If the requirement to explain what a webcam shows is understood by any
organisation to be justification for closing down the large proportion who
cannot afford the technology (visual object recognition is not as complex or
expensive as it was even 3 years ago, but it is still beyond most people with
a $100 webcam) then I would agree that calling their policy application
half-baked is generous. On the other hand it is clear that if your webcam is
to let people know if you are in the office or not, and the text equivalent
provided is just "Schrodinger's office with or without cat" then you haven't
made the function accessible yet.

I agree with you that the definition relied on may exclude these things, but
I disagree with your conclusions.

A Deaf person is unlikely to use an all-audio device. Instread, in a scenario
such as using a VoiceXML interaction, the fact that it is a Web application
(has a URI) enables people to use an alternative browser suited to their
needs, that provides a text-based representation. (With the use of something
like Annotea it is possible to explain the interaction using visual symbols
for control)

It provides functionality that people are not used to having - more than what
is available with recent technology. It is certainly possible with
current-generation Web technology.

Yes, the wording should be something like "all information that is conveyed
by the combination of the audio and the video".

No, that is not true. Collecting the captions and a caption of the audio
description, and doing a merge to interleave them in timing is easy to
envisage with the current XML or XML-like formats used, and is on the surface
an obvious way to meet the reauirement.

The only sensible reading is to assume that the which introduces an
adjectival clause governing the substantive phrase "captions and audio
descriptions". Perhaps wording it as "For all live broadcasts, captions and
audio descriptions which provide the same information are required" would
help. (I still don't understand why this is a special case from the
perspective of accessibility requirements. The obvious difficulty of doing it
with current technology is a policy question of what to require.)

Well, of captioning as conceived twenty years ago. People who can work with
captioned content and not need to stop one or the other part will be able to
work more efficiently than those who cannot. But those who cannot keep up now
live in a world here the technology can halp them better than what was
possible a few years ago.
