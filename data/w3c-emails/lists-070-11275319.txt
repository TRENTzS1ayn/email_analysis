Gunnar Hellstr?m has written on sign language on the web and would like
to coordinate his efforts with W3C.  

 

His draft guideline for Sign Language in the web can be found at: 

 

http://www.omnitor.se/english/standards/Sign-in-web/Sign-in-web-guidelin
es.htm

 

Please give these a read and comment.  

 

How do we want to address this issue.

Hi Gunnar,

 

 

WOW ? how did this get buried.    

 

(I actually tried to give it special treatment and get it out of my
usual piles.  But that was a mistake.  )

 

Lets get this back on track.  

 

 

 

  Looks like a good idea and this is a good doc.   

 

I will post to the guidelines working group.  That should get it into
the review and working process from this end.

 

I will forward you any responses and discussion ? or you can join the
list yourself.  You don?t have to be an active member to join the list.

 

See www.w3.org/wai/gl 

 

Before I can post it though, I need it in a form that all our
participants can access.  (they can?t all access PDF)

 

Could you send it to me in HTML? 

Also, if you have any more let me know.

 

thanks

 

Gregg

Gregg,

I entered yesterday a contribution to the CEN WS-DfA Design for All
guidelines workshop. It is  the attached document about sign language in
the web. We have noticed the vastly varying usability of sign clips in
the web, and want to contribute to better quality, less uncertainty and
more activity in the area.

 

I have indicated that the real goal for such a guideline is really to be
entered among the WAI guidelines. And then I heard from the French WAI
representative in the meeting that you chair the web content part of
WAI.

 

So, now I turn to you for advice on how to proceed. CEN WS-DfA approved
the work item proposal, but we need to aim at WAI from the beginning.

 

What do you think about the proposal? How do I best get into the WAI
procedures? Are there similar actions proposed before? Are there any
specific deadlines to look out for?

 

Gunnar
