John Slatin proposed the following rewording of example 2 for checkpoint 
1.1 [1]

Providing a short label and a longer explanation are provided for
a data chart.  A bar chart compares how many widgets were sold in June,
July, and August. The short label says, "Graph of the numbers of widgets
sold in June, July, and August." The longer description identifies the type 
of chart or graph, provides  a high-level summary of the data comparable to 
that available from the chart or graph, and lists the data themselves.

I suggest that we accept this proposal in the next draft.
