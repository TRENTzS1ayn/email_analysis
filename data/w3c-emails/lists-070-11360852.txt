Hello!

I am reading with great interest the working draft of the WCAG2!

Under Checkpoint 3.5 the following is suggested:

<q>Example 1: a form to deactivate pop-up windows.
A checkbox is provided on a page of links to let the user select whether
they want the resultant pages to appear in new windows or not.</q>

Does this also refer to target="blank" or just to the javascript pop-up
functions?
Has there been a solution developed yet?

In the second example it is written:

<q>Example 2: a warning given before a pop-up window.
At the end of a news story, several links are provided for more
information. At the beginning of each link is an icon of an arrow with
the text equivalent, "Link will open in new window."</q>

I have tried this out and it can look a bit icon overloaded. In cases of
link lists would it not be sufficient to do something like this:

<p><img src="img/extlink.gif" alt="Links will open in new window."/>All
links of the following collection will open in a new browser window.</p>

One more comment with regards to Checkpoint 4.3 I would like to make:

<q>acronyms and abbreviations are defined the first time they
appear.</q>

Does this relate to the single document or the whole website?
In the latter case - is it not rather difficult on a website to
determine where there is a "first time" since we are confronted not with
linearity but hypertext?
It might be more understandable to some to clarify this point.

With regards and many greetings from Berlin

Ines Robbers
