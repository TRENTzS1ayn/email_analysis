The following proposal emerged from a conversation with Gregg and
Wendy.

Add a section to the document, under its own heading,
that sets forth the requirements pertaining to each of the "views"
that it must be possible to generate from the techniques. For example,
checklists must specify the techniques as true/false statements; under
each success criterion, implementation of the techniques must be
sufficient to satisfy the success criterion; technqiues should be
listed under the respective success criteria to which they apply.

What other views should be available? What are the corresponding
requirements?

The plan for further work in this area, as I understand the proposal,
involves several steps:

1. Fine-tuning of the requirements document.

2. Completion of an XML schema embodying the data fields identified in
   the requirements, for inclusion in an appendix to the requirements
   document itself.

3. Preparation of XSLT transforms to create the required views of the
   techniques, including checklists, from the XML source.

4. Preparation of at least one techniques document in this format,
   verification that the XSLT transforms produce the desired results,
   and iteration of the development process as needed to correct any
   errors or oversights that may be found.
