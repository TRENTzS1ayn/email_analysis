This can be implmented by the website that takes the information and uses
some tracking mechanism (paralell URIs, cookies, all manner of appraoches) to
serve pages that don't cause pop-ups. I don't think it is a very valuable
area of research and development - many browsers already provide the ability
to suppress pop-up windows. But it should certainly apply to any technique
that creates a new indow - scripting, target attributes, etc.

No, because many people still just browse the list of links and so would miss
this. Ideally their browser will tell them and you don't need to, but
otherwise adding (new window) to each link is the nly way to be sure. This is
helpful not just for people who are blind, so please don't make it invisible.

CMN
For the reasons you point out it should be in each document. (In my opinion
it should be every time - it doesn't take much if you use an automatd tool,
and if you don't this is already really ahrd to do).
