Various members consider that what was actual said has some higher 
merit than what was recorded.
The whole concept of dial-up telephone conferences is highly elitist  
and objectionable on those grounds alone.
minutes are important, and time should be spent approving them, 
otherwise the whole exercise is that much less worthwhile.

If members think that those who have the time, means, respect and 
ability to participate are naturally the right people to contribute 
they are very sadly mistaken.
There are very good reasons for believing that subsidised or sponsored 
places be made available.
How on earth do you suppose you will get contributions from the 
unemployed, disenfranchised, ill-educated?

Rude and bloody minded people come from all walks of life, however 
there are none so blind as those who will not see.
