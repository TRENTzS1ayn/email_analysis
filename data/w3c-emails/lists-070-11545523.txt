Action Items and Proposed Resolutions

- general consensus: long emails that group proposals are ok.
- action wac: clean up the mailing list. send email to all people don't 
recognize and ask them if they want to be unsubscribed.
- action ls draft something using 4.1 as a starting point that will address 
meta-data with a top-level statement.
- resolved (proposed): discuss 4.1 on 19 december assuming avi is available 
that day (others who are primary to the discussion seem to be available).
- action wac: double check with judy, janet, and ian to see if use of 
phrase "success criteria" will be issue as we move forward. will there be a 
harmonization issue?
- resolved (proposed) continue using the phrase "success criteria" rather 
than "provision" as suggested by ian (unless an effort causes us to harmonize).
- resolved: (proposed) drafts more often is a good thing.
- resolved: (proposed) proposals will sit on the list for a week and if not 
comment be incorporated into the next draft.
- action: jw, js, wac propose a way to address the issue raised by SAP 
concerning screen shots and checkpoint 1.1 that lead to a design issue 
about the accessibility of the "big picture."

Please send corrections, additions, or other comments to the list or to me 
personally.

Thank you,
