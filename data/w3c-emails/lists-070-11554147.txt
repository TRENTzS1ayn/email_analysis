Charles

your response is as always thoughtful and pleasant to read.
Unfortunately, you responded to your concerns, not those expressed

Many members will remember Anne Pemberton, she is not easily replaced, 
and has not been to my knowledge, she left because of the extremely 
slow progress.
She considers that her views were effectively ignored
Her students must come first, and she now uses flash extensively, 
please take a look at her work, you may all learn some humility 
eventually:

You fail to mention who represents the 3 groups:

Ill educated (which may include those who are socially excluded such as 
LDD)

unemployed

disaffected

perhaps you can name, or members will identify themselves,

perhaps about 50% (not including voters in australia :-?) of the world 
population fits in this group, yet there represention is far from 
significant.

You comment that the quality of minutes is critical, do you personally 
feel that adequate resources are being devoted to this?
I'm concerned, that your response mentions this, but does it address 
the reality?
