Please elaborate on that, Charles. You seem to be saying that if
even one person disagrees with the way a point is made, every point
made by that party can be disregarded.

I'm sure I'm dramatically misreading that, but I'd really prefer to
make sure.

May I suggest you actually go about this replacement process?
Let's get it started! Please make sure to do it in public, though.
It will be interesting to watch, particularly as WAI prides itself
on being an open and inclusive organization.

Unfortnately, Charles's post leaves me with the same question so
very many WAI documents leave me with: What is he *really* trying to
say?
