I like Option 3, because it gives us relatively stable numbers for each 
success criteria, even as we wrestle with conformance levels. (How many times 
have we confused about about whether we are discussing the old item x.x.x or 
the new one). Clearly, this will not be an issue once we publish.

I also think it is clearer to spell out the conformance level, rather than 
encoding it in the numbering system.
