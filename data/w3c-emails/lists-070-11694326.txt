#4 also contains the conformance level.

e.g., 1.1-1a  Non-text content that can be expressed in words has 
a  text-equivalent explicitly associated with it.

1.1 is the checkpoint number
1 is the conformance level
a is the sequential number for that criterion

thus, 1.1-2a
would be the first success criterion (a) for Level 2 for checkpoint 1.1.
