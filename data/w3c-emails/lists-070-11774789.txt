Reminder: this is our scheduled meeting to discuss the WCAG 2.0
technique requirements document. See the thread starting at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002OctDec/0206.html

The object of the meeting is to consider the requirements themselves,
together with issues raised in the ensuing exchange of e-mail.
Possible work items include:

1. Development of the XML schema mentioned in the requirements
   document, and of the XSLT transforms required to generate
   appropriate presentations.

2. Clarification of the different "views" that ought to be available
   and the requirements pertaining to each.

3. Preparation of techniques documents conforming to both the XML
   schema and the principles specified in the requirements document.

There is also the possibility of scheduling extra teleconferences
specifically to facilitate the ongoing development of techniques.

Teleconference details: Thursday, 12 December, 2100 UTC (4 PM US
Eastern, 10 PM France, etc.), on +1-617-761-6200, passcode 9224 as
usual.
