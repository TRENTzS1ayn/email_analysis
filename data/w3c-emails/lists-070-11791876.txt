As talk with Wendy, i will try to use net2phone.com software that could also
be used by other members because have less costs for communications (eg.
from Italy to USA, 0,05 USD per minute).

Also, if the +1-617-761-6200 has setup the net2phone.com, all the
net2phone.com users could call it for free by DSL connection...
