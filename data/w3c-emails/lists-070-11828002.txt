To the group -

Personally, depending upon readership all of the options have a place.  I
like Option #1 the best as it seems the easiest to understand.  I'd like to
see the conformance standards separate from the checkpoints.  This, of
course, is only my opinion and the other options have validity in their own
right. This is a hard call.
