I agree with Charles.  U.S. law provides for exceptions in cases of "undue
burden," but the standard for "undue burden" is quite high and, in my
understanding, not usually tied only to cost.

I propose that for this checkpoint the qualification be removed. Whether
soeone has the money to provide captions and descritions (and therefore
actually does it) is entirely a matter for policy makers to determine.

The accessiblility need doesn't change at all, but in some cases it may be a
considered policy decision to provide the option of claiming unjustifiable
hardship as a reason not to meet the accessibility need. howeer in other
cases this is not the case. Australian law requires that government provided
services are accessible if it is technically feasible, and high cost is
explicitly not allowed as grounds for not doing it. If this exclusion is
kept
then this checkpoint will not be suitable for policy in Australia and would
need to be explicitly called out as such in Australian government
information, whereas if it is left out the existing exclusions in policy
that
cover undue hardship will still mean it makes sense in other jurisdictions
as
well.

cheers
