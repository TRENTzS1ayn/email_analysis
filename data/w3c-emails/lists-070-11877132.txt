I'm a little confused as to why we brought up US law.  What is the
purpose of relating to only the US laws?  Many other countries have laws
regarding accessibility for the disabled and not as soft-hearted to
businesses as the US views.

So, someone please explain why we want to become soft-hearted on some
issues and not so soft-hearted on other issues.

Thanks,
Lee

I agree with Charles.  U.S. law provides for exceptions in cases of
"undue burden," but the standard for "undue burden" is quite high and,
in my understanding, not usually tied only to cost.

I propose that for this checkpoint the qualification be removed. Whether
soeone has the money to provide captions and descritions (and therefore
actually does it) is entirely a matter for policy makers to determine.

The accessiblility need doesn't change at all, but in some cases it may
be a considered policy decision to provide the option of claiming
unjustifiable hardship as a reason not to meet the accessibility need.
howeer in other cases this is not the case. Australian law requires that
government provided services are accessible if it is technically
feasible, and high cost is explicitly not allowed as grounds for not
doing it. If this exclusion is kept then this checkpoint will not be
suitable for policy in Australia and would need to be explicitly called
out as such in Australian government information, whereas if it is left
out the existing exclusions in policy that cover undue hardship will
still mean it makes sense in other jurisdictions as well.

cheers
