Hi,

I'm kind of wondering why there needs to be only one format made available
to users.  Different users have different preferences.  Since this is a
technology based group, why not take advantage of technology and let users
choose what options/formats they would like to see information presented.
Why squeeze everyone into one format?

Scott

PS  If there is a technological reason why this can't be done, then fix the
technology.
