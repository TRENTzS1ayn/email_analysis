Well the problem is that if we each use a different set of numbers it is
going to be hard to talk about something and make sure we mean the same
thing. The external technology handles this fine - converting from one scheme
to another is trivial for a computer. Unfortunately it turns out that
poeple's brains aren't that flexible - they like things they can make sense
of and don't have to convert.

(this is why the metric system is really an all-or-nothing proposition - CSS
works fine with mixed units, but people tend to get confused)
