John,
Thank you for the explanation.  That helps me a great deal.

I do concur, leaving loop holes in the standards limits the validity of
the standards.  We're facing that now in the US due to the not-so-clear
openness of the ADA.

I don't have the reference, but the Dow Jones is being sued in Australia
by an Australian for libel.  This sets a precedence that has been
unheard of previously.  Now, we could be faced with a web site being
developed in one country not being accessible and being sued in another
country where a person uses the site.  That's an interesting concept to
say the least.  

With this I would have to agree that policy-makers be left to determine
their levels of accessibility based upon their business goals.  Yet, we
should infer the most ardent levels of accessibility.  If we can develop
the standards then people should be able to meet those standards.

Lee

Lee, I only brought up US law as additional justification for agreeing
with Charles' point.  He had mentioned that, as written, the checkpoint
would not work in Australia for legal reasons, and I was simply trying
to support
that-- I had no intention of m aking US law the standard.  Quite the
contrary.  Sorry for the confusion!

I'm a little confused as to why we brought up US law.  What is the
purpose of relating to only the US laws?  Many other countries have laws
regarding accessibility for the disabled and not as soft-hearted to
businesses as the US views.

So, someone please explain why we want to become soft-hearted on some
issues and not so soft-hearted on other issues.

Thanks,
Lee

I agree with Charles.  U.S. law provides for exceptions in cases of
"undue burden," but the standard for "undue burden" is quite high and,
in my understanding, not usually tied only to cost.

I propose that for this checkpoint the qualification be removed. Whether
soeone has the money to provide captions and descritions (and therefore
actually does it) is entirely a matter for policy makers to determine.

The accessiblility need doesn't change at all, but in some cases it may
be a considered policy decision to provide the option of claiming
unjustifiable hardship as a reason not to meet the accessibility need.
howeer in other cases this is not the case. Australian law requires that
government provided services are accessible if it is technically
feasible, and high cost is explicitly not allowed as grounds for not
doing it. If this exclusion is kept then this checkpoint will not be
suitable for policy in Australia and would need to be explicitly called
out as such in Australian government information, whereas if it is left
out the existing exclusions in policy that cover undue hardship will
still mean it makes sense in other jurisdictions as well.

cheers

Charles
