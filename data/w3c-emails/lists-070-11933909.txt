I agree. It is not the purpose of the guidelines to try to balance
competing policy considerations, which, in any event, will vary
significantly according to context. A policy setter can, if necessary,
opt to exclude certain multimedia presentations from the scope of any
policy requiring conformance to the guidelines, a point that was made,
and indeed accepted by the working group at a meeting several weeks
ago.
