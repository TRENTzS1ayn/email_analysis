Wendy and Group -

I like the way you formatted the minutes this time - it gets to the facts of
the matter more easily.  It also allows the note taker to be far more
involved and lessens the possibilities of misquoting someone or not quite
getting a persons words written the way they would have intended.

When we run program meetings here at our work, we follow a fairly strict set
of meeting guidelines that really benefit minutes and note taking.  We have
one meeting facilitator, a time keeper and a person devoted to assuring that
all get a chance/opportunity to speak.  As discussions around a topic
evolve, the facilitator will question those who have participated whether or
not there has been an outcome reached.  The note taker ONLY writes down
outcomes and none of the discussion "stuff".  The note taker will generally
read back what he/she wrote to assure accuracy and agreement. This is sort
of what Wendy did today with respect to the notes. The biggest advantage is
that a note taker can actually participate more easily using this approach.

So - I liked the new method and appreciate the fact that there have been
those of you who have volunteered to take notes.  I am a terrible note
taker!!!
