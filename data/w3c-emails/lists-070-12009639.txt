  Overview of Design Principles

    * How does assistive technology interpret "form(s)"?
    * Usage of "perceived" in the "Perceivable" definition is ambiguous.
    * The same applies to "Operable".
    * The same applies to "Navigable".
    * The same applies to "Understandable".
    * Item 3 needs a period at the end.
    * Should <q cite="http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/PWD-Use-Web/"> be
      around "How People with Disabilities Use the Web".?


  Guideline 1 - Perceivable.

    * Should "all intended function" be plural?
    * I would use a different word that "form(s)" because form can be
      confused with XForms or HTML forms or other input forms in
      general.  Perhaps "way(s)".


    Checkpoint 1.1

    * In item 2 under "Success Criteria", should "can not" be one word?
    * Shouldn't you have at least two items at each level of a list?
    * Should <span lang="la"> be around "i.e."?
    * I think there should be level headings or make the level names
      strong so they can be found at a glance.
    * Is there a reason that the examples are numbered and if so, should
      they be a numbered list with style :before { content: "Example" +
      number }?  I know that CSS syntax is wrong but you get the idea.
