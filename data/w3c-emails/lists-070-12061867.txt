if we lay aside transparency can we agree that:
the profile or outline of an image is helpful for identification, and 
that therefore rectilinear outlines should be avoided where possible?

As far as transparency, it is preferable as 'else' one gets artificial 
rectilinear boxes, which maintain an author controlled background, 
which may not suit the user.
it is true that in many instances the user may choose an inappropriate 
BG, however the author is in no position to decide what is suitable....

(to say: "If these help recognisability, commercial web sites will do 
it anyway;" as David does(in IG thread) is not that helpful, we may as 
well give up writing guidelines on this basis....

all this supposed freedom of SVG, flash, whatever means that we need 
more guidelines... where are they? come to that where are those CSS 
accessibility style sheets?

did you consider that text box that resizes itself as you write? have 
you seen it anywhere, this would be an example of a site usefully 
transforming to suit the user, a rare commodity indeed :-0

thanks
