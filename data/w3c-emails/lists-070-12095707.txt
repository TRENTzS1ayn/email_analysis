I agree that a strong outline is helpful for recognition for various reasons.
I don't think it therefore follows that a shape should not be on a
rectangular background.

I liked the idea of a text-box that is dynamically sized. This is something
to look for in Xforls implementations - I suggest looking at them in a
browser like X-smiles where you could get a nice SVG layout...
