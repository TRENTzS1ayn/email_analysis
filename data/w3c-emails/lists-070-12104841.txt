    Checkpoint 1.2

    * In item 1, "of all visual information" should be "for all visual
      information".
    * I feel that the single list item under item 1 is much too long
      and, with all the parenthetical phrases, too complex.
    * In item 2, is "time-insensitive" better than "not time-sensitive".
    * Is the second "if" necessary?
    * Should the exception for item 6 be part of item 6 like it is with
      item 2?
    * How about example broadcast accessibility guideline documents?
    * Why is "Audio" capitalized in item 2 of Level 2?
    * If something is live, are the captions and audio descriptions
      supposed to be realtime?  That does not seem very feasible.  Also,
      please define "professionally produced".
    * In item 3, there should be a comma after "interactive".
    * In item 3, how do "captions with the audio" and "both together"
      differ?
    * In item 1 of level 3, "script" should be avoided since it could be
      confused with the <script> element and scripts in general. 
      Perhaps "transcript" is a better term to use in its place.
    * What exactly are the difference between item 2 in level 2 and
      level 3?  They seem pretty similar to me.
    * In the first definition, is it better to put "OR" in <strong> than
      to capitalize it?
    * Wouldn't the definitions make more sense as a definition list <dl>?
