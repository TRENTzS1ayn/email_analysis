I have a concern, with  Checkpoint 5.2 -  Ensure that technologies relied
upon by the content are declared and widely available.

The success criteria makes no mention of technologies that can only be used
on specific operating systems.

At present we require that technologies and features on the required list
are available in at least two independently-developed implementations. But
no mention of weather it is possible to develop applications for other
platforms.

What if they are only supportable one a specific platform? In other works if
a web author choses to use a  technologies  that can only be accessible on
Lynix or can only be accessible to user agents run on Microsoft - surely
that can not be considered accessible.
This is even more the case when the operating system required is not free.
It must be an undue burden on the end user to expect  him/her to buy a new
operating system to view your site

I recommend that all  technologies  should be supportable on any operating
system, and that that should be a level one requirement.

Should we also specify that  the independently-developed implementations are
not themselves dependent on the same proprietary , restricted (non-free)
components?

all the best
