Hi Lisa and Group -

Are you (Lisa) referring to Checkpoint 5.2 that reads, "Design for backward
compatibility"?  Have you paraphrased the wording?  I am a little confused
but what else is new!

In response to your comments about varying (different) operating systems, I
have some concerns as you do but also feel that we cannot easily control all
the possible scenarios.  For example, if a web author/designer developed a
site that was accessible via, let's say, Internet Explorer (Microsoft) and
someone using JAWS (as an example) could access the site - the site is
accessible to that particular user. Now, let's say someone is using Mystery
OS 105.3 (a pretend operating system) and Internet Explorer and they can
visually access the same site as per above but there is no screen reader for
the operating system (Mystery 105.3). Is this site now considered to be
inaccessible?  Is this the concern that you posed to the group?

If this is the concern (or at least is part of the concern) then we have
some real life issues and a lot of not so friendly cross-platform operating
system barriers in our way of achieving universal accessibility.  It seems
that the question, as posed, crosses over into the user agent group and
maybe deeper than that alone.  Guess my main question is - did I understand
at least in part what you were getting at?

My question is this:  Where does the responsibility lie when it comes to
developing applications for one platform or another that would (if
developed) make web pages accessible on all presently available (and,
ideally future) platforms?  In my mind, this is a very difficult question to
even start to respond to and I am not sure that it's even close to where you
were coming from.  But, there are so many "real life" scenarios that fall
into this particular void.  I'd be very interested to hear responses from
others.  Lisa, thanks for your post - if I got it right, an interesting set
of questions.
