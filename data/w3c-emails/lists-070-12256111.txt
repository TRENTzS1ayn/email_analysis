I'm concerned that I think Lisa's request goes beyond this, that it doesn't 
matter how many Assistive Technologies vendors support a technology on 
Windows. As long as AT is only available on Windows, the technology should not 
be considered accessible.

We wrestled a lot with what we wanted this checkpoint to say. It is a very 
difficult issue. Lisa, I assume you are requesting that we re-open the 
discussion.
