To The Group -

I, too, believe that Lisa's comments go beyond "just" the technologies that
are possibly programmed into a web page or an entire site.  I am having a
difficult time trying to figure out the "real" issue.  Lisa, am I wrong in
thinking that you are saying (possibly), some operating platforms/systems
are being ignored when it comes to vendors making accessible
products/agents/technologies for a lesser selling operating system.  If this
is what you are saying, I can tell you, you are 100% correct.  In the early
years of assistive technology, Macintosh was superior with regard to
assistive technology (stuff built into their system and software developers
making AT products for the Mac).  In my humble opinion, I have seen the PC
world jump way ahead of Mac related to accessibility products and supports.
Some vendors are no longer developing multi-platform products, especially
assistive tech products.  Is this what you were talking about?  Thoughts?
