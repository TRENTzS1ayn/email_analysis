A few clarifications:
I am referring to 5.2 in http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/

checkpoint 5.2 reads:
Ensure that technologies relied upon by the content are declared and widely
available.

success criteria level two reads:
Technologies and features on the required list are available in at least two
independently-developed implementations.


Now what is happening is people are claiming accessibility based on
technologies that can only be used on the windows/intel platform, and
assistive technologies that do not run on window, can not, with all the will
in the world, provide support.

  I see a big difference hear between developing based on a free download, or
even a none non-free application, and developing for, say, only IBM with
windows. (hay I use IBM and windows, but that is not the point)

Part of the difference is that the user can get a new user agent a lot easer
then he can sell his mac and buy an IBM.
  But the BIG  difference  is that developers of assistive technology for
other  platforms are barred from developing support. The do not have the
API's. They can not do it.

It seems to me that this allows potential monopolies, and such games to be
played in the assistive technology/platform market.

I think that it is  the disabled who will pay the price.

Any standard that are relied on for fulfillment of these guidelines must be
open and usable on more then one, independently owned,  platform.
