I'd like to suggest some changes in wording for Wendy's proposal #4.  The
suggestion for item b is merely editorial; the suggestion for item c may be
considered substantive.

Proposal #4
rewrite the minimum to read:
1. At least one of the following is true:
    a. content does not flicker or flash.
    b. flickering or flashing of content is not between 3 Hz and 55 Hz.
[js]: Proposed rewording for item b: "Content does not flicker or flash in
the range between 3 and 55 Hz (cycles) per second."
    c. if flicker is unavoidable, the user is warned of the flicker before 
they go to the content, and as close a version of the content as is 
possible without flicker is provided.
[js]: Proposed rewording for item c: "If flicker is unavoidable, users are
given advance notice and a method of avoiding the flickering content is
provided. An equivalent alternative that does not flicker is available."
