I agree that education is important.  Here in Virginia we're drafting state
guidelines for Web sites, focusing heavily on accessibility, and many of the
people on my Advisory Committee didn't even realize many of the issues
related to minimum compliance.  Some designers create Web pages with
whatever their editor creates, and don't realize there might be important
elements left out, because the latest version of Explorer doesn't need them.

When I forwarded the current and new WAI standards to the Advisory
Committee, most needed a translation into a "higher level" of English.

John and the Group -

First off, I hope my comments are not coming off as critical - far from my
intention by all means.  But, I really do think that some of our writing is
well beyond that of our potential readership.  And, it is mostly terminology
(as John states) and yes, there is a glossary that can help explain the
terms more simply. 

Like John, I do a lot of training in the area of web site accessibility and
can say, as much as anything, the educating of others will help solve a good
many barriers.  Most web developers do NOT even know that there are problems
related to access within the disability community.  In fact, most web
developers might even be surprised that a blind individual could access the
web in the first place.  Generally, I find that people say to me, "Wow, I
didn't even think about that" when we discuss or bring up a particular
barrier to access. 

Another problem is that of available tools that allow a developer to realize
they are missing an accessibility issue before they have to run an
evaluation tool (or evaluate manually - which I am not sure many developers
can do in the first place).  Some development tools, Hot Metal Pro, for
example, prompt the developer as he/she develops the web page/site.  Some
tools do not as a default place a DOC-TYPE within the HTML so these pages,
for one reason or another cannot be parsed by web crawlers and worse yet
some assistive technology.  But, again, the web developer probably does NOT
even realize this is an issue.  Essentially, well meaning people not knowing
and they would have done it different had they known.  At least this has
been my experience.  So the education and outreach group can really help
with respect to these issues - I think.
