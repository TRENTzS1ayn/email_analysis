I concur with this thought.

Should we say:
The content must be supported by multiple, independent, and
interoperable implementations of the technologies (i.e., formats,
protocols, API's, etc.) required for the content.

Using the above terminology removes the possible confusion that a screen
reader like JAWS or Window Eyes would be counted as two independent
implementations.  For both of them to work they require the MSAA, that
in itself would be counted as one API.
