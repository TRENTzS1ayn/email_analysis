I'm sorry to go on about this, but now that I've read the whole of Jason's
message (I'm going through my inbox in reverse chronological order) I'm even
more confused.  Let me begin by proposing a slight reworking of what Jason
offered, and then I'll ask a couple of questions.

==Jason's phrasing:==
>... there exist multiple, independent and interoperable implementations of
the
> technologies (i.e., formats, protocols, API's etc.) used by the
> content.
[snip snip] Jason then proposes an example of how we might define
"independence":
>... e.g., that [the technologies used by the content] have not been
> developed by the same entity, or that they don't have substantial code in
> common, or whatever seems most reasonable as a requirement.
>
==end Jason's wording==

Here's a slight reworking that does little more than simplify the syntax:
== John's reworking of Jason's text==
... There are multiple, independent, and interoperable implementations of
the technologies used by the content.

Note: Technologies, including formats, protocols, API's, etc., may be
considered independent and interoperable if they require different operating
systems or don't have substantial code in common.
==end John's reworking==

Comment: I simplified the sentence by removing the parenthetical phrase
about formats, protocols, APIs, etc.  I then proposed putting those terms
into an explanatory (informative) note rather than the text of the
checkpoint or success criterion.  I deleted the phrase about having been
developed by different entities because it didn't seem to fit cases such as
JAWS and WIndow-Eyes.

Questions:
What does "interoperable" mean in the sentence "There exist multiple,
independent, and interoperable implementations of the technologies used by
the content"?

Does content meet 5.2 if it works in Internet Explorer on both Windows and
Macintosh but not in Netscape/Mozilla?

I think there *is* a significant communication issue here.

Sorry!
John
