Whew! Jason, Lee, thanks so much for working so hard on this-- but I'm
afraid I can't agree that Jason's wording eliminates confusion.

Yes, Jason's wording is far more precise than mine, and therefore very
useful.  But it's so highly technical that it will be incomprehensible to
most readers of WCAG 2.0, and will cause consternation and despair.

To meet the needs of our readers, we should try to write in the spirit of
4.1.  Having said that, however, I don't think I have the technical
knowledge to paraphrase Jason's text accurately.

John
