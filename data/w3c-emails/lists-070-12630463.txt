Thanks again to both Jason and Lee for helping out with this-- I'm really
struggling here.

What Jason writes (see below) prompts another pair of questions:

1. What constitutes an "implementation" in the sense of the term as used
here? Is IE 5.5 for Windows a *different* implementation than IE 5.0 for
Macintosh?  If I understand Lee correctly, he would say "No-- these are
merely two instantiations of the same implementation."  But I'm not sure
whether Jason would agree-- and I'm not sure where I stand either, given the
amount of time Web developers have to spend to ensure that their content
works correctly on both Windows and Mac.

2. If "interoperable" means, in essence, that mainstream technologies "used
by the content" must be compatible with assistive technologies used by
people with disabilities, (a) can we say that in some reasonably concrete
form instead of using such high-level abstractions? and (b) how can Joe and
Josephine Web Developer know if they meet this criterion if they don't have
access to a wide variety of assistive technologies?

A third question just popped into my head: are we engaging in circular
reasoning in the way we talk about interoperability here? It's my
understanding that "Robust" (our keyword for the principle expressed by
Guideline 5) might be translated as "Interoperable."  If that's correct,
then we can't use the word "interoperable" in checkpoints or success
criteria whose purpose is to define what "interoperable" means.
