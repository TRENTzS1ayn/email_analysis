I suggest to change it with:

"The content use technologies, including assistive technologies, that are
available in different operating systems"

I think that "multiple implementations" could be difficoult to understand
and to define, also is to explain well about "different opertating systems".

For example, if i have a tecnology that works for Windows 98/2000/XP i
respect the request because it is available in three different operating
systems.

But the request must be focused that my content will be usable in Windows
and Mac, for example.
