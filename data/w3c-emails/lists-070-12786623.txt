Yes this is true. But my example is not a proposal for do this but a request
for change the language expression used. In fact, Windows 98 and Windows XP
are - at least - two different operating systems and an user could consider
that he pass the checkpoint if his content (as in the example, with MSAA) is
shown in two different OS.

There are at least 3 different OS in MS, one "home" version (Win98, ME, XP
Home), one "office version" (NT, 2000, XP Pro), one server Version (NT
Server, 2000 Server, .NET). What we need to explain well is the word
"operating systems" into "independent operating systems", as suggested by
Lisa.

I think is right the Lisa proposal to use "independent operating system" and
i think it would be best to add a little explanation about what we intend
for "independent operating system":

Recalling a definition of "Operating System":
http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/O/operating_system.html

Here there is an important refer to the "platform":

http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/platform.htm

that bring us to the correct term: "cross-platform"
http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/cross_platform.html

So we could change the point:

"The content uses technologies, including assistive technologies,  that are
available in multiple implementations for different operating systems."

with:

"The content uses technologies, including assistive technologies,  that are
available in multiple implementations cross-platform application."
