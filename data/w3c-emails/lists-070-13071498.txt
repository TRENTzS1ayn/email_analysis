Just some of my thoughts -

Not having a firmed-up agenda in front of us, yet, I would propose looking
at any outcomes from the f2f at CSUN.  I know Gregg had said, their group
made some nice compromise efforts that incorporated some of his ideas about
looking at the structure and philosophy behind the ?new way? of looking at
WCAG 2.0.  I?d like to hear how this group progressed.  I?d also like to
hear equally about outcomes and directions from the other sub-groups.

Personally, I have been looking at the technology of where transcoding
servers or client-based technologies are at this point and Gregg?s proposal
warrants some looking into based on what I?ve read.  We do need be be
somewhat forward thinking in our effort to set guidelines/criteria as we
look at the next steps in making 2.0 (whatever that is) something that can
set the standards and be useful to developers as they build for
accessibility.  Like many have hinted toward ? we do seem to have become
stagnated and maybe a bold move is in order.  Change is never easy but
looking beyond can be exciting.  Let?s see what happens!

I assume Jason, Gregg and possible others will set the agenda topics for
this Thursday.  I am just throwing the notion out there that I?d like to
hear a reporting out from the face to face.  Also, sounds like Lisa wanted
more time to digest and that seems reasonable, but just my humble opinion,
for whatever it?s worth.  I hope I am not too far off base with these
comments.  

Any thoughts from others in the group?  I?ll see you all on Thursday.
Again, it was nice to finally meet so many of you in Los Angeles.
