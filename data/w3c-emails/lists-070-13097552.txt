Just a suggestion regards conformance icons... there is XHTML+CSS
code to make W3C conformance buttons (maybe you already know them)
on this site:

http://www.sovavsiti.cz/css/w3c_buttons.html

We should use them for WCAG levels too, what about? It could be
an exaustive example of right use of webstandards.


Roberto:
Hi Marco,
this is an illegal use of the W3C logos:
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/logo-usage-20000308.html

and also a violation of the trademarks claim:
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/trademark-license-19990516.html

At least, This is a W3C policy issue and not something that the working
group can decide.
