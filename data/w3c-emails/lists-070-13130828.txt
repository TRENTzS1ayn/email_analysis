1. Introduction to the issues considered at the face to face meeting
   and the recent proposals that have been advanced in response
   thereto (Gregg Vanderheiden, 10 minutes).

   to face meeting and the issues considered in analysing the
   structure of the guidelines (Jason White, 5 minutes).

3. More detailed discussion of the analysis carried out by the
   subgroup (10 minutes).

decisions will be taken at this week's teleconference.
