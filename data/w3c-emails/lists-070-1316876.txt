Hello W3C,
Something to consider in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

The problem is described at:
http://petermoulding.com/colour/colourblindness.html
and the enclosed email is feedback from a sufferer.

Does the W3C have a colour test page? I could expand on mine for use in tests.

Peter Moulding

Message: Good to see this - as a mildly red-green colour blind person. (Although interestingly I can distinguish all the 
colours in the very first bar of nine colours.) It is sometimes a source of frustration, to say the least, that colourblindness is 
not mentioned in the context of web design.

That apart I am just getting acquainted with your book (two days in) but it looks good so far. Basically although I already 
had a little, playing around, experience of php and mySQL, my work has me making a web inteface to an MS SQL 
server database and yours looked like a good reference. I'll let you know if further questions come up.
