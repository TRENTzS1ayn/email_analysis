To the group -

As was the case with most of us, I listened with a great deal of interest.  Personally, I like the new direction in terms of looking at accessibility outcomes and not focusing as much on how those outcomes really come about (does not mean I am not concerned about the how part).  

If content can be delivered in an accessible faxshion to a end user, it should not matter what process was used to deliver the end result.  In my mind, we need to stay clear of specific termonologies and techniques that may go away down the road (I believe Matt sort of hinted toward this).  But, we likely need to archive our thought processes as we move forward.  We need to speak to the present with an eye toward tomorrow but not be so specific that we sink the ship in short order.  And, we need to realize that some organizations have already used WCAG 1.0 and any major deviation from those guidelines or the overall look of a new process may seem confusing.  Sort of like, a make up your mind mentality.  

Helping developers cope with the present is paramount even though we can probably peer partly into the future with where we think things may head.  

It will be great to see the next written version that the sub-group comes up with.  What a great deal of work.  

Thanks all -

Doyle Burnett
