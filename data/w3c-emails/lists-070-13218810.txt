Thursday, 3 April, 2000 UTC (4 PM US Eastern, 10 PM France, 7 AM
Eastern Australia) on +1-617-761-6200, passcode 9224:

1. Introduction to the issues considered at the face to face meeting
   and the recent proposals that have been advanced in response
   thereto (Gregg Vanderheiden, 10 minutes).

2. A summary of the work of the "WCAG structure" subgroup at the face
   to face meeting and the issues considered in analysing the
   structure of the guidelines (Jason White, 5 minutes).

3. More detailed discussion of the analysis carried out by the
   subgroup (10 minutes).

4. General questions and discussion (20 minutes).

5. Next steps, action items and closing remarks by teleconference
   participants (15 minutes).

Note: the primary purpose of this teleconference is to orient the discussion
and to start considering central questions emerging from the face to
face meeting. More detailed discussion will take place at subsequent
meetings, however, and it is not anticipated that any significant
decisions will be taken at this week's teleconference.
