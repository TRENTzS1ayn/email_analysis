Hello,
I am sending this on behalf of Tim Boland from NIST.  At the 4 March F2F he 
took an action item to draft "Accessibility Testing Technical 
Documentation." It is based on other W3C Test Suite work (primarily SVG, 
CSS, and UAAG) and outlines possible requirements for a shared ATAG and 
WCAG Test Suite.  We discussed this draft briefly at the 23 March joint 
meeting between the ATAG WG and WCAG WG.
