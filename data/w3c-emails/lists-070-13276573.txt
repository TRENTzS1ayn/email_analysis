Recently I have been explaining the new definitions of ?levels? that we came
up with to people, and found that our current definitions kept raising
questions.? In answering them, I got to thinking about the definitions ? and
how we can make them clearer.?? Below is a suggestion that might cover some
of these questions and include many of ideas we have been discussing.?? 
?
Some of the questions were
?
-???? why is level 1 only AT compatibility?
-???? What about cognitive?? Is that only a level 2 item? -- or Level 3?
-???? If AT compatibility is in level 1 and direct access in level 2 what is
in level 3???        
        Aren?t the level 3 items either AT Access (L1) or Direct access
(L2)? too?
?

The edited version of the three levels is as follows:

?
Level 1 ??Those measures that can provide access without changing or
constraining the presentation of the page - and that can be applied to all
types of web sites.  These items address compatibility of the Web content
with assistive technologies for all disabilities. 
?
Level 2 ? Those measures that allow access without requiring any assistive
technology ? and that can be applied on most or all types of web sites.
These do not address all disabilities but allow many to access pages using
mass market web technologies alone. 

Level 3 ? Those measures that improve access, either directly or via
assistive technology, beyond Level 1 and 2.? Some of these do not apply to
all types of web sites or content.? Some would require multiple
presentations of the information or targeting of the web site to individuals
with particular functional limitations.?
