Agenda

1. To complete the work of the subgroup at the face to face meeting
   that sought to reorganize the guidelines according to the proposed
   categories.

2. To discuss the proposed definitions of the three categories/levels:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2003AprJun/0025.html

Other issues available for analysis:

The implications of the proposed levels for the further development of
the WCAG conformance scheme.

Whether a reorganization of the guidelines according to the proposed
categories would overcome substantial concerns affecting the
development of WCAG 2.0.

Whether the guidelines should be regarded as specifying what ought to
be delivered to the user agent, perhaps via intermediary processing,
rather than what the author must create.

How to ensure that the guidelines remain precise, while taking
account of changes in user agents and assistive technologies, wherever
the latter may reside on the network.

The upgrade path from WCAG 1.0 to WCAG 2.0: how it is to be explained,
and whether relatively straightforward WCAG 2.0 conformance profiles
can be constructed that correspond approximately to the three WCAG 1.0
conformance levels.

The role to be played by the concept of a "user agent baseline" in the
WCAG conformance scheme - if the guidelines specify what the user
agent must receive, rather than what the author is required to
produce, then it would appear that the concept of a "user agent
baseline" should play an important part in defining how the guidelines
apply, notwithstanding changes in technology.

It is not expected that all, or even most of these issues will be
considered at the meeting; the purpose of this list is to indicate
some of the major questions that still remain open.
