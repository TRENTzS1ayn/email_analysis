Hello,

Last week we used the queue management feature of Zakim.  These features 
are provided via a the phone bridge and an IRC bot connected to the phone 
bridge.  Zakim allows us to mute noisy lines and identify callers.  It also 
allows people to "raise their hands" to get into queue.  To do this, press 
"41#" on your telephone keypad or if you are using IRC, type "q+".

For example:
If I press "41#" on my telephone keypad, Zakim displays the following in IRC:
[13:04] * Zakim hears Wendy's hand up
[13:04] * Zakim sees Wendy on the speaker queue

In IRC, I can ask Zakim for the list of people in the queue:
[13:04] <wendy> zakim, q?
[13:04] <Zakim> I see Bill, Sue, Wendy on the speaker queue

Once I begin speaking, I can acknowledge myself:
[13:04] <wendy> ack wendy
[13:04] * Zakim sees no one on the speaker queue

To add myself back into the queue, in IRC I can type:
[13:04] <wendy> q+
[13:04] * Zakim sees wendy on the speaker queue

If you have any questions, please let me know.
