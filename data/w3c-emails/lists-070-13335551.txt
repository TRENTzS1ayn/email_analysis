Hello!
I appreciate, also as AC Rep, the section "10.1 Member and Invited Expert
participation" that is more elastic than the Section 4.2.4 of the Process
Document[1]

About experts that are not of W3C organization, how they could be "invited"
and how they could partecipate?

Hello,

A draft charter is available at:
http://www.w3.org/2002/10/wcag-charter-draft.html
It does not yet include the appropriate language suggested by the QA
Activity, ala their template at:
http://www.w3.org/QA/WG/2003/02/OpsET-charter

Best,
