Subject: User Agent Content Question



Let's see how to pose this question.

A company wants to convert Powerpoint slides as web content.  They are
planning on using the U of Illinois web export wizard that converts the
Powerpoint slides to HTML (the wizard also produces associated CCS).  Upon
basic review it is noticed that the converted files render well in all the
major Windows-based browsers and are screen readable.  However, on a
Macintosh running OS-X, using the latest Internet Explorer, the pages did
not render nor did they render in Apple's Safari browser.  However, the same
files did render in Netscape, OmniWeb, Mozilla and iCab (all Mac browsers).
