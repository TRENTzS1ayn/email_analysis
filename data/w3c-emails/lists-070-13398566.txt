Here's the question...a pretty good conversion tool in the making (some
problems but a good start) but not all browsers support it's final output.
I am going to leave the question open-ended and only ask, how would those of
you in the group deal with this issue?  A few more questions follow:

Would you point people toward a browser that will work?  Would you save the
Powerpoint document as Rich Text/Outline as well as actual Powerpoint
presentation and let folks download the two?  Would you re-do the Powerpoint
slides in HTML from scratch?  Would you say, the majority of screen reader
users use Windows so who cares about Mac users?


Roberto:
I've found this one:

U can also create your presonalized templates:
http://www.rdpslides.com/ppt2html/FAQ00068.htm

it costs less than 50 USD ;-)
