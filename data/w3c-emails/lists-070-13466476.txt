I agree with Michele.
This issue will also reduce the necessity of using the 'lang' attribute
inside pages.

Most screen-reader users told me that the 'lang' attribute cause screen
readers to change vocal rendering engine, with some trouble. So it is
problematic to conform to guidelines and at the same time not to hurt
such users (I don't know what to do in most cases). Reducing the foreign
words would help, if not solve. Obviously this is just a side effect: I
agree with the basic arguments of Michele proposal.
