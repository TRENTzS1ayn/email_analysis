I am not sure what you are proposing here. What Gregg argued at the
face to face meeting was that in order for the guidelines to be widely
adopted and implemented, it must be possible to conform at a minimum
level without imposing constraints on the author's expression and
presentational style. That is to say, the accessibility would be
achieved by way of markup and other forms of machine-readable content,
including, potentially but not necessarily, metadata, sufficient to
enable highly accessible presentations to be generated by "mainstream"
user agents, assistive technologies, or both.


Roberto:
Hi, an IWA/HWG member has developed an interesting thing for WCAG 1.0 that i
think could be implemented:

http://www.prato.linux.it/~gbartolini/it/wcag/

The tool (in Italian, but he is working for english version) let the user to
"check" the values of conformity, offering at the end a "page accessibility
policy". This also could be integrated with languages like EARL and/or using
formats like P3P for have an XML document that contain all the conformance
checkpoint soddisfed.

What do u think about?
