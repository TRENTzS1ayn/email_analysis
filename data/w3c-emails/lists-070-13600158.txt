Hello,

I've made changes to the draft charter [1] to incorporate the Quality 
Assurance (QA) suggestions [2].  They are marked in red as prefaced with 
the phrase, "New for QA:"  I also made the minor editorial comments 
discussed at last week's telecon:
1. in "mission" replaced "produce guidelines for the development of 
accessible Web content"  with "produce guidelines for accessible Web content"
2. in "scope" made "W3C Recommendations" in the 2nd bullet link to the list 
of W3C Recommendations.
3. in "deliverables"  Replaced "Requirements for Techniques" with the 
correct title of "Requirements for WCAG 2.0 Checklists and Techniques"

In the QA template charter, it has a section for milestones [3].  I did not 
add a milestone section but added a bullet to the list of deliverables that 
says, "A list of proposed  milestones, to be updated accordingly" and links 
to a separate page of milestones.  We have something like this in our 
current charter. [4]
