Hello,

We expect to publish a public Working Draft of WCAG 2.0 in the next 2 
weeks.  Since we do not have consensus about reorganization or changes to 
the conformance scheme, this next draft will continue to use the old scheme 
but should outline the issues we are discussing. It will also link to a 
summary of the proposals (this summary page is not yet available). I have 
drafted text that attempts to outline both the current scheme (i.e., now 
considered the "old" scheme) and the issues with it.  Please review and be 
prepared to discuss at tomorrow's telecon.

http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2003/04/16-proposals.html

If we adopt this draft (or one with edits), it will replace the existing 
"Conformance" [1] and "Appendix B" [2] that exist in the 8 January 2003 
Working Draft.

Thank you,
--wendy
