We started the teleconference on April 16 2003 by reporting on reviews of
test files we took on from last week. We discussed specific issues of alt
text, title attributes, longdesc and d-links, alternative content for
object, accesskey, tabindex, and table summary/caption. We noted that the
work on developing techniques and test files are closely inter-related. The
UAAG test suite has good stuff for us to use, and also areas in which we
could contribue. We would like to inventory a number of existing test suites
and implementation reports for our work. At this time we want to dump all
the relevant information into a location to start discussion and feed into
the XML files when we're ready for that. We will use the Bugzilla database
hosted by Trace and will prepare that over the next couple weeks.

We took note of the following implementation reports for HTML to use as
resources:
UAAG Implementation Report: http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/impl-rec/
Index DOT Html Reference: http://www.blooberry.com/indexdot/html/index.html
HTML Compendium: http://htmlcompendium.org/
