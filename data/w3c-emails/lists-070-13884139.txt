I see that WAI is managing to top itself.

And when was the message going to start doing that?

White text on a black background sounds like a nice legible
combination to me. Isn't that what we use in, say, print?

For "those people," in other words.

In this simple paragraph, we at last see a confirmation that Web
Accessibility Initiative contributors hold good visual design in
outright contempt. Background images are, after all, "of no real
value," it has been decreed.

> Graphical text headers and graphical buttons

...and of course to the many readers who appreciate good visual
design, including people with disabilities, such as deaf or
mobility-impaired persons.

Of course, those groups simply *are less important* than people with
cognitive impairments, for whom the entire Web must be overthrown on
the unproven contention that it will make the Web less inaccessible
for them.

> Background sounds are typically sound bytes of non-vocal types.

Oh?

> Therefore, they don't really offer any value to the hearing impaired.

If we took this reasoning to its ultimate, non-vocal music programs
would not be captioned, nor would any soundtrack orchestration. Are
you ready to defend this denial of accessibility?

You don't see any HTML on that page?

Aren't they delivered by HTTP in cases other than dedicated streams?

How do these multimedia presentations fail to be Web pages?

I also appreciate this confirmation that Web Accessibility
Initiative contributors are now willing to micromanage, on pain of
refusal of WAI accessibility certificate, the editing of every audio
track on the Web.

Ah, yes. Useless and meaningless images.

Really, they all are, aren't they?

It does clarify the delusionalism and extremism of certain Web
Accessibility Initiative proposed practices, yes. It even clearly
clarifies them. What it *adds a level of* not previously encountered
is, I think, something else.
