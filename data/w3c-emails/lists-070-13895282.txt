I guess one thing stays unspoken: Usability and several accessibility
aspects (sometimes) are subjective. And I noticed that usability/accessibility
topics were mixed up with content related themes.

For some users white-on-black text might be legible, for others it is not.
For some users (and even the designers), some images (background or not) make
sense, others won't agree. There are far more examples, related to as well
accessibility as content... 'Common sense' is necessary, that's right...
