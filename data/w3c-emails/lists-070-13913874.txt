I'm confused why, just because you disagree with what one of the
people on the working group says, you have to make this all about
how screwed up the entire Web Accessibility Initiative is, instead
of just realizing that you, a member of the WAI working group,
disagree with the statement of another member of the WAI working
group.

It really seems counter-productive if you're waiting for any person
to speak up and say something you disagree with, just so that you
can leap up with righteous rage and condemn the entire process.

Surely it would be better to try to convince, rather than condemn,
and thus strive to promote that W3C elusive goal, "consensus"?
