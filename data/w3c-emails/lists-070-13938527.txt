Here are a list of Web sites I found a while ago that provide interesting
information about color contrast:

http://www.firelily.com/opinions/color.html 
http://www.tesspub.com/colours.html 
http://more.btexact.com/people/rigdence/colours/ 
http://www.vischeck.com/index.php  
http://www.colormatters.com/entercolormatters.html
http://www.internettg.org/newsletter/mar99/accessibility_color_challenged.ht
ml 

I thought the last one was particularly interesting and useful, and the
author of that might be a resource we would want to contact for help in
figuring out a contrast algorithm, since this person already created an
applet that simulates the effect of various color combinations with various
color vision problems.
