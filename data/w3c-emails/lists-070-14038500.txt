W3C Server Issue: The Content-Type header is sending charset=UTF-8 which 
overrides the XML Prolog which claims ISO-8859-1.  This causes extended 
characters that are valid in ISO-8859-1 but not in UTF-8 such as the 
copyright character to appear as diamonds with a question mark in them 
in Mozilla.  The W3C HTML Validator even caught this:

"Sorry, I am unable to validate this document because on lines 87, 89 
it contained one or more bytes that I cannot interpret as utf-8 (in 
other words, the bytes found are not valid values in the specified 
Character Encoding). Please check both the content of the file and the 
character encoding indication."

Editors listing:
It would be nice if the list of editors were hyperlinked to the 
respective companies/organizations and depending on existence and editor 
preference, either the editor's personal page or e-mail address.

The second reviewers note in Checkpoint 5.4 has a missing space between 
"WCAG 2.0" and "refer".

Quotation mark style is inconsistent.  Some places use hacker-style in 
which the punctuation is outside the quotation marks.  Other places use 
standard English style with punctuation inside the quotation marks.
Compare: Type "this."Standard Style
          Type "this".Hacker Style
See http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/Hacker-Writing-Style.html for 
some more examples.  As this is technical documentation, I prefer Hacker 
Style.  Whichever is chosen, it should be consistent.
