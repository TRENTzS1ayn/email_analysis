Brant,
The document was fixed, republished and validates. Thanks for catching this.
Your other comments are good.  We'll make those changes in the source for

re: linking to editors' companies: it is not typical W3C style to link to 
organizations. None of the editors want to include email addresses because 
we are already dealing with an abundance of spam.

Thank you,
--wendy
