Hi,

I've had a read of the new working draft and have a number of comments.
Please note text in double quotation marks ( " ) are directly from the
document. My comments in bullets underneath.  Please note these are my
comments for Guideline 2 only (Guideline 1 sent previously_ - will make
comments on other guidelines over the next few days.

"Checkpoint 2.1 Ensure that all of the functionality is operable at a
minimum through a keyboard or keyboard interface.
Success criteria
You will have successfully met Checkpoint 2.1 at the Minimum Level if:
- all of the functionality of the content where the functionality or its
outcome can be expressed concisely in words is operable at a minimum
through a keyboard or keyboard interface."
   Why should it matter whether functionality can be expressed in words as
   to whether you should be able to operate via a keyboard?  Also the
   checkpoint is not particularly clear

"Checkpoint 2.2 Allow users to control any time limits on their reading,
interaction or responses unless control is not possible due to the nature
of real-time events or competition.
Success criteria
You will have successfully met Checkpoint 2.2 at the Minimum Level if:
- at least one of the following is true for each time limit:
--- the user is allowed to deactivate the time limits,
---or the user is allowed to adjust the time limit over a wide range which
is at least 10 times the average user's preference,
---or the user is warned before time expires and given at least 10 seconds
to extend the time limit,
---or the time limit is due to a real-time event (e.g. auction) and no
alternative to the time limit is possible,
---or the time limit is part of a competitive activity where timing is an
essential part of the activity (e.g. competitive gaming or time based
testing).
You will have successfully met Checkpoint 2.2 at Level 2 if:
-(presently no additional criteria for this level.) "
   I believe under Level 2 we should include the ability to START the
   interaction from WHERE it stopped.  So, for example, if you have a
   "Breaking News" scrollbar, and press "Stop", when you click "Refresh" it
   starts the scrollbar from the same point - not the beginning?

"Checkpoint 2.3 Avoid causing the screen to flicker.
Success criteria
You will have successfully met Checkpoint 2.3 at the Minimum Level if:
At least one of the following is true:
- content was not designed to flicker (or flash) in the range of 3 to 49
Hz.
- if flicker is unavoidable, the user is warned of the flicker before they
go to the page, and as close a version of the content as is possible
without flicker is provided."
   Should we include in here particular types of geometrical shapes/lines
   and movement that are known to cause migraines and epilepsy?

Cheers,
Gian
