Using Dict.org:

From WordNet (r) 1.7 :
  web site
       n : a computer connected to the internet that maintains a series
           of web pages on the World Wide Web; "the Israeli web site
           was damaged by hostile hackers" [syn: internet site, site]
From The Free On-line Dictionary of Computing (09 FEB 02) :
  web site

      (Not "website") Any computer on the
     Internet running a World-Wide Web server process.  A
     particular web site is identified by the hostname part of a
     URL.  Multiple hostnames may actually map to the same
     computer in which case they are known as "{virtual servers".

     (1997-02-05)
The Jason's proposed definition:

"Web site:
A linked collection of Web resources created, aggregated or controlled by
a single administrative entity, which can be accessed via a URI. Examples of
administrative entities
include governmental departments, public and private corporations, and
individuals. Web sites may include interactive user interfaces,
multimedia and other forms of content."

could be adapted, with receipt of official dictionary words (and respecting
the "plain language"), with this sentence:

"Web site:
Any computer connected to the internet that maintains a series of web pages
on the World Wide Web, controlled and managed by a single administrative
entity, like governmental departments, public/private corporations or
individuals, which can be accessed via a URI (link to "URI" definition) and
include web contents (link to "Web Content" definition) that request
interaction with user agents (link to "User Agent" definition)."

I think we need to apply a similar definition to explain to the WCAG readers
that the web site is made with "web content" (that request WCAG) that are
usable with user agents (that request UAAG).

This is MHO :)

Subject: Alternative definition of "Web site"



At today's meeting I took an action item to draft an alternative
definition of "Web site" derived from observations I made during the
meeting. I don't necessarily support this proposal; it is merely
presented as an alternative to what was suggested at the face to face
meeting.

Web site:
A linked collection of Web resources created, aggregated or controlled by
a single administrative entity, which can be accessed via a URI. Examples of
administrative entities
include governmental departments, public and private corporations, and
individuals. Web sites may include interactive user interfaces,
multimedia and other forms of content.

Doubtless this proposal can be improved.
