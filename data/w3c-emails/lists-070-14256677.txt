To: Web Content Guidelines<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>


Someone pointed out to me in private e-mail that a Web site can be
controlled by several different entities. For example an internet
service provider may host users' content on its Web site; that content
itself is created and controlled by each individual.

In that case the conformance claim would have to say, for example:

This Web site, excluding personal pages created by users of the
service, meets WCAG 2.0 at the minimum level.

Or if users are bound by an accessibility policy that the hosting
provider has set, there need be no such exclusion.

I don't think we need to be too precise about what we mean by "Web
site", because we aren't using the term to draw any normative
distinctions in the guidelines, and thus whether a certain collection
of resources counts as one Web site or two doesn't matter so long as
the conformance claim is clear as to what is and isn't covered.
