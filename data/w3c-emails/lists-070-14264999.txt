 To The Group -

Jason, I do like the basic approach you took and have some things
I'd like to add.  First, I will say what the basic additions might be and
then add them to what you previously wrote.  

1.  Web sites may well have linked and un-linked resources such
that individuals are directed to a URI that may not be publically
available.  

I may choose to tell a client to go to a certain page by
directing them there via e-mail or a phone call.  The information they 
receive is under the same domain name but not at all available to
"just" anyone.  This information is part of the web site as I see it.  

I only added, "or un-linked" below.  

Web site:

A linked (or un-linked) collection of Web resources created, aggregated or
controlled by
a single administrative entity, which can be accessed via a URI. Examples of
administrative entities
include governmental departments, public and private corporations, and
individuals. Web sites may include interactive user interfaces,
multimedia and other forms of content.

Subject: Alternative definition of "Web site"
 
At today's meeting I took an action item to draft an alternative
definition of "Web site" derived from observations I made during the
meeting. I don't necessarily support this proposal; it is merely
presented as an alternative to what was suggested at the face to face
meeting.
 
Web site:
A linked collection of Web resources created, aggregated or controlled by
a single administrative entity, which can be accessed via a URI. Examples of
administrative entities
include governmental departments, public and private corporations, and
individuals. Web sites may include interactive user interfaces,
multimedia and other forms of content.
 
Doubtless this proposal can be improved.
