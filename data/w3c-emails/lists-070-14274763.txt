Hum... this will exclude all the web sites CMS-generated from the WCAG
check...

Also, remembering the claim of WCAG 1.0 [1], in "Scope of the claim" there
is the following text:
"By default, a conformance icon refers to a single page. If the claim is
meant to apply to include more than one page, the conformance icon must be
accompanied by explicit scope information explaining which pages are covered
by the claim."

So, IMHO, is not possible to said "This Web Site .... .meets WCAG 2.0 at the
minimum level" but the claim must be done per single page. If *and only if*
all the page conform would be possible to said "This web site meets WCAG 2.0
...".

Also, would be best to have a conformance claim page by page and/or a unique
web site definition for level areas reached like in the P3P Policy [2]: here
follow an idea about how different policy/conformance claims could be
assigned to different folder.

These my two cents :)
