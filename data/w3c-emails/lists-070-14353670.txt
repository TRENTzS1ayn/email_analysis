Subject: regrets for 8, 15, 22 May. Need volunteers to take minutes



Hello,

I will probably not be able to attend the 8, 15, and 22 May teleconferences
because I will be traveling, in face-to-face meetings, and attending a
conference over the next couple of weeks. We need minute takers for each of
these days.  I will be available via email if you have any questions or
concerns.

Information about the meeting template is available at:

Thank you,
--wendy
