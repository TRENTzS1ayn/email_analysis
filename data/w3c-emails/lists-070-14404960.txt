Today I have a monthly staff meeting so unfortunately won't be able to be in
the call to defend my definition of content. One thing to say in case it's

definition (encoding and media type) are essential to the definition. The
remaining bullet points could be modified or removed, I put them there just
to see how they sit. Michael
