We received comments from the W3M (W3C Management) review of the 
charter.  Two changes were required. I made them and republished the 
charter at:  http://www.w3.org/2002/10/wcag-charter-draft.html
The WG needs to also approve the changes and then the charter should be 
ready to move forward for consideration by the Advisory Committee

1.
The first paragraph under Deliverables used to say:
The WCAG WG has been working on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 
(WCAG) 2.0 since November 2000. The Working Group will continue to work on 
the following deliverables:
===

Now it says:
The WCAG WG has been working on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 
(WCAG) 2.0 since November 2000 and seeks to renew the charter to finish the 
work. Addressing a breadth of technologies, reformulating the priority 
scheme, and writing a suite of documents that meet the Requirements for 
WCAG 2.0 has taken longer than anticipated. The Working Group will continue 
to work on the following deliverables:
===

2.
10.3 IPR, used to say:
W3C promotes an open working environment. Whenever possible, technical 
decisions should be made unencumbered by intellectual property right (IPR) 
claims.

This is a Royalty Free Working Group as described in the 24 January 2002 
version of W3C's Current Patent Practice.

Working Group participants disclose patent claims by sending email to 
<patent-issues@w3.org>; please see Current Patent Practice for more 
information about disclosures.

If and when W3C institutes a more formal patent policy, the WCAG WG charter 
will be revised, following the recommendations of the Patent Policy Working 
Group in a manner consistent with the IPR goals of the current charter: 
that the WCAG WG produce deliverables that ought to be implementable 
royalty-free.
===

It now says:
W3C promotes an open working environment. Whenever possible, technical 
decisions should be made unencumbered by intellectual property right (IPR) 
claims.

This is a Royalty Free Working Group, as described in W3C's Current Patent 
Practice.

Working Group participants disclose patent claims by sending email to 
<patent-issues@w3.org>; please see Current Patent Practice for more 
information about disclosures.

Patent disclosures relevant to this Working Group may be found on the WCAG 
Working Group's patent disclosure page in conformance with W3C policy.
