defn of content

if look at content and web resources: content says "anything rendered by 
user agent" resource
"...and rendered by UA" thus, resource is any content accessed through web 
protocols.
except resources lists things not listed under content
if content is anything rendered by UA and accessed through protocols. 
resources is a subset of content.
circularity. content is anything rendered by ua. ua is anything that 
renders content.
anything rendered by UA implies image and text.  to say anything between 
start and end tag would mean "just text"
since img referenced by attribute
don't see are the other aspects, alt-tag renderable by ua but text? content?
seems to miss out on functonality.
what is the defn of functionality?
what about format info?
info sent to ua but how rendered is up to ua
is that content?
perhaps content is any info sent to ua?
defn from UAAG is written technical. there are items of content that don't 
appear in a DOM.
but are part of content
want more restrictive defn or broader?
perhaps to a thing can have content and ua features, our guidelines apply 
to only content-like features.
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/1999JulSep/0203.html
might be ok for defn to be circular
put Web in front of content, these are running on devices that support a 
variety of mime types
is #3 a defn?
It is used in the terms non-text content and text content"
basically a see also
Brainstorming - an even fuzzier definition perhaps, but maybe content is 
"information transmitted to a user"
"info conveyed to users"

ways that we use "content" in the current draft: non-text content, content 
and structure, foreground content, "characters and words in the content",
"elements in teh content", facilitate content orientation and navigation,
structure within content, content and controls, ability of content to work 
with technology, technologies relied upon by the content, Web-based content
Web content and sites

what we mean is a part or a section or a complete web page
all of those terms could be replaced by section
not just page - site or application
"anything rendered by ua" might pick up all that we need.
might work. might not want to take as normative uaag defn
if so, then need to discuss with UAWG

action michael: propose new defn for word content (try for monday, 5 may)
action gian: go through document looking at use of the word content.
look for ambiguous uses, places where it could be replaced with anothe 
word, etc.
(try for early next week)

what about the debatable items?
michael will consider while drafting

===
defn of user agent

web applications are user agent
web resources: use similar to uaag defn

===
defn of web site

network: ambiguous
single uri?
same server? same ip address?
http://www.phoenix5.org/glossary/Web_site.html
A web site is a collection or combination of linked resources that can be 
accessed and rendered through or started from a single URI
also a definition could be find here: 
http://hostingworks.com/support/dict.phtml?foldoc=web+site
it's the URI that we focus on.
if you in a uri, anything with that base uri is the site.
every page is a different uri
http://www.w3.org/1999/05/WCA-terms/
think that http://www.w3.org/1999/05/WCA-terms/ need a working group for 
mantain updated :-/
there is a w3c glossary project underway :)
QA is taking responsibility
use defn from f2f until hear otherwise
prefer the administrative defn
currently overbroad and doesn' thave much meaning

action jason: draft a defn for web site based on today's discussion
