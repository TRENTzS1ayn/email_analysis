Hi,

I've gone through and looked at all the uses of the word "content" in WCAG
2.0, and in nearly all cases it means "web information" or "information".
The following are examples of this - I have replaced the word "content"
with the word "information" or "web information", and preceded it with an
asterisk.
   This document outlines design principles for creating accessible Web
   *information. When these principles are ignored, individuals with
   disabilities may not be able to access the *information at all, or they
   may be able to do so only with great difficulty. When these principles
   are employed, they also make Web *information accessible to a variety of
   Web-enabled devices, such as phones, handheld devices, kiosks, network
   appliances, etc. By making *information accessible to a variety of
   devices, that *information will also be accessible to people in a
   variety of situations.
   You will have successfully met Checkpoint 1.1 at the Minimum Level if,
   non-text *information that can be expressed in words has a
   text-equivalent explicitly associated with it, and non-text *information
   that can not be expressed in words has a descriptive label provided as
   its text-equivalent.
   A text equivalent:
     serves the same function as the non-text *information was intended to
     serve.
     communicates the same information as the non-text *information was
     intended to convey.
     may contain structured *information or metadata.
   Presentation that emphasizes structure:
     enables users with cognitive and visual disabilities to orient
     themselves within the *information
     enables all users to move quickly through the *information and notice
     major content divisions
     enables all users, but particularly users with visual or cognitive
     disabilities to focus on important *information,
     enables all users, but particularly users with visual or cognitive
     disabilities to distinguish the different types of *information

There are a few occasions where the word "web site" is more appropriate,
for example:
   the *information can be presented on a variety of devices because the
   device software can choose only those elements of the *web site that it
   is able to display and display them in the most effective way for that
   device
   Checkpoint 5.2: Ensure that technologies relied upon by the *web site
   are declared and widely available

Am looking forward to discussing this at the teleconference tomorrow!

Cheers,
Gian
