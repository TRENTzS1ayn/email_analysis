Actually, let's not assume that "order in Lynx" and "order with
style sheets turned off in a graphical browser" are going to be
the same, nor that either of them will equate to "order which is best
for a screenreader."

The idea of PROPER linearization of content for different media types
is not yet a solved problem. It's not easy; on the contrary, it's quite
difficult.

I don't really expect that someone should feel an obligation to spend
as much effort on presentation in Lynx as they do on the presentation
in IE.  That seems a weird request.

I do agree that structure-first is a relatively decent way to design
a site, but it makes more sense to design structure and presentation as
different sides of the same coin, and then use something like XSLT or
server-side includes or other server techniques to combine them together
rather than insisting that one has to flow from the other.
