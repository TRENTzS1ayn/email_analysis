Here are some notes on the vote about whether to go forward from her using
the new reorganization to work from.. or whether we should drop this and
continue forward using the older version.   

LGR - yes - use the new one.
MC - yes (pretty much) I'd like to see it in action a little more.  But I
don't have as many concerns with the new form as I did with the old -- so
yes. I vote yes.
MM - yes
Jibari - yes
RS - yes
LS - yes
Katie - yes  
Gian - no -  I have concerns 
JW - yes
Andi - yes
GV - yes
JS - yes
CS - yes
RE - yes
BF - yes

Gian -  concern was with ability to do multiple levels of conformance - A,
AA, AAA.    - If we can do multiple levels of conformance then votes yes

Vote is unanimous for going with new reorganization if it is possible to do
more than just two levels of conformance.

Roberto, is this the vote you are referring to?

GV: I'd like to walk around and get a Yes or Has Reservations for everyone.
      (Gian had reservations.)
...
GV: So after this discussion, is it unanimous with the people on the call
today that we move to the new reorganization? <<yes>> We'll move this to be
the new working document.
