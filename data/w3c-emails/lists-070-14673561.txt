Hi,
in an italian discussion list a partecipant has post this url:



     Ergonomics of human-system interaction -- Guidance on accessibility for
human-computer interfaces


http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=30858&ICS1=13&ICS2=180&ICS3


            Abstract
            ISO/TS 16071:2002 provides guidance on the design of accessible
(work, home, education) software. It covers issues associated with designing
accessible software for people with the widest range of visual, hearing,
motor and cognitive abilities, including those who are elderly and
temporarily disabled. ISO/TS 16071:2002 addresses software considerations
for accessibility that complement general design for usability covered by
ISO 9241-10 to ISO 9241-17 and ISO 13407.

            ISO/TS 16071:2002 addresses the accessibility of interactive
systems. It addresses a wide range of solutions, including office
applications, web pages and multimedia. It does not provide recommendations
for the design of hardware.

            ISO/TS 16071:2002 promotes increased usability of systems in
combination with assistive technologies, when they are required. It does not
cover the behaviour or requirements of assistive technologies themselves
(including assistive software).
