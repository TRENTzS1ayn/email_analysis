Agenda

The purpose of the meeting is to discuss issues emerging from the
reformulation of WCAG 2.0 which, at last week's meeting, it was agreed
we should take up as the basis of our next draft.

An internal working draft may be ready for consideration by Thursday;
Ben is hard at work fine-tuning the XML markup and preparing the
document for internal review by the working group. If the draft isn't
available by Thursday's meeting it should be ready early next week.

Major items for discussion include:

1. Identifying issues raised in public comments on earlier drafts of
   WCAG 2.0 and determining which of them apply to the reformulation.
   We also need to decide which issues should be resolved before
   making an updated draft available for public review on the W3C's
   Technical Reports page.

2. Technological compatibility and interoperability, i.e., the
   checkpoints that were formerly under guideline 5 of the WCAG 2.0
   working draft. See in particular Cynthia's discussion of what was
   formerly checkpoint 5.3:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2003JanMar/0309.html

3. Definition of "content" (see last week's agenda for references).

4. Editorial issues surrounding the presentation of the guidelines, if
   the new draft is available by Thursday.

Another major item which we probably won't have time to discuss in
detail this week concerns the requirements for valid conformance
claims and the distinction between what is required in order to
achieve minimal conformance, and what should be "reportable" via
textual claims, conformance icons and metadata, respectively.
