PRESENT

DISCUSSION
These two meetings were focused on going through HTML Techniques issues that
have been logged in Bugzilla. Actions were taken on issues, typically to
assign it to someone on the call to explore the issue in more detail or to
make a proposal to the group for a solution. 

ACTION ITEMS
Action items are defined by the assignments in Bugzilla. It should start
emailing us to make sure we're on top of them.

FUTURE MEETINGS
Following the the results of the actions taken on in the past two meetings,
we will need to discuss issues that come up and start writing techniques
around issues that are closed.
