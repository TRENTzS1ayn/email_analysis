A suggestion for refer to bugs in this list (also for let the user order
them)
Why don't start the message with the object [Bxxx] where xxx is the number
of the bug=

in this case the object could be:

"[B248] Table Techniques - Layout"

This will made more clear the read and the follow-up of the messages per
bug.
