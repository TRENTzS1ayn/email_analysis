(This is an item assigned to me in the WCAG Bugzilla at:
http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=188
)

There is a section in the HTML Techniques which suggests using the 
object element in place of frames.

Due to current practice in the browsers, using object is only 
theoretically a better solution, and we do not expect this to change in 
terms of how various user agents render text/html objects differently. 
Further, newer specs, like XHTML 1.0 Strict and XHTML 1.1, do not 
define frames in their DTDs, so there is no point in telling people 
using those DTDs not to use frames, as it will be the default until 
XFrames is released.

I propose that this technique be removed.
