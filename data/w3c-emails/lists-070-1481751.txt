Not a one-to-one correspondence, but certainly close enough for most uses.

Most Web pages aren't that complex. Other than data tables (and how 
often do those really appear?), most information *is* linear. Let's not 
overcomplicate this unnecessarily. A rule of thumb doesn't have to cover 
every instance, just the majority.

It does, which is why I didn't make it. My point was that non-CSS 
browsers in general (with Lynx as an example) should not be second-class 
citizens who get whatever is left over after CSS is removed. In reality, 
structuring content appropriately works well for both CSS and non-CSS 
browsers. When you consider the time required to add CSS, obviously more 
time will be spent for CSS versions. Making sure that both CSS and 
non-CSS browsers work well with your pages is not the same thing as 
"spend[ing] as much effort on presentation in Lynx as... in IE." In 
fact, if the structure is good, presentation in Lynx (and Netscape 2, 
etc.) should look good with virtually no effort.

Who said anything about one flowing from the other? Mark up the content, 
mark up the structure, then worry about presentation. That these occur 
in sequence does not mean that one flows from the other.

The structure of content depends on the internal relationships within 
that content. A heading is a heading. A subheading is a subheading. It's 
not about where it goes on the page or what type face is used or what 
color it is. It is about its relationship to the subsequent paragraphs; 
it's about the relationship of the parts to the whole and to each other.

Similarly, a paragraph is a paragraph. It encapsulates, ideally, one 
concept. Generally, it has some relationship to the paragraphs 
immediately preceding or following it.

These relationships exist independent of the presentation.

Moving chunks around on a page -- like putting the navigation bar above 
vs. on the left -- has nothing to do with structure. It has to do with 
layout. Let's not get these confused.
