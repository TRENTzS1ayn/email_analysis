The techniques subgroup will begin sending issues to the larger group that
need discussion. These issues are generally stored in an instance of
Bugzilla and we have adopted a convention for identifying the bug number in
the subject line as shown in this message. These are internal reference
numbers for our use so don't get thrown off by them, but please do retain
them in replies.

The issue I would like to raise comes from a suggestion about a way to do
auto-redirect in HTML. The standard way to do this is to use a <meta>
element to mimic an HTTP refresh header, e.g., 

<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="http://www.watchfire.com/" />

The suggestion was that we use the "location" header, e.g., 

<meta http-equiv="Location" content="http://www.watchfire.com/" />

I tested this in IE6 and Mozilla 1.2 and it did not work. Further, according
to my understanding of HTTP, it theoretically should not work. Therefore I
propose that we declare this a "non-technique" and close the issue, and need
the group's approval.
