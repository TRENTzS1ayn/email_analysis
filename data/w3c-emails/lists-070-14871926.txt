It is RFC 1945 [1]

10.11 Location

The Location response-header field defines the exact location of the
resource that was identified by the Request-URI. For 3xx responses, the
location must indicate the server's preferred URL for automatic redirection
to the resource. Only one absolute URL is allowed.


       Location       = "Location" ":" absoluteURI
An example is


       Location: http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/NewLocation.html
