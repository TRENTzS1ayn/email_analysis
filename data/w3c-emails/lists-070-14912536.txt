The following criteria and comments are based on discussions of late and
some comments sent to me -- and are submitted to the list to start
discussion on this topic.

POTENTIAL CRITERIA BE FOR PLACING 
ITEMS IN SUCCESS CRITERIA VS. BEST PRACTICE


#1 Criteria :  Wherever the working group thinks they should be

Other Criteria:
- All required items must be testable.
- All required items on the CORE items must be doable on all sites.

- The required items for the Extended checkpoints would not necessarily be
doable on all sites, but it would probably be good - so that sites could
strive for meeting them all.

- The Best practice items might be testable or they may not.   Not sure.  
If not testable it makes things a lot easier.  And more good advice can get
in there.  But then it is less likely that they will be picked up in
'required' practices (since they will not be testable).

- There is also a question of the line between the 'best practice' lists and
the techniques docs.    I think we will need to have some in but don't know
where the line is.   Maybe we don't put techniques in except where there are
no hard guidelines or much more than a general guideline possible. So the
techniques are needed to provide guidance and clarity.  

Perhaps we could say that an item goes in "best practice" rather
than techniques if all or most of the following requirements are met:

1. Following the "best practice" item would significantly enhance the
   quality of implementation of the checkpoint, or substantially
   improve the accessibility of the content.

2. The "best practice" item is always, or almost always applicable
   whenever the checkpoint is - in other words, it is relevant in most
   circumstances under which the checkpoint is to be implemented.

3. The "best practice" item is not technology-specific.

4. The "best practice" item would only be used in content targeted to
   the needs of a particular audience, that is, it carries
   implementation of the checkpoint to the highest standard.
