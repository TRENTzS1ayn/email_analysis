Since this one keeps coming up in our conversations, I thought I'd go ahead
and add an issue to our issues list and put forth a proposal for it...

Issue #285 [1] suggests that given the May 2003 restructuring changes and
the move toward the use of core and extended checkpoints, the name "Core
Techniques" has the potential to create some confusion. 

I propose that we change "Core Techniques" to "Cross-Technology Techniques."
