CURRENT CRITERIA BE FOR PLACING 
ITEMS IN SUCCESS CRITERIA VS. BEST PRACTICE


#1 Criteria :  Wherever the working group thinks they should be

Other Criteria:
- All required items must be testable.
- All required items on the CORE items must be doable on all sites.

- The required items for the Extended checkpoints would not necessarily be
doable on all sites, but it would probably be good - so that sites could
strive for meeting them all.

- The Best practice items do not need to be reliably testable. 
However, we want to track the different items and mark them as [TESTABLE] if
they are testable.

- it was not clear to the group if there should be just two levels  (minimum
and best practices) or if there should be three (with a second testable
level after minimum).   We are therefore holding this issue open and using
the [TESTABLE] marking technique so that we can go back later and examine
this issue after we have reviewed the reorganization and all of the items.
The concern is that if we put everything in best practices (that cannot be
claimed in conformance) then it is less likely that they will be picked up
in 'required' practices (since they will not be testable or reportable).



TECHNIQUES VS BEST PRACTICE ITEMS.

- There is also a question of the line between the 'best practice' lists and
the techniques docs.    I think we will need to have some in but don't know
where the line is.   Maybe we don't put techniques in except where there are
no hard guidelines or much more than a general guideline possible. So the
techniques are needed to provide guidance and clarity.  

Perhaps we could say that an item goes in "best practice" rather
than techniques if all or most of the following requirements are met:

1. Following the "best practice" item would significantly enhance the
   quality of implementation of the checkpoint, or substantially
   improve the accessibility of the content.

2. The "best practice" item is always, or almost always applicable
   whenever the checkpoint is - in other words, it is relevant in most
   circumstances under which the checkpoint is to be implemented.

3. The "best practice" item is not technology-specific.

4. The "best practice" item would only be used in content targeted to
   the needs of a particular audience, that is, it carries
   implementation of the checkpoint to the highest standard.


This questions is still open and we currently are holding this until we can
review the re-org


Comments on all of the above are invited.
