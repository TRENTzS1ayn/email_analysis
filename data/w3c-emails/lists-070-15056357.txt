Here is proposed wording for the erratum regarding placeholder text for form
controls. This would appear in and follows the format of the Errata in Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines [1].

10. Placeholder text for form controls.
Date: {TBD}
Class: Requirement no longer relevant
Refers to: Checkpoint 10.4 of 5 May 1999 Version
Description: Checkpoint 10.4 requires that authors provide placeholder text
for form controls. This was a workaround for user agents that, at the time
the guidelines were written, would not find form controls unless they had
placeholder text. The requirement was only intended to be applicable "until
user agents handle empty controls correctly". User agents now do so, and
implementors can remove Checkpoint 10.4 from the conformance requirements
for WCAG 1.0.
