I agree and would suggest that the summary attribute on layout tables be
addressed in the same way that the TH, TBODY and THEAD elements have been in
Chris's original proposal.

My suggestion would be to remove the following two proposals:

- only the first layout table requires a summary. Following layout tables
have a summary of "layout table" or NULL ("").
- layout tables should have short summaries (less than 150 characters
[English])

and to modify the item about the use of TH, TBODY and THEAD to read:

- add a statement that the TH, TBODY, THEAD elements and the summary
attribute should not be used at all in layout tables.
