FYI.

GEO now has an initial implementation of it's layered approach to
techniques.  Note that this is still very early days, especially with
regards to styling and content, and that much more work still remains
before this achieves its final form.  Nontheless, this may be useful to
illustrate the ideas we have.

You can now view our techniques as an outline [
http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/outline/html-authoring-out
line.html ] or as the full text [
http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/html-authoring.html ].
You can also move between the two (currently by using icons to the right
of the title).

The outline view is derived from the full view via XSLT. Future work
will allow the user to expose other types of information according to
preference (eg. Browser specific tips).

Best regards,
RI
