All these tables have significant, regular data structure conveyed by the 
layout.

These are _all_ 'data' tables in the colloquial parlance.

In each case there is a special relationship between the content of one 
cell and
the content of another cell in the same row.  These relationships are connoted
by this geometrical alignment; and the nature of the relationship is repeated
row after row.

In the cases where you gave headers, the nature of the repeating 
relationship is
explained in the pattern of headers.
