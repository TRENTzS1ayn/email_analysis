Al's right: they're all data tables.  By contrast, the main table(s) at
http://www.metmuseum.org/home.asp are used for layout only-- that is,
they simply ensure the placement of elements on the screen in accordance
with a visual design: their purpose is aesthetic, not informative.

All these tables have significant, regular data structure conveyed by
the 
layout.

These are _all_ 'data' tables in the colloquial parlance.

In each case there is a special relationship between the content of one 
cell and
the content of another cell in the same row.  These relationships are
connoted by this geometrical alignment; and the nature of the
relationship is repeated row after row.

In the cases where you gave headers, the nature of the repeating 
relationship is
explained in the pattern of headers.
