Bring your designer here! We'll beat him up!

Actually, the thing is that CSS-P doesn't really remove any of the
checkpoints related to tables anyway; the same problems with table
placement can be found in CSS-P placement too. Visual layout can
always cause problems for non-visual users...

The way you mark it up ultimately is less important than other issues.
