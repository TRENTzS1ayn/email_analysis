Just one more note to add about passive versus active from a 
localization perspective - it is often
much harder to translated passive sentences into other languages than 
active ones, especially for translation memory machines, which can be 
"taught" to look for subject-verb-object coming from certain languages 
in order to do fuzzy-logic matching.  We always recommend that writers 
try to use the standard SVO in English for such reasons.  So, even if 
the implied subject needs to be declared, it might be the best form for 
understanding the checkpoints internationally.

I know that the Guidelines are translated - and I know that they will 
probably be translated into even more languages once/if they are 
integrated into more legal contexts for support in the EU and possibly 
Asia (?) - so this should probably be a consideration.

Richard Ishida can probably say more.  Richard - any thoughts?

Cheers,
-Kerstin
