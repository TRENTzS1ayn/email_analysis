Here are links to 2 example tables that may muddy the destinction between
layout and data tables:

http://www.thunders.ca/tabletest1.html
http://www.thunders.ca/tabletest2.html

These tables layout text but make use of a header (table1) and caption
(table 2).

Would you describe them as layout or data tables?
