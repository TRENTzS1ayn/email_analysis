After the call I realised that not all the relevant files were on the
site, including the (brief) documentation.  They are now there, and I
have updated the documentation. 

To understand the approach for generating outline files you might find
it useful to start with
http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/documentation/documentatio
n-build.html

Hope that helps,
RI
