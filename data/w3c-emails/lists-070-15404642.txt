Hello Pam,

This is an interesting question.

Personally, I interpret 11.2 to mean "don't use deprecated features" and if 
you use deprecated features then you don't conform.

It sounds like you have updated some pages but not all.  What if you 
clarify the scope of your conformance claim?  For example, "Pages created 
or updated after 1 June 2003 conform at Level AA to WCAG 1.0.  Pages 
created before 31 May 2003 conform at Level A to WCAG 1.0 because they use 
deprecated features of HTML 4.01."

I'm interested in reactions from others on the list.
