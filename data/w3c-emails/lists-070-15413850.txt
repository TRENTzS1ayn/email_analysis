The issue seems to be semantic, pivoting around the meaning of the word
"avoid" in the guideline.

I agree with Pam that "avoid" does not include the sense of  its likely
intended meaning: "do not use" [per Wendy 's interpretation]. "Avoid"
certainly is more of a "grey" word
than a "black or white" one.

I suggest need to be clearer and replace "avoid" with "do not use" in the
guidelines.

This change would then create a more "black and white" decision for those
trying to make their whole sites compliant.

In Pam's case this solution is probably not one she wants to hear, given the
considerable workload involved.

Per Wendy's suggestion could we live with a WWW that had
varing compliance at the page level as opposed to the site level? I think
that *could* work but may not be ultimately that usable for the web
community we are designing for. 

Thoughts?


Thanks,
Gordon.

Hello Pam,

This is an interesting question.

Personally, I interpret 11.2 to mean "don't use deprecated features" and if 
you use deprecated features then you don't conform.

It sounds like you have updated some pages but not all.  What if you 
clarify the scope of your conformance claim?  For example, "Pages created 
or updated after 1 June 2003 conform at Level AA to WCAG 1.0.  Pages 
created before 31 May 2003 conform at Level A to WCAG 1.0 because they use 
deprecated features of HTML 4.01."

I'm interested in reactions from others on the list.
