Both of the examples would be layout tables.  

Although a header are used in example #1, the information does not
conform to an understandable data format.  Additionally, the <br/> would
cause this example to fail validation because HTML 4.01 Transitional was
used instead of XHTML.  The image doesn't include alt text.

Example 2 simply lays the information out into visually separated
sections.  Still no order of linear express is carried through.

I'm assuming the content was not intended to be a true representation of
a web page.

Here are links to 2 example tables that may muddy the destinction
between layout and data tables:

http://www.thunders.ca/tabletest1.html
http://www.thunders.ca/tabletest2.html

These tables layout text but make use of a header (table1) and caption
(table 2).

Would you describe them as layout or data tables?
