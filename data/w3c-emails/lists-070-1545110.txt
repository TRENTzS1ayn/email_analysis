Oh, that's fine and that's what I suggested based on your initial
proposal.

Because there's no rules for color transformations built into CSS.
I can't write something which says:

   ~~color: blue~~ { color: red; }

Oh, well, what you suggest should work pretty reliably most of the time;
the only problem is that it can't be done with CSS unless there's
major changes to how CSS handles color. I don't know if the CSS3
color-profile model will help any. (Another CSS-related idea would be
to attempt to recast everything in system colors.)

Ultimately, what would work better is simply a browser plug-in for
users, which transforms colors as they need 'em.

I think this is a good idea.
