Agreed.

The word "avoid" has been one of the worst stumbling
blocks for Web developers -- after "until user agents"
-- in understanding and implementing the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines.

Nobody seems to know what "avoid" means.  If WCAG is
meant to forbid something, it should do so.  If it
does not mean to forbid something then how can you
know if you have complied?  (If "avoid" does not mean
"do not use," then any "avoid" checkbox is by
definition uncheckable.)

The word "avoid" is one word that -- in the opinion of
this Web development educator -- should be excised
from WCAG entirely.  It tells us nothing and guides no
one.
