I agree that this word is problematic, and should be avoi-- er...

RFC 2119[1] defines terms like MUST, SHOULD, and MAY. This is the 
standard for setting requirements or prohibitions in Internet 
standards. If "avoid" indicates prohibition, it should be followed up 
with a statement using MUST NOT; and/or indicate that "avoid" equals 
MUST NOT in the glossary; or it should be replaced with "Do not use". I 
suggest "Do not use".
