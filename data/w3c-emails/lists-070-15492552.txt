I found the old issues lists, went through some old minutes, and found 
contradictory interpretations of "Avoid deprecated features."

I propose the following erratum to WCAG 1.0:
10. Avoid deprecated features
Added: DD MM YYYY.
Type: Clarification
Refers to: Checkpoint 11.2 of 5 May 1999 version
Description (and correction). The checkpoint says, "Avoid deprecated 
features of W3C technologies" but it is not clear if "avoid" means "do not 
use at all" or "use only when absolutely necessary."  Since this is a 
Priority 2 checkpoint, the stricter interpretation applies and it should be 
read as, "Do not use deprecated features of W3C technologies."  Deprecated 
features may be used in a site that claims conformance at Level A.  Level 
AA requires more work, including replacing deprecated features with updated 
technology.
---

The other checkpoints that use the word "avoid" are also Prioirty 2 except: 
"7.1 Until user agents allow users to control flickering, avoid causing the 
screen to flicker. [Priority 1]"  There are a variety of issues with this 
checkpoint ("until user agents...," how to test for flicker, what do we 
mean by "avoid.").  This is a separate issue and should not impact the 
clarification of 11.2.

trail of minutes and issues lists:

At the 13 April 1999 meeting there was discussion about what we meant by 
"avoid" but there was no resolution.
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999AprJun/0015.html

Greg Lowney commented about an earlier draft and Ian responded that BLINK 
and MARQUEE "should not be used."
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999JanMar/0470.html

In an old issues list for WCAG 1.0, there are still some open issues.  One 
is related to this issue and it says, "We need to share our interpretation 
that some use of deprecated is o.k. The CG feels we should either address 
this in errata or the next version."  However, I am unable to find support 
that this is the consensus.
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wai-gl-issues.html#g11

13 June 1999, Ian made the following proposal:
Change wording of 11.2 to read "Avoid deprecated features of
       W3C technologies. Note: Authors should stop using deprecated
       features when they are supported by by other technologies such
       as style sheets."
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999AprJun/0191.html

I remember quite a lot of discussion about "avoid tables for layout" and 
found some evidence of us changing from that to the current wording, "5.3 
Do not use tables for layout unless the table makes sense when linearized. 
Otherwise, if the table does not make sense, provide an alternative 
equivalent (which may be a linearized version). [Priority 2]"
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999AprJun/0029.html

This wording comes from the 17 March 1999 meeting:

History of issues lists:
1. WAI Page Authoring Guidelines Issues List for the Working Drafts (Pre-Rec)
(last modified Nov 2000)
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wai-wd-issues

2. Summary of Last Call Issues

3. WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Issues List - Proposed 
Recommendation
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wai-pr-issues#layout-tables
At PR, "Avoid tables for layout" was replaced with a clarified checkpoint:
5.3 Do not use tables for layout unless the table makes sense when 
linearized. Otherwise, if the table does not make sense, provide an 
alternative equivalent (which may be a linearized version). [Priority 2]
