I have always interpreted WCAG usage of the term "avoid" in the "when
possible but not absolutely" sense. In certain ways, the stricter
interpretation of 11.2 makes my life easier, and it emphasizes the
importance of moving to newer (accessible) technologies. So I kind of
support the clarification / reinterpretation, whichever it is. 

But a flag comes up - a lot of the deprecated features in HTML are
deprecated in favor of CSS. One reason I used to take the softer
interpretation was that CSS support was so shaky you were better off using
deprecated HTML than taking your chances with CSS. That doesn't seem to be
as much of a problem now, but a side effect of the stricter interpretation
would be that we would be practically mandating CSS for most site designs,
which we also encourage in 3.3. I don't think that's a bad thing but I think
a lot of content authors are used to using HTML in certain ways. I see a lot
of pages that use CSS to do a lot of things, yet they still use the <font>
tag, out of momentum as much as anything else as far as I can tell. Although
it shouldn't be much more difficult to use CSS (easier if you structure your
code well), a lot of people aren't going to feel that way. They may feel
that the bar for P2 compliance has been pushed beyond their reach.

I'm not necessarily arguing against this erratum proposal. I just want to
make sure the flag is visible in the decision process. If I were making the
decision, I would probably issue a clarification that "avoid" has the
softer, "when possible" meaning for now, but in WCAG 2.0 go to the stricter
meaning. But if the decision goes the other way I won't oppose it.
