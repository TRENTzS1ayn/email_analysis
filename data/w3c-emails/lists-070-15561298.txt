I do not agree, simply related to this suggestion:

CMIIW, but if you want to use the former background-image selector and put
an image map on it, you will have the 'opportunity' to integrate other links
in the same <td /> or <table /> or whatever element, and you will get a nice
'onehundredthousand overlapping links area'. Otherwise, add a (IMO)
unnecessary comment to the WAI guidelines to not use overlapping links.

I know this sounds a little bit overdone, but that's way I thought to
pronounce it. I guess there are several proposals only bloating the CSS and XHTML
specifications for too specific and maybe unnecessary needs. Feedback is
appreciated.
