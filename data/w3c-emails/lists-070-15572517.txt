Hi Wendy,

My 2 cents. I believe that we could use the strict interpretation for 
WCAG 2.0, but then the checkpoint shall forbid for some compliance level 
Transitional Grammars, and state clearly "use only strict grammars of 
the latest version of the markup."

However, for WCAG 1.0, I see things differently and agree with Michael's 
view (bearing in mind I am not an official WG member). There is out 
there a lot of valid 4.01 Transitional with some harmless (for 
accessibility) deprecated elements or attributes. For instance, I agree 
with the fact that for <font>, *avoid* shall be translated to *do not 
use*. But what about <center>, or the attribute align, or <dir>? I don't 
see any harm to accessibility on those (say level AA). Probably we shall 
be more specific in what to avoid (sorry, do not use!), and what could 
be allowed.

Regards,
carlos
