HI All

 

John Slatin's explanation of passive/active is in line with my
understanding and is why I introduced this idea.

I agree with Gregg that passive voice may be better.  As far as I can
see that means that only 3 guidelines would have to be adapted.

 

Here are my suggestions to make the 3 active voice guidelines speak in
the passive voice with the other guidelines.

It would also remove the imperative.
