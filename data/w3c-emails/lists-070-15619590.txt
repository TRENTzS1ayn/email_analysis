I'm confused and maybe I'm missing something?
 
If I am, then I apologise in advance, but don't we want to move 
towards active and away from passive?
 
Examples:
the boy hit the ball with the bat [active]
the ball was hit with the bat by the boy [passive]
 
Issues:
. the left-to-right reader has to wait much longer in the passive
   voice until they get to the subject of the sentence.
 
. passive sentences usually take more words to say the same thing.
 
. the subject-verb-object structure is dominant in the Western world
[currently has most Internet users].
 
. passive is harder to translate into other languages.
 
 
thanks,
Gordon.

HI All

 

John Slatin's explanation of passive/active is in line with my understanding
and is why I introduced this idea.

I agree with Gregg that passive voice may be better.  As far as I can see
that means that only 3 guidelines would have to be adapted.

 

Here are my suggestions to make the 3 active voice guidelines speak in the
passive voice with the other guidelines.

It would also remove the imperative.
