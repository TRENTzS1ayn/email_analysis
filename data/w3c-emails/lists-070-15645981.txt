Hi Montgomery

 

In many ways I agree that Active is better than Passive and my Mom the
grammar queen would too.  That was my original thinking when I brought
up the issue.

 

But John and Gregg have good points.   

 

My feeling is that all guidelines should be in the same voice whether
that be active or passive and since the guidelines would have to go into
major contortion mode to become "active" I think perhaps for this draft
we should just bring the 4 passive guidelines into alignment with the
others which are passive.
