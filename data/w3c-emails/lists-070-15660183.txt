But, should it be clarified to mean MUST NOT or SHOULD NOT?  I have
always interpreted it as SHOULD NOT.  It sounds from Gregg's statements
like the group was trying to find something a little stronger than
should not and a little weaker than must not.

I agree that this word is problematic, and should be avoi-- er...

RFC 2119[1] defines terms like MUST, SHOULD, and MAY. This is the
standard for setting requirements or prohibitions in Internet standards.
If "avoid" indicates prohibition, it should be followed up with a
statement using MUST NOT; and/or indicate that "avoid" equals MUST NOT
in the glossary; or it should be replaced with "Do not use". I suggest
"Do not use".
