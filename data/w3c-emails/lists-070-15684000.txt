I did not have the latest (May 23) draft of the guidelines.  I can see
that 3 of the 4 suggestions I made were implemented.  So I withdraw my
last suggestions. That leaves just one lonely guideline in the "active"
voice. 

 

2 E-1   User can avoid experiencing screen flicker. [was 2.3]

 

I'm kind of shy to change this to the passive voice because it may not
work as well and we would change it simply for grammatical consistency
with the rest of the guidelines - but here it goes:

 

2 E-1    Screen flicker can be avoided by the user. [was 2.3]

or

2 E-1    The experience of Screen flicker can be avoided by the user.
[was 2.3]

 

I think the following might be a better use of the passive voice:

 

2 E-1    Screen flicker can be prevented by the user. [was 2.3]
