Original Message -----------------------

Hello folks,

I have (re) joined the working group, so here is a short introduction.

I work on the Semantic Web Advanced Development - Europe project. One of my
tasks there is to develop information on ways the Semantic Web might improve
accessibility, and to bring these ideas to WAI in order to see which ones are
useful and should be developed further, and which ones are not.

My primary interest in this group is therefore techniques.

I was a member of the group from 1998 until 2002, and I have been a member of
most WAI working groups at one time or other. I am no longer working for WAI,
and at no time should my opinions be taken as representing WAI, or as
speaking for W3C on accessibility.

I am a vice-president of La Fundacion Sidar, a spanish-language accessibility
organisation, but anything I say on behalf of Sidar will come from my Sidar
email address. At the moment my involvement in WAI through Sidar is only as
an invited expert in the Protocols and Formats group.

Looking forward to working with you all

cheers

Chaals
