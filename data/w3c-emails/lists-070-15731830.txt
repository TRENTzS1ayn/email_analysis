The issue is:

when you dont have stylesheets and you do have scripts...what do you
do?particu larly difficult: transparent backgrounds.issue - if you overlay
you can read w/underneath depending on how c ss set up.problem is with css
positioning. legacy issue with browsers.


Response:

Could a realistic scenario be detailed in which one does not have stylesheets
but does have scripts? In a standards-compliant browser? I am thinking perhaps
of Netscape 4, which WCAG 2 should do nothing to support.

By definition, when a menu drops down, you are not suppsed to read what's
under it. I don't see how anyone could imagine that seeing through the
menu would be a requirement. If that were the requirement, menus would not
drop down, and no interface element would ever cover any other part of the
screen. The issue with transparent backgrounds appears not to be an issue.
