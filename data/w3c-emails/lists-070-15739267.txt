The issue is:


what exceptions... for rebroadcast of TV signals.JW Solution:if content is
reb roadcast from another medium or resource that complies to broadcast
requirements of acce ssibility (independent of these guidelines), the
rebroadcast satisfies the checkpoint if complies with the other
guidelines.

Response:

It is technically possible to Webcast a *television* program with the same
captions that program has (as in open captioning). We are 85% of the way
to being able to Webcast a program with its captions reformulated into an
online video player's own captions (closed captions transformed into other
closed captions).

Thus the original broadcast could be accessible. Later rebroadcasts could
be accessible if captions were recovered or preserved, which isn't difficult
in a video-digitizing environment.

CLARIFICATION REQUESTED: What is the actual goal this bug seeks? To exempt
already-captioned (and, presumably, already-described) TV broadcasts that
are retransmitted online?
