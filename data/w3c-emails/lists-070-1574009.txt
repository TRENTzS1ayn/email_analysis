Hi Gian, thanks for the information about Netscape 2.0 users. Do you have any
figures available? (I realise this is one organisation in one part of the
world, but it is interesting to try and collect these things).

Regarding what it means to "work" without stylesheets: The guidelines
actually say "Organise documents so they may be read without style sheets".
So if your CSS layout means that without CSS the thing is not useable, you
have failed a priority 1 checkpoint. (Right, the guidelines don't define what
is useable, but this is a kind of "reasonable person" test that I believe a
reasonable person would understand...)

cheers

  Charles,

  I agree with your points, and yes the site must work with CSS turned
  off, but perhaps the WCAG needs to be clearer on what it means for the
  site to 'work'. If I use CSS for the layout of a site, then if you turn
  off stylesheets the site can become very difficult to comprehend. If you
  use CSS to organise that layout of navigation, followed by text etc.
  then once you've turned off CSS then these elements (in some browsers)
  are laid out one after another, and the whole look and feel of the site
  it lost. Not to mention the inconvenience of having to scroll three
  pages of image after image in order to get to content.

  As for the Department, they requested compliance with Netscape 2.0
  because after some user testing they had determined that a significant
  proportion of their repeat users were still using this browser level.

  Cheers,
  Gian
