The issue is:

doesn't work with XML, where a style sheet is reqired to allow a sensible
reading of the document. But this is not yet noted in the errata. I
propose the following errata for this checkpoint:1. This checkpoint is
only applicable to HTML documents.2. This checkpoint does not require that
stylesheets not be present, but rather that the content of the document
does not rely on style sheets for the user to know what it is.

Response:

The relation of this bug to CSS-generated content needs to be explored. If
the author intends for CSS-generated content to be an integral part of the
experience, will the author flunk WCAG 2.0 when the HTML page is viewed without
that generated content?

Note that this further impinges on any suggestion to use CSS-generated content
as a solution to a WCAG accessibility problem.
