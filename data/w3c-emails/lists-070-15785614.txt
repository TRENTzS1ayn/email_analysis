In working on the table proposals, Chris and I weren't sure whether the row
and column structural elements should be permitted or forbidden in layout
tables. They clearly have a role in data tables, but it's less clear whether
they have a role in layout tables or should be avoided. These elements in
question are:

THEAD - identifies header row(s)
TBODY - identifies row group(s)
TFOOT - identifies footer row(s)
COL - identifies columns
COLGROUP - groups columns identified with COL
