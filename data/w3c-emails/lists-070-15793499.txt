Not sure if it is worded well, but I THINK the idea was...

That if web access requirements are GREATER than broadcast requirements,
that broadcast requirements should be enough if you are just rebroadcasting.
- if broadcast is captioned - you would need to pass captions through (as
you suggest below)

- if broadcast rules are that 80% needs to be captioned - and you pass all
them through, then you would conform even though 20% were not captioned. 

By the way, the working group is having a lot of difficulty with this
checkpoint in determining where captions and descriptions would be REQUIRED
since this is a CORE technique and violation would mean that you can claim
nothing.  ANY and all input and thoughts on this are welcome.  Especially
and proposed solutions.  We expect most proposals will have holes in them
(at least all of ours have) so feel free to propose solutions.  (and be
prepared for hole finding).  A big prize to the person that finds the
wording that unties the Gordian knot.

Subject: [171] accessible rebroadcasts


The issue is:


what exceptions... for rebroadcast of TV signals.JW Solution:if content is
reb roadcast from another medium or resource that complies to broadcast
requirements of acce ssibility (independent of these guidelines), the
rebroadcast satisfies the checkpoint if complies with the other
guidelines.

Response:

It is technically possible to Webcast a *television* program with the same
captions that program has (as in open captioning). We are 85% of the way
to being able to Webcast a program with its captions reformulated into an
online video player's own captions (closed captions transformed into other
closed captions).

Thus the original broadcast could be accessible. Later rebroadcasts could
be accessible if captions were recovered or preserved, which isn't difficult
in a video-digitizing environment.

CLARIFICATION REQUESTED: What is the actual goal this bug seeks? To exempt
already-captioned (and, presumably, already-described) TV broadcasts that
are retransmitted online?
