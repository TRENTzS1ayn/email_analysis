I have one concern about using the passive voice in the guidelines which
we may need to iron out. 

 

In Guidline 3.3 we have a best practises section that tells people to
write in the "active" voice.  I'm a little worried that people may tell
use to practise what we preach.

 

Best Practice

1.the content has been reviewed, taking into account the following
strategies for evaluating the complexity of the content, applying them
as appropriate.

a.use of sentence structures that increase understanding 

*such as active voice in languages where this form helps convey
information
