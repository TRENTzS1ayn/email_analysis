Perhaps this issue [1] needs a bit of clarification...

While I agree that WCAG should not explicitly prohibit the use of repetitive
headings as described in Joe's example, I think that making some adjustments
to the repetitive headings in the guidelines document increases the
usability of the guidelines, sets a good example for structuring complex
documents and is consistent with what we're currently recommending in
checkpoint 2.4 [2].

If I'm remembering correctly, this issue was raised by a member of our
working group and applies only to the guidelines document itself. It was not
meant to imply that requirements for making headings unique would be
introduced into the guidelines.

Thoughts?
