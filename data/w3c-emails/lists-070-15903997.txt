WCAG 2.0 should not, however, include even informative examples that
validate or encourage the remixing abilities of particular favoured
adaptive technologies. Authors do not create documents with an intent that
they could be randomly reshuffled like decks of cards but still be read
and understood perfectly.

If we want people to use structured markup, then let them decide what
content to include in that structure. There should be no mention
whatsoever that certain favoured adaptive technologies can do new and
kooky things with headings, links, and other elements.

There should be no hint of prohibition against identical link or title
texts, for similar reasons. It is up to the author to decide the content
of a page, including the content expressed within structural markup.
