Hello Lisa and Bob

I think that this is a fantastic effort, Lisa!

I think that the success criteria are appropriate,
given the nature of the checkpoint.

"Write...": Identifies the checkpoint as being about
original content.

Good writers generally aim to write clearly and
simply.  _The Old Man and the Sea_, by Ernest
Hemingway, is often used as an example of this point.

We are talking about Web content.  Writing for the Web
involves a different discipline to writing for print,
for film, or for the stage.
