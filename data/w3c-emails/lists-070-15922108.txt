Subject: New mailing list on web testing by visually impaired users

A new mailing list has been created on testing of web pages by visually
impaired
users.  The main purpose of this mailing list is to facillitate
communication
between web page developers and visually impaired users.  Some of the goals
include:

    Helping each group understand the other group better

    Identify problems and explore possible solutions based on the knowledge,
    experience and background of each of the groups

    Share new information as it is discovered

    Provide a place where web page developers can ask for volunteers to
    test their web pages.  (Currently, any web page developer can ask
    for volunteers, but this might change in the future as the group
    evolves.)

If you would like to subscribe to this mailing list, just send an empty note
to:

    uvip-web-test-subscribe@yahoogroups.com

(The mailing list is also available in daily digest format.)
