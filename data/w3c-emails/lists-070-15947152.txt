Regrets - I can not make it tonight for the call (it is a festival
tonight...).

 My 2 cents - It looks good, well done Wendy. I would find a stronger
way to state the "WCAG 2.0 Extended". This is clearly a lot of work, so
maybe we should say "WCAG 2.0 Full or Comprehensive"  - some word to say
this site is just fantastic....

Also any way to state best practices

"This site complies to "WCAG 2.0 core" using WCAG 2.0 best practices".

All the best
