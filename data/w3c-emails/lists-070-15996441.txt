Thanks, Kynn.  I know my analogy between summary and alt breaks where
the current HTML and XHTML specifications are concerned; I like the idea
of submitting this to the XHTML WG.  And I know that most tables now in
existence fail, but they also fail current WCAG checkpoints if you push
it down far enough.

As for the content of the summary, I think that's context-specific, just
as ALT text is.  I like to think of the summary as providing information
about the table that a sighted user could get from a quick scan of the
table but that would take a long time to emerge from listening to the
table.

This is a good rationale, but note that nearly all tables currently in 
existence
will fail, and the HTML specification does not require a summary attr, 
although
it does require an alt attr.

Perhaps this suggestion should be submitted to the (X)HTML working group
for XHTML 2.0?

I think it's a good answer, but support will take a long time.  Also, 
we need
guidelines as to what "summary" should include.  In my opinion, it 
should be
a statement of "what you'd learn from this, in the form of what you'd 
read over
the phone to your friend who doesn't want specific details."  In other 
words,
something like summary="Republican Presidents have created the largest
deficits" or the like.  (Assuming a table that shows presidents, that 
president's
party, and budget deficits, per year.)
