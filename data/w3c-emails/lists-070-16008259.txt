I don't know if I can help you.

Confused is a past participle - a form of a verb that works like an
adjective. So "I am confused" is a standard passive construction.

The verb to be is intransitive (it doesn't happen to anything, the subject
just does it). So when used with an adjective it is active.

But it is also used as an auxiliary verb - in "I am confused" the verb part
of the sentence is "am confused". (In latin you can say "audio, video, amo" -
I hear, I see, I love - and "audior videor amor" - I am heard, I am seen, I
am loved - but in at least half a dozen modern european languages you need
two or more parts to make the statement, and one of them is often the verb to
be).

Because this construction works the same way as the verb to be with an
adjective, I think it is OK to use this simple construction in general
(compared to using complex passive sentences).

I think the guidelines should be in the active voice, in the imperative mood,
but I think that is the sort of thing a technial editor should suggest
towards the end of the drafting process. If we want the drafts to conform to
WCAG 1 to the highest degree possible, of course, we should aim to keep the
language simple.

Mostly I wanted to clear up some misunderstandings I had seen about what is
passive or active.
