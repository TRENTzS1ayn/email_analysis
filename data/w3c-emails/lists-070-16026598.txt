I would like to submit that Although I support the null summary for lay out
tables if the null summary actually works as a null rather than putting some
sort of flag that the screen reader or other rendering agent will
speak/render, Alt and summary are two different things.  In a data table
which is quite complex, it is often a good idea for usability for a
narrative to be provided as part of the table such as in a summary in order
to get the big picture of the table.  This is more like narative description
than alt/replacement for the table since It provides an overview and
possibly some instructive information concerning the table and the data in
it.  A data table is not a graphical element as such but is a structural
element or block of structural elements holding textual relationships, while
though benefitting vision are not enherent to it since tactually and via use
of a screen reader or other device which allows appropriate navigation, the
relationships among the data and data sets can be discerned.

I propose then that null summary be used for lay out tables as per my
comments above, and that summary be used with appropriate content for data
tables but that the later might be constrained by the complexity of the
structure.  In other words on the second point, some times, there is nothing
to say beyond the rendering of the table so a null summary would be
acceptable.

Thanks for allowing me to intrude.
