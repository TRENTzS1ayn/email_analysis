Hello,

At last week's meeting, I took an action to update the draft conformance 
section based on discussion.  It is attached.

Major changes:

1. added "Best Practice items to do not need to be met to claim conformance 
to a Checkpoint." to explanations of Core and Extended.
2. added summary of issues with Core+ to bullet 4 of "Conformance Claims"
