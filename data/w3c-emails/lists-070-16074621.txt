Hi,
i'm glad to inform the group that there will be the support of IBM Italia to
the event in Venice.
IBM Italia will organize a wireless connection and give for use 6 notebook

They ask to me to know who has his personal notebook with the wireless
connection and/or who need the PCMCIA card for use the wireless connection.

The maximum number of pc that can be connected to the wireless lan will be
