Gregg asked:

Yes. Checkpoint 1.1 would include checkpoint numbers in headings as follows:

Required Success Criteria for Checkpoint 1.1
Best Practice for Checkpoint 1.1
1.1 Definitions (Informative)
1.1 Benefits (Informative)
1.1 Examples (Informative)

I've modified the XSL for our draft to insert these numbers automatically
and will include it in the next draft.

Does this sound like a reasonable proposed resolution to Issue #12 [1]?
