Ben, the proposal does sound reasonable.  But I notice that the proposed
text for definition headings puts the numbers first (1.1.2 etc.) whereas
the others put the words first (Success criteria for ...).  I'd suggest
putting the letters first, both for consistency's sake and because it
makes navigation faster.  For example, people who use JAWS or Home Page
Reader can navigate the headings list alphabetically: hit "D" and you
jump to the next item in the list that begins with that letter.  If the
numerals come first, it'll take longer, since there's 1.1.1, 1.1.2,
etc., plus the possibility of even deepr nesting.

Gregg asked:

Yes. Checkpoint 1.1 would include checkpoint numbers in headings as
follows:

Required Success Criteria for Checkpoint 1.1
Best Practice for Checkpoint 1.1
1.1 Definitions (Informative)
1.1 Benefits (Informative)
1.1 Examples (Informative)

I've modified the XSL for our draft to insert these numbers
automatically and will include it in the next draft.

Does this sound like a reasonable proposed resolution to Issue #12 [1]?
