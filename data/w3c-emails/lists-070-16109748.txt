This comment from Phill Jenkins:

The summary attribute was not discussed in the June 9th proposal.  It is
the one attribute unique to layout and data tables that could be used to
help confirm that, in fact the should's and must's have been followed and
in fact this table is or is not a layout table.  The convention I have been
proposing is to use the keyword "layout" in the summary attribute text.

When the table is a layout table, the summary attribute text SHOULD include
the text word "layout".

When the table is a data table, the summary attribute text SHOULD NOT
include the text word "layout".

This convention will help checking and repair tools, authoring tools,
users, and assistive technology better create, repair, identify, and render
tables as intended. Of course tools could assume that because of the
presence or absence of TH the table is or is not a data table, but the
presence of the "layout" will confirm the intent that it is a layout table.
