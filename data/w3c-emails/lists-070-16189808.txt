Hi Carlos.

   Countries could just say that they require  WCAG Core or higher.   The
Pluses are just to let people get credit for doing more (and incentive to go
higher than the minimum for a country)

draft


Hi Wendy, all,

Just a quick thought. We are all well aware that one of the problems of 
expressing conformance to WCAG 1.0 was "how do I explain this to a 
non-technical person" (e.g. legislator, politician, manager, etc.). The 
different drafts of WCAG 2.0 seem to become more and more cumbersome in 
this issue. We shall probably start to think that we are not writing for 
ourselves, as the abstract says "... and to use wording that may be 
understood by a more varied audience."

In Germany, WCAG 1.0 has been adopted as legislation, combining WCAG 1.0 
  A and AA into Priority 1 items, and AAA as Priority 2 (almost). We 
have discussed this issue with people involved in the legal process, and 
basically, there is no chance a legal document can deal with A 
Conformance, A+ Conformance, AA- Conformance and so on (not to mention 
Core+1, Core+2, etc.). In Europe, most countries are adopting or intend 
to adopt WCAG in one way or another. And they want to update to WCAG 
2.0, when the moment comes (at least, in Germany). Conformance is a key 
issue, and we shall make it simpler.

2 (Euro-)cents from an outsider.

regards,
carlos
