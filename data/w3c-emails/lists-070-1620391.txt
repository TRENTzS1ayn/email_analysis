The book that I used is a reference book used for English Composition and
Writing Skills.  Every book that I have ever had on the subject presents the
information in the same manner.  That's the really good thing about books on
writing - the are consistent with each other.  There is no biase in their
writings and the information is based upon standards that don't change
simply because someone does not agree with them or thinks they should be
different.

I hope this helps.

Thanks,
Lee Roberts

Is this book based on some kind of research, or is it just "good ideas from
someone"? (I realise that for all the things I have proposed for this
checkpoint, I don't think I have pointed to a single piece  of research that
backs them up.)
