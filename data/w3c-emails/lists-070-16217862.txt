Jason's proposal to use class="layout" to distinguish layout tables is
intriguing.  What implications does this have for user agents?

Problems with this proposal:

1. It is language-specific (ie., English only).

2. The contents of SUMMARY are meant to be presented to the user, not
   interpreted by the user agent and we shouldn't violate this
   expectation.

3. There is a feature of HTML/XHTML designed exactly for the intended
   purpose, namely the CLASS attribute.

Proposal: CLASS="layout"

Some have argued in the past that we shouldn't attempt to establish
conventions for the use of the CLASS attribute, as its semantics are
intentionally left open by the HTML and XHTML specifications. A parallel
case can be mounted, however, with respect to SUMMARY - the original
proposal would partition the set of SUMMARY values into two subsets
according to whether or not they contained the word "layout", and would
then attach specific semantics and behaviours to summaries in which the
word appeared. If we are going to set expectations for developers
regarding the semantics of attributes of the TABLE element I would
prefer to constrain CLASS than to constrain SUMMARY.
