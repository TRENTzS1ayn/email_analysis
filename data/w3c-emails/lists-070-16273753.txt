Hi,
As you know i'm searching application for active partecipation to WCAG WG
Teleconference and at now i've found Net2Phone that has a cost per minute of


I've found now this:
http://www.dialpad.com/

This package offer some discount and monthly costs:
http://www.dialpad.com/products/monthly.html

500 minutes a month (about 8 hours) are 9,99 USD - about 2 cents per minute.
With Net2Phone it is about 5 cents per minute.

I've test also other products that have problems with the teleconference
bridge but this one seems to work.

I hope this could help other people to partecipate actively to the working
group :)
