Hi Joe and all

In general, CSS aids accessibility.  However, I have stumbled across the
problem that you describe with CSS-generated content.

On some Web pages, I would like to distinguish content contributed by other
authors.  I set up CSS rules that add initials to the end of each
contributed item.  To help sighted readers, I also coloured the contributed
items.

Without the CSS (eg Internet Explorer 5.2 under Mac OS X), readers get
colour, but no initials.  With the CSS (eg Safari 1.0 beta 2 or Netscape
7.02 under Mac OS X), they get colour and initials.

A simple example can be seen at:
    http://purl.nla.gov.au/net/jod/metadata/css_example.html#after

The relevant CSS is:

.hawks:after 
    {
    content: " [tomtom]";
    }

As far as I am concerned this flunks WCAG 2.0, or any other accessibility
requirement.

This doesn't change my belief that the content of the document should not
rely on style sheets for the user to know what it is.  I just don't know how
to do it in this case.
