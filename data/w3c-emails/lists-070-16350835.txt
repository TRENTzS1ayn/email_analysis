Hum.... i think if we "adapt" the WCAG to the 508, for the same we need to
adapt the WCAG to all the local countries normative but - as had said during
a meeting in Venice Daniel Dardailler - local government representative must
be involved in the working group and the WCAG must be "the document".

In Italy there is a discussion that said that with WCAG 1.0 is difficoult to
apply a law, due to the impossibility to verify some checkpoints: with WCAG
2.0 we need to create a real "conformance matrix", where could be possible
for the local government (or their "certificator representative) to simply
translate (but sounds be good that local office of W3C make an official
translation of the normative document) and apply the WCAG.

Interesting idea that last one.  (WCAG 2.O+508)   Have to ponder that one.

Does it imply 508 and 2.0 are different --- or that 508 is a variant of 2.0
- or superset -- or....

hmmm

Then _they_ should specify a conformance profile, and they should
specify _which_ checkpoints over and above Core. No self-respecting
organization is going to issue a content requirement that allows people
to select items "a la carte" to implement. If they're going to make
laws out of WCAG, they should select and require items in the extended
set when they do it.

Core will be the most important set. From there, I think the focus
should be on telling potential adopters (governmental and
institutional) to start with nothing less than Core, and add
requirements from there. Core+ does not help.

As far as 508 goes, I think we'd do well to create a Core+508 profile
as an informative example. We could show that adopting our requirements
and processes will allow authors and ER tools to state authoritatively,
"this is 508", while still adopting the principles of good design that
WCAG contains (and 508 leaves out).
