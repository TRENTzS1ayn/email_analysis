Yes, there are directives but these directives must be applied to all the
member states.
Also in Europe there is an European Parlament that make laws that are
obligation for all the member states.

We need to move around and promote the armonization of the guidelines
receipt in all the Europe: there are private projects like
www.euroaccessibility.org that point to this.

We are also working for it as IWA/HWG for the promotion of the right
application of the web standards and we are testing this policy in Italy
where for the first time in Europe we have created a law project that
request the receipt of the full WAI project (as you know, make only
accessible web sites and not involve the people with disability in the web
developing with ATAG products make only half of the support for people with
disability)

That's how Europe is used to operating.

There are European directives from the Parliament that are left to
each country's lawmakers to implement as they see fit in line with
their own very specific local context.

Hence the UK's DDA: http://elj.warwick.ac.uk/jilt/01-2/sloan.html

It's not a United States of Europe :-)

Then _they_ should specify a conformance profile, and they should
specify _which_ checkpoints over and above Core. No self-respecting
organization is going to issue a content requirement that allows people
to select items "a la carte" to implement. If they're going to make
laws out of WCAG, they should select and require items in the extended
set when they do it.

Core will be the most important set. From there, I think the focus
should be on telling potential adopters (governmental and
institutional) to start with nothing less than Core, and add
requirements from there. Core+ does not help.

As far as 508 goes, I think we'd do well to create a Core+508 profile
as an informative example. We could show that adopting our requirements
and processes will allow authors and ER tools to state authoritatively,
"this is 508", while still adopting the principles of good design that
WCAG contains (and 508 leaves out).
