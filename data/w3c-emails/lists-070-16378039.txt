I would tend to believe that there's no real value in prohibiting those 
elements. If it encouraged some kind of heuristic, like "presence of 
THEAD indicates a data table," that would be one thing, but I think 
we're settling on summary="(foo)" as that heuristic, so we don't need 
to require another.
