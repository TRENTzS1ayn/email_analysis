I don't propose adapting WCAG to 508. But WCAG 2 is working on what 508 
is missing: objective, testable requirements that authors can use. If 
we can produce a document that lets people say with confidence that 
they did 508, I consider that a step forward.

This would be a step toward harmonizing Web development processes by 
pointing out that if you learn accessibility with WCAG, you can design 
content that conforms to a range of existing policies. Presently, one 
of the most common questions I get is "should I do 508 or WCAG?", and I 
don't want to have to hear that anymore.
