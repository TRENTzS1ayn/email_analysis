This would be a step toward harmonizing Web development processes by
pointing out that if you learn accessibility with WCAG, you can design
content that conforms to a range of existing policies. Presently, one
of the most common questions I get is "should I do 508 or WCAG?", and I
don't want to have to hear that anymore.

Roberto:
Yes... it is the problem that I think that we will have in the european
countries, due to the difficoult to armonize the normative to the actual
WCAG 1.0.
