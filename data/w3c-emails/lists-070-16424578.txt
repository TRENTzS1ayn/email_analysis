I assume the following is a typo (this occurs in both <dd> items
defining core and extended checkpoints).

"Best Practice items to do not need to be met..."

Explanation of extended checkpoints is difficult to understand.

Item #1. 

Current wording: "No conformance claim of any kind may be made..."
Proposal: Change to positive statement: "In order to make a valid
conformance claim for a Web resource, the resource must satisfy all
required success criteria for all Core checkpoints."  Or "A Web resource
must satisfy all required success criteria for all core checkpoints in
order for a conformance claim to be valid."

Rationale: the negative form of the current wording is difficult to
parse (e.g., for non-native speakers and possibly for people with
reading difficulties).

Item #2
Current wording: "If all ... Then a claim ..."
Proposed: "A conformance claim of "WCAG 2.0 Core" can be made if all
required success criteria for all core checkpoints have been met."
Rationale: To improve readability by simplifying the syntax.

Item #3: Same as #2.

Item #4: Ditto.

Finally, it's not clear who the audience for the remarks under "Sites
that conform to WCAG 1.0" is.  Reads like an internal note to WG
members, or like the hwole thing is a reviewer's note...

Hope this helps.
John

Subject: Please review: Updated draft of conformance section for next
draft


Hello,

At last week's meeting, I took an action to update the draft conformance

section based on discussion.  It is attached.

Major changes:

1. added "Best Practice items to do not need to be met to claim
conformance 
to a Checkpoint." to explanations of Core and Extended.
2. added summary of issues with Core+ to bullet 4 of "Conformance
Claims"
