Hi, I remember to all the partecipants that the offer for hotel discount has
end on 10th June.
There are only few chambers available at now so I suggest - for who is
interested to sleep directly in the meeting hotel - to book in these days.

If you find problems in hotel booking or there aren't rooms, I can help to
find a room here in Venice-Lido near the meeting hotel.
