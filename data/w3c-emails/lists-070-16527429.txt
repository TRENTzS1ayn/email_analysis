Describing visual images:
Adam Alonzo, "A Picture Is Worth 300 Words: Writing Visual Descriptions
for an Art Museum Web Site," CSUN 2001, at
http://www.csun.edu/cod/conf/2001/proceedings/0031alonzo.htm.  Very
useful, clear material; guidelines can be adapted to other kinds of
visual images.
 
Audio description:
Audio Description International, at http://www.adinternational.org.  The
Web site provides lots of good information and resources for audio
description/descriptive video, and an email list for people on it.
 
Joe Clark's book, Building Accessible Web Sites, has some good material
on audio description, as does Maximum Accessibility, which I co-authored
with Sharron Rush.
 
I'll find some more stuff, but these should get things started.

Subject: Guidelines for describing pictures and video



Do we have a listing of documents with techniques or guidance on how to
describe pictures (long descriptions) and video (audio descriptions)?

 

-          do we have a list of these docs/guidelines in techniques?

-          If not should we?

-          If so - which ones are people aware of?

 

thanks
