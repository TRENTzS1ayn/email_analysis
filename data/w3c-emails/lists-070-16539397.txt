Just found some useful guidelines on the W3 site (of all places!)-- an
excerpt from a manual produced by the National Library Service,
reproduced with permission.  Includes guidelines for describing maps,
illustrations, etc., with examples:

Subject: Guidelines for describing pictures and video



Do we have a listing of documents with techniques or guidance on how to
describe pictures (long descriptions) and video (audio descriptions)?

 

-          do we have a list of these docs/guidelines in techniques?

-          If not should we?

-          If so - which ones are people aware of?

 

thanks
