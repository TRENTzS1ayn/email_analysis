There are a couple of reasons why this seems a worthwhile requirement to
retain.

One is that the techniques for doing it are remarkably simple in general -
don't (as Microsoft Publisher certainly used to) use CSS positioning to move
the presentation of things which have a nonsensical source order, don't
include vital content through  CSS (this is just accurately seperating
content and presentation, although that is harder than people sometimes
claim, as Jonathan's examplle shows).

Certainly having a "different" but equally useful reading order seems less
than terrible- this has been used as a quick hack to give good rendering for
lynx users that is different to that provided for others (e.g. as a way
around the skip navigation thing).

This might seem like saying "don't do really perverse things to your page",
but that still needs saying - after all one person's abominable perversion is
another person's normal lifestyle.

And the difference between floated and positioned elements, very roughly, is
that floated elements are moved to one side or the other but are the same
vertical position as they would be if not floated, whereas positioned
elements can be placed more or less anywhere in the page, and can stay in one
place on the screen while the rest of the page is scrolled.
