The regular annual wake for:
"Client-side Scripting Techniques for Web Content Accessibility 
Guidelines 2.0"
http://www.learningdifficulty.org/develop/script-techs.html

is fast approaching.


Please can anyone advise me in what sense is WCAG fulfilling it scope 
with respect to scripting?
other W3C technologies?

thanks

Jonathan

Congratulations on the working group logo 'b-10-family1.png' though 
this is perhaps not ideal as a name, how about 'working group logo.png'.
Sorry not to have contributed more, perhaps its time I rejoined as an 
active participant.
