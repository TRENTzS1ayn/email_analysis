which members contributed to 'SVG Content Accessibility Guidelines'?
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-SVG11-20030114/ 
access.html#SVGAccessibilityGuidelines

Is anyone currently working on improving the 'SVG Content Accessibility

and discussing this with the SVG working group?

We would like to use SVG accessibly, and have some svg samples here:

we'd like a lot more to chew on though.....

thanks
