If you would like the WCAG WG to discuss a specific issue,

1. check if the issue is already in the issues list
links to condensed bug report lists: 
http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/condensedreports/
we have 4 open issues related to client-side scripting:
http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/condensedreports/clientside_issues.php

2.  If your issue is not on the issues list
create a new issue in the WCAG Bugzilla database
http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/

3. Propose a solution to the issue and send it to the mailing list
For example, refer to this message from Michael Cooper about using the 
summary attribute on Table elements.  He summarizes the possibilities and 
proposes a 
solution.  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2003AprJun/0294.html

Another good example:
summarize the issue and raise questions that we need to answer about a 
particular technique:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2003AprJun/0215.html

===
While scripting issues have not been the core of our discussions, we have 
been making progress. Here is an overview of what's been happening with 
Techniques for WCAG 2.0 (http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wcag20.html#techs).

1. updating issues lists.
all previous HTML issues have been moved to bugzilla

2. discussing open issues on Wednesday telecons and mailing list
primarily addressing HTML issues, summary of those discussed in the last 
few weeks:
- tables
- alt/title/longdesc
- abbr/acronym

3. designing schema and tools for techniques
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/sources/xmlspec-tech.dtd

4. converting old html techniques to new dtd
Loretta is doing this. She is also converting the PDF Techniques to the new dtd

Best,
