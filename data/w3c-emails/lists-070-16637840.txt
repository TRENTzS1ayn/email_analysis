Kynn,

Yes, the border between server-side techniues and how WCAG and ATAG apply 
to them is fuzzy.  Content Management Systems (Matt's favorite topic :) is 
a good, concrete example to begin the discussion between AUWG and WCAG 
WG.  It will be interesting to hear if the AUWG talked about this 
relationship (between CMS, ATAG and WCAG) at their F2F meeting last week.

If it hasn't been done yet, it would be interesting to list all of the 
issues related to CMS, accessibility, WCAG and ATAG as a starting point for 
a discussion.  Are you interested in taking a first pass or digging up what 
has already been written?  (Matt?)

Perhaps server-side techniques could be a shared Techniques document 
between ATAG and WCAG or at least have entry points for each set of 
guidelines.  I'm not sure how that would work, but it could be something to 
consider. We've discussed joint telecons between AUWG and WCAG WG, although 
a particular date and time for a discussion has not been scheduled. Once we 
do schedule a discussion,  this topic ought to be on the agenda.

I've created issue #309 as a placeholder for this topic [1].
