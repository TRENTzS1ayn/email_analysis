Wendy,

thanks for your fairly comprehensive reply, to a different question.
On the positive side, The bugzilla interface looks great.
It doesn't seem that appropriate for shifting the whole document across  
though. I also have a life.
Accessible scripting does need a large document

the 4 open issues listed are only a few of the ones we covered, should  
they be dated, to give some idea of progress?
Beneath each open issue there appears the following:
Techniques for WCAG 2.0 | Client Side Scripting Techniques | proposal |  
2003-02-12 15:29:54 | NEW | WCAG Bugzilla Issue #197
What is its purpose? they look like links but aren't, at least the last  
one is but when I tried to add a comment, by clicking on "WCAG Bugzilla  
Issue #197" I repeatedly get an 'Internal Server Error'

am awaiting password(20 minutes later), to add a new topic,
tried again, and this time received email changing password??
now however I get the Internal Server Error when trying to log in.
tried alternate email address, new password, Internal Server Error
Gave Up for today!

4 open issues, does not look like a whole lot of effort for 12 months.
Is WCAG planning to contribute significant effort in the next 12 months?

NB:The SVG condensed report has no open issues, shurely shome mishtake?

Do you consider that WCAG is on track with regard to techniques?
SVG and Scripting?
Who is the lead on these?

Please remember that I offered to manage development of the Scripting  
document, but you demurred, insisting that you were in control.
Where is the evidence that you are progressing this?

My apologies if this seems forceful, I only wish to see progress, and  
this is not readily apparent.

Jonathan
