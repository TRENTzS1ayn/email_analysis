At last week's telecon, Cynthia and I took an action item to see if we
could clarify the wording for Checkpoint 4.2, success criterion #1.
Here's our proposal:
 

Current wording for Checkpoint 4.2, success criterion #1


1.    a list of technologies and features, support for which is required
in order for the content to be operable, has been determined and the
content is still usable when features not on the required list (for
example, scripting and stylesheets) are turned off or not supported.


Proposed rewording for Checkpoint 4.2, success criterion #1

1.    The Web resource includes a list of the technologies users must
have in order for its content to work as intended.  Users who do not
have some of these technologies can still access and use the resource,
though the experience may be degraded.
 
Discussion
This proposal addresses the original intention of the checkpoint, as
Cynthia (who wrote it in the first place) explained it last week.  Gregg
offered a quite different interpretation of the original wording, which
is not addressed here.
