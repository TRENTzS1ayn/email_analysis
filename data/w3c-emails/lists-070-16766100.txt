I concur that checkpoints that specify that pages be readable without
CSS or scripting enabled harken back to support of legacy browsers and
is that our charter?

We should be careful with statements such as "should be readable"
without style sheets because it invokes the concept of "readability"
which is a much higher standard than simply being able to 'get' the
content. 

Basically, are we stating that so long as a page can be 'perceived' or
'rendered' without CSS (and missing the benefit of layout, structure,
and embelishments that CSS provides) that a page is within compliance? 

If the author intends a user to experience a page using CSS then it is
not a choice of the user not to fully experience the page?

There are a couple of reasons why this seems a worthwhile requirement to
retain.

One is that the techniques for doing it are remarkably simple in general
- don't (as Microsoft Publisher certainly used to) use CSS positioning
to move the presentation of things which have a nonsensical source
order, don't include vital content through  CSS (this is just accurately
seperating content and presentation, although that is harder than people
sometimes claim, as Jonathan's examplle shows).

Certainly having a "different" but equally useful reading order seems
less than terrible- this has been used as a quick hack to give good
rendering for lynx users that is different to that provided for others
(e.g. as a way around the skip navigation thing).

This might seem like saying "don't do really perverse things to your
page", but that still needs saying - after all one person's abominable
perversion is another person's normal lifestyle.

And the difference between floated and positioned elements, very
roughly, is that floated elements are moved to one side or the other but
are the same vertical position as they would be if not floated, whereas
positioned elements can be placed more or less anywhere in the page, and
can stay in one place on the screen while the rest of the page is
scrolled.
