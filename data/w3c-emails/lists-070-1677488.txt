On the other hand, we don't want to _hold back_ progress either. Whether
or not the PDF format has reached the level we wish it to meet, the
folks at Adobe (including some involved in WAI) are working on hard
on improving accessibility of that product. There's talk of access
improvements in Flash. CSS, SVG, and other new technologies are
working to successfully meet accessibility criteria. Sun has invested
a great deal in making Java accessible.

If we say, "sorry, no, only HTML circa 1997 can ever qualify as
accessible" then we're locking ourselves into an unreasonable state
_and_ we're removing any incentive for progress from people such as
Adobe, Macromedia, and Sun.

A baseline browser for 2002 shouldn't look like a baseline browser
from 1997. And the baseline browser for 2007 shouldn't look like
today's, either.

Here's a reasoanble example of what a baseline browser _should_ be
expected to support:

* HTML roughly equal to HTML Basic and perhaps a bit higher.
* Key portions of CSS (to be defined later).
* If supports scripting: support DOM and standardized ECMAscript.
* If supports images: GIF, JPEG, and PNG formats.
* Some way to extend the browser via third party additions, to
   support things like Java, SVG or Flash.

This is actually a reasonable spec for a 2000 baseline browser, but
I am erring conservatively and trust others to argue for more
features if appropriate.
