Sorry to say that I am not feeling well and am going home to rest.
Thus, I'll be missing today's conference call.

Also, I have an action item to provide references regarding methods of
improving readability for checkpoints 3.3 and 3.4.  Because I won't be
attending today, I will instead send an email over the weekend
describing what I have found.

Many apologies,
Mark
