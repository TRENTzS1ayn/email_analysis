I hope this information helps everyone.  It doesn't matter what the content
is the content must follow certain requirements.  Those requirements were
included in my previous post
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002JanMar/0282.html.  In all
the research I found there were two things that were constant.  The first is
mentioned in the above linked message.  The second is the fact that the user
and the provider must come to an agreement that the content must present
itself in a credible manner.

Succeeding on the first part requires the content to be provided in an
easily read and understood format.  Nowhere does it indicate that the
content must be provided in a manner that takes into consideration the
lowest common denomiator or reader.  The second successfully shows that the
user or reader agrees that the information is written on their level and the
content is credible.  How can the content provider meet up to the
expectations of unrealized users or readers?  Simply, provide links to
supporting or background information for those that are not totally up to
speed.

By meeting both of these requirements the level of accessibility is
increased and enhanced.  Even those that are accustomed to the content
expect to find resources at the end and segments notated that are
reflections of other's work.  The only content that can be assured of
uniqueness are literary works.  Technical and informative information will
almost always have referenced material.

Below is a listing of resources I found that provides information that will
help with this issue.
