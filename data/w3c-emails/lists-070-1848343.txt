"Technology Problems and Solutions"
"Web pages divided into segments or frames can confuse software programs
that translate text to voice. Graphics that have not been labeled with text
will be read only as "image" by the software reading the text on the screen
and will deprive students of valuable content. Web pages with a long list of
hyperlinks crowded together can confuse a student with visual, cognitive, or
motor disabilities."

Also, scan down to "Pedagogy Challenges for Students with Learning
Disabilities".

Not as many as how to write correctly, but I'm sure this will help everyone.
