If you are reviewing this material for the working group, could you tell us how these differ from the research quoted till now.
Unfortunately all member of the group are unlikely to find the time to review all the different links. 
Thanks,

  Below are links to information that I found regarding researh specifics.

  "Technology Problems and Solutions"
  "Web pages divided into segments or frames can confuse software programs that translate text to voice. Graphics that have not been labeled with text will be read only as "image" by the software reading the text on the screen and will deprive students of valuable content. Web pages with a long list of hyperlinks crowded together can confuse a student with visual, cognitive, or motor disabilities."
   
  Also, scan down to "Pedagogy Challenges for Students with Learning Disabilities".

  Interesting point made in this article: Do not underline text.

  Not as many as how to write correctly, but I'm sure this will help everyone.
