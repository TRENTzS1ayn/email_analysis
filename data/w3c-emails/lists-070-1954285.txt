Actually it is something that the Education and Outreach group are actively
working on - they are calling it an "Implementation Suite" and it covers a
number of important topics such as how to incorporate WCAG conformance into a
publishing policy, how to select tools and adapt processes to support that,
and so on.

This is quite a large piece of work, and I think it is very helpful that
another group is doing it, although of course formal coordination such as
joint meetings, and informal coordination such as the crossover of membership
and reading what each other are doing is very important.

  I haven't looked at this yet, but in concept I like it a lot -- the
  idea of a "deployment guide" is something this working group should
  consider for WCAG.
