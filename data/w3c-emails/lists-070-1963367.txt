Thursday, 14 February, 2100 UTC (4 PM US Eastern, 10 PM France, 8 AM
Eastern Australia), +1-617-252-1038:

The agenda can be summarized in two words: guideline 4.

While action items related to guideline 3 are being worked upon, we
plan to visit guideline 4 at this week's meeting.

Relevant links are included in last week's agenda. As has been the
case during the past few months, the purpose of the review is to
inquire into the testability and adequacy of the success criteria.
