Summary of actions and resolutions
- checkpoint 4.1 - will be incorporated into 4.3 and/or parts incorporated into an "advisory" Gregg and Jason took an action to work on this text. 
- checkpoint 4.3 - Jason and Gregg took an action to reword it based on today's discussion. The gist is that it will refer more specifically to UAAG with a success criterion that discusses providing an alternative for those things that do not. 
- Everyone should review checkpoints 4.2 and 4.4 in prep for next week's discussion. 
- Agenda next week: 4.2 and 4.4. If time we'll come back to 3.3 and 3.4.
