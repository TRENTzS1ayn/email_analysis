NEW CHECKPOINT PROPOSAL 
Based upon our discussions at the meeting yesterday



Checkpoint 4.S.1
 If you are serving content in different forms to different users to
comply with the guidelines, then at least one version must meet all the
guidelines (with which compliance is asserted) and that form must be
complete and up to date:

Success Criteria

    1) that version provides accessible forms of all the content that is
provided in the default presentation 
    2) that version can be obtained from visiting the same URI 
    3) that version is always up to date (same content) as default
    4) that version can be easily selected by users using technologies
that area accessible under these guidelines  (e.g. you don't have to
operate an inaccessible technology in order to request the accessible
form of the content)

NOTE: The reason that one version must be used to meet all the
guidelines instead of using different versions to meet different
guidelines is to allow access by people having multiple disabilities --
and because authors may not understand which combinations of guidelines
must be used together to provide access.
