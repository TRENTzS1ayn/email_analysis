Right. Which, as I read it, was an attempt to set a baseline browser
capability requirement. And probably a reasonable one.

The thing I would like to see is the working group come up with a way of
explaining how they decide that this is the baseline, and whether there are
some set of circumstances (better defined than "until user agents are better"
<grin/>) when it would be clear that this baseline could be shifted.

cheers

  Yeah
  That's why I suggested steering clear of that
  altogether (using 'default').
  My suggested wording for the checkpoint being

  'Ensure that all content remains available when
  stylistic and scripting technologies are not supported
  or are turned off.'

  Cheers
