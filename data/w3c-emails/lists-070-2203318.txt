Yes, can someone please clarify? My understanding of this is completely
different. I'm under the impression that some of the tools that some people
are 'forced' to use (e.g. only this browser works with this software that
makes items accessible to them), do not provide Javascript support. So
anything within the script is inaccessible to them. Not so much a question
of 'make sense' but more like 'not available'.

My understanding is that some people with disabilities
have to switch off Javascript in order to 'make sense'
or 'successfully use' some web sites. 
Can someone confirm this and perhaps give a specific
example?
Then I will word a 'Benefit' of making pages work when
scripts are not available.
