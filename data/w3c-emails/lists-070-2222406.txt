In WCAG 1.0 the reason was that this is a general issue which doesn't affect
people with disabilities much more than it does everyone else, overall. (56k
modems are common in Australia, but 56k connections - i.e. the ISP having a
56k modem running at the other end) are rare. 9600 is something I use a fair
bit.

But the basic answer is that these are general design issues,which don't have
a great impact on disability in particular, as I recall the decisions of the
group.

  Why don't we cover page size (and the related issue of

  the guidelines and the resultant impact on
  accessibility?
  For example, I was recently faced with a site with
  several 1mb pages (only 5% of which was images!).
  The page was virtually impossible to use on my 56.6k
  modem, never mind anyone who accesses using 9.6, 14.4
  or 28.8 (all of which are common in NZ).
