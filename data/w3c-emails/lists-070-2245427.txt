Checkpoint 4.2 Use technologies according to
specification.
Success criteria
You will have successfully used technologies according
to specification if:

for markup: the markup has passed validity tests of
the language (whether it be conforming to a schema,
DTD, or other tests described in the specification),
structural elements and attributes are used as defined
in the specification, accessibility features are used,
and deprecated features are avoided. 
*I am not sure about 'and deprecated features are
avoided'. That seems a bit 'loose'. You either write
valid code or you don't. Would prefer to leave it out.
It's covered in example 1 below anyway.*


for api's: programming standards for the language are
followed and accessibility api's are used when
available. 
Note to reviewers: Please help us identify
accessibility issues with transport protocols so that
we can properly address them in this checkpoint. Our
current thinking is that these issues might be
server-side issues rather than issues with the
content.
*Amount known about transport protocols - 0 :-(*

Benefits (informative)
When languages, API's, and protocols are used
according to specification, tools that use the results
will be able to do so as intended and expected.
*Needs a reference to people too, for example if you
don't use the Java accessibility API your Java applet
is not going to be accessible to people with
disabilities. Not quite sure how to word this.*

Examples (informative)
Example 1: structural elements. 
Do not use structural elements for purposes of
presentation. Likewise, do not use presentation
elements for purposes of structure. 
Example 2: accessible api's.
Use the Accessibility API when programming in Java.
Refer to the IBM Guidelines for Writing Accessible
Applications Using 100% Pure Java. 

Cheers
Graham
