Proposal

Checkpoint 4.3 Design user interfaces to be accessible or to provide
an accessible alternative.

   Success criteria
1) any applications with custom interfaces conform
to at least Level A of UAAG 1.0. If the application cannot be made
accessible, an alternative accessible solution is provided.


Query: what is meant by a "custom" interface and should the success
criterion be restricted, as in the above proposal and the current
draft, to custom interfaces?
