Clearly - it is to be accessible.  But if no version works across
disabilities then how  do we make sure that one of your disabilities
isn't handled with one version,  and one is handled by another.   So you
can't use either.

I don't like having to require that one version be for all either.   But
I don't see another solution.

Can you think of a solution that will guarantee that a persons multiple
disabilities won't be split across different versions?
