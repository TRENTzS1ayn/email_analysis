We discussed both the specifics of checkpoints 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 and guideline 4 overall.  Despite agreeing last week that 4.1 is advisory, there was discussion this week that perhaps if we reworded it differently it would still apply.  Cynthia took the action to work on the checkpoint text of 4.1 and 4.2 as follows:
<quote>
Action CS: rewrite 4.1 - along the lines of, "Checkpoint 4.1 Choose technologies that support interoperability and compatibility." and also include something in 4.2 along the lines of, "Include accessibility provisions where applicable."
</quote>

Jo and Lisa will work this week on 3.3 and send to the list for possible discussion next week.

Gregg and Wendy gave regrets for next week.  Could someone volunteer to take minutes?
