Hmm,
 We are talking about this on the phone but I am sending this point to the
list anyway

We seem to have lost conform to W3 technologies or at least to widely
published, publicly available and used specifications.
If you develop for an obscure technology that is not supported by assistive
technology that the whole WCAG becomes ridicules.

Also as soon as technologies move outside the w3 space the work done by W3
to promote accessibility through RDF, the semantic web etc will become less
useful making that page less accessible.

I can point out this obvious issue as I do not work for the W3C, but now
that I have said it, Charles could probably elaborate.

Yes I know this is not a popular one

Oh well,
