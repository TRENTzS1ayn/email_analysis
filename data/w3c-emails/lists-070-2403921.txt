The W3 certainly aren't the only organisation creating technologies, core
ECMAscript for example is an actual standard, and one with excellent
support in browsers - there's no chance of getting developers away from
using it, and all those nice W3 DOM bindings will be become unusable. (In
strict interpretations they are now as it requires completely
non-standard means to get to the HTMLDocument element.)

The 4.3 suggestion you quoted certainly seems to cover this requiring the
technology to follow UAAG.

Can you elaborate? - EARL (for example) is quite capable about making
assertions on anything.
