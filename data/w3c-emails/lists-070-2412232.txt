Lisa and All,
I'm confused on this point.  I way that I understand what is being said here
is that we should only use accepted standards.  I can partly agree with
this.

However, I would like to review the way that new languages are used prior to
standards being accepted.  XML was used long before it was adopted.  WML had
at one time several versions and still does if I recall correctly, but only
one standard which portions of do not work well across the entire system.
Hey, that reminds me of browsers.

Many times technologies adopt something before standards are in place.  Some
of those technologies still use those archaic elements like the embed tag
and many others.  When we depracate a tag we should remove it from the list
entirely.  That way people can't say that it is a tag that can still be
used.

I had that particular situation come up in a class I was teaching yesterday.
When I expressed they should stop using FONT tags, the class got into an
uproar.  They stated that as long as the tag is still listed in the
standards it is okay to you.  Unfortunately, they have no idea what XHTML
is.

At any rate how far back do we support and how far forward do we support?  I
recall two weeks ago on the Telecon that it was stated that we should use
all the techniques in the WCAG standards even if technology has not caught
up yet.  If technology offers something that the W3C has not adopted yet,
should we support it in the WCAG standards?

Please advise.

Sincerely,

Hmm,
 We are talking about this on the phone but I am sending this point to the
list anyway

We seem to have lost conform to W3 technologies or at least to widely
published, publicly available and used specifications.
If you develop for an obscure technology that is not supported by assistive
technology that the whole WCAG becomes ridicules.

Also as soon as technologies move outside the w3 space the work done by W3
to promote accessibility through RDF, the semantic web etc will become less
useful making that page less accessible.

I can point out this obvious issue as I do not work for the W3C, but now
that I have said it, Charles could probably elaborate.

Yes I know this is not a popular one

Oh well,
