What we want to say is:

(a) use technologies (or combinations of technologies) which are designed
     to be accessible -- a category which includes W3C specifications
     among others

(b) use technologies which you can reasonably expect to be supported --
     which means, for example, sending raw XML and XSLT converting to
     SVG and CSS will likely be unhelpful, even though those are W3C
     technologies
