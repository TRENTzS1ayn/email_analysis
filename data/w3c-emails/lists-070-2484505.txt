I doubt such records exist and are widely available to web developers;
therefore, I suspect that it will simply prove impractical to consider
this as our criteria.

I don't disagree in theory, but lacking such detailed records, such as
a month-by-month breakdown of what technologies were deployed when and
on what, I think this will prove to be impossible for web developers
and policy makers to use as a standard.
