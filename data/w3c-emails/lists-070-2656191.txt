From today's meeting.

In terms of people with disabilities....

'What are the reasons (not to do with money) that mean
that it's a good idea to ensure that web pages are
backwards compatible.'?

1. Assistive technology takes time to catch up with
developments in technology for non-disabled people.

2. People with disabilities (especially those with
cognitive disabilities) may find it harder to recognise
the importance or value of upgrading their software.

3. It takes time for non-English (internationalised)
versions of software to be produced.

Cheers
Graham
