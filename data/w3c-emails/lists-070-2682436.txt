This seems like a good idea.
?
My email was down for awhile so I missed a few posts, however I have
checked the archives and haven't seen any discussion on this.? Has it
been decided that it is not useful?

   Sorry--I forgot to put asterisks and?notes?on a couple of the
   guideline changes. Here it is again:
   
   

      As a result of today's conference call, and specifically a comment
      that Gregg made, I took a look at our document as a whole, and I
      have come up with an alternate meta-organization scheme that I'm
      including in this email for consideration. I have reduced our four
      main guidelines into three, and I have re-titled them. This
      required some rearranging of the checkpoints. Each change to the
      checkpoints is noted in the context of the list below and marked
      with an asterisk. I did not delete or alter the wording of any of
      the checkpoints, just the main guidelines. My re-organization does
      not take into account any recent discussion of the combining of
      checkpoints or any of the smaller details, but this is an attempt
      to organize our thoughts on the bigger picture. 

      ?

      1.0 MAKE THE CONTENT AVAILABLE to a broad range of users and
      technologies. 

      1.1???????????? Provide a text equivalent for all non-text
      content.

      1.2???????????? Provide synchronized media equivalents for
      time-dependent presentations.

      1.3???????????? *Identify the primary natural language of text and
      text equivalents and all changes in natural language (previously
      1.4).

      1.4?????????????*?Choose technologies that support the use of
      these guidelines?(previously 4.1).

      1.5?????????????*?Use technologies according to
      specification(previously??4.2).

      1.6?????????????*?Design user interfaces compatible with assistive
      technology(previously??4.3)?. 

      1.7???????????? *?Use device-independent event handlers
      (previously 2.5). 

      1.8?????????????*?Ensure that content remains usable when
      technologies that modify default user agent processing or behavior
      are turned off or not supported? (previously??4.4)??.

      

      ?

      2.0 ALLOW FOR USER NEEDS AND PREFERENCES.

      2.1???????????? Provide multiple site navigation mechanisms.

      2.2???????????? Provide consistent and predictable responses to
      user actions.

      2.3???????????? Either give users control of mechanisms that cause
      extreme changes in context or warn them of pending changes.

      2.4???????????? Either give users control over how long they can
      interact with content that requires a timed response or give them
      as much time as possible.

      2.5???????????? *Avoid causing the screen to flicker (previously
      2.6).

      2.6???????????? *Handle input errors, such as misspellings
      (previously 2.7). 

      ?

      3.0 MAKE THE CONTENT COMPREHENSIBLE.

      3.1???????????? Use consistent presentation.

      3.2???????????? *Use markup or a data model to provide the logical
      structure of content (previously 1.3).

      3.3???????????? *Separate content and structure from presentation
      (previously 1.5).

      3.4???????????? *Emphasize structure through presentation,
      positioning, and labels (previously 3.2).

      3.5???????????? *Write as clearly and simply as is appropriate for
      the content (previously 3.3).

      3.6???????????? *Supplement text with non-text content (previously
      3.4).

      3.7???????????? *Annotate complex, abbreviated, or unfamiliar
      information with summaries and definitions (previously 3.5).
