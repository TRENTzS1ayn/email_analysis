I like this too.

One of the things that I would suggest is that we reinforce the ideas that:

1. Order of checkpoints is not significant
2. We care about all kinds of accessibility

And I would suggest we do it by changing the order. I think there is a
general perception that WCAG 1 didn't provide a lot of support for things
which are clearly crucial to the accessibility, as well as the general
success, of a site - clear writing, usable navigation structures,
illustration, etc.

If we start with the things that designers realise they are trying to do -
communicate clearly - we get to point out that these things are not strange
requirements but normal parts of what people expect. We should be clear in
the introduction that some things are of this nature - things we expect
designers to be somewhat familiar with - and other things are more technical
requirements to make things work with specific technologies.

I would also move the old 1.3 and 1.5 (3.2 and 3.3 in Paul's proposal) into
section 2, since they are about providing for user preferences (by providing
support for users to reconfigure as far as they want and are able).

just my 2c worth

cheers
