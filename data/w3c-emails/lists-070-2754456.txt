My response:

I think you're right. The old 1.3 and 1.5 probably would fit under
"Allow for user needs and preferences" in my organization. Here is my
organization again, taking into account Charles' suggestion (asterisks
mark checkpoints that have been assigned new numbers, and references to
the old numbers are included at the end of the checkpoint):


 

1.0 MAKE THE CONTENT AVAILABLE to a broad range of users and
technologies. 

1.1 Provide a text equivalent for all non-text content.

1.2 Provide synchronized media equivalents for time-dependent
presentations.

1.3 * Identify the primary natural language of text and text equivalents
and all changes in natural language (previously 1.4).

1.4 * Choose technologies that support the use of these guidelines
(previously 4.1).

1.5 * Use technologies according to specification (previously  4.2).

1.6 * Design user interfaces compatible with assistive technology
(previously  4.3). 

1.7 * Use device-independent event handlers (previously 2.5). 

1.8 * Ensure that content remains usable when technologies that modify
default user agent processing or behavior are turned off or not
supported  (previously  4.4).


 

2.0 ALLOW FOR USER NEEDS AND PREFERENCES.

2.1 * Use markup or a data model to provide the logical structure of
content (previously 1.3).

2.2 * Separate content and structure from presentation (previously 1.5).

2.3 * Provide multiple site navigation mechanisms. (previously 2.1)

2.4 * Provide consistent and predictable responses to user actions.
(previously 2.2)

2.5 * Either give users control of mechanisms that cause extreme changes
in context or warn them of pending changes. (previously 2.3)

2.6 * Either give users control over how long they can interact with
content that requires a timed response or give them as much time as
possible. (previously 2.4)

2.7 * Avoid causing the screen to flicker (previously 2.6).

2.8 * Handle input errors, such as misspellings (previously 2.7). 

 

3.0 MAKE THE CONTENT COMPREHENSIBLE.

3.1 Use consistent presentation.

3.2 Emphasize structure through presentation, positioning, and labels.

3.3 Write as clearly and simply as is appropriate for the content.

3.4 Supplement text with non-text content.

3.5 Annotate complex, abbreviated, or unfamiliar information with
summaries and definitions.
