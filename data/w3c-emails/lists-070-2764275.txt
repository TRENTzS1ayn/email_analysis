As I'm sitting reading our current revision of the WCAG requirements,
does anyone else think of Dyslexia in this section? I know of people
that have to carry notes to themselves with how to write certain
characters and things like that also. Is there anyone with ideas on
how these can be overcome, or am I opening up a "can of worms" so to
speak? I know even with me, I'll be reading something and my words
will get mixed up so I can't read correctly anymore and I'll have to
put a straight edge of some kind down just to distinguish words and
sentences. It's harder to explain exactly, but it makes it hard
sometimes as I'm a web programmer.
