Hi Paul
Yes I really like this too (you've got the Australasian
contingent happy anyway!)
One suggestion

Alter
2.0 ALLOW FOR USER NEEDS AND PREFERENCES

to

2.0 ALLOW FOR USER NEEDS, ABILITIES AND PREFERENCES

My reasoning was set out in [1]

To summarise I think that it is easy for non-disabled
people to focus on what disabled people cannot do
rather on what they can do.
The inclusion of 'abilities' is meant to address this a
bit.

Great Job, thanks
