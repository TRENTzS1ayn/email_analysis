Hi,

Al has an excellent point with his observations:

    "So we should not disallow server side diversity.  We do need to continue
    to work on a clearer statement of the functional requirements and tactical
    approaches that let this diversity add more than it subtracts."

    .
    .
    .

    "That is the primary mode in which disability-adaptive views will
    first reach the public in volume -- through site partnerships
    between a look and feel site dedicated to a group that strongly
    benefits from a particular and atypical look and feel; and content
    services that deliver content to multiple sites each with its own
    version of look and feel.  This tier system is emerging in the
    mainstream web independent of disability issues.  We need to
    understand its upside and channel it in that direction or we will
    realize too late that it has happened and we are left with only the
    downside."

    .
    .
    .

    "Oh they do!  This is true.  They think they want just what everybody
    else gets.  This is because they don't know what the alternative is.
    Those who have experienced the options appreciate the value of
    having options.  There is just no comparison between how easy it is
    to learn to use a voice portal as compared to how easy it is to
    browse the web with a screen reader.  If the websites will just put
    up their voice portal version in a way so the screen reader user can
    opt into that mode, and know what they are getting, a lot of
    confusion and wasted time groping through visually composed web
    pages will be avoided."

    .
    .
    .

    "It's perfectly fine for you to take this approach.  But the enhanced
    usability of divergent representations of a service is not something
    that you should be allowed to deny to our clients.  Imposing this on
    everyone is just forcing disability access into a technological
    backwater, just like Baudot in TTY and plain text for screen reader
    compatibility."

The technology is being developed and refined where multiple versions of
web pages for various companies, universities, etc,  can be readily
created and maintained.  The disabled population can either ignore the
directions that technology is going or jump on board and figure out how
to take advantage of the evolving technology to ensure that disabled
people not only can use web pages, but use them in ways that do not put
them at a competitive disadvantage.

I'd like to suggest that the standards list functional requirements for
generic browser web pages (or some shorter name).

In the case of sign language we can't wave off natural language differences as not our problem because there is such a strong link between an absence of hearing function and an orientation to sign language as a primary means of communication.

There is a certain amount of trial and error that is unavoidable because people themselves cannot describe what works best for them.

It is up to the content provider to let them know that at that point that they have a choice.  _Under these conditions of duress!!!_  It has to be <expletive/> clear.  How widespread this message has to be on the site is a matter for exploration.  At least according to Nielsen Norman Group, the best plan is to plan on deep linking and provide basic orientation to the site on every page.

The "where's" in this requirement have to expand to include the divergently-presented alternatives.  That's a tall order, but when done well, it's better.

So major sites may well wish to outsource their adaptation to affinity group portals.

And the service offerors need to tell the same story regardless of the channel that the user selects to access the service.

But there are some people you can bring in under the 'big tent' this way that would be left out by any single version.  So it is more inclusive to allow multimode serving than to insist on one 'universal' form.  So long as the diversity is not taken as an excuse to make all the forms narrow and inflexible.

Some adaptation of the omnibus services, and some targeted assistive services to cover where that doesn't go.  The van only serves qualifying individuals.  Should we drop the van service?

Most of the sites that we can do that level of analysis and documentation of what they are processing are those that embrace a single-source multi-channel strategy.  If we don't work with this trend, it will only work against us.
