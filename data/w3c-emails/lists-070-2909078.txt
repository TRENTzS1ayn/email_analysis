Hi,
For some months now I have been reading with great interest the debate that
has raged.  Quite frankly I haven't participated before because someone else
usually had the same viewpoint.

The issue of multiple versions of a page has however seemed to be missing 1
point.  If you have already covered this, then I apologise - just ignore
this email.   Focusing on abilities is better than focusing on disabilities.
It's important to remember that very often particularly if the disability is
intellectual or cognitive, that it is accompanied by other disabilities.
For example, my son has Down Syndrome, autism, a moderate hearing loss and
probably photo-sensitive epilepsy.  He also has no depth perception and
requires glasses to read.

All I'm really saying is - consider the possibility of more than one
disability.  Easier said than done I know - since I don't know how to
program for that either.

It's nice to finally talk to you all and thank you for the significant
effort you are all putting in to helping people like my son.

Lee Otto
