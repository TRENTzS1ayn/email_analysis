The information for the 23/24 March F2F meeting is available at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/03/f2f-agenda.html

This page includes an agenda, hotel information, a list of required reading materials and instructions on how to dial into the meeting if you can not attend in person.  

Please note: if you plan to attend by phone please register for the meeting.  At this time I have reserved a bridge for 10 people, if more people plan on attending by phone I need to reserve a larger bridge.

Registration closes on 15 March 2002.

The agenda has been updated per discussion at today's telecon.  If you have suggestions, additions, etc. please send them either to the list or privately to me, Gregg, and Jason.
