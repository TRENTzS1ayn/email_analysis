Hi,

I think Lee is right, and one major problem with having multiple
versions of a web page is that we can NEVER know the variety of
disabilities a person may have, and therefore splitting an accessible
web site into several sites can end up making that site essentially
inaccessible. What I mean, is that if someone needs checkpoints A and B
to access a site will not be able to do so if checkpoint A is solved by
Site Version 1, and checkpoint B by Site Version 3.

Cheers,
Gian
