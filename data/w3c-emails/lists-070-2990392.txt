Sometimes one item conflicts for different user  gropes
eg: use of jargon (good for some bad for others), more  multimedia  items
less words (see feedback on 3.3 email), using color to emphasize structure
against a black and white page that is good for people without  any cone
vision. etc etc.

Keeping basic accessibility on all accessible renderings but having any
amount of sever side automatic renderings, optimized to different scenarios,
is to me, state of the art accessibility. Have a look at our home page if
you are still not convinced.

All the best,
Lisa
