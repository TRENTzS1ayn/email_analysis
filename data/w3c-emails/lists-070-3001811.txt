Hi,

Here's an example of the ways the technology world outside of the
disabled community is looking at technology to support individualization
of web experience.  A person's disability would be just another factor
in the decision making process.

Subject:      Call for papers: Adaptive Systems for Web Based Education

Dear colleagues:

Please find attached (and if possible distribute) the call for papers for:

WASWBE'02: Workshop on Adaptive Systems for Web Based Education
http://sirius.lcc.uma.es/WASWE2002/

In conjunction with

2nd International Conference on Adaptive Hypermedia and Adaptive
Web-Based Systems (http://www.lcc.uma.es/AH2002)

May 28, 2002. M?laga, SPAIN

Workshop Description:

Web-based education is currently a hot research and development area.
Benefits of Web-based education are clear at hand: learners from all
over the world can enroll in learning activities, communicate with
other students or teachers, can discuss and control their learning
progress - solely based on an internet-capable computer.  A
challenging research goal is to tailor the access to web-based
education systems to the individual learners' needs, as determined by
such factors as their previous knowledge on the subject, their
learning style, their general attitude and/or their cultural or
linguistic background.
The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for the discussion of
recent trends and perspectives in adaptive systems for web-based
education, and thus to continue the series of workshops on this topic
held at past conferences, e.g. :

AIED'97 http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~plb/AIED97_workshop,
ITS'98    http://www-aml.cs.umass.edu/~stern/webits/itsworkshop/ and
ITS?00   http://virtcampus.cl-ki.uni-osnabrueck.de/its-2000
