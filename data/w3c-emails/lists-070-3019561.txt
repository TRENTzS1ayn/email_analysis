Hi,

I think there's another way to look at some of the accessibility issues.
I believe there are more dominant aspects and less dominant aspects
and ways to do some bundling of requirements.

A critical factor is use of mainly text as compared to a more visual format.
If there are additional requirements such as the text version doesn't
use javascript (or severely limitis its use in various ways), the text version
doesn't use tables except for formatting table, the text version has a
very linear format; the format can be used to provide accessibility
in a number of ways.
