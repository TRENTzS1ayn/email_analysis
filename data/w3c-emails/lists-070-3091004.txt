Well, this needs to be balanced against the fact that a specialised version
might be many times more accessible for a given group.

I think that the method of getting around different versions of the same
content needs always to cover "everything", and that the accessibility in
general of a given resource is only as good as the general accessibility
available in a given version of that resource.

But within these constraints there are ways of providing multiple "views" of
a single resource taht are useful in different contexts.

In the development of content for mobile devices all this is taken as
"given". But there they make the false assumption that knowing what the
browser is defines what the user needs - in accessibility users lie about
what browser they have, for good reason, and browsers are not always able to
know what is between them and an end user - one approach to assistive
technology which has been followed for many years makes that more or less
impossible.

On the other hand, CC/PP provides an architectural model (currently lacking
in any techniques or appropriate vocabulary definitions) that could be used
to solve this problem too for many cases that are currently more or less
intractable.

  Hi,

  I think Lee is right, and one major problem with having multiple
  versions of a web page is that we can NEVER know the variety of
  disabilities a person may have, and therefore splitting an accessible
  web site into several sites can end up making that site essentially
  inaccessible. What I mean, is that if someone needs checkpoints A and B
  to access a site will not be able to do so if checkpoint A is solved by
  Site Version 1, and checkpoint B by Site Version 3.

  Cheers,
  Gian
