Well, like all people with language difficulties they look for stuff that
helps. Multimedia (in this case graphic information), simple language,
interactivity, ...

like people with learning difficulties it is not true to say that they cannot
make any use of written language, just that it can provide a limited amount
of commmunication which needs to be augmented in large part.

As you pointed out, most people who are Deaf do still learn to read and
write, but they still have difficulty with this as a communication method.

(I should write more, but I have to go home before the last bus does)

cheers

Charles

  Thanks so much for the explanation Charles. It put things in a different

  use?
