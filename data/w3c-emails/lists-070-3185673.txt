 All in all,  I enjoyed reading this one, (really pointed out what I had
 missed.)

 the upper limit could be every page can be summarized. For very simple
 pages,
 this can be done through a good title. (e.g. something.com's products)
 I can sometimes be at a relatively simple page, and it is something of an
 intellectual exercise to know what this page is actually about.

 Many sites have the same title for all pages. this is often less then a
 summary of the page, but a marketing thing for search engines.

 We can say that for most content five sentences is the maximum.
 If your content is exceptional, such as...(I have no idea when this is
 truly impossible) were short paragraphs are not possible, then use as short
as possible.


Can you give me an example of a paragraphed of more then five sentences,
 that could not be broken up?

 The test I think we had marked out for it was if you just have the
highlight
 content. Does the document flow? are any key points not represented?

 That is human testable.

 absolutely the why is very important. we will get there.

 There are. I wrote a few email to the list on this.

 we had using a literal translation tool to a foreign language, and then
 doing
 a literal translation tool to go back to the original language. If the
 meaning is different then that is how some people will read
 it.

 I think that the more commonly used a word is, more easily it is
understood.

 To make this easily testable we need a Thesaurus / dictionary that ranks
 word usage.

 I had understood that we could consider something testable even if the tool
 was not yet created for it, but could be created and assume that Bobby or
 others will follow suit, even if there is some time laps.


 All the best
