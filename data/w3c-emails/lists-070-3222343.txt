Maybe, -if consepts in the page are included in the title - or somthing like
that. In other words, if a table of content is on a page titled table of
content, then ther is no new content, just details or information about that
consept.
The same is true for a product isting page titled "product listing"
It is not tue for a page titled " discussionb omn checkpoint 3.3"
that would require a summary.

cool, maybe we could do it interms of word count. Can a paragrafe be clear
if it is nore then 150 words long?

I think that is the point they translate it litraly, andif it comes back
lodercrase then it is not a sentece that makes sence when read litraly.

children seem to gain aproximatly the same first 500 words followed by the
same next 2000 words. If one three year old with a five humndred word
vocablery understand what you are saying the next one will to. It will vairy
a bit by location but the principle is there.

I am preety sure that this data is documented somwere. It is often quoted in
child raiseng books.

How about " if a Thesaurus subvsitution can be made with a word in the
"first 500" or "first 2000" - use that. (This is assuming that the
subsitution does not degrade the meaning of the sentence. )

This is machtien testible, we just need the tool to highlight each word were
this is the case and suggest a subsitution, a bit like a speal checker.
I could proberbly even find a student to do build it as a final year
project. It might even be ready at about the same time as WACG 2.

Doese that help your dreams along?

This is like the acsample by Charles at the last FTF using RUBY. ALternitve
renderings. Thats what I say.
