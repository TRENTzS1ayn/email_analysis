As always being a little bl**** minded and difficult:

In my experience users prefer communication that use mainly symbols (place
markers) that they already know.

Hence one might have a sentence of perhaps 10 words with only one image
(baby) and the reader can tell from the context what baby is referred to.
as opposed to offering very many symbols which may confuse.

Generally, early signers will also show this preference.

This for the present makes it slightly more difficult to ensure that a
translation suits all audiences.
