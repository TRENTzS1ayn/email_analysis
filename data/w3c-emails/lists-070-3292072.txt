Hi,
I really just wanted to echo Jason's comments. I believe that the issue of
whether we have a single source web page or multiple versions should not be
defined in a standard.  It should be the author's decision based on the
material they are presenting.  

Thanks for your time and attention.

Shouldn't this be open to the author to decide, depending on the
nature of the document and the circumstances? Of course we can provide
appropriate advice, but why constrain the author's options
unnecessarily by prescribing one or the other of these options under
particular circumstances?
