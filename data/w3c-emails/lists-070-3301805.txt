Hi Jo
My take on all this is as follows....

If your audience includes people with intellectual
disabilities, then either 

a.
You create one piece of content which is created to be
accessible to everyone.

or

b.
You create 2 pieces of content, one for people who do
not have intellectual impairments and one for those
that do.
