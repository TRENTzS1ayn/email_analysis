I agree, but please note, I can not think of a single example were your web
page could not have someone with a cognitive disabilities.

Take a home page for your immediate family. Can you stop your father from
aging? Will he tell you when his memory starts to go? Or will he try to
cover it up?

Is any content so complex that you have a grantee that it is not potential
comprehensible by a sever dyslexic (such as myself)?

All the best,
