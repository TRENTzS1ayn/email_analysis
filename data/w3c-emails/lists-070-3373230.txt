Intellectual impairments covers a very smooth continuum, let us say sponge
like.
By which it is implied that no single version will be accessible to all.

In theory one could have a dial that was turned very slowly, however perhaps
for the present it is worth considering the very large numbers that are
excluded because of their low literacy.

People's motivation is as important as their abilities.

Guidelines for motivating would be interesting indeed.
