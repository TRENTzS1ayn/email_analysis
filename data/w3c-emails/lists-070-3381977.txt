I agree that the author should be free to decide. What I'm saying is 
that we have not articulated that position, and its implications, 
clearly enough in our drafts and discussions.

We must make it plain that providing multiple versions is one way to 
satisfy the checkpoint. Otherwise, authors reading the checkpoint are 
unlikely to understand what their options are. If they mistakenly 
think the checkpoint prohibits them from publishing anything that a 
child could not easily understand, they will howl bloody murder, and 
rightly so.
