a significant number of students cannot identify a musical note as an
indicator for music.
these are students who are good communicators, and quite able to tell one
whose music they like or not.

I've not been able to discover what might be responsible for this problem,
though it is certainly not a cultural one.
More problematically, what other symbol could be used?

context can be very helpful, a toolbar that 'tells a story' is here
http://www.peepo.com/2k2/toolbars.html
almost certainly you'll have problems with one or two symbols.

I suppose I'll soon get around to using css instead of crudding it.
but this is your very last chance to catch the one and only link from google
to 'xhtml &nsp;'

thanks
