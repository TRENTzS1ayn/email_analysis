OK, this has been sitting on my plate for ages, so I thought I would kick it
off with a handful of quick things - these are more like quick tips (which
are useful for assessment) and are not yet related to all the WCAG
guidelines. I'll build  it as I go...

Things I am sure of

There must be a title and a desc element for the image as a whole, unless the
    image is only a representation of text.

2. Ensure that text included is grouped in such a way that it describes a
    sensible reading order

Each identifiable visual object in the image must have a title and should
    have a desc.
    A picture of a cow is an identifiable visual object. One of the spots on
    the cow normally isn't.

Each identifiable visual object should be grouped into a single element.
    For example it might be a path, including a title childd, or it might be
    a group.

Each animation element needs a desc child

Things that are often helpful...

Use metadata to describe formal relationships  between visual objects -
    for example flowcharts, relational graphs.

Use animation rather than scripting to present visual styling effects. (I
think that to make "substantive cntent changes" it might be better to use
scripts, which will change the DOM, unlike animations. This gets interesting
about here...)

So there is a very rough start at my 2c worth
