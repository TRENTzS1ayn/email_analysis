We keep on discussing the problems of how to make something accessible
when it cannot be changed.

This is, obviously, a real world problem. The solution seems equally  obvious
- equivalent alternatives need to be provided. To the extent that they manage
to be equivalent they will provide accesssibility. Obviously, in most cases
equivalence is only limited - whether it is a version of the EU treaties that
ordinary people can read, instead of the full legalese, or a description of a
rough cartoon, it is going to convey information that the cretor of the
equivalent thinks is essential for understanding the original, and leave out
things that other people may find in the original.

And we can't guarantee that people will do this. All we can do is tell them
how.
