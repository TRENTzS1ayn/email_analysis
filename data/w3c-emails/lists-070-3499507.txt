If you mean they cannot identify it originally, it is no surprise to me. 
Most of the icons need to be learned first.

Or do you mean they cannot remember it later after the icon has been 
explained, or they have more difficulties remembering it than other icons 
that they did not know originally. In that case I'm not sure, maybe they 
have never played or sung from notes and it therefore remains abstract and 
unconnected to anything familiar.
