Hi,

I think Jason has a point about supporting a greater range of complexity.
However, I think it would be helpful if there was better understanding
of three or four basic pages in order that users don't have to make
a lot of choices.  A reasonable approach might be where the user can
choose some basic model and then fine tune the model if desired.
