Well, to make it a bit more solid I have taken some stuff from the SVG 1.1
last call draft, which (like all good specifications) has a chapter on
accessibility - http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/access.html - together with a bit
more thinking, and the stuff that was lying around already.

The results are still fairly rough and sketchy, but now have something
approximating a home...

(The latest version URI takes you to the wrong place at the moment - I will
fix that...)

  OK, this has been sitting on my plate for ages, so I thought I would kick it
  off with a handful of quick things - these are more like quick tips (which
  are useful for assessment) and are not yet related to all the WCAG
  guidelines. I'll build  it as I go...

  Things I am sure of

  There must be a title and a desc element for the image as a whole, unless the
      image is only a representation of text.

  2. Ensure that text included is grouped in such a way that it describes a
      sensible reading order

  Each identifiable visual object in the image must have a title and should
      have a desc.
      A picture of a cow is an identifiable visual object. One of the spots on
      the cow normally isn't.

  Each identifiable visual object should be grouped into a single element.
      For example it might be a path, including a title childd, or it might be
      a group.

  Each animation element needs a desc child

  Things that are often helpful...

  Use metadata to describe formal relationships  between visual objects -
      for example flowcharts, relational graphs.

  Use animation rather than scripting to present visual styling effects. (I
  think that to make "substantive cntent changes" it might be better to use
  scripts, which will change the DOM, unlike animations. This gets interesting
  about here...)

  So there is a very rough start at my 2c worth
