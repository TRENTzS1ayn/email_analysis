In Acrobat 5, this user would control the background and text colors by 
setting them in the Accessibility Preferences panel. And Acrobat has always 
supported magnification of the entire page, just not the text separately from 
the rest of the contents. If the PDF file has been marked up appropriately for 
accessibility (that is, it is a Tagged PDF), the user will also be able to 
reflow the contents of the page, making it much easier to read at large 
magnfications.

These are features of the Acrobat 5 User Agent, of course, which gets us back 
to the problems of backwards compatability.
