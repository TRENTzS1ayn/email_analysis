Yes, but remember that we are building guidelines for the world, not
just the English-speaking world.

I would say that you want your content to be compatible with user agents
and assistive technologies available in the language of the content.
So, if the content is in English, you have a lot of options.  If the
content is in French or Russian or Tagalog, you have fewer. Hmmm...
Maybe that should be a checkpoint?

As to the issue of affordability, I don't think it is reasonable to put
the entire burden on the web author.  The user has some responsibility
to find and use the technologies he needs.  Remember the wheelchair
analogy -- it's the building owner's responsibility to build the ramp,
and the wheelchair-user's responsibility to buy the wheelchair.  If he
can't afford the wheelchair, or the electricity to charge it, he may
need to find funding for it (from governments, charities, family, etc).
The same is true of hardware, software, and assistive technology.

Well using this theory, then I doubt that people having English as a
second language can be defined as a disability - isn't it more a
'problem people encounter in life'?
