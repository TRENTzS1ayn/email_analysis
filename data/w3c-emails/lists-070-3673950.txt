The problem with reasonable grouping as I see it is that it doesn?t
allow for multiple disabilities -- cause they are random.

A person can have any mix or subset of 

Low vision (many types)
Blindness
Hearing Impairments (many types)
Deafness
Physical disabilities (many types)
Cognitive disabilities
Language disabilities 
Seizure disorders
Or all of the above (and I have had clients with all of the above)

Since you can have any combination,  how can you have 'logical
groupings" of access features?

I LIKE server side tuning for different combinations of the above.  But
unless we have a very sophisticated means to ask, discuss, negotiate and
come up with the right combination of features ---- for all browsers (or
a vast majority )  then we need  to have a default, cross disability
accessible version --- don?t we?
