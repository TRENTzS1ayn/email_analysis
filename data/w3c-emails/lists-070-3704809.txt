Definitely, but keep in mind that those are no more likely to solve the
problems of multiple disabilities than anything else. We need to be
careful not to think that a single "accessible" version is a magic
bullet. The problem of complex disability needs still exists no matter
how many versions you have. Restricting yourself to one (as some would
do) is less of a solution than adding 5 more to that one.
