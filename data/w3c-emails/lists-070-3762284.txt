Comment 4.  Is there a recommended list of access keys to use for
functions?
 
Issue: If we don't mention this, it will be unclear on  how to
implement. 

Solution:  Provide a list of access keys or references for products and
what they use.  Please note, this is not my area and defer to people
with more expertise.
