Comment 5.  Under forms and tables, I do not think we go far enought in
providing examples on how to properly implement form controls.

Issue: There needs to be use case scenarios deribing all the possible
form controls (input, textarea, select, option box for radio and check
as well as combo, and submit).  Neither Section 508 nor W3C goes far
enough to greatly reduce user interpretation.  

Solution:  There are two solutions: (1) Provide examples using all form
controls in a table with two columns for layout. (2) Provide example
using all form controls without a table.  These are the two most common
usages that I see in competitive research.
