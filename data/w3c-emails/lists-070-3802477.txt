If HTML 4.01 is the baseline for this document, I think the solution should
be to use the "button" element, which would allow authors to add HTML
including images to button faces, rather than using "input type=image". I'm
not sure how all user agents support button, however. (There is a section in
the techniques XML to add implementation details from one UA to another,
though.)

Alternately, I think we should require that the site be usable when "input
type=image" is sent with x and y coordinates of 0, which is what IE and
Netscape send when an image input is activated by keyboard. Since almost all
instances of image inputs that I've ever seen ignore the coordinates, this
would be a minor concession to be made only by those who are using the x and
y values.

I think where this goes, in HTML or server-side techniques, is a gray area.
My vote would be in server-side techniques, since HTML itself has no sense
of state, as it's all provided by HTTP or server magic.

This is already part of the plan. The code will be transformed into HTML
where applicable (no point doing it for the "title" element, for example),
and the XML document also provides for screen shots of how the document
appears in various browsers, and hopefully sound files of output from screen
readers and the like.
