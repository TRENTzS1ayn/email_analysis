Food for thought. Been thinking about the button created by input=image.
This is widely used and don't think it can be avoided as it is also
widely noted in many books.  If you think the coordinates do not need to
be posted, then may I suggest keep them off, however, u can always put a
note that some browsers may require this.

If HTML 4.01 is the baseline for this document, I think the solution
should
be to use the "button" element, which would allow authors to add HTML
including images to button faces, rather than using "input type=image".
I'm
not sure how all user agents support button, however. (There is a
section in
the techniques XML to add implementation details from one UA to another,
though.)

Alternately, I think we should require that the site be usable when
"input
type=image" is sent with x and y coordinates of 0, which is what IE and
Netscape send when an image input is activated by keyboard. Since almost
all
instances of image inputs that I've ever seen ignore the coordinates,
this
would be a minor concession to be made only by those who are using the x
and
y values.

I think where this goes, in HTML or server-side techniques, is a gray
area.
My vote would be in server-side techniques, since HTML itself has no
sense
of state, as it's all provided by HTTP or server magic.

This is already part of the plan. The code will be transformed into HTML
where applicable (no point doing it for the "title" element, for
example),
and the XML document also provides for screen shots of how the document
appears in various browsers, and hopefully sound files of output from
screen
readers and the like.
