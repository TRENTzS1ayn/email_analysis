Hi,

I think it would be helpful to first take a stab at some of the functionality
groupings before trying to determine that the people are getting the version
they can use.  The nature of the groupings might influence how a user
can request them.  A second question that comes into mind is what is the
definition of "best version" for a user.  How much different is "best"
as compared to "sufficient"?
