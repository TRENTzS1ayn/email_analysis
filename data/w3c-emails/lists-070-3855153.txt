Hi,

I think one clustering of attributes or functionality might include:

    a standard linear format
    no javascript
    tables not used for format, only for data
    no images, only descriptions which are links to images
    no flash, etc, but links to flash elements

I'd also like to see some of the categorization tested in terms of
accessibility rather than just than being based on opinions.  For
example, time disabled people using general web pages as compared
to how efficient they are using based pages based on categorization.

Scott
