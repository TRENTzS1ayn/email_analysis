Hi,

This kind of goes back to some hard issues of values.  Is it appropriate
to make something harder for a person with a single disability
because they may have the same disability as someone who has
additional disabilities or is it appropriate to make it harder for
someone with multiple disabilities than it is for someone with
a single disability?  A naive answer might be that designers can make
it equally easy for both people.  While this might be achievable in
some situations, it is most likely requires additional resources
to accomplish this.  Forcing the use of a single web page format
brings up these questions.

I think that until some effort is put into looking at various potential
categorizations, it probably doesn't make sense to look at how to handle
such aspects of user/browser specification of features.
