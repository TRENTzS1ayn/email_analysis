Hi,

I think that the grouping I started describing would benefit screen
reader users.  Users who have older browser technology, slower
connections or PDA's could also benefit.  Another group who might
benefit is the web page developers.  The reason why I mention web site
developers is that they might be able to reduce the amount of effort
needed to determine the accessibility of web pages.  For example, the
web site developer could go through various cycles of determining how
web pages "linearize" and fixing problems identified.  Or they could
just create web pages which don't use tables and that reduces amount of
linearization checking that needs to be done.

I may not sure who loses with this grouping if another version of the
web page is developed.  Maybe part of the question is identifying what
is lost and how critical that loss is to functionality.

I think the extension to "unusable" is pretty good.  Maybe, we are
discussing a range from "best" to "sufficient" to "barely usable" to
"unusable".
