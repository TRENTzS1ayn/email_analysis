Hi,

My suspicion is that there might be two or three main categories of
versions of web pages.  One useful approach would be for authoring
tools to keep enough information to automatically generate these various
versions of a web page.

For web pages which are generated dynamically as needed, the issue of
content being updated becomes more an issue of updating the data storage
which is used for providing the information for the web pages being
generated.
