Hi,

There was a recent posting on CHI-WEB about a web page with an article
called "Text-only is not accessible".  The web page is at:

    http://infocentre.frontend.com/servlet/Infocentre?access=no&page=article&rows=5&id=286

Now an interesting aspect of this web page is that in the upper right
corner of the web page there is a link labeled "accessible".  This
links the user to a web page with the same article in a format designed
to be more accessible.


With regards to our discussion of multiple versions, I was thinking it
might be interesting to get some comments about what different people's
experiences are using the different versions.  One of the aspects I'd
be interested in hearing about is differences in speed or efficiency.

Scott
