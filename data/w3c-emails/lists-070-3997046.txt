Interesting example. Actually, as a visual user of a text-only browser I
found both versions the same to use. Which seemed to argue the author's point
that a single version works best.

However, I think that a better test would be to use a whole site, not just a
single page. Does anyone have some examples of functional sites that can be
tested like this?

I would like to spend more of my time reading the newspaper. The newspaper I
would like to read is the Age, published in Melbourne, and it is available
online in 3 versions  - standard, text and handheld. I think it might be
instructive for anyone who has time to read the paper 2 or 3 times a day for
a few weeks to compare these versions:

standard: http://www.theage.com.au/
text: http://www.theage.com.au/text/index.html
handheld: http://www.theage.com.au/handheld/index.html

From my preliminary look, one of the things that I wonder about is finding my
way between them. It took a lot of searching to discover that these other
versions were available, and I wonder how someone using the handheld version
can give me a pointer to an article in the most appropriate way for em to
find it in my preferred version.

cheers

  Hi,

  There was a recent posting on CHI-WEB about a web page with an article
  called "Text-only is not accessible".  The web page is at:

      http://infocentre.frontend.com/servlet/Infocentre?access=no&page=article&rows=5&id=286

  Now an interesting aspect of this web page is that in the upper right
  corner of the web page there is a link labeled "accessible".  This
  links the user to a web page with the same article in a format designed
  to be more accessible.


  With regards to our discussion of multiple versions, I was thinking it
  might be interesting to get some comments about what different people's
  experiences are using the different versions.  One of the aspects I'd
  be interested in hearing about is differences in speed or efficiency.

  Scott
