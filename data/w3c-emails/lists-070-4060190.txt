Subject: Questions from Face to Face

 


Questions about the checkpoints


During the face to face, we raised the issue of there being several
questions that might arise as one reads the guidelines for the first
time. There were some comments that to the extent possible, these
questions should be answered within the guideline itself. To explore
this issue further, Gregg suggested a list of these quesitons be
collected. Below is the list of the questions I could think of and
others I collected during the face to face meeting.

 

*     Guideline 1 - Perceivable

o    Checkpoint 1.1 Provide a text equivalent for all non-text content. 

*     For images, does this mean I have to have an alt text for all
images?

*     For images, does this mean I have to use a long description for
all images?

*     Does this require a text equivalent for every QT movie, Flash
element or PDF it they meet Guideline 5?

o    Checkpoint 1.2 Provide synchronized media equivalents for
time-dependent presentations. 

*     Do all video presentations require captions and audio
descriptions?

*     Will text description suffice in video with no sound?

o    Checkpoint 1.3 Make all content and structure available
independently of presentation.

*     Do all HTML pages require CSS?

*     Can I use the <font> tag?

 

*     Guideline 2 Operable

o    Checkpoint 2.1 Provide keyboard access to all functionality of the
content. 

*     Do all forms require the use of accesskey?

*     Do all controls of technologies other than XML applications
require shortcut keys? i.e. does the play button of a video player
require a shortcut key?

o    Checkpoint 2.2 Allow users to control any time limits on their
response or interactions times unless control is not possible to due to
nature of real-time events or competition. 

*     Can online exams ever be limited to a specific?

*      

o    Checkpoint 2.3 Avoid causing the screen to flicker. 

*     Can something 'blink' for a short time and stop?

 

*     Guideline 3 - Orientation/Navigation

o    Checkpoint 3.1 Provide structure within content. 

*     Do all HTML pages require use of <h1> through <h6> elements?

o    Checkpoint 3.2 Emphasize structure through presentation(s),
positioning, and labels.

*     Do all heading elements have to be formatting differently? i.e
does <h3> have to be different <h4> in HTML? 

o    Checkpoint 3.3 Provide multiple site navigation mechanisms. 

*     Does a site with 5 pages need to meet this standard? If not, how
large is large enough?

o    Checkpoint 3.4 Use consistent but not necessarily but not
necessarily identical presentation. 

o    Checkpoint 3.5 Provide consistent and predictable responses to user
actions. 

o    Checkpoint 3.6 Either give users control of mechanisms that cause
extreme changes in context or warn them of pending changes.

 

*     Guideline 4 - Comprehension

o    Checkpoint 4.1 Write as clearly and simply as is appropriate for
the content.

o    Checkpoint 4.2 Supplement text with non-text content. 

o    Checkpoint 4.3 Annotate complex, abbreviated, or unfamiliar
information with summaries and definitions. 

o    Checkpoint 4.4 Identify the primary natural language of text and
text equivalents and all changes in natural language. 

*     What about phrases that have coopted by the primary language? For
example the City of Prarie du Chien in Wisconsin, U.S. is not pronounced
in French. 

 

*     Guideline 5 - Pot Luck

o    Checkpoint 5.1 Use technologies according to specification. 

*     How are these specifications identified and ratified?

o    Checkpoint 5.2 Ensure that content remains usable when technologies
that modify default user agent processing or behavior are turned off or
not supported. 

*     Does that mean every element that is not written as an XML
application must have a text equivalent?

o    Checkpoint 5.3 Choose technologies that support interoperability
and compatibility.

*     Does this mean that only W3C technologies are accessible (other
than GIF and JPEG)?

*     What technologies fit this category? 

o    Checkpoint 5.4 Ensure that user interfaces are accessible or
provide an accessible alternative. 

*     The success criteria refer to accessibility conventions. How are
these conventions identified and ratified?
