Most of Joe's stuff I agree with as is and so have removed. On a few poiints
I have made some further comments, interspersed

  Inside <object>, probably. (Just a functional equivalent will do
  there: "Star Wars trailer.") Inside <embed>, probably not, though I
  suppose you could use title="".

Presumably similar kinds of content are added to a page using object and
embed elements - it is more a case of where you rate standardisation in
importance than a difference in what kind of content is being provided.

(the technical details for embed are that a noembed element can be included,
allowing the same kind of content that would be provided inside an object
element, but it works more like a noscript element - i.e. there isn't the
ability to have a cascade of content, as I understand the element. I note
that I have not been able to find any specification of it for about 3 years,
so my memory mey be faulty).

  In HTML variants where it is not deprecated, yes, and even when it
  is, it's not so bad:

  <font class="v" face="Verdana" size="+1">
  and
  .v { font-family: Verdana, Trebuchet, Georgia, Geneva,
  Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px }

  works in pretty much every browser since 1996.
(and earlier, although those browsers don't necessarily provide font control)

  Unfortunately, that does seem to be the requirement as written. I
  think it's too strong.

I agree that such a requirement is too strong, and not necessarily helpful.

  Yes, definitely.

well, a keyboard acticvation method, which might be something slightly
different, but I agree. Also for things that are XML applications.

  No, just valid markup. <p></p> is structural. So is <input> or
  <samp>. It all depends.

In general, one or more heading elements are useful in an HTML page. Although
p elements are structural elements, using differently formatted p elements to
identify titles or subheadings, items in a list, and so on, (as unfortunately
done by many current and most obsolete authoring tools) would be breaking
this checkpint. But as Joe says, It depends.

  A CSS question. No, they don't. I cover this in my forthcoming book.

In terms of distinguishing the levels, it is helpful if they are.

  But it isn't a French word anymore (tennis and rendezvous aren't,
  either). Sushi isn't a Japanese word anymore. Loanwords are clearly
  exempt, and arguably proper names should always be exempt.

I agree with what Joe says. Maybe we should clarify further the point - that
this is for pronunciation, translation (including simplification by
auto-translation), and braille contraction to be done correctly.

An intersting issue arises in connection with teh discussion of how to do
quotes in other languages. In an english text, where there is a passage of
dialogue in french, the normal thing to do would be to use english dialogue
presentation style, but if the dialogue is marked as french then a browser
would normally apply french style for that section (I think, depending on how
the markup is done). I will follow this up further. But it is an edge case
for most users in monolingual countries.

No, it means that any kind of technology beyond the (still undetermined)
baseline must not be relied on for use of a page or site. (which is also
relevant for the question of "what technologies are accessible?")
