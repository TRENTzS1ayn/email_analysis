FYI..............At the face2face we all took an action item to come up
with our most obvious FAQ question for each checkpoint, to add to the
work that others had already done.........but this time based on the new
Draft structure proposed by the Vacationing-Gregg.  We were to compile
that list for our cross-over work with EOWG on a working FAQ.

(I have a pretty good feeling that Bob R. knows the answers to the
questions he proposed in his list........ ;-)...........give the guy a
break..........he got railroaded (volunterily) into being the keeper of
our FAQ questions............
