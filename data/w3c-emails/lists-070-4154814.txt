I have noticed that when using a screen reading browser such as IBM
homepage reader when words are joined together for example "homepage"
the words "home" and "page" are not recognised, as a consequence the joined
words become incomprehensible to the screenreading software. I haven't
found any references to this within the gudielines. have i missed them?
