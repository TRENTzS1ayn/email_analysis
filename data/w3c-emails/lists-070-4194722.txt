14.1 Use the clearest and simplest language appropriate... [priority 1]

Of course at some point speech technology needs to learn how to deal with
common but new terms in a language. Homepage is one that I would expect to
work - especially in a product whose name includes the term. But Text to
Speech is an inexact science - even people who are experts cannot agree to
pronounce words the same way. Just ask a well-trained and very literate
American chemist what the eleme whose symbol is Al is called - they tell you
about a thing called "aluminum". But they are in fact referring to what any
Australian voice recogniser would expect to hear as al-(y)a-min-(i)-yum.

The problem is funnier (after people get over the inconvenience of learning
about it) when a screen reader uses a finnish or swedish synthesiser but
provides its cues and prompts in english...

  the words "home" and "page" are not recognised, as a consequence the joined

  found any references to this within the gudielines. have i missed them?
