I don't know that I explained the purpose of the list well enough. 

The goal here is not to ask what some may see as 'obvious' questions, but to try to identify them. The issue came up in the face to face that several of the guidelines, when read for the first time, lead to these obvious questions. 

To the extent possible, we want the guidelines to answer the questions themselves. This will help to clarify the document, especially for novices or those new to accessibility. 

Cheers,
Bob
