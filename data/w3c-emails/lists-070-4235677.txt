There is probably a good argument for raising the issue of proper names.

In my brief experience it seems that common dictionary words are read 
well enough.
However it seems that people and place names are not.

These are the very words that are of greatest interest.

it would also be great to see a decent ua that offered alternative 
readings (as per spell checker example), a memorise function, and 
possibly the opportunity to share the choice with a public database. 
Perhaps somone knows of this?

thanks
