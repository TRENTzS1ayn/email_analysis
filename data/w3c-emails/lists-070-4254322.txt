It would appear that this is readily available using Speech synthesis markup
language and XSLT (or XSLT 2 perhaps)... or someone can make smarter and
smarter speech synthessisers. If Audio CSS allowed something equivalent to
SSML's say-as propoerty, we would be closer perhaps.

  There is probably a good argument for raising the issue of proper names.

  In my brief experience it seems that common dictionary words are read
  well enough.
  However it seems that people and place names are not.

  These are the very words that are of greatest interest.

  it would also be great to see a decent ua that offered alternative
  readings (as per spell checker example), a memorise function, and
  possibly the opportunity to share the choice with a public database.
  Perhaps somone knows of this?

  thanks
