Maybe I didn't read the original message clearly enough.

But anyway, I think it is valuable both to raise the questions and prpopose
the answers. If we, the woring group disagree on an answer, then clearly this
is not sufficiently explained in the guidelines and we need to tighten it up.
If we do, then we need more ffedback from naive users to tell us if that is
because we have all been sucked into the "W3C cabal", or because it reallly
is clear...

cheers

  The goal here is not to ask what some may see as 'obvious' questions, but
  to try to identify them. The issue came up in the face to face that
  several of the guidelines, when read for the first time, lead to these
  obvious questions.

  To the extent possible, we want the guidelines to answer the questions
  themselves. This will help to clarify the document, especially for
  novices or those new to accessibility.

  Cheers,
