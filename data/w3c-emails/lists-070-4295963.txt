Based on the categorizations in the restructured WCAG 2.0 document,
which are:

1. Perceivability
2. Operability
3. Navigability/Ability to Orient One's Self
4. Comprehension/Understandability

I propose that we include a one-sentence summary of the entire document.
This sentence should be one of the first things in the document--a sort
of executive summary. Here is my proposed sentence:

"Ensure that Web content is maximally perceivable, operable, navigable,
and understandable within and across Web technologies."
