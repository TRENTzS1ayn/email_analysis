Summary

We discussed a few topics that came up at the F2F:
- disclaimer for techniques that are not W3C techniques
- using the techniques dtd for other techniques docs

Then, we began going through the issues list.  WAC selected issues on the 
fly that were not related to conformance or specific checkpoints and that 
we had not discussed for a while. We got through quite a few of them with 
several people accepting action items.

Summary of resolutions and actions

- Action WAC and LGR discuss proposal for disclaimer for non-W3C techs. 
Also, process. Chase up Judy's idea about W3C member submission. Review 
section 8 of the Process document - Member Submission.

- Action MM, CS, WAC apply the techniques dtd to Core techniques, CSS and 
server-side.

- Action WAC clean up issues list.

- Action Editors: Propose wording for color contrast checkpoint (use 
existing 2.2 from WCAG 1.0) with some success criteria?

- Action LR: draft success criteria for contrast checkpoint.

- Action CS either find previously proposed checkpoint for switching 
between multiple renderings or propose one.

- Action ASW: map WCAG 2.0 against IBM guidelines.

- Resolved: we want to keep ourselves up to date with other guidelines, but 
not keep a mapping between WCAG and other guidelines up to date. We will 
keep mapping of WCAG 1.0 and WCAG 2.0 up to date

- Action WAC: find someone to help keep internal list of other guidelines 
so we can track other work in this area.

- Action WAC: while cleaning up issues list, issue #58 needs some digging. 
Why did we get rid of this? Where did it go? Under navigation mechanisms?

- Action LR find out more about testing for flicker rate.
