Hello,

I did some research in preparation for discussion at the face to face about 
the illustrating text checkpoint. In previous drafts it was checkpoint 3.4 
"Supplement text with non-text content."  In Gregg's latest proposal it is 
checkpoint 4.1.

I prepared 2 sets of notes and referred to a 3rd set written in May 
2001.  These  need more work but were used as part of Sunday afternoon's 
discussion at the F2F.
[Minutes of this discussion are at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/03/24-f2f-minutes.html#illustrations]

We had good discussion at the F2F and I need to incorporate that feedback 
into my notes.  However, I published the minutes from the F2F today and I 
would like to publish the notes for those who were not able to attend.  I 
will continue to work on my notes and I welcome any feedback.

1. Symbolic Languages instead of text-based language
quick summary:
what are the issues and how can we use technology to solve them?  Many of 
these ideas look to the future. Still unanswered is what to do 
today.  Gregg took an action at the F2F to draft a new checkpoint to 
address the issues brought up in the discussion.

2. Illustrating text
quick summary:
what are common uses of illustrations already in use on the web, what are 
some possible technological solutions, and what needs to be considered when 
creating illustrations?  This is more of an outline of the things to 
consider than of solutions.  It feels like a techniques document rather 
than success criteria for a checkpoint, but they are issues I thought would 
help us design success criteria.

3. Wendy's unillustrated notes, thoughts, and questions about the recent 
WCAG WG "Illustrating Guidelines" thread
quick summary:
In May 2001 I was trying to summarize an ongoing thread called 
"Illustrating Guidelines."  In it I try to get my head around the issues by 
summarizing the axes of discussion and the main points of discussion.  The 
axes of discussion are still relevant today.
