Hmm, thinking about this.

Yes, the "standard links" (the alpahbetical navigation) is really annoying.
One possibility would be the "skip navigation links" that 508 mandates, but
there has to be a better way of saying it for your audience in particular.

To "grey out inactive links" i think the best trick is to unlink them.

Can you explain what you mean by 'reading on action'?

cheers

  Can anyone point to good simple examples for navigation,which have been
  designed for 'machine readers'

  I am concerned that users with a 'reader' will find the 'standard' links
  repetitive.
  Using css, or tabindex these could be placed at the end of the document.
  Is there an inherent confusion between the auditory and visual channels
  with regard to navigation?
  (ie that visually we select the 'new'), and if so a recognised and
  succesful approach?
  many links are visually 'greyed out', as in a drop-down, or otherwise,
  how is this best achieved for the non-visual community.

  It does seem though that SLD users will prefer 'reading on action' as
  this will be less demanding.
  Is it common(or a standard) for readers to provide an on mouse-over read
  setting?

  The beta is here: http://www.peepo.com/main.html, this will change.
  click on music then top of the pops, or alternatively 'A'.
  We are testing a graphical breadcrumb trail.
  how do breadcrumbs work best in the context of a 'reader'

  thanks
