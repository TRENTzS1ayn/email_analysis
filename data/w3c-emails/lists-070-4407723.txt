Agreed and in the F2F I talked about annotating original works and using 
Web services to create alternative versions (copyright would be dealt with 
properly). It didn't make it back into my notes, but I believe it is 
captured in the minutes of Sunday afternoon.  For example, Recording for 
the Blind and Dyslexic make original works accessible by reading and 
recording them, other organizations translate books into Braille.  Perhaps 
someone will create a web service that produces illustrated versions of 
original works.  Or Cliff-Note like services that summarize.

However, the point I was trying to make in my notes, is that it would not 
be *required* to illustrate previously published works that were not 
illustrated by the original  author.
