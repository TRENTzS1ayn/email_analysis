Sorry to have to restate this again, anyway Yet Another Attempt for Al 
(Yaaagh) humph for those that have to be precise.

It seems self evident to me that if the user has selected say '200%' 
font size they have a good reason for doing so.
In which case why is it that the tooltips are still in standard size?

If this standard is not in the guidelines could it be?
apologies if this has already been done to death.
its been a long day.

thanks
