See http://www.mencap.org.uk for a working example, although one where the
user needs to click on a button to make a section speak. But applying this to
SVG animation or HTML event triggers should be reasonably straightforward
(although because HTML's event triggering system is messy in terms of
accessibility it won't be beautiful...) I will try to find time next week to
write a code example.

One of the issues here is whether this should be done by the author or the
browser - people who have talking browsers will have interference problems.
It seems to me a smarter solution in the general case for someone to be given
a browser like websound or homepage reader.

cheers
