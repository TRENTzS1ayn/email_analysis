I think "the inability to interpret and/or formulate language symbols", from
the list below, would cover dyslexia. (Although it might not be obvious to
someone with dyslexia, or  with an inability or disability with regards to
interpreting or formulating language symbols).

My only other idea about what it means is people who don't understand sign
language,because they grew up having to use spoken languages. But that seems
unlikely.

  put a straight edge of some kind down just to distinguish words and
  sentences. It's harder to explain exactly, but it makes it hard
  sometimes as I'm a web programmer.
