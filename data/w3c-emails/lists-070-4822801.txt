I'm working on compiling the list of Guidelines. In doing so, I kept finding
items that weren't really "guidelines" but more, techniques or informative
material. Wendy suggested breaking the list into 3 parts (these are
currently on one page at the present):
 
1. List of Guidelines for Accessibility of Web Content
2. List of Techniques for Web Accessibility Guidelines
3. List of Related Documents Found During Search
 
I'm attaching what I've done so far. Don't laugh at the measly list. You
would be amazed at how long it takes me to read over stuff to decide if it
fits and where! I wanted to get this out before the face to face meeting so
that any issues/suggestions/etc could be addressed there. I'm sorry I won't
be able to attend. Wendy, could you please capture any feedback and pass it
on to me? 
 
I'm also soliciting for any additions to this list. If you know of URL's to
add, could you please send them along with a short description, date
updated, publisher and indicate what section you think it belongs under. 
 
Thanks,
