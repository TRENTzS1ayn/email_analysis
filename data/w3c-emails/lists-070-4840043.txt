I'm not sure I follow.  Strobes are great for freezing (visually) and
measuring the period of something which is moving repetitively, but I
don't know how you use a strobe to measure a strobe.  I can sort of see
how you might, but don't see how it could be more effective or easier
than just using a light probe and looking at the events on an
oscilloscope (storage).   (or, for that matter, just capturing the
information using a computer as a storage oscilloscope.)

I don't recall anyone talking to me about using a strobe to measure
flash frequency.  But Trace is looking into the idea of a measurement
tool to address photosensitive epilepsy.   Have made progress and
contacts but don't yet have any determination of do-ability,
effectiveness, or timeline. 

More when I know more.
