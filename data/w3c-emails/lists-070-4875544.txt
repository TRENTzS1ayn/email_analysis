Hello,

I have added more detail to the agenda for next week.
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/07/f2f-agenda.html#Agenda

Several of the items are links to issues in the ETA system.  Most of these 
are work items and should not require too much discussion.  I hope we can 
get through as many of them as possible next week.

Jonathan Chetwynd, Jim Ley, and I met 25 June to discuss client-side 
scripting.  I have added a few issues to ETA from that discussion. I took 
an action to revise Jonathan's current draft.  Jim has sent me comments to 
incorporate. I hope to have a draft before the meeting next week.

Please also refer to the list of "Required Reading" included on the meeting 
page.  I don't expect you to read everything. Please focus on the documents 
that interest you.

Please come to the meeting prepared to have fun and do lots of work! :)

Best,
