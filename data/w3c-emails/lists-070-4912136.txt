Hi 

 

I checked it out.  It is from England.

 

I called the developers (several times actually) and discussed with
them.  It is really quite nice but quite expensive - and not really
designed for Web application.

 

 

The basic cost for a standard unit is $16000.00 CIF, duty and taxes not
paid.

 

It appears to be intended for use in broadcast or video industry.

 

The standard unit consists of: 

 

-a desk-top PC fitted with a data capture card and a firewire control
card, 15" LCD monitor and connecting cables.

 

-a printer and cables.

 

-a JVC D-VHS VCR and cables.

 

-The analysis Software.

 

The VCR model they are using is undergoing a model change and they would
need to check if either version is available in US NTSC version.

All tapes (or video signals) should include a section of colour bar or
pluge to enable calibration.

 

 

Am now talking with them about collaborating on the development of a web
version -- hopefully that could be available for use free.   Will let
you know.
