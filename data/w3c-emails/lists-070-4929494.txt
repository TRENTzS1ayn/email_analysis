The intention of the following* seems to be contrary to our generally 
agreement that alternatives should be available, and to leave the choice 
with the user.



Handheld

handheld devices which typically have small screens and limited bandwidth.

CSS: @media handheld { IMG { display:none } }*

The above example will not display images on handheld devices. If the 
style sheet is evaluated in a proxy server, this can save much bandwidth.


*This was taken from CSS Designing for the Web by Hakon Lie and Bert 
Bos, pg 261, 2nd edition
