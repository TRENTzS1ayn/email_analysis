Using wordnet with ILS could work, (as in your document) but, yes
referencing is a problem. I do not like using a cgi as a reference page. The
resulting html is quite nice in terms of being well formed but is no in a
dictionary format (all nouns are together, instead of being individually
labeled a nouns)

The must have a database, and it may well be in xhtml.
maybe we could contact them about working together on this?
otherwise we could use Project Gutenberg dictionary, and reformat it to  XML

Subject: Detailed agenda for F2F meeting, updates to ETA



Hello,

I have added more detail to the agenda for next week.
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/07/f2f-agenda.html#Agenda

Several of the items are links to issues in the ETA system.  Most of these
are work items and should not require too much discussion.  I hope we can
get through as many of them as possible next week.

Jonathan Chetwynd, Jim Ley, and I met 25 June to discuss client-side
scripting.  I have added a few issues to ETA from that discussion. I took
an action to revise Jonathan's current draft.  Jim has sent me comments to
incorporate. I hope to have a draft before the meeting next week.

Please also refer to the list of "Required Reading" included on the meeting
page.  I don't expect you to read everything. Please focus on the documents
that interest you.

Please come to the meeting prepared to have fun and do lots of work! :)

Best,
