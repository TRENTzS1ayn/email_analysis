Hello,

2 changes to next week's F2F agenda:

1. A continental breakfast will *not* be provided from 8:30-9:00 each 
morning.  It seems most of the hotels include a continental breakfast.  If 
your hotel does not, you can grab breakfast at one of the University of 
Linz eateries.

2. When you arrive for the meeting, approach the ICCHP registration desk 
for directions to the meeting room.
