It seems to me that the note to "additional ideas" in this draft is in
error, and in any case does not reflect the consensus of the group. I would
prefer that it was removed, and this section was marked "under construction".
The fact that this is under discussion is reflected by the reviewer's note,
and the additional note simply claims that it is not possible to have success
criteria (which would mean that there is no point in further discussion of
them).
