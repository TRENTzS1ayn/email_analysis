BBC radio 4 has an amazing service where you type in a keyword and a date, and it finds the (current if wanted) news item and you can listen to it...

Perhaps you all know of this service, I was stunned, thought the actual news item* I had heard, and then found to send, was unfortunately linked to a different item in this instance.

Amazing.
