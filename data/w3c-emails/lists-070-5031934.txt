Hi Charles,

Actually,  that note has been there for a long time - unchanged.  But
since the whole 4.1 is being posted as an open question, it probably
makes sense to pull that as text and perhaps change it into a readers
note that is less definite.  That way we may get more input on the
topic.   

It is so late in the game I don't know if we can still do this but how
about we change it to a reviewer's note that says 


Reviewer's Note: This checkpoint is very difficult and the group is
wrestling with several problems.     1) It is very difficult to
determine what makes writing clear and simple for all topics.   2) Some
content is derived from other sources and is copyrighted so it cannot be
altered.   3) Some materials or topics cannot be communicated accurately
in simple language. 4) sometimes the form is specific to the intent,
(poetry,  exposition )  5) Since some people cannot understand the
content no matter how simply it is written, it is not possible to make
any content accessible to everyone.    It is difficult to find specific
objective criteria that could be applied across all types of content.
Any input on ways to address these issues is solicited. 


IF NO ONE HAS AN OBJECTION TO CHANGING THE TEXT TO A READERS NOTE FOR
THE TR RELEASE -- PLEASE POST A MEMO IMMEDIATELY.  

Otherwise I will try to push this through.   It will leave the questions
sound less final,  and might solicit more input to this very tough area.

Thanks.


Gregg
