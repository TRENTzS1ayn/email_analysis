Chaals,

you've stated a personal reason, fair enough.

Do you recognise that this is causing problems?

My problem is that, I wish to offer a virtual keyboard,
now Hakon Lie has suggested that CSS3 might offer something that scales text
to the client window size, which is great, for us.
However, for the present, I'm having to use a fixed font, because if the
user has control, and it is set to very large, then the keyboard isn't all
viewable.
and my users would not know there was more outside the window, or how to set
the font size smaller.
because this is a college it is impractical to set these things.

jonathan
