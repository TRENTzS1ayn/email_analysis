On the one hand, I agree that many developers have trouble with the
implementation of standards because browsers just don't seem to agree on
what to do and how to do it.  It's probably the only business where no one
steals good ideas from each other.  How difficult is it to just support
style sheets the same way?

On the other hand, many of these standards are tough because developers are
used to just one way of doing things, and just one audience to do it for.  I
only recently even started using style sheets, because I just found it
easier to hard code my font sizes into each page, so I'd know exactly what
the layout would look like on every browser imaginable, and not have to
worry about which ones handled style sheets.  It may not be easy design to
take so many variables into account when you create a site, but it's good
design.  It sometimes takes longer than bosses may want, but if you end up
with a site that looks good and works well for everyone - even if it doesn't
look exactly the same for everyone - then you have a superior product.

But to say that a site absolutely will not meet standards if it doesn't use
relative font-sizes is a big deal. As a developer I am told that I must make
the site look right, work, meet standards AND do so in NN 4.x and above and
IE 4.x and above. Netscape 4.x doesn't just not support relative font sizes
- it destroys them. So what is the lowly developer to do? I think one of the
reasons that developers don't follow accessibility standards is because they
can be so difficult to implement. Granted the newer browsers are going to
make that easier but most developers aren't given the option of coding for
their favorite browser.

No, it is saying that people who use Netscape 4.x browsers shouldn't expect
it to handle HTML and CSS very well under certain circumstances. I don't
have any problem with people using Netscape 4.x (or any other browser) if
they happen to like it and it suits their needs, but I have a big problem
with people turning up with broken systems and expecting that the Web be
broken to match. As well as with sites that do break the Web to match such
systems. They tend to be simple problems - I think the most common is "I
can't make a payment here so I will go find another provider". I don't
expect peoploe to resolve the problems caused by bugs in my browser (the one
that annoys me most is missing some CSS-positioning, although it isn't more
than cosmetic until people try to use presentation to convey critical
structure information).

I have a strong reason for preferring relative font-sizes - they are what I
need to be able to keep reading for the day. In fact some of my browsers do
pretty good zooming. The ones that require proper coding...
