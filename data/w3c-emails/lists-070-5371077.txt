I accept the idea that it might now be doubtful, and the implied slap on the
wrists for using a shaky and unresearched statistic is deserved.

I don't think it is irrelevant, since the point I was making is that the
growth is pretty fast, particularly in mobile services, and that leveraging
web access with that growth seems a likely proposition for making growth in
Web access faster still. I suggest that the reference Joe gives supports my
assertion of fast growth. Further, the imediate conclusion I draw, that
mobile web growth is likely to outstrip desktops, seems a fair extrapolation
of the article's point.

My final conclusion, that we had better be thinking reasonably soon about
making sure we are getting it right for mobile systems that are shared as
well as Desktops at home, doesn't change in the light of that.

(Of course, that doesn't immediately answer the question of whether we can
get people to upgrade browsers faster or slower than before...)
