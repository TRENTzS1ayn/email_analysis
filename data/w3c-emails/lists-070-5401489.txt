I was asked to write up the success criteria from Avi Bentz and me for 4.2

here they are:

- use markup to support the conversion of test into non text
-supply an illustration for each instruction
- create a non text equivalent for all textual content.

We are intending to continue working on these by email.
 let the debate begin......


All the best,
