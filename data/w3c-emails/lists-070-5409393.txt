Are these two equivalent? (well the second contains the first.)

Do you have a definition of what an "instuction" is?

How many "non-text equivalents" should you include for each text-content?
ie is including just audio sufficient, if so why? if not how many
equivalents do we provide?

Is there a summary of discussion at the f2f to avoid us having to go over
well discussed topics?
