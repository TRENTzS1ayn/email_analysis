suggestion to change the wording of checkpoint 4.1 to:
"write in  plain language"

suggestion for 4.1 success criteria:
minimize complex syntax -
reduce the usage of "and",  "if" and other augment words (use bulleted list
or more sentences)
reduce the usage negatives (one negative term per sentence)

conform to a plain language specification that is relevant for your content.

All the best,

Lisa Seeman
