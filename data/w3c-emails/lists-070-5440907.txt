Hi Lisa,

I just don't see how this is possible.   Could you show me what you mean
by posting all your comments to this list with picture equivalents for
all the text and illustrations for all instructions.  

This either sounds impossible or I don't understand what you are
suggesting.  In either case -- it would be solved if you would just
follow your suggestions for all postings to this list.

Thanks much.
