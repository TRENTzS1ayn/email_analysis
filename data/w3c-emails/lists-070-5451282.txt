My memory concurs with Gregg's: the issue was whether tools had been
created or could feasibly be created, with reasonable time and effort,
to solve the problem, and could then be available at no (or low) cost.
Given the tools, the problem would no longer reside with the content
developer.

The proposal was: let's not make this a priority 1 item for the author
unless it is shown to be necessary (i.e., a technological solution
isn't feasible).
