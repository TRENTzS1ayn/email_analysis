I had a go at the jigsaw puzzle (it was mine, I should've tried my best
to make it accessible.)

>tab stops on all pieces

Adobe SVG, does not get the tab key, so you cannot capture it, I've used
the character 'A' on the keyboard as a substitute.

>move pieces w/arrow keys

I don't believe you can capture the arrow keys either, I've used i,k,m,j
for up,right,down, left respectively (hopefully convenient for qwerty
keyboard users.)

>an interesting exercise: describing the pieces in such a way that there
is hints about where it goes or

I've had a go at this, but didn't do the "inny nib" and "outty nib" one.
The desc is also displayed as you "tab" (with the a key) through the
pieces.

>use the RDF image annotation stuff to do this??

I could to add this, in both my own, and Ivan Hermann's et. al.
vocabularies, but haven't yet.

This is a lot of work, the game currently doesn't have any idea if the
pieces are in correct places, there's also no way in SVG to make a sound.

The new version:

I also need to add some instructions on how to play etc. but I've not got
time at the moment.

I personally think SVG is far from being a rich enough format to really
be accessible, especially as currently implemented in the Adobe SVG
Viewer.

Cheers,

Jim.
