With the author's permission, I'm passing along some feedback that I
received this afternoon regarding the ideas compilation for checkpoint
4.1.

Someone on your list sent this along to me. Since a lot of this material
relates to clarity,I want to urge you to u   USE ACTIVE VERBS as much as
possible throughout.  Passive verbs are a major source of confusion in
writing.  You shuld start each item with a strong action verb.

 

For example:

 

Instead of  

*content under site control is written as clearly and simply as
the author feels [appropriate / possible] for the purpose of the
content.

 

 

write

 

write content under site control as clearly and simply as possible (all
the rest about the author is excess - "as possible" covers it)

 

and instead of

 

  

*  summaries and/or simpler forms are provided for key pages or sections
of the site.

write

 

provide summaries or simpler form for key pages or sections of the site
(don't use slashes, they are often confusing).

 

You do have some statements written this way, as in 

 

  

*  Break up long sentences into shorter ones. [1]
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/07/checkpoint-4-1-ideas.html#ref1>  

*  Provide accurate unique page titles.
