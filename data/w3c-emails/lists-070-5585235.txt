Jonathan, screen readers don't *create* text equivalents: they only report
those that a human author composes.

In another message, you contended that it would be possible to create visual
equivalents for nearly "all messages."  I'm not clear what "message" means
in this context.  I'm also not clear about the granularity-- the level of
detail at which you'd like the requirement for visual equivalents to apply.


Thanks!
John

Undoubtedly some of the creation of non-text equivalents might be created by
user agents, much as screen-readers currently do.

In the meantime, there are very good reasons for asking authors to provide
resources they may have available.
