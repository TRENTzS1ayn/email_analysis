Gregg

"It may well be possible to have some portion of the pages illustrated." is
a significant step, and needs to be incorporated in the guidelines, somehow.

Can you please point to where it indicates that: "the guidelines at level 1
are to apply to all pages"?
I've glance through a number of charters and not spotted this.

Can the next charter make it explicit that not all content is expected to be
accessible to all people, including those with severe learning difficulties,
but that we are obliged to make a best effort?

Where did it say this discussion was a level 1 priority?
It certainly is not clear that this is de facto, surely some guidelines
bubble up rather than appear from the top?

thanks again

Jonathan
