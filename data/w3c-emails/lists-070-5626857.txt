There can be very little difference between illustrating a given piece of
text, and describing the frames in a film.
Both are possible, it just so happens that we consider the one easier than
the other.

One does not describe every detail in every frame, but uses judgement,
discretion, discernment, and more.
Radio commentators at a sports event have a similar task.

In the sense that we insist that all images have text equivalents, it is
possible to say that all pages should be illustrated, just unrealistic.
It seems more realistic to require some pages, to be illustrated (say 10%
for large corporations and governments)
The reality is however that skills for either are in very short supply
presently, and the results of either endeavour are very likely to be of
mixed quality, as are the benefits..
