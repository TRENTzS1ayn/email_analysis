I didn't mean to take it off list, Jonathan-- I just hit Reply by accident,
instead of Reply-All.  Sorry about that!

not sure why you took this off the list.
unfortunately I assumed you were refering to the granularity of the
description, rather than the presence of one :-)

which turns out to mean much the same when one comes to your next points. I
dont believe that for instance every frame in a movie is required to be
described in full.... not sure that I can help more than this off list
