Excuse me Wendy,

Please can you advise me who attended the f2f, and who is in the 'rest of
the working group'?
Who are the other contributors, other than Jim, and yourself?

Did you ask, to take over editing of the document
http://www.learningdifficulty.org/develop/script-techs.html?
The current draft remains very similar to the original, and your edit, left
topics very hard for users to find.
If you expect to take over editing of this document, please either write a
completely new document, without reference to mine, or demonstrate to my
satisfaction that your document is an improvement.
You can publish a document in W3C space, but it had better not be based on
my work, if you intend to steal it.

I remain well aware of the work that has to be done.
thank you

jonathan chetwynd
