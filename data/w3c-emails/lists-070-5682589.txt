I feel that it is reasonable, in making all sites accessible to all people
with disabilities, to illustrate them. If you want to discuss the finer
points of Greek theology with somebody who has a learning disability, or
suffers from dyslexia, it is helpful to illustrate the major information
points - events, characters etc. One only needs to open an organic chemistry
textbook to see this applied in practice (actually i am not sure what gets
included in braille textbooks. I know that there are images in some of them).

In fact I have great difficulty trying to think of content that could not be
made accessible to more people by being illustrated.

(As a side note: when I sayillustration, I am actually thinking of providing
multimedia. This could be sound - especially useful for may people in the
case of music, video - a good tool for explaining many concepts, or images.
If you read what I say as just meaning images it still should make sense, but
I would prefer to address the wider range of content.

I am aware that sound on its own, or images on their own, are no more useful
to universal accessibility than text on its own. We need to provide
information that meets the very different needs of a range of people, and
this group are in the business of describing how to do that. )

It may turn out that it is not feasible for most organisations to make their
sites accessible to this level, in which case we should either expect that
few people will conform to level one, or move the hard bits to a different
level and then be clear that level one doesn't provide even basic access to
certain groups of people.

Although our charter obliges us to work on access for all people regardless
of disability I don't think it makes specific statements requiring or
prohibiting differentiation of groups served by different checkpoints - and
our requirements suggest that we will provide that information.

Cheers

Charles
