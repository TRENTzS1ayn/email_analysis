Actually the user and the author on the Web are often not in a position to
negotiate - if the authors haven't ensured a particular piece of information
is included, there is not much the user can do about it.

I think this group does have to go further than just giving a general idea.
It is not easy to do so, but I do believe it is possible, and useful when
people who are not experts try to put our ideas into practice.

Cheers
