Hi everyone,

 

I have a feeling that our discussions are getting unfocused enough again
that it is not clear what is being proposed or sometimes even argued
for.  

 

As a result I am going to reissue a request that the chairs put to the
list a couple times in the past.

 

Please try to stay away from posts that are philosophical or general in
nature.    By this I mean anything which is not a concrete suggestion
(with suggested wording) for a change to the guidelines, or a concisely
worded issue to post to the issues list.    You can follow these with a
long discussion but we are having lots of discussions that don't seem to
be centered on a concrete proposal.  As a result 

 

a)      the discussions don't seem to come to closure with anything we
can use very often.

b)      We have a lot of animated discussions where it looks like people
are talking about different things.  Sometimes even in successive
emails.   It makes for angst that I hear about, and sometimes there
wouldn't be any disagreement if everyone were talking about the same
thing. 

 

Also, if we have a consensus decision in place, I don't think the group
should entertain proposals that conflict with the decisions unless and
until the decision has been reversed (which it always can be).  So
please don't post suggestions that contradict the principles that we
have established.   If you think that they principles are wrong, then
let's talk about them.  If you don't, then don't waste your time and web
space with proposals that are in conflict.  They won't get far and you
and everyone will just become frustrated.   

 

 

So please include in each posting either 

 

1)      a short statement with an issue for the issue log

or

2)      a proposed rewording of something in the guidelines.   

 

You can then elaborate in the rest of the email.   Issues that are not
in this form may not make it onto the issues log or into consideration
at the working group meetings.  It is just too hard for the chairs to
accurately capture the essence of long postings.

 

Now it IS fair game to comment on someone else's proposal.   But if you
do please 

 

a)      include a copy of the proposal or issue you are commenting on at
the front of your post

and 

b)      if at all possible, post an alternate suggestion that takes your
concern or comments into account and proposes an alternative 

 

Remember, that unless there is an alternative or an issue that the
working group can address - you comments and thoughts get put into "deep
background" at best--- and "deep sixed"  (buried six feet under) at
worst.  

 

Thanks

 

Gregg

 

PS On a side note, I will be teaching a non-stop 4 day industry course
all this week so I will be disappearing until Friday unless I am so
zombied that I come to the GL list for relaxation (or escape).   (that's
scarey)  (but I love you all).
