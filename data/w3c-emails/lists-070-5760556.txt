One way to approach this for retrofitting is to find a way of making it
happen on a proxy. This is very low cost if pages are generated and then
stored (or cached by the server) although  there is a potential performance
hit that would mean a new design should build in the functionality.

The paper presented by Max Froumentin and Vincent Hardy shows how to use XSLT
to turn some XML data into an SVG histogram:

for the following data format:

<data>
<datum>23</datum>
<datum>94</datum>
<datum>55</datum>
</data>

which is simplistic but not terribly so, and an easy pattern to generate from
almost any content management system, the following XSLT

<xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
version="1.0">
<xsl:template match="/">
<svg xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 {10*(count(data/datum)+1)} 100">
<xsl:for-each select="data/datum">
<rect x="{10*position()}" y="{100- .}" width="10" height="{.}" fill="red" stroke="black"/>
</xsl:for-each>
</svg>
</xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>

will produce a set of columns in an image the right size to contain them.
The image produced for the sample above is at
http://www.svgopen.org/papers/2002/froumentin_hardy__xslt/data.svg for the
curious. The sizing here is based on linear scales, - logarithmic scales
involve a little more work. And adding labelling of the table to make it more
directly accessible is also a couple of lines of extra work.

This is explained in the paper -
http://www.svgopen.org/papers/2002/froumentin_hardy__xslt/index.html#id2590086
and if you get fascinated there is an explanation of how to do the same for a
textual representation of a chess game (the sort of thing you find in
Newspapers near the sports and comics section) to have a nice animated view
of the game being played.

This can all be done by passing the page through a proxy after it has been
generated, as a last resort that isn't really horrendously hard. Or it can be
built in to the design to make it much easier.
