Eastern Australia, etc.) on +1-617-761-6200, passcode 9224.

Agenda

1. Minutes from last week's face to face meeting: any comments or
   questions. Potential issues include checklist generation and
   client-side script techniques (for example, whether these should
   comprise a separate document or be integrated into other
   techniques documents, such as (X)HTML and SVG).

2. Review process for the public draft: from whom in particular should
   we be seeking comments?

3. Open issues (the issues list still needs work):
