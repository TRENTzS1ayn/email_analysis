Part of the working group's consensus on checkpoint 5.2 was that
success criteria would be drafted at level 2, specifying a stronger
backward compatibility requirement. Here is my first attempt,
reflecting ideas that have been raised previously on the mailing list
and at teleconferences.

You will have successfully met checkpoint 5.2 at level 2 if
1. The technologies and features below the baseline have
been independently implemented in at least two user agents.

2. At least two such implementations have been available to the public
   for a period of three years or more, and have been localized to
   support the primary natural language of the content.

Have I omitted anything important?
