Hello,

Jenae and I went through the Core Techniques for WCAG 1.0 [1] today.  Our notes are at [2].  

It seems that most of the information in the Core Techniques has moved into the Guidelines/Checkpoints/Success Criteria document and the rest of the info should be expanded upon in either the Gateway Techniques (similar to the existing "Techniques for WCAG 1.0" [3]) or in each technology-specific techniques document.

Best,
Jenae and Wendy
