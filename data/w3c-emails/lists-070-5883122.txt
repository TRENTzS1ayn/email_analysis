The problem is probably not with the screen readers, but with the
speech synthesis software they are using. If they are all relying on
the same speech synthesis engine, one can expect that they will all be
prone to the same shortcomings in respect of pronunciation accuracy.

The question, under those circumstances, is whether alternatives are
available or a suitable tool could readily be constructed to resolve
the problem, as discussed in the working group meeting last month.
