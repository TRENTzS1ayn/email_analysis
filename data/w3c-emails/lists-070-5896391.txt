I'm the company leader of Bazzmann Labs, an advanced service agency
dealing with accessibility, usability,  w3c standards' development and
webdesign.

I deeply believe in accessibility as the basic rule to work on the web,
in fact I started an italian online resource (Bazzmann.Com) two years
ago about accessibility, usability,  w3c standards' development and
webdesign.

Bazzmann.Com hosts 3 important mailing list:

- Humana (accessibility and usability)
- w3c-hack (around deeply comprehension of web standards)
- webdesign

It hosts also the unofficial project of Usability.gov in italian,
at the permament address: http://www.bazzmann.com/usability_it

I've produced the interface, CSS and XHTML code of
www.regione.veneto.it, the first italian government web site that
reached the level AAA of WCAG 1.0.

I'm the co-founder with IWA/HWG Italy (Roberto Scano) of
webaccessibile.org, to grant info about W3C guidelines, support to
the web professionals, training of our members.

I'm also co-founder of http://www.dev2dev.it, the first italian
internet network of developers.

Last but not least, I'm already subscribed to the following ML:

w3c-wai-gl@w3.org
w3c-wai-ua@w3.org

Thanks in advance,
Marco Trevisan
