While some people may have access to various OS platforms I'm sure your
speaking more to the fact that we should consider Microsoft versions as
Microsoft and Mac version as Mac.  The small developer would be excluded
from this due to cost factors.  I think if we throw the OS into the picture
it should be at Level 3 versus Level 2 because of that specific issue.

There are more independent developers than there are those that work for
corporations and governments.  The only large government organization I've
ever worked for was the US Navy.  While there I was able to afford the
various testing platforms.  Now, I do good to have one computer.  The
various browsers I can handle, but not the various OS.

Thanks,
Lee

"2. Technologies and features below the baseline must be supported by
   at least one prior version of two or more user agents which, in
   their latest versions, provide such support."

i think that this could be implemented as:

"2. Tecnoligies and features below the baseline must be supported by at
lease one prior version of two or more user agents in two or more O.S.
platform which, in their latest versiones, provide such support."

This is due for the cross-browsing support to the tecnologies.
