Hello,

I spoke with Ian yesterday about UAAG Conformance.  A user agent makes a conformance claim based on a "profile" as described at [1].  We discussed the possibility that UAAG profiles could be used in checkpoint 5.2 to describe the baseline and in 5.4 to describe what is required of a web application/embedded interface.  

Thoughts?
