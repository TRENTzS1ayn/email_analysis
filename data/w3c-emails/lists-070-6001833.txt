To: Web Content Guidelines<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>


Various level 2 success criteria in WCAG 2.0 are of the following form
(the wording is inconsistent, but that's an editorial matter):

"A statement is published on the site asserting that the content has
been reviewed and is believed to be ..."

I propose that the language be modified in two ways: (1) to clarify
that a conformance claim, whether in text or metadata, counts as
satisfying the "statement is published" clause in the above
requirement; and (2) to make explicit reference, where they exist, to
the "additional ideas for enhancement" included as part of the
checkpoint, which should, naturally, be taken into account in any
qualitative review.

To implement this proposal, the relevant success criteria could be
rewritten as follows:

1. "The content has been reviewed, taking into account the additional
   items for enhancement listed below, and is believed to be ..."

2. "A conformance claim associated with the content asserts
   conformance to this checkpoint at level 2 or above".

In the introductory section of the guidelines, add a paragraph
explaining the rationale behind "review requirements" in the success
criteria, and indicating that it is suggested, but not required,
that in carrying out such reviews, testing be conducted with actual
users.
