This is very common practice in pages with forms. I've fought it in the past
as an accessibility issue - but usually clients overrule the decision. WCAG
1 did address it in the don't change focus, page, etc without notifying the
user - right off hand I can't think of where it is addressed in WCAG 2.

I came across something new as I was Jaws browsing along, and that is the
auto focused of the page had been set to a text box mid way down the page
(you can see it at

<http://www.Amazon.com/exec/obidos/subst/home/home.html/002-5628707-8901611>
)
 
this made the screen reader start from the text box and miss the info above
it. 
It stumped me how they had managed to do this, but then I found in their
code
onLoad="document.searchform.elements[1].focus()"
That did it.
 
Did I miss this in WCAG ?  it seems an accessibility issue.
It also may be an issue for the DOM object model - allowing a script to move
and control the focus and bounce you around the page without your knowledge.
All the best,
