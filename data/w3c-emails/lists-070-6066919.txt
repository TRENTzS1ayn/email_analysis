Thanks,
"don't change focus" needs to include "don't set the focus" - in other words
to set it on loading is also an issue

  This is very common practice in pages with forms. I've fought it in the
past as an accessibility issue - but usually clients overrule the decision.
WCAG 1 did address it in the don't change focus, page, etc without notifying
the user - right off hand I can't think of where it is addressed in WCAG 2.

    I came across something new as I was Jaws browsing along, and that is
the auto focused of the page had been set to a text box mid way down the
page (you can see it at
http://www.Amazon.com/exec/obidos/subst/home/home.html/002-5628707-8901611)

    this made the screen reader start from the text box and miss the info
above it.
    It stumped me how they had managed to do this, but then I found in their
code
    onLoad="document.searchform.elements[1].focus()"
    That did it.

    Did I miss this in WCAG ?  it seems an accessibility issue.
    It also may be an issue for the DOM object model - allowing a script to
move and control the focus and bounce you around the page without your
knowledge.
