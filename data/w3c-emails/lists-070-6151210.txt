Regrets for this week, and possibly for next week as well.  On the road
again...

Subject: Agenda



Thursday, 8 August, 2000 UTC (4 PM US Eastern, 10 PM France, 6 AM Eastern
Australia) on +1-617-761-6200 passcode 9224.

Agenda

1. Principles for allocating success criteria among the three
   conformance levels:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002JulSep/0122.html

See also the proposed consensus items at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002JulSep/0123.html
(these aren't expected to be controversial as they reflect choices already
taken by the group).

2. Level 2 assurance requirements:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002JulSep/0114.html

3. Checklist generation (combining guidelines with technology-specific
   material from techniques documents). What should be included in
   checklists and how should they be created?

4. Checkpoint 5.3 (issue raised last week). How can the success
   criteria be defined more precisely? Is there an overlap with
   checkpoint 5.2 (see checkpoint 5.3, success criterion 3)?

5. Checkpoints 1.3 and 3.1: the principles are distinct, but there
   appears to be an overlap in the success criteria themselves which
   should be corrected. Also, surely a "linear reading order" should
   be at levels 1 or 2?

Any items in this list not considered at the meeting will be placed on next
week's agenda.
