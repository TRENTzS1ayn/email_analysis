> 1. Principles for allocating success criteria among the three
>    conformance levels:
> http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002JulSep/0122.html
> 
> See also the proposed consensus items at
> http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002JulSep/0123.html
> (these aren't expected to be controversial as they reflect 
> choices already
> taken by the group).
> 
> 2. Level 2 assurance requirements:
> http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002JulSep/0114.html
> 
> 3. Checklist generation (combining guidelines with technology-specific
>    material from techniques documents). What should be included in
>    checklists and how should they be created?
> 
> 4. Checkpoint 5.3 (issue raised last week). How can the success
>    criteria be defined more precisely? Is there an overlap with
>    checkpoint 5.2 (see checkpoint 5.3, success criterion 3)?
> 
> 5. Checkpoints 1.3 and 3.1: the principles are distinct, but there
>    appears to be an overlap in the success criteria themselves which
>    should be corrected. Also, surely a "linear reading order" should
>    be at levels 1 or 2?
> 
> Any items in this list not considered at the meeting will be 
> placed on next
> week's agenda.
