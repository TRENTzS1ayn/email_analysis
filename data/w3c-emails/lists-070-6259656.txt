Hello,

I have been converting the CSS Techniques [1] from XHTML to the techinques DTD.  In doing so, I have made some tweaks to the DTD [2].  Some of the tweaks have been discussed but not added to the dtd, the rest are changes that made sense w/the work I've been doing. The DTD was last published in April [3]).

One issue: 
we currently allow more than one "rule" element per technique, I think we ought to limit this to one.  As I mark up the CSS techs, this is what I'm doing and it seems much cleaner.

Here's the list of changes. 
- added some documentation to the dtd.
- added wcag-tech element as the root element
- added "front-matter" and "doc-intro" elements as children of "wcag-tech."  (described in dtd documentation)
- added "name" attribute to category
- moved rule element as a child of "technique" rather than "description"
- added "test" element as child of "technique"
- added attribute "success-criteria" to "applies-to" element.
- added a list of attribute values to the "group" attribute on the "affects" element.  The list is taken from the Requirements from WCAG 2.0 document [4]

I expect we'll need to make a few more tweaks as we develop the transformations to generate the variety of documents we've discussed.

Please let me know if you have any comments or concerns about the changes that I have made.

Thanks,
--wendy
