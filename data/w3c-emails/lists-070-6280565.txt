The Ken Nakata presentation

  http://workshops.fedstats.gov/Nakata_Fedstats.ppt

and the Steve Ferg read-ahead whitepaper

  http://home.att.net/~stephen_ferg/section508/accessible_tables.html

are important resources.

For completeness, the meeting is at

  Fedstats 508 workshop - Agenda and Presentations
  http://workshops.fedstats.gov/agenda.htm

and what I presented (not linked from their page yet) is at

PS: copying Ian because it was at this meeting in Ken's report that I
heard of a command in Jaws that would scavenge the headers linked by
the 'headers' attribute associated with a queried cell in a table.  Not
a mode in which the headers got read automatically, but where you could
query the cell and the associated headers would be spoken.  Affects
implementation report for table navigation.
