I thought it was nice for Marco to send a personalized introduction to the list.  We have had several new people join recently.  Feel free to introduce yourselves.

I offer "WCAG WG tours" to new participants.  If you haven't had one yet, please contact me about scheduling one.  I cover:
- an overview of the WCAG WG
- update on WCAG 2.0
- review of the "Requirements for WCAG 2.0"
- overview of the WAI and how the WCAG WG relates to the other WAI WG
- overview of the W3C (WAI is only one of 5 domains)
- overview of key pieces of the W3C process

I also try to answer questions that you might have about any of these topics.

This offer is open to anyone on the list who would like to know more about these topics.  Please keep in mind that I will be on vacation this Thursday and Friday (15 and 16 August), as well as 23 August through 2 September, so we will need to schedule around that.

If possible, it would be helpful to conduct the tours in groups of 2 or 3 rather than individually so that we can get through more people in less time.

Best,
