Hi Wendy and friends,
as requested i start to present myself.

I'm Roberto Scano - 27 years old - and i'm an asp developer. Also i'm the
EMEA (Europe-Middle/East-Africa) Coordinator of IWA/HWG (www.iwanet.org -
www.hwg.org). I've started to follow accessibility since August 2001 because
our association has merged with HWG that as you know was specialized in
promotion of web standards and raccomandations (Kynn Barlett is our
"teacher" :-D).

Now IWA/HWG is working around the world for develop the conoscence for
members and no-members to use the raccomandation of W3C as an official guide
in developing products and contents for the www. This also is due to the
eEurope raccomandation of EU that raccomend for the public administration
the respect of level 1 of WCAG for all the public administration web sites.

We have supported in Italy a conference in May 2002 (www.webxtutti.it) and
we will partecipate with also W3C Europe to the 2nd Webmaster Forum in Dubai
(
http://www.iwa-italy.org/comunicati/me_webmaster.pdf) . As EMEA, i must
coordinate the activity of these chapters and grant support with the
official guidelines of IWA International: for eg., for all the new chapter
agreement we request that the creation of the country web site must respect
the W3C guidelines for XHTML and the WCAG at least for level A.

We are also following an accessibility project that will start in september
in italian language and then with an international version made by IWA/HWG:
www.webaccessibile.org that is a project to promote the accessibility
guidelines and the knowledge and example about its application to the
web-workers that aren't able to study and apply himself to the WCAG of W3C.

Personally and with Marco we have developed a local government website:
www.regione.veneto.it that is fully managed by the local government and
organized with a CMS that i've created using as support ewebeditpro of
Ektron (www.ektron.com) with customization that "force" the respect of the
WCAG 1.0 and the validation of the code for XHTML 1.0.

This CMS will also "power" webaccessibile.org and other web sites that will
be opened and upgraded for accessibility.

That's all folks! :-)
