Hi all, this is a status report.
I have been asking my more linguistically inclined academic friends to help
out on this one. So far we have not gotten very far. Lot of discussing the
problem, but that's about it.

Apparently however Arabic is a bigger problem then Hebrew, with a single
word could be deciphered into 15 different words, depending on the missing
vowels.
The best methodology that I have come across was to "read a lot until you
get used to it". Peaple have promised to ask around in their respective
departments, so I am homing for a bit of an advance on that.
But I do suggest that we need to ensure that this problem is solvable for
Arabic as well as Hebrew. As my knowledge of Arabic is limited to writing my
name, we need a different volunteer for that one.
I am also putting together some test sights, to see how respective solutions
work. (with thanks to Jael Kurtz)

Our first find is at http://www.letlive.org.il/letlive/index.asp
It is a cute example
called u?a iceau iceau <BR>(transliterated:"Ten lichayot lichyot) or "give
life to animals" (it is an animals right charity)
The word "to animal" and "life"
has the same word spelled the same
way twice, each one is pronounced differently, due to vowels - they have the
vowels in as a picture in the heading, but miss it out of the text.


All the best,

Lisa Seeman
