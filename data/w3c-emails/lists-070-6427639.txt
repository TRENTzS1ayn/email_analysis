More interestly perhapes is some resurch being done at the Technion. The
Technoin in Haifa is an engineering biased university that I would recommend
as world class.

They have been working on this issue, and I am sending a URL for an English
abstract of the work.

http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~erelsgl/bxi/hmntx/teud.html#English

The impression I get is, well, mixed

There is some progress, in at least it is being addressed, but as quoted
from the abstract

"Due to the rich morphology of the Hebrew language and the inadequacy of the
undotted script which results in a great degree of morphological ambiguity,
the problem has not yet found a satisfactory solution. "

However they then claimed to have achieved 96% success, except that they
were using a dictionary of only 5000 words - so each spelling could not have
had many options.

I have contacted the researcher, and hope to have more information soon.

All the best,

Lisa Seeman
