Hi Wendy and friends,
I  present myself, as requested.

I'm Maurizio Vittoria, since 1998 webmaster of the National Marciana 
Library, in Venice, Italy (http://marciana.venezia.sbn.it/). I always have 
been sensitive to the problematic of accessibility and the usabilit? of the 
Web, and therefore I am a supporter of the W3C and its standars.

In truth I am a librarian who, dusting my studies of electronics and 
computer science, me slowly "transformed" in webmaster, and work also from 
"interface" between the librarians and the web.

I am IWA-HWG member, where I am are "WebGuru Bibliography";  I often 
teach  on the courses on searches and cataloguing on the Net, Internet and 
webwriting and standards, in which I consider the WCAG and accessibility 
like integrating part of the other web-standards.
I have stated that, working in XHTML, the "Level double A " is caught up 
with extreme facility To;
so I try to convince the colleagues and the students that to follow the 
WCAG he does not involve large efforts.

Many italian colleagues and students assert that the texts of the W3C are 
difficult to  understand (not only as language, but often as exposure), but 
I have seen that in the draft of WCAG 2,0  they have been the efforts to 
become simple.

Working in a Public Administration, I believe I am a duty that the 
information arrive to all:
from the Library, round to October 2002 and together to other 
organizations, will leave one National Campaign (in Italy)  for 
accessibility in the libraries on the web.
This in order to push to a law (like "Section 508") that forces all the 
Italian Public Administration not to forget the disability, to follow the 
standards and to align themselves also to the directives of the European 
Union.

To this purpose *it would be much beautiful one*  that this Group supported 
this campaign, when it leaves!  What do you say about?

PS: I have studied the French language, I'm sorry for this strange English!

Maurizio
