Hi group,
i have think about this a lot before write but i think it could be useful to
discuss here that is the best place for do this.

Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS) - http://www.w3.org/PICS/

"It was originally designed to help parents and teachers control what
children access on the Internet, but it also facilitates other uses for
labels, including code signing and privacy."

So, why don't create a Label Pic for accessibility level? So, when a website
respect the level of accessibilty A, AA, AAA, can add a label pic like:

<meta http-equiv="pics-label" content='(PICS-1.1
"http://www.weburbia.com/safe/ratings.htm" l r (s 0))' />

This could also be a support for disable users for show only the accessible
web site (without losing time in flash intro loading, etc.) and an incentive
for the developers for create accessible web sites.

What do you think about?
