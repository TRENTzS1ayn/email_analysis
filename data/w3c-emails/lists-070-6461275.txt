Hi Roberto

Cool idea. It was done -
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999AprJun/0161.html

The EARL work is designed to use RDF to provide a more powerful version of
this - see http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl for an old outline and
http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/#earl for links to recent work.

There was also a discussion in this group about a year ago on using metadata
to make conformance claims. I can't find it at the moment though.

Cheers

Chaals
