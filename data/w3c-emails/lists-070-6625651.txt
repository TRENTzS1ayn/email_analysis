Well, I think that your idea about onlly having useful things is a good one.
But there are lots of people who are sighted, but who use a keyboard instead
of a mouse to navigate. It might be even more useful to these people than
people who use a mouse, since many of them are really using some slow form of
interface that mimics a keyboard, so simplifying navigation is
extra-helpful...

In general it is difficult to identify combinations of disability taht do or
don't occur - as far as I can tell almost all combinations of requirements do
occur.
