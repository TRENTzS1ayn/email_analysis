Me too.

I hope to join in when I can get a hands free phone set, and I don't know if
I can get up at 6am and sit in an unheated office in sub zero temperatures.

Also, can someone point me to where (if) the agenda is published somewhere
before hand, because it usually arrives from the list after the
teleconference.

Geoff
