Great!

Yes, that's the way... in Italy lots of peoples are thinking that Bobby
validation is the goal, when Bobby say "Bobby AAA Approved" then the
pages and sites are accessible.

The big problem is that also webagencies say this to their customers.

(One of them said that HTML is not a web standard... :) )

Yep, I agree.
EARL PICS posted by Wendy is stable? Can we try to use and test
softwares or solution around it?

I feel that peoples (and me too when I'd started to understand
accessibility) are a bit disoriented when they wish to test their
pages and understand where the "bug" is, and how to resolve it.

So, I think that EARL mixed with stable PICS WAI model and some
guideline in WCAG around this is a good goal for users and developer.

What about?

I'm sure you had already discussed about it and I know that it's
a big work to do. :)
