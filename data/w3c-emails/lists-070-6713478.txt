Hi Charles.

Intersting point!

I think that scripts can even be used to facilitate the interface
manipulation to some category of disabilities, with specific device
usage. Those who use the mouse don't need the same script aid for those
who use keyboard, and so on for many combinations. So the entire
question of  'device indipendent' event handler has to be revised? After
all, if some event handler is useful for those who use the mouse, it's
possible that it's not useful for others, and vice versa... It's no
content: it's interaction, and it depends on the cognitive, motorial and
sensorial abilities of the user. Everything has to be accessible. But
further (convenient? comfortable?) interaction is dependent by device
and abilities.

Should we talk more about 'device indipence'? Can we imagine web
interfaces that have different features for different devices, without
creating a barrier to content or functionality access (only a different
way of access: so, no need of equivalent - better: no *automatic* need
of equivalent: a human judge may help to evaluate case by case)?
