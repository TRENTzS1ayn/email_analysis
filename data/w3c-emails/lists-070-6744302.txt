Muchos saludos

I appreciate being admitted in the list.
My name is Jorge Teran, from La Paz Bolivia South America.

I'am currently a professor in the local univeristy UMSA and my main concern
is to introduce accessibility issues in undergraduate students.

Since telephone comunications are very dificult here I apologize for not
participating in teleconferences.

I would like to thank for the transcripts.

best regards

Jorge Teran
