Hi,

I think it is important that any success criteria for language use includes a
list of applicable languages.

For example, there is a proposal not to use noun sequences. In french, one
can reasonably say

  la version du loi de droits de general de gaulle

(either: General de Gaulle's version of the law of rights, or the version of
the law of General de Gaulle's rights).

Similarly, it is proposed that verbs in the passive mood be avoided. (I.e.
the last sentence would fail, twice). I don't know if this applies in all
languages.

If we do not think that a criterion works for a particular language, we
should not say anything. If we think that a criterion does not work for a
particular language, we should say so. I realise that this will leave us with
a weaker list than we might have, but hopefully it will encourage people with
relevant expertise to help fill the list. It will also hopefully mean we
avoid saying things that are wrong and would cause problems.

cheers

chaals
