Hello,

Our public working draft was published today. It is available at: 
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-WCAG20-20020822/

A formal announcement and calls for review will be sent to other working 
groups in the near future.

As well as making the edits to the working draft, Ben updated the change 
history with information since the last TR 
draft:  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/change-history.html  (Thanks Ben!)
