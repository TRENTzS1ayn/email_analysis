Hello,

I apologize that this agenda was not posted 24 hours before the 
meeting.  We will hold a meeting at our regularly scheduled time (later 
today): 4:00 to 5:30 PM ET (which is 20 hours UTC/GMT).

More information about the meeting and phone bridge is available at [0].

There are items from the 7 August agenda [1] that we have not discussed yet.

This week, there a mailing list discussion and various proposals for 
checkpoint 4.1.
Lisa's proposal [2]
Avi's proposal [3]
Charles' proposal [4]

Best,
--wendy
