Hi all.

I finally present myself as Wendy proposed...
... and excuse me for haven't done yet!

I'm Maurizio Boscarol, 33, and I work as usability and accessibility
consultant in Italy. I'm a cognitive psychologist with a special
interest
in text-comprehension, that has been my favourite argument before
approaching the web, some years ago. I've studied a lot about
text-structure and grammatics, comprehension process and skills, and
integrating information for mixed textual and visual modality (as text
and image, text and diagram, etc.).

I like also work as a graphic designer, but it's most an offline
activity...

I'm very interested in discussing accessibility and usability principles
and criteria, that I found implied in my everyday testing activities.
I also publish online articles and resources (in Italian only, sorry) on
usability, accessibility, design and writing on the web, and often teach
some of these arguments to Company or PA Web Staffs.

Best regards.

Maurizio Boscarol
