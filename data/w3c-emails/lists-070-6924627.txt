I think it is vital that success criteria are specific - otherwise they are
just nice ideas. I think there are success criteria that we can apply so long
as we recognise that they may only apply to certain languages.

There will always be more things that we will have as nice ideas, but the
goal of this group is to make a specification that can be tested, and that
serves tthe needs of people with disabilities. That implies being as specific
as possible.
