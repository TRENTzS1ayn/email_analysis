Moving Checkpoint 3.2 to Guideline 1 to Become New 1.4

 

                A suggestion that came from the teleconference was to
take Checkpoint 3.2 "Emphasize Structure Through Presentations,
Positioning and Labels" and move it up to become a new Checkpoint 1.4
(pushing the old 1.4 to become 1.5, etc.).

 

                This is suggested because it was felt that the purpose
for emphasizing the structure through presentation was to make it
perceivable.  Making it more perceivable, of course, facilitates
navigation, understanding, orientation, etc.  The primary purposes for
emphasizing it, however, was so that the structure can be perceived
independently from the rest of the content.

 

                A second motivation for moving it up next to 1.3 is that
the two guidelines can be viewed as being contradictory if not read
carefully.  By putting them immediately next to each other, it becomes
clear that they must work together.  It also makes it easier to look
back and forth between them to discern their separate and complimentary
(rather than contradictory) roles.

 

                It was further suggested that 3.2 (now the new 1.4) be
looked at to see if a slight rewording of the Checkpoint might make its
complimentary role even clearer.  However, the group was not able to
come up with such a wording at the meeting.

 

                Comments are solicited.

 

 

 


Thanks.
