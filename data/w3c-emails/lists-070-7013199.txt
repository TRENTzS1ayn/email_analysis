This fits clearly into the space of realising that the Web isn't entirely a
closed system - it is also part of the real world. There are times when
moving outside the Web is desirable (certain transactions for example often
require some kind of ink-on-paper signature), and it is important to be aware
that doing this doesn't magically end the requirement for accessibility - a
system that relies on something non-web-based but includes the Web isn't
going to be accessible if only the Web part is accessible.

I suspect that this is something more related to general reminders than
checkpoints, but it is worth keeping in mind.

Cheers
