Greg -

Thanks for putting into words what it was we discussed at the most recent
teleconference.  I agree, fully, that 1.3 and 1.4 should be close to each
other as I was having a challenging time with them being somewhat
contradictory, myself.  I will take a look at 1.4 and see if I can come up
with any wording.

Moving Checkpoint 3.2 to Guideline 1 to Become New 1.4

 

               A suggestion that came from the teleconference was to take
Checkpoint 3.2 ?Emphasize Structure Through Presentations, Positioning and
Labels? and move it up to become a new Checkpoint 1.4 (pushing the old 1.4
to become 1.5, etc.).

 

               This is suggested because it was felt that the purpose for
emphasizing the structure through presentation was to make it perceivable.
Making it more perceivable, of course, facilitates navigation,
understanding, orientation, etc.  The primary purposes for emphasizing it,
however, was so that the structure can be perceived independently from the
rest of the content.

 

               A second motivation for moving it up next to 1.3 is that the
two guidelines can be viewed as being contradictory if not read carefully.
By putting them immediately next to each other, it becomes clear that they
must work together.  It also makes it easier to look back and forth between
them to discern their separate and complimentary (rather than contradictory)
roles. 

 

               It was further suggested that 3.2 (now the new 1.4) be looked
at to see if a slight rewording of the Checkpoint might make its
complimentary role even clearer.  However, the group was not able to come up
with such a wording at the meeting.

 

               Comments are solicited.

 

 

 


Thanks.
