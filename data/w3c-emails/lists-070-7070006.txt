I agree with Charles-- I think it would be very helpful for us to provide
lists of specific recommended practices, with references to the languages
for which they're suitable.

I'd olke to see those lists in the Advice section, however, with the Success
Criteria stating more general principles and then pointing to the advice
section.  This is a practice we've followed elsewhere in 2.0.

I am not suggesting that there is a problem of listing things that are
specific to one language. I think it is sensible to do that. My opinion is
that we should do it, and we should be clear about what languages things are
useful for (so that nobody tries to apply rules for english to hebrew where
they are not applicable).
