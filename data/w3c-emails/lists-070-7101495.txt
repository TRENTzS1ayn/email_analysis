My two cents worth is - if you print a list of any sort, and most especially
a long list, readers will possibly take that as an all inclusive list.  If
readers do so (consider the list to be all inclusive), we'll be getting all
sorts of feedback along the lines of, "but, you forgot blah, blah, blah".

It seems logical to assume that authors of materials in different languages
only need to be asked to write clearly in their particular language, use
common rules of grammar for their language and have web pages that follow
the language of the particular web content (if it's scientific, write with
that readership in mind and where possible write to a wider span of
readers).  

Maybe a couple of examples but the issue there is in what languages will you
promote this checkpoint?  If you go to the government web site for HUD
(http://www.hud.gov/cgi-bin/intercept?http://babel.altavista.com/translate.d
yn?lin=en&url=http://www.neighborhoodnetworks.org) this page will redirect
you to a translation page...but, the initial connection with this page is in
English and no other language.  Some might be able to muddle through it,
even if they did not read English but accurate ideas about the links would
be diminished if you were a non-English reader.  But, maybe the HUD idea is
better than no access at all...I dunno!
