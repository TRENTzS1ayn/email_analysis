Hi Avi,

Well, next some references,
- Make it Simple: European Guidelines for the Production of Easy-to-Read
Information
(in all the european languages, but I don't believe that they are applicable
to all the document types, they are centered especially in people with
cognitive deficiencies. In Sidar we are working to define what guidelines,
of the version in Spanish, they would be applicable to all the documents.)

- Guide de la redaction (Minist?re de la fonction publique et de la r?forme
de l'Etat:
http://www.fonction-publique.gouv.fr/reforme/simplification/cosla/guide.htm

- Fight the fog:
http://europa.eu.int/comm/translation/en/ftfog/index.htm
(A very instructive and funny place, of the Service of Translation of the
European Commission.)

- Plain Language Commission
http://www.clearest.co.uk/cesacccrit.htm

I hope this helps you in their titanic task :-)
