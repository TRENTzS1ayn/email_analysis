We currently have an item in the new 1.3  level 2 that reads

 

"1. [diagrams that have structure can be accessed by the user.]"

 

It actually isn't worded very well  and is hard to understand

 

I suggest it be worded something like 

 

"Any diagrams that have structure expose the structure in accessible
form. "

(is "accessible form"  clear enough?)


Thanks. 

Gregg
