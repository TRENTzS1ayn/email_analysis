That's much better.  How about making it parallel to the level 1 success
criteria?
 
1) The following can be derived programmatically (i.e. through assistive
technology compatible markup or data model) from the content without
interpreting presentation.
    a) Structural components of diagrams

Re: "... expose the structure in accessible form":
 
I see two problems with this wording:
1. "expose the structure" assumes fairly sophisticated knowledge
of technical concepts-- i.e., this won't mean much to non-geeks.
2. "... in an accessible form" seems circular, since the point
of the checkpoint is to facilitate accessibility.
 
So how about something like the following:
"Structural components of diagrams can be recognized/used by
assistive technology"?

We currently have an item in the new 1.3  level 2 that reads

 

"1. [diagrams that have structure can be accessed by the user.]"

 

It actually isn't worded very well  and is hard to understand

 

I suggest it be worded something like 

 

"Any diagrams that have structure expose the structure in
accessible form. "

(is "accessible form"  clear enough?)


Thanks.
