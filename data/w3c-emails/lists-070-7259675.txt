Cynthia's revision of my proposed revision works for me.  Here's what she
wrote:
1) The following can be derived programmatically (i.e. through assistive
technology compatible markup or data model) from the content without
interpreting presentation.
    a) Structural components of diagrams

That's much better.  How about making it parallel to the level 1 success
criteria?

Re: "... expose the structure in accessible form":
 
I see two problems with this wording:
1. "expose the structure" assumes fairly sophisticated knowledge of
technical concepts-- i.e., this won't mean much to non-geeks.
2. "... in an accessible form" seems circular, since the point of the
checkpoint is to facilitate accessibility.
 
So how about something like the following:
"Structural components of diagrams can be recognized/used by assistive
technology"?

We currently have an item in the new 1.3  level 2 that reads

 

"1. [diagrams that have structure can be accessed by the user.]"

 

It actually isn't worded very well  and is hard to understand

 

I suggest it be worded something like 

 

"Any diagrams that have structure expose the structure in accessible form. "

(is "accessible form"  clear enough?)


Thanks. 

Gregg
