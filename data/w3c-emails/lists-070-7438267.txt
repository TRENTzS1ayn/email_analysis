As I understand the way the phrase "plain language" is used in the proposal
for 4.1, it's something on the order of a technical term, referring to a
specific body of theory and practice.  So replacing it with "easily
understood" would be problematic in that regard, as well as in the way Chris
suggests.

Except then you get into that gray area of what "easily understood" means.
Reminds me of a Steven Wright joke where he said he got into an argument in
Vegas over what he considered an "odd" number.

I was thinking that perhaps instead of "plain language" we use "easily
understood language".  This would remove the connotation that "it's only
plain English".  "Easily understood language" would meet the requirements of
any language and is also "easily" translated by machine translators.

Just my two-cents.

I don't think we're going to find anything better.

In plain English the term for what we wish to connote is "plain English."

This fails the W3C ethical guideline "insofar as possible avoid the
appearance of bias with regard to language and national origin."

As close to "plain English" as we can come in politically correct English is
"plain language."  I don't see us coming up with another way of saying this
briefly which is both

- as clear from a base in the most commonly used subset of English

- sufficiently language-group neutral

PS:

For a term that applies across media an includes the expository-structure
idioms of genres (such as title-bar at the top, navbar on the left in LTR
languages) as well as language structures, use "vernacular idiom."

But this concept, understood that broadly, is exotic.  This broad notion
does not exist in the vernacular base of commonly understood notions.  Its
OK to use highfalutin' language for this idea, because it is an advanced
concept to begin with.

PPS:

Hypertext is a medium.  Web portal is a medium.

Web Store (Amazon) is a genre, as is "community hub" (slashdot).  Idioms for
page organization exist at the level of site similarity group where you do
similar things there.
