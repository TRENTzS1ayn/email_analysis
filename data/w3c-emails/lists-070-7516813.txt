Hi Ben,
?
I seem to have got lost in the teleconference (action item and minutes)
... the following comments should be attributed to me (GSW):
ES - agrees that it is confusing

ES - I'll take an action item to reword this and send a note to the
list.(1.2, level 2, item 1)

ACTION Eugenia - reword 1.2, level 2, item 1 and send a note to the
list.?

Thanks!

Gian
