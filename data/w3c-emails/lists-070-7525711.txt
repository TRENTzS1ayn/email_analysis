Hi,
?
If you could respond to the list as to which one you like the most -
that way we can see if there's a definate favourite and finalise it next
teleconference.
?
The original wording:
A conformance claim associated with the content asserts conformance to
this checkpoint at level 2 or level 3.
?
Option 1:
A conformance claim associated with the content asserts conformance to
this checkpoint at the relevant level (level 2 or level 3).
?
Option 2:
Conformance to this checkpoint is asserted. The conformance claim
specifies at which level the site conforms to this checkpoint (level 2
or level 3).
?
Option 3:
The site asserts conformance to this checkpoint and specifies the level
claimed (level 2 or level 3).
?
Cheers,
Gian
