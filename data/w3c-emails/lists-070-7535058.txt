I think 2 and 3 are clearer, but 1 is slightly simpler.

Whichever you choose, it is important to use the term "content" rather
than "site" because the latter implies that the conformance claim
applies to the entire site, whereas in fact the implementor has complete
flexibility in defining the scope of the conformance claim, which
can encompass anything from a single document to a whole web site.

As a related issue we need to be careful where we use the term "site"
in the guidelines, and work out whether there are any contexts in which we
really mean it. The term isn't defined anywhere, which just makes it
worse and adds to the ambiguity.
