Hi,
i think option 2 is more "clear" but tecnically i think is best to use
option 1.

Also, about my IRC message in the last meeting:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/08/29-minutes.html

"I suggest for "conformity" of the document to use in Appendix B the same
style of paragraph of level 2 and three, starting level one with "At level
1,..."

have the group considered this change?

Subject: Action item - claiming conformance at Level 2 or 3


Hi,

If you could respond to the list as to which one you like the most -
that way we can see if there's a definate favourite and finalise it next
teleconference.

The original wording:
A conformance claim associated with the content asserts conformance to
this checkpoint at level 2 or level 3.

Option 1:
A conformance claim associated with the content asserts conformance to
this checkpoint at the relevant level (level 2 or level 3).

Option 2:
Conformance to this checkpoint is asserted. The conformance claim
specifies at which level the site conforms to this checkpoint (level 2
or level 3).

Option 3:
The site asserts conformance to this checkpoint and specifies the level
claimed (level 2 or level 3).

Cheers,
Gian
