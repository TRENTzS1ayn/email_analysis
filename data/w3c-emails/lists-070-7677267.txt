Background
The W3C's device-independence working group has proposed to meet
jointly with us on 12 September, during our regular meeting time. This
working group has published drafts of two documents of interest which
it is important to review in advance, namely:

1. Device Independence Principles: http://www.w3.org/TR/di-princ/

2. Authoring Scenarios for Device Independence:
   http://www.w3.org/2001/di/public/as/as-draft-20020729.html

Time will be set aside at this week's meeting to discuss these
documents and the relationship between WCAG and the
device independence activity.
