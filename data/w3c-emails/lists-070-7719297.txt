Current wording for Checkpoint 5.2, Success criterion #1, minimum level:
1.a list of technologies and features, support for which is
required in order for the content to be operable, has been determined and is
documented in metadata and / or a policy statement associated with the
content.
Proposed new wording
1. A list of the technologies and features required to operate the content
is associated with the content through metadata and/or a policy statement.

-- Explanation:
I've tried to make this criterion more understandable by (a) straightening
out the syntax and (b) shortening the sentence.  I deleted the phrase "has
determined and is" on the grounds that the list of required technologies and
features can't be provided until someone has determined what those
requirements are.

What important nuances have I missed?
