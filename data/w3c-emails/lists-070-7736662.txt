Thanks, Ben, for getting out the information about the checklists.

I have been working on a prototype "gateway" interface for accessing the
checklists. We decided to present things in a step-wise fashion. On the
first page, the user selects whether to access a static or an
interactive version of the technology checklists, On the next page, the
user selects which technologies to include (e.g. HTML, CSS, script,
etc.).

Along the way, the user can also choose to create a custom checklist
(either static or interactive).

Just so you know, when I say "static checklist" I mean a version of the
checklist which is best suited to online viewing and/or printing out on
paper. When I say "interactive checklist" I mean a form-based version of
the checklist which the user can fill out, submit, and then receive a
conformance report or rating, along with the necessary EARL markup which
can then be included in the page or site itself. We have not created
these interactive forms. I have only created the gateway to them.

When I created these prototypes, I did not do an XSL conversion, though
we'd like to do XSL in the final version. So, in light of the fact that
I had to copy and paste everything, I did not create a complete
checklist. I only did the first three guidelines, with their
corresponding checkpoints success criteria. Even so, you can see that
the documents become quite long.

Also, you'll notice that I just copied and pasted the techniques from
1.1 into all of the success criteria. I did this just so that we could
have some place-holder content in the techniques. (Copying, pasting, and
formatting all of that information would have been too time-consuming.)

You'll also notice that not all of the text in my "gateway pages" is
linked yet, again, due to the large amount of time it would take to
generate all of the corresponding documents.

Lastly, you'll notice that the checklist that I created is somewhat
different from both of the versions that Ben referenced in his email
earlier. My version is simply another conceptualization of the same
basic idea. At some point we'll have to choose between
conceptualizations and then refine the one that we choose.

Ok. With that preamble, here is the link to the first step in the
gateway pages:

Follow all of the active links in these documents to get the big picture
of how the system fits together.
