The option to have a "full checklist" is still there. But the issue is
that there is more than one type of full checklist. 

For example, you could have a checklist with every success criterion for
every conformance level with all techniques for all technologies (this
would be a *HUGE* document).

You could also have a checklist with every success criterion for every
level *without* any technology-specific techniques (you can see this
option by going to the main gateway
page--http://www.webaim.org/wcag/checklist/step1--then clicking on
"pre-configured static checklists", then choosing "general - all
conformance levels").

Similarly, you could have every success criterion and every level with
only HTML, and so on, through all of the technologies.

As you can see, there is not really one checklist that fits every
situation, but it is still possible to generate one generic checklist
(without technology-specific information) which includes all success
criteria and all levels. I think that this is what you are referring to.
If it is not, then you'll have to clarify.

Hi,
i think that would be important to have two kinds of checklist: a full
checklist as for the WCAG 1.0 and one interactive.
This second options is due for the users that prefer to have a
"Step-by-step" guide for reach the correct level for accessibility
claim.
