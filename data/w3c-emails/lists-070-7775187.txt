Current wording for Checkpoint 5.4, level 2, success criterion #1:
1. the interface has been tested using a variety of assistive technologies
and preferably real people with disabilities who use assistive technologies
to
determine that assistive technologies can access all information on the page
or hidden within the page.

Proposal: pull this into two separate success criteria and make testing by
people with disabilities a requirement, not a mere preference.

Proposed wording:

1.The interface has been tested using a variety of assistive
technologies, and an accurate summary of the test results is provided.
2.The interface has been tested by a number of people with
different disabilities using assistive technologies familiar to them, and a
summary of the results is provided.

I can see an argument for making number 2 (user testing by pwd's) a
level 3 requirement, but I'd much prefer that it stay at level 2.  By
requiring a summary of results we introduce verifiability, or at least
testability, in the ways we've been talking about.
