I just read through the minutes for last week.  Unfortunately, I didn't see
mention of any concensus regarding "plain language" only mention that we
need to determine if that checkpoint should be totally focused upon content
or the written words.

I'm still with the idea that "plain language" does not meet the needs.
Plain language to one person is not the same as plain language to another.
This is very much like the fact that for one person "church clothes" could
be a really sharp and expensive suit while to another it could be a nice
pair of slacks and white button-down shirt with a tie.

However, "easily understood language" removes any ambiguity from the
concepts.  It puts the language down to the common denominator.  Newspapers
use "easily understood language"; they don't use "plain language".

Thursday, 5 September, 2000 UTC (4 PM US Eastern, 10 PM France, 6 AM
Eastern Australia) on +1-617-761-6200, passcode 9224, with the
following agenda:

1. Device-independence and WCAG. See my message at
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/2002JulSep/0280.html This
   includes discussion of documents published by the device
   independence working group and preparation of questions and issues
   that we want to take up with them next week.

2. Checklists: see the thread starting at
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002JulSep/0279.html

3. Checkpoint 4.1. Last week there was "rough consensus" on the call
   that the checkpoint should be rewritten as:
Use plain language.
retaining checkpoint 3.1 in consequence.
For subsequent mailing list discussion see the thread starting at
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002JulSep/0253.html

It is proposed to devote 30 minutes to each of the three topics on the
agenda.
