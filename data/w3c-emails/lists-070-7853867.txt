Hi,

please note that display of vowels as a concern is a stylistic question, and
there are style solutions in many cases. For example in SVG it is easy to
include vowels which are not actually displayed. Similarly in MathML, the
convention of writing

 ab insted of a.o or a times b is supported through the availability of the
invisibleTimes element.

Cheers
