That is my understanding as well. I use javascript for drop down menus but
make sure that there are redundant pathways to all the content. It may take
an additional click to get to the lower level content without the javascript
menu - but you can still get there.

Lisa, it's my understanding that WCAG 2.0 does permit use of Javascipt under
two conditions: (1) it's documented, and (2) that the content meets *all*
checkpoints at minimum level or better.  Thus if the example you offer fails
on other checkpoints or other criteria, there cannot be a conformance claim
with respect tot hat content.
 
Is this the way others understand what we're saying?

criterion #1


Can you clarify two points for me,
 
1, does this mean that according to WCAG 2 you can use JavaScript if it is
documented?
 
2, what about a page like http://space.ort.org.il/nagish/
<http://space.ort.org.il/nagish/>  were you have framesets embedded in
framesets and the second set of framesets are written by a JavaScript - how
can the assistive technologies get to the titles?
 
a code snippet follows:
 
if ( RestoreTopFrame == 1 )
document.write('<frameset rows="21,*" name="MainFrame" border="0">')
else
document.write('<frameset rows="91,*" name="MainFrame"  border="0">') 
document.write('<frame class="clsFrameTitle" marginwidth="0"
marginheight="0" id="idTopBar" name="TopBar"
src="frame_title.asp?sp_c=424450463" frameborder="0" scrolling="NO"
noresize>')

All the best,

rion #1



Current wording for Checkpoint 5.2, Success criterion #1, minimum level: 


1.      a list of technologies and features, support for which is
required in order for the content to be operable, has been determined and is
documented in metadata and / or a policy statement associated with the
content.

Proposed new wording 
1. A list of the technologies and features required to operate the content
is associated with the content through metadata and/or a policy statement.

-- Explanation: 
I've tried to make this criterion more understandable by (a) straightening
out the syntax and (b) shortening the sentence.  I deleted the phrase "has
determined and is" on the grounds that the list of required technologies and
features can't be provided until someone has determined what those
requirements are.

What important nuances have I missed? 

John
