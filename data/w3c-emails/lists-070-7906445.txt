With permission, I am forwarding this note from computational linguist
Kurt Godden, Ph.D. I first met Kurt when he headed the Controlled
Automotive Service Language (CASL) program at General Motors.  He is now
Principal Member of the Engineering Staff, Advanced Technology Labs,
Lockheed Martin Corporation:
