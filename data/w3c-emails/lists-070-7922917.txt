Current wording for checkpoint 1.2, success criterion 1, minimum level:
1. an audio description is provided of all visual information in scenes,
actions and events (that can't be perceived from the sound track).
* The audio description should include all significant visual information in
scenes, actions and events (that can't be perceived from the sound track) to
the extent possible given the constraints posed by the existing audio track
(and constraints on freezing the audio/visual program to insert additional
auditory description).

Proposed wording 
1.an audio description is provided of all significant visual
information in scenes, actions and events that cannot be perceived from the
sound track alone.
Note: When adding audio description to existing
materials, the amount of information conveyed through audio description is
constrained by the existing audio track.  It may also be impossible or
inappropriate to freeze the audio/visual program to insert additional
auditory description. 

Comment:
I have moved the word "significant" from the first line of the bulleted item
into the success criterion itself, then deleted the first part of the
bulleted item since it was nearly identical to the success criterion.  I've
also tried to clarify what we say about the constraints on audio
description, by (a) noting that this note applies to audio description
*added to existing material* (i.e., material that doesn't make room for
audio description in the original script); I also broke up the sentence and
got rid of the parenthetical notes.  It's my hope that the result is more
closer to the kind of practice we're proposing for 4.1.

On the other hand, I may have omitted or obscured something essential
here...
