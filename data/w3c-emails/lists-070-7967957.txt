In fulfillment of my action item from last week's meeting, here is a
list of checkpoints in WCAG 2.0 (public working draft) of relevance to
device independence:

All of guideline 1
checkpoints 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, 5.2, 5,3 and 5.4.

Other checkpoints may also be relevant but the above are most
obviously so.
