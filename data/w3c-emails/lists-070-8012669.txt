I like this -but we can't leave the limits out of the checkpoint and
just put them in a note.

 

Hmmm

 

Maybe..something like this. (Edits marked in curly brackets.)

 

1.      an audio description is provided of all significant visual
information in scenes, actions and events that cannot be perceived from
the sound track alone {to the extent possible given sound track
constraints}.

Note: When adding audio description to existing materials, the amount of
information conveyed through audio description is constrained by the
{amount of blank space available in} existing audio track.  It may also
be impossible or inappropriate to freeze the audio/visual program to
insert additional auditory description.

Subject: 1.2: proposed rewording

 

Current wording for checkpoint 1.2, success criterion 1, minimum level: 
1. an audio description is provided of all visual information in scenes,
actions and events (that can't be perceived from the sound track).

* The audio description should include all significant visual
information in scenes, actions and events (that can't be perceived from
the sound track) to

the extent possible given the constraints posed by the existing audio
track (and constraints on freezing the audio/visual program to insert
additional

auditory description). 

Proposed wording 

1.      an audio description is provided of all significant visual
information in scenes, actions and events that cannot be perceived from
the sound track alone.

Note: When adding audio description to existing materials, the amount of
information conveyed through audio description is constrained by the
existing audio track.  It may also be impossible or inappropriate to
freeze the audio/visual program to insert additional auditory
description. 

Comment: 
I have moved the word "significant" from the first line of the bulleted
item into the success criterion itself, then deleted the first part of
the bulleted item since it was nearly identical to the success
criterion.  I've also tried to clarify what we say about the constraints
on audio description, by (a) noting that this note applies to audio
description *added to existing material* (i.e., material that doesn't
make room for audio description in the original script); I also broke up
the sentence and got rid of the parenthetical notes.  It's my hope that
the result is more closer to the kind of practice we're proposing for
4.1.

On the other hand, I may have omitted or obscured something essential
here...
