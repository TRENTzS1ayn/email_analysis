Well, sound track constraints are (like what is sufficiently artistic to
merit ignoring accessibility considerations) subjective.

The success criteria should be that the resulting soundtrack carries
sufficient information to understand the content presented without visual
cues.

Techniques should be noted for squeezing enough into a very small space. But
in some cases it simply won't be possible to make the content accessible by
sound alone. This doesn't mean that content should pass the checkpoint by
default, it means the content should fail the checkpoint by default (although
we should look for all possible techniques to make the content accessible so
it meets the fundamental success criterion: people can use it regardless of
disability).

just my 2 cents worth.
