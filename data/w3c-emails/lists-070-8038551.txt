Subject: WCAG/DI joint teleconference: agenda



Thursday, 12 September, 2000-2130 UTC (that is, starting at 4 PM US Eastern,
10 PM
France, 6 AM Eastern Australia, etc.) on +1-617-761-6200, passcode
9224.

Agenda:

1. Introductions: the relationship between device independence and
   accessibility, areas of potential collaboration.

2. Issues raised by the WCAG working group in response to the
   Principles of Device Independence and Authoring Scenarios working
   drafts. These include matters identified by Cynthia and Wendy in
   fulfillment of last week's action item, the differing roles of the
   various documents and the ways in which the Principles and the
   Scenarios should be taken into account in the development of WCAG
   2.0 and/or its accompanying Techniques documents (including
   "server-side" techniques). Also, the
   potential for collaboration in preparing the
   "accessibility-related" sections of the Scenarios document may be
   explored.

3. Issues raised by members of the device independence working group
   upon reviewing the WCAG 2.0 public working draft.

4. Conclusions: opportunities for collaboration, action items and next
   steps.
