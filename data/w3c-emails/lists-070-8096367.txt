Abstract

The principal goal of this document is to help W3C Working Groups to write 
clearer, more implementable, and better testable technical reports. It both 
provides a common framework for specifying conformance requirements and 
definitions, and also addresses the representation of specifications 
(technical reports) as schemata, both of which facilitate the generation of 
test materials. The material is presented as a set of organizing guidelines 
and verifiable checkpoints. This document is one in a family of Framework 
documents of the Quality Assurance (QA) Activity, which includes the other 
existing or in-progress specifications: Introduction; Operational 
Guidelines; and, Test Guidelines.
