>Boston, MA. September 19, 2002. A groundbreaking collaboration among
>international players in the online learning field has resulted in a set of
>guidelines to educate the eLearning community about the challenges that
>people with disabilities face in accessing online education, and to provide
>solutions and resources to solve them.  Major support of these efforts is
>provided by the Learning Anywhere Anytime Partnerships program* of the U.S.
>Department of Education.
>
>"IMS Guidelines for Creating Accessible Learning Technologies" is a joint
>publication of the IMS Global Learning Consortium, and the CPB/WGBH National
>Center for Accessible Media (NCAM), the research and development division of
>the Media Access Group at WGBH Boston, a U.S. public broadcaster with a
>thirty-year history of developing access solutions for mass media.
>
>The IMS Guidelines are available on the Web in a screen-reader friendly
>format as well as in PDF (http://ncam.wgbh.org/salt) and are expected to be
>an invaluable resource for a broad range of stakeholders in online
>education, including educators providing online learning materials,
>developers of learning software such as learning management systems and
>educational software, and educational publishers, content authors, authoring
>tool developers and parents, advocates and students with disabilities
>themselves.
>
>Users will find the IMS Guidelines a comprehensive source on accessibility,
>which includes principles for accessibility in online learning, accessible
>delivery of text, audio, images and multimedia, using XML for accessibility,
>and legal issues for accessible distance learning.  Developers, including
>educators, will find methods for developing a wide range of accessible tools
>including:
>
>- asynchronous communication and collaboration tools
>- synchronous communication and collaboration tools
>- interfaces and interactive environments
>- testing and assessment
>- authoring tools
>
>Key contributors to the Guidelines include representatives from the
>following organizations: Blackboard (USA), Centre for Educational Technology
>Interoperability Standards (UK), Department of Education, Science and
>Training (AUS), Educational Testing Service (USA), Industry Canada (CAN),
>Open University (UK), Sheffield Hallam University (UK), UK eUniversities
>Worldwide (UK), and the University of Toronto Adaptive Technology Resource
>Centre (CAN).
>
>* The Guidelines were developed as part of the Specifications for Accessible
>Learning Technologies Partnership at the CPB/WGBH National Center for
>Accessible Media. Funding is provided by the Learning Anytime Anywhere
>Partnerships (LAAP), a program administered by the Fund for the Improvement
>of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE), part of the Office of Postsecondary
>Education, U.S. Department of Education.
