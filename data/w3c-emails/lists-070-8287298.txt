A test point that needs to be added to the checklist of validation

http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/#validation

is to be aware of the default settings and metrics of each individuals
desktop OS.

I have two monitors 19" and 21" set at various degrees of resolution,
running both Win2000 and Linux.  On Win2000 I have Large Fonts installed and
have changed the default screen fonts to Verdana.

On my mothers computer; Win2000 17" 800x600 I also have installed Large
Fonts and Verdana, but set them much higher.  I have also customised the
desktop to set icons sizes and spacing.

All this impacts on the default of browsers, and also, how the user sets the
defaults fonts and sizes in their browser.  This really impacts on how web
sites are seen, and it catches out even the well design sites (I'm sure
everyone on this list is aware of this, but we need to document it for
others).  For instance, often such designers will have a background colour
for all text, including nav text, instead of using transparent (therefore
inheriting the default background).  What happens, is that the text overlaps
and can't easily be read.  It's definitely a fine art getting all these
things correct in CSS.

Maybe we need to revise and update checklists for accessibility?  What do
others think?  I'm willing to work on it, because I am addressing this at
the moment in a web site I am building which is aimed at trying to assist
big business (and anyone else) realise, that incorporating WAI and W3C
standards can improve their business process, their SDLC, their ROI etc.
