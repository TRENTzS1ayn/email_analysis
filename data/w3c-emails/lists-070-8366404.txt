I think Wendy's draft document is a positive step and should be
completed at some stage before WCAG 2.0 becomes a Recommendation.

As for two levels of detail at the technology-specific level, I would
prefer that the techniques be formulated with sufficient precision
that it is obvious from them alone what is required. However, one of
the expectations from the authoring tools working group is that we
identify all of the assertions (especially in techniques documents)
that are machine testable, as well as those which are human testable.
I think test assertions are therefore to be recommended, together with
an indication of whether each is amenable to automated application.
This, I suspect, lies at the core of what Wendy was suggesting, and if
so I endorse the idea of including them (of course some users won't
need them, and should be able to filter them out in generating
checklists etc.).
