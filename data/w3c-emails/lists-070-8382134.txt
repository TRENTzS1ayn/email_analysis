I like the 2 levels of statements. As a developer I would find this document
extremely useful. I believe that by breaking it out into a general statement
followed by technology specific items allows for growth of the document.
Other technologies such as CSS, XSL, etc. can be added as needed without
affecting the organization of the document. Nice job Wendy.
