I agree that providing two levels of detail will be useful.  It may be a way
to address some of the concerns Bob Regan raised in his response to WCAG 2.0
as a whole-- that it raises the bar significantly and may pose serious
issues for "beginning and intermediate" developers who use WYSIWYG tools
since they'd be required to do hand-coding (though that's true now as well);
Bob also points out that the document is more technical than 1.0, which may
pose barriers to non-technical readers (policy wonks, managers, etc.).  The
two levels of detail might help there.  

It seems to me, too, that offering two levels of detail is consistent with
the practices we're recommending/requiring n 4.1.

I like the 2 levels of statements. As a developer I would find this document
extremely useful. I believe that by breaking it out into a general statement
followed by technology specific items allows for growth of the document.
Other technologies such as CSS, XSL, etc. can be added as needed without
affecting the organization of the document. Nice job Wendy.
