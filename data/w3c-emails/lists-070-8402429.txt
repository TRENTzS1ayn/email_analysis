Hi Wendy!
It's a good stuff!

I'm a bit doubtful around the designer definition:

"Layout Designer, Stylistic Designer, Interaction Designer,
Navigation Designer"

I think Layout and Stylistic Designer are redundant because of
is the same role, a webdesigner has to know both roles basically.
It could be different the Interaction and Navigation Designer and
both from the Layout designer, but Layout and Style are the same
thing for me, in Italy we call it normally Web Designer.

So, I'm asking myself if it's a good thing to split them in
different roles or it is better to keep them one. I think that
peoples who begin to understand accessibility (specially outside
USA) could ask: "ok, there's so many roles... but, we're the
roles for webdesigner?"

Is it right to apply them? Or there are other roles for me?

Just a doubt.

I agree. I think beginners need a roadmap and they need a clear
reference to relationships that are linked from WCAG to others
workgroups. A lot of peoples think that Bobby validation is the
goal of WAI-AAA accessibility.

I think that "human" statement (the second example) works better.

Yes. Good.

I think roadmap is necessary! :)

Many peoples feel the statement "Use the TITLE element to describe the
document" too difficult to understand (it is too programmer-side) and
they feel better the second statement.

They need simple words to understand.

Best,
