it is right... a web designer is not always a graphic designer...
We as IWA/HWG are defining the definition of web professional specification
(IWA/HWG International has made these since 1996...) and we are trying to
create a "point of division" of these two specialities.
For example, i have some web designers that are IWA-ITALY members that are
also graphic designer and they prefer to develop web sites with a lot of
graphic and animation, and some web designers that are now specializing in
simple design for web site and contents....
By the way, i think that is more simple to have a "web designer only" that
develops web accessible web sites than a "graph and web designer" that
prefer more "look" for web site and contents.
