In the device independence authoring scenarios document, on which
Wendy wisely based the list of categories, these are discussed in
terms of roles rather than people: what needs to be determined is the
interplay between each of  the roles and the technology, or, in our
case, the documents. Obviously, some sites are implemented by only one
person, who assumes, at different stages during the development
process, each of the roles that Wendy identified. In other cases the
roles will be distributed among different developers or groups
thereof. Thus I think it is best to rework the document to make it
clear that we are discussing the roles that implementors have in
developing content, rather than trying to classify people by
occupational category.
