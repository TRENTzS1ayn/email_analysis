I also agree to keep different roles distinct.
The definition of layout designer Wendy given in the document explains
well the point: how to 'lay-out' the informational object is another
question from how they may look (and feel...). It is true in visual
design like in auditory design, if so I can say. In visual design the
difference sounds like this:

-layout: a spatial and relationship problem;
- look&feel: a visual, 'surface' problem (color, contrast, shape, lines,
etc.);

After usability testing very often the problem of bad layed-out elements
is resolved altering their look&feel proprerties, but that's another
problem... ;-) In fact often this doesn't solve the problem... :)

At the same time I also agree with Marco and confirm that in most cases
in Italy the layout designer and stylistic designer are the same
person... and even the same mental process! But this is a way of work in
Italy, in the little web agency or in personal sites. I'm sure that in
the future the processes will became more distinct, and this division
will be clearer as we start intensively project for different media.

I think the Scenario Document is a really good idea. Two question
follows:


-where we must place the information architet role: in the navigation
designer, in the interaction designer, content creator or what?
-where we place the usability specialist? In the 'site tester' role?
That doesn't seem really clear.


Great job, anyway: the one we need, as I see.
And I personally surely need even a roadmap... :)

Best regards

Maurizio Boscarol
