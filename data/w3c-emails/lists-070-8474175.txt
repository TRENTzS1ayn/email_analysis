To the group and Jason in particular, can you send me the link to the device
independent scenarios that you speak of.  I did find some scenarios related
to device independence but in my reading they had everything to do with
people and their particular need in terms of accessibility and not role
specific (other than the person they are) - maybe I am confused.
(http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/PWD-Use-Web/Overview.html).  Is this the
direction we are talking about (the above link)?

I see web designer and policy maker roles at an organizational level as
being potentially all over the map.  It would be (I feel) virtually
impossible for us either tell or know what it is that certain individuals
within some organizational structure ought to be doing.

As I said, in yesterday's audio conference, I would give my first best shot
at writing up some scenarios as they relate to accessible design and
development features.  When I look at what and how I wrote my first few
scenarios, they fall in-line with what I read from the link above.  Am I on
the right track?  The scenarios I read (if the correct ones) were nicely
done, easy to understand and something I think needs to be employed into our
work.  

Your input is desired.
