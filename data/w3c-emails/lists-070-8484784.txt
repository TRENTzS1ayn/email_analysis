The "Authoring Scenarios for Device Independence" is available at: 
http://www.w3.org/2001/di/public/as/as-draft-20020729.html

In "Usage Scenarios for WCAG 2.0" [1] (a very rough initial draft that 
outlines some ideas), I link to specific sections of "Authoring Scenarios 
for Device Independence".

For example, "Layout Designer, Stylistic Designer, Interaction Designer, 
Navigation Designer" [2]  links to section 2.1 of "Authoring Scenarios for 
Device Independence."  [3]

The document, "How People with Disabilities Use the Web" is an important 
piece of the puzzle that is included in the list of "WCAG2.0-related 
documents."  It does a good job of outlining how people with disabilities 
use the Web.

Best,
