Hello Maurizio,

What responsibilities does the architect have in making a site 
accessible?  Do they differ greatly from other roles that are listed?  If 
not, can we combine them in some way?

The point of the exercise is not to create an exhaustive list of all 
possible roles that people may play in the Web site development 
process.  The point (as I see it - feel free to disagree) is to figure out 
the different types of information that people need.  If the needs of an 
information architect differ greatly from a designer, then we ought to 
address them as separate entities.  If not, then we ought to find a general 
category that represents them both.

Perhaps by answering my questions we can answer yours. :)

Thanks,
