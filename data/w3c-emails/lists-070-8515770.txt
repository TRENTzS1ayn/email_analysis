Jon,

I think this issue is covered by checkpoint 1.3 Make all content and 
structure available independently of presentation. [1]  Do you feel that 
this checkpoint and its success criteria are not strong enough?  Could this 
checkpoint be strengthened instead of adding a new checkpoint?

I think it is clear in the benefits for this checkpoint,
""
Separating content and structure from presentation allows Web pages to be 
presented differently to meet the needs and constraints of different users 
without losing any of the information or structure. For example, 
information can be presented via speech or braille (text) that was 
originally intended to be presented visually.
""

Perhaps we can make this more clear in the success criteria?
