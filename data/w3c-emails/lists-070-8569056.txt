Hi folks,

one of the reasons I use iCab a lot is that it shows what accesskeys are
available, visually, and it activates the links in a single keypress - I find
this slightly more convenient than the double action of <accesskey><enter>
(especially when I am reduced to using one hand) because it saves me
travelling across the keyboard (for the same reasons I find this preferable
to <modifier><accesskey><enter> ...)

I understand the issue that leads to people wanting to make accesskey a
two-step process. I suspect this is a minority case, and should be handled by
allowing for configuration in the User Agent, although I think that either
approach is acceptable - the more so if users can readily find out what
accesskeys are available and know that they are not going to override system
functions they rely on.

Accesskey introduces some general problems for User agents - in many systems
certain keys are reserved, or not available (how many people know how to
activate the 'kaf' key?), and the user agent has to find some way of making
the functionality available. In Amaya, the accesskey overrides the system
functionality, which is an obvious problem. In Explorer, certain accesskeys
are simply ignored, which also creates a problem, especially without clear
documentation of which keys will be ignored.

For what it is worth, the WAI Protocols and Formats group is aware of this
issue, and expecting to deal with it in its review of XHTML 2.0. Further
input is of course welcome - for people with member access I recommend
copying the PFWG at w3c-wai-pf@w3.org but for poeple without member access
this thread is a useful place to collect information that will remain
publicly available.

cheers
