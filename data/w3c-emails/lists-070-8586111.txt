JRG: I feel that this is not the checkpoint for this issue.  I think using
technologies that all the user to stylize text is a different issue than
separating content from structure.  I could use an image (with alt text)
to stylize text and enclose the image in a H1 element to indicate that the
element was a header.  Are you saying that this would not pass the test
for 1.3?
