In my understanding it would not pass the requirement - the content is
intimately tied to its presentation either as a bitmap or as an attribute
value. (I don't think it is very clear in the current draft that an attribute
value is not an acceptable substitute for real content, nor why. But i think
this is a matter of refining the success criteria rather than a fundamental
change to the checkpoint).
