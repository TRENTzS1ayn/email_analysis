Due to the cross-group interest generated by this issue, which affects
the WAI User Agent Accessibility Guidelines working group, the
Protocols and Formats working group, The Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines working group, as well as the HTML working group, the
discussion has been moved to the WAI xtech mailing list
(wai-xtech@w3.org) for further deliberation. The xtech mailing list
was set up within the WAI domain precisely to foster, and to provide a
forum in which to hold, cross-group technical discussion.

It is a public list, and I have commenced a thread which
can be found in the archives at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/wai-xtech/2002Sep/0043.html

Please direct follow-up to the wai-xtech@w3.org list.
