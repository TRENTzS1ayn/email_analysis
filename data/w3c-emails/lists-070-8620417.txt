attached mail follows:
I just read through the draft to get a feel for how hard it would be to change from
1.0, which we currently use as a standard for many of our sites.  While I am in
great sympathy with all of the checkpoints and I wish everyone could do them all, I
do honestly think it would be difficult to migrate.  I wish I had time to go
through it all thoroughly and give more detailed comments, and maybe I'll have time
to articulate more, but I do want to at least say that one thing that could make it
easier would be something along the lines of "If you currently meet WCAG 1.0, here
is what is needed to meet the minimum level of WCAG 2.0".  Something like the
checkpoint mapping, but cut down to cover WCAG 2.0 minimum level only.  That would
help me anyway!
