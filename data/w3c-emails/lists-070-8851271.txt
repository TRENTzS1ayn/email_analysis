guidelines"
This remains the goal, for without contributions from all-comers, our
ability to include is curtailed.

It would be an improvement if there were worked examples, as well as textual
descriptions, for instance see 3.4 below, in this way we begin to produce
guidelines that are accessible to people who don't choose the current style,
and may prefer cut and paste for instance.

more specific comments follow:

Overview of Design Principles
>>Someone who does not read well may want to hear the information read
aloud.

someone who cannot read well probably wants a precis, and an illustration.
publishers have known this for hundreds of years.
having the text read suits blind users, a different category.
(this is an example of the author-programmer assuming that what is most
easily doable is what is wanted.)

Guideline 1 - Perceivable.
>>except those aspects that cannot be expressed in words.

Could someone please expand on this? do we have an example? seems unlikely,
but what was the thought that went into this?
seems a confusing and unnecessary qualification.

Checkpoint 2.2
>>due to the nature of real-time events or competition.

following the golf buggy test case, this may be an unnecessary
qualification.
LDD + CD users need games that are adjusted to their abilities. In reality
the video games market has rapidly, over the past 10 years, moved towards a
situation where game skills are not an integral part of enjoyment.

rather we need to emphasise this aspect, ie that:
>> game skills are not an integral part of enjoyment.

however this is probably more properly part of a script techniques document,
and that is another story.....

Checkpoint 3.4 Provide consistent and predictable responses to user actions.
>>At the beginning of each link is an icon of an arrow with the text
equivalent, "Link will open in new window."

this seems to assume a text link. Could we have a working example? with a
graphic?
I've not been able to find a suitable way to do this for a graphic site....

This is a significant document, well done folks
