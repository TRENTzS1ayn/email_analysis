Is there an RDF techniques document? I think RDF could be extremely exciting
for accessibility. Remember that RDF does not have to be written by the
author, so that  crucial pages could become accessible by the work of care
givers or volunteers.

If we are interested in perusing this then I would volunteer to help draft a
page (preferably with some other people)
All the best,
