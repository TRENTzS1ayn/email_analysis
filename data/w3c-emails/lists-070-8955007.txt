Wendy raised the notion of "personas" in discusing the Usage Scenarios
today, in connection with Alan Cooper's _The Inmates Are Running the
Asylum_.  Another useful source for ideas about this topic is Brenda Laurel,
_Computers as Theatre_ (Addison Wesley, 1991).  Laurel works out a theory of
interface design based on drama; among other things, she argues that
interactivity has to do with the possibility of action by human or software
agents in a meaningful representational context.

It's a much more interesting book than that makes it sound...
