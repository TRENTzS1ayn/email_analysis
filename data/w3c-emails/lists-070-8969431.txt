Jukka,

Thank you for your thoughtful comments. I have attempted to address a few 
of them.

I have removed the link from the News section and left only the news item 
about our next telecon.

Both internal and public drafts are available to the public, but they serve 
different purposes.  The  public draft exists to solicit feedback from 
people who are not in the working group (i.e. "the public") as well as keep 
the public up-to-date with our current thinking.   Per W3C process, a 
public draft should be published every 3 months.  This is called a 
"heartbeat" requirement - every 3 months we make a bit of noise to draw 
people's attention to our most recent work.

The internal drafts should be published more often  and allow the working 
group to try out new ideas and to see changes in context.

People are able to comment on either, but we actively solicit feedback on 
the public drafts since they are more polished and stable.

I'm glad to hear you like our approach of fewer principles.  Could you 
please list which WCAG 1.0 principles are "homeless?"

Could you give your reasons for wanting to move 4.2 under 1.1?

If you look at the W3C process [1],  WCAG 2.0 has to go through Last Call, 
Candidate Recommendation and Proposed Recommendation before becoming a 
Recommendation (assuming that we progress through all stages of the 
process).  We expect that the technology-specifics will be available *well 
before* we go through Last Call, so before we even enter the second major 
stage of the process (the 1st stage is a public Working Draft. We have had 
3 of these already and expect to have at least one, possibly 2 more before 
Last Call).

The technology-specifics for WCAG 1.0 are not normative, nor will the 
technology-specifics for WCAG 2.0 be normative.  I'm concerned about your 
statement that the European parliament considers the techniques normative.

This is an interesting suggestion that we will have to consider.  I think 
you have identified an interesting issue, but we will have to consider the 
best approach to address it. Thank you for your proposal.

Another good observation.

People who try to implement WCAG 1.0 are often unable to determine if they 
have met the requirements.  Thus, we have set a goal for ourselves to write 
testable statements.  However, as you say, some important aspects of 
accessibilty that are not easily testable are not required in and of 
themselves, but a statement about them is required.  I agree that it is not 
clear that this increases the accessibility of content.  This has been a 
primary issue that the working group has struggled with and this is our 
best approach to balance all of the factors.  Do you have a specific 
suggestion for how we can provide clear guidance to authors?

Thank you,
