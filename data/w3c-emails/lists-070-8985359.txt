Hello,

At today's telecon we discussed possible dates and locations for future F2F 
meetings.  Here is the information I promised:

1. W3C All Group Meeting (a.k.a. the Technical Plenary). 3 - 7 March, Royal 
Sonesta Hotel, Cambridge, MA USA
2. Conference on "Technology and Persons with Disabilities" (a.k.a. CSUN). 
17-22 March, L.A., CA USA

Information from last year's technical plenary is available. [1]  One 
possibility is for a small group to attend the technical plenary and 
solicit feedback from other W3C groups then bring that feedback to a 
regular working group meeting that would occur after CSUN.

Another possibility is to have two meetings with different goals.  One 
could focus on technology-specifics (i.e., a working meeting similar to 
Linz) and the other could be regular meeting.

Please send your preference for date and venue to me, Gregg, and 
Jason.  Also, be sure to let us know if you support the idea of organizing 
two meetings (one at the plenary and one at csun).

Thank you,
--wendy
