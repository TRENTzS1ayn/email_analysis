Yes, that is what I am volunteering for, RDF techniques would involve
writing a vocabulary for accessibility through RDF.

Yes, the potential is as vast as the creativity and ingenuity of

Well, RDF is a very general standard, similar to XML. Consequently you
would first need to create suitable RDF vocabularies with which to
express whatever it is that you want to represent in metadata, then
the tools to process it.

Earl is expressed in RDF and we are planning to use it as one means by
which WCAG conformance claims can be made.
