PF are helping with this, and in the mean time, for the shear fun of it, I
am drafting RDF techniques for WCAG. It's objective -to contain generalized
techniques  to impliment most or all of WCAG 2.0 through RDF. It involves
going through each checkpoint / success criteria, and seeing how RDF could
be used to fulfill each requirement and building the supporting vocabulary.

Examples:  instead of adding and alt tag - having an RDF statement that
provides reference to the required extra information
This is especially useful for XML legacy languages which may not support alt
or long desc

Another example, a legacy page without header markup - add an rdf statement
similar to:  "this element is similar to a H1"

I also think it is the best way to address 4.1

I will let you all know when there is a nice draft up.

All the best,

Lisa Seeman

Or, more likely, multiple vocabularies. There is already one for SVG,
see

What kind of information would you wish to represent in RDF? Have
you formulated any requirements? Such development may not fall within
this working group's Charter, but if there is interest in pursuing it
further I am sure a suitable place can be found (perhaps in PF
initially, if not in WCAG). What we would need at the outset, I
suspect, is an indication of the requirements and of the level of
interest in working on the proposal. Specifically this means that the
nature of what the RDF schema are designed to accomplish and the kinds
of relationships to be represented therein, would need to be defined
at least to the point of making it possible to evaluate the proposal
and ascertain the kind of work that would be involved.
