I really like the "Examples" and "Benefits" sections. I 
also like the 5 categories. People who read this will 
gain a deeper understanding of what it means to author 
accessible pages.

I'm also looking forward to a techniques document that 
contains more practical markup advice.

Checkpoint 2.1: Ensure that all of the functionality of 
the content is operable through character input to the 
content or user agent

Benefits:
I would add physically disabled users that cannot use 
pointing devices or speech input. For example, users 
with ALS who use single switches to simulate keystrokes.
