No one seems capable of providing a short (xhtml) accessible 
((non-flash)) code sample* that allows a sound
to be played when the user initiates an event.

flash has provided this functionality for some years.

Many users need, and benefit from this, others prefer it, and not a few 
believe they are thus delivered to the bleading edge.

A few of you will see the many evils that advertisers will thereby 
promote and use.
Frankly, without it the gap between accessible code and multimedia can 
only widen.

*The following snippet could use any particular player, what is needed is one that plays whatever player is installed.
It only plays sound-on-event for windows media player 7 on a pc, whereas mozilla 2002092708, icab 2.8 for mac and ie5.2 for mac ONLY play the autostart sound (not surprisingly.)
