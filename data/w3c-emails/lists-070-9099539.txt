Is there a guideline regarding whether providers of 'current news items' should provide a static link? and then archive with a more permanent link?

Please could anyone comment, is this a sensible idea?

We are currently trying to link to a number of websites that provide current news.
Some (eg BBC) provide a single URI, and the content changes regularly.

others (eg Channel4) change the URI regularly, say for instance daily.
This makes it difficult to link, save in favourites etc

Both are linked from
http://www.peepo.com/alfy/news.html

I've hacked some fairly awful javascript which is intended to update the channel4 link, but what a hassle, at least their URI was 'readable'.

thanks

jonathan
