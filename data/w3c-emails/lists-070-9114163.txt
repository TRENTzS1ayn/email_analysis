Thursday, 10 October 2002 at 2000 UTC (4 PM US Eastern, 10 PM France,
6 AM Eastern Australia, etc.) on +1-617-761-6200, passcode 9224:

The objective of the meeting is to consider Ian Jacobs' comments on
the WCAG 2.0 working draft:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002OctDec/0020.html

In particular, his comments on terminology, conformance, normative
inclusions/exclusion and success criteria bear upon the structure of
WCAG and its conformance scheme; they therefore merit detailed
consideration. After that we can also examine his comments pertaining
to specific checkpoints and success criteria.
