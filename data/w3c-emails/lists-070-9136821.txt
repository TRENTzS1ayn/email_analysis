Hi,

I think this is way outside the scope of accessibility - it is a basic design
issue for the Web. And has been discussed as such. You could try looking at
http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues (where you might find some accessibility
issues arise - I haven't looked at that stuff for a while)

But basically yes, it makes sense to have a URI which is "the latest news"
and which points to things that change. But those things should also have a
URI that points to that article, and keeps pointing to it (although in some
cases you may well be asked to pay for the right to use that URI - producing
content doesn't necessarily happen for free, and copyright law is designed to
recognise that and allow people to get paid for their work if they so
choose).

Cheers

Chaals
