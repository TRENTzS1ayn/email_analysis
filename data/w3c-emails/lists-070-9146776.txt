Chaals,

We have been discussing for some while how accessibility is more than 
about individual pages but about the structure of the web.

For this reason, whilst this concept or guideline may be outside the 
current guidelines, it is important that these type of issues be 
discussed within the domain of accessibility, until a better division of 
responsibilities blooms.

Jonathan

people who need payment, can password protect their site,  alternatively 
they could change the link minute by minute using some sophisticated 
algorithm, this is a side issue.
