I agree that basic architecture considerations are important. But
Accessibility is only one aspect of W3C's work. There is indeed a group at
W3C that deals with these kind of issues - and in the accessibility work we
tend to say "use the rest of the W3C's work" rather than try to repeat that.

It is similar to the fact that we don't try to write markup languages to do
the things that HTML or MathML do - we just use the existing work done by the
reponsible groups (although the PFWG, when necessary, works with those groups
to ensure that their work doesn't get n the way of, and as much possible
actively supports and encourages, accessibility).

So in this case the group responsible is the Technical Architecture Group,
and I am told that their Architectural Principles Draft (available from the
Technical Reports page or at http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/ if you just want
to read it) includes exactly the principle you are looking for.
