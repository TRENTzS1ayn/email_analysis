No, P3P is a vocabulary for privacy. It would require writing a new
vocabulary - in essence repeating the work being done with EARL.

In order to make EARL a feasible approach, each checkpoint being conformned
to needs a URI.

This is not very difficult - and there are tools already doing this for WCAG
1.0 (AccessValet, Accverify, a bookmarklet from Jim Ley, among others).

It is possible to associate EARL information by several means - on the Web it
is possible to use annotations, or point to it from a page using the link
element, or to include it directly in some XML formats (not HTML unless you
write a customised schema for it, but in VoiceXML, SVG and SMIL it is
possible with the specifications as they are).

Hopefully by the end of this month I will be able to demonstrate a few simple
open-source tools for using EARL to do assessments. There is a project in
France which should make an open-source automated checking tool like Bobby
use EARL (this is what accessvalet already does, except that accessvalet
isn't free software - the maintenance vs adapatability trade-off is a topic
for somewhere else) in a few months.

I would seriously consider EARL, and getting some people who have real
expertise in it to talk to the working group before rejecting it or repeating
the work.

cheers
