Dear Wendy,

I am attaching some comments on WCAG 2.0 (put together by my colleague David
Poulson with also some input from myself) which I hope the working group
will be useful.  The WWAAC project is working on specific success criteria
and advisory recommendations for making the content understandable for
people with communication or cognitive impairments, and I hope we can give
you more input at a later date.

Best wishes from a very wet and windy Loughborough,
Colette

> 
>          2.  The priority structure of this WCAG 2.0 Working

> 
>          3.  If your site already uses WCAG 1.0, do you think

> There is also a "Requirements for WCAG 2.0" document on which you are
