I am suddenly getting more feedback on the vowels issue on a local level,
and we may even have some more interest form user agents offering support.
I would like to gain more consciences on a local level on what priority
level the success criteria should attain, and report back to the group.
Is this OK? Are there any objection to reopening the issue of priority level
for this success criteria?
What time frame do we have for resolving this issue?

All the best,

Lisa Seeman

Hi Collette,

there is a W3C policy that requests people do not send attachments in
formats
such as Word (since not everyone has access to software that can read it,
among other reasons) to mailing lists. More to the point, I don't have Word,
but am interested in your comments.

Would you be able to copy them and paste the text into a plain email, or
send
them as an HTML file or a pointer to where they are available on the Web?

Thanks

Charles McCN
