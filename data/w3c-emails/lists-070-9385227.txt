This is a good idea; the input might be quite valuable. Since the
issue was never closed, it therefore remains open.

How long do you think it will take to pursue your inquiries? After
that, we can bring the issue to a meeting and either resolve it, or
establish any further action items that might be needed. Members of
the W3C's internationalization working group may also wish to
contribute at some point (as Wendy noted at one of our meetings, they
have an interest in various aspects of the guidelines, with this issue
being one of them).

The absolute requirement is that all issues be resolved before we
proceed to last call. However, it would also be desirable to obtain
some implementation experience before then.

Thus if you have a preliminary indication of how long these valuable
inquiries will take, we can schedule further treatment of the issue at
an appropriate meeting thereafter. My suggestion would be that you
post your findings to the list once the inquiries are concluded, and
that the issue should then be placed on a meeting agenda.
