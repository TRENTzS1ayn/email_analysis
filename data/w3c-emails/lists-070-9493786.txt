Hello,

I'm not sure if it is the just moment to speak about, but i would want to 
propose a new Appendix to the WCAG 2.0, when will be ended.
The new Appendix could help, "step by step", the newbie on the WCAG.

We know that, following the checkpoints,  people can  test itself a 
document but, and here i believe to interpret the desire of a lot of 
persons, I know also a lot of person do not want to read all the pages of 
the WCAG.
They prefer to find  some swift diagrams to know how is the situation of 
the documents.

I got ready a small example,  a flow-chart like a tool, at URI: 
http://marciana.venezia.sbn.it/mauri/check-exemple.html

It is very simple, but swift; I think that  is very important the existence 
of a small tool *inside* the  WCAG 2.0 document.

Other similar ways,  in other documents, but maybe more bigger:
