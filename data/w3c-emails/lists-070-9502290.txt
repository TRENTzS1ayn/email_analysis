Hi Lisa,
Perhaps you could add under Vision a category of colour impairments.

Cheers,
Gian

Subject: questionnaire

I have written a short questioner for Peaple involved with web/disabilities 
in Israel to complete as a way to gather data needed to make the criteria


The idea is to translate the questionnaire to Hebrew and circulate it among 
the community. Before I translate it however I wanted to know if anyone 
feels that I have left out any important questions.

Please do not tell me any grammatical mistakes, they will be lost in the 
translation.
