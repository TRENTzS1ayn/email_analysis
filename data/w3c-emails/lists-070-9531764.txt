"You will have successfully met Checkpoint 1.2 at Level 2 if:
the site has a statement asserting that the audio description has been 
reviewed and it is believed to include all significant visual information 
in scenes, actions and events (that can't be perceived from the sound 
track) is provided to the extent possible given the constraints posed by 
the existing audio track (and constraints on freezing the audio/visual 
program to insert additional auditory description).

There seems to be a word(s) missing in at least this part of the sentence.

Sorry, I didn't get to review the rest of the document by the deadline today.
