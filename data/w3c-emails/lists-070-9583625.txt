It is important that as alternative web technologies develop, they are aware of accessibilty issues, and that we understand their possibilities.

Does anyone have a plan, or concept on how we could begin to draft such a project*?

Where are we to share, or pool our knowledge?

Are we prepared to discuss these issues within gl, or is ig the place for now?

case study
separating content and presentation, is fine if you consider that text is content, however for Matisse, were he alive, the web has very limited tools to demonstrate the use of colour.
on ig and www-style there is a (current) thread on why Mondrian might not be a happy with CSS.

thanks

Jonathan
