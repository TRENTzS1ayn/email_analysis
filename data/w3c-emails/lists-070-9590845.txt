Hello,

I am in the process of "retiring" our old issues list [1] by:
1. closing issues that have been resolved or are no longer relevant.
2. carrying forward open issues to ETA [2, 3]

As of this writing, there are still 5 issues marked as open because I am 
checking to see if they should carry forward or close.

Please go through the list of recently closed issues, i.e., everything that 
comes after issue #5 [4].  If you do not agree that an issue should be 
closed, please let me know.

Some issues were carried forward because a reviewer's note exists in the 
working draft.  I created an issue in ETA that is general: "Address 
reviewer's notes."  We might want to make individual issues for each of 
these, but this was a quick way to capture these for the moment.

Next, we will be updating ETA with issues recently raised on the list as 
well as fixing some minor errors in the linearized ETA output [3].

Note: many of the issues currently in ETA are techniques-specific and many 
of them are "to-dos" rather than issues that need discussion.  Feel free to 
volunteer to work on a "to do!"

Thanks,
--wendy
