Thursday, 24 October, 2000 UTC, +1-617-761-6200, passcode 9224:

1. Checkpoint 4.1 - a proposal by Avi, Lisa and Lee is expected to be
   circulated shortly.

2. Whether the normative and non-normative components of the
   guidelines should be separated, or whether the need for a
   "collapsed view" of just the guidelines, checkpoints and success
   criteria is adequately addressed by our checklist proposals. This
   is also an opportunity to discuss the number and types of checklist
   that we want to produce and the extent to which dynamic generation
   will be utilized.

3. Issue tracking, in particular whether there are any concerns
   related to the issues from the old list that Wendy has marked as
   closed, or any other questions that need to be discussed as to the
   management and processing of issues, including public comments.

4. Any other business.
