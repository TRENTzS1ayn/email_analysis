I was looking again at 5.1 and I am a bit confused. Are requiring that all
HTML passes the HTML validate for minimal conformance or level two?
I always go for valid HTML - but  - in my experience getting a page to be
valid is more work then the rest of WCAG put together -a lot of the errors
are trivial, but time consuming to repair.
do we want to do this?
Is there  a way to categories the type of error, like we have with other
checkpoints - say something like, were important content could be lost, or
the site layout confusing.
People may want to try putting their sites through html validate. - It can
be a bit of a shock, even pages after you have run tidy.
All the best ,
