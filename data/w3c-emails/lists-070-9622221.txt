Hi to all the group!

sorry for this post but i have the pleasure to let you see the new project
born by an idea of IWA/HWG International and Bazzmann.com:
www.webaccessibile.org

Inside this web site we will support the promotion of the accessibility for
the web professional in italian language becoming the sole full resource in
italian language. In this project are partecipating all the italian people
that are inside this group and other W3C Members like Fondazione Ugo Bordoni
(for the Ministry of Communication).

We hope that our initiative will take more knowledge about accessibility in
italian language helping the web professional to develop accessible web
sites and helping "newbies" and users to know more about WAI, W3C and laws.

Ciao!
