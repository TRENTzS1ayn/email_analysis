Hi Lisa,
i think is important to have a valid HTML/XHTML code for level 1 because, as
experience in our webprofessional association, a web professional MUST
create standard code for web sites.

This is a requrement that we ask to all our member and this will be a must
for the respect of WCAG 2.0, due the mission of W3C.

Also, i think that we need also to create a section in guidelines about the
"abuse" of the WAI Level 1,2,3 Claim... We need to set the possibility to
check and ask for logo removal for web sites that declares accessibility
level that is not reached because this could cause problems of "emulation".

What did the group think about
