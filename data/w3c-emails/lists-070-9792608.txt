Avi, Lisa, and Lee,

Thanks for the proposal.   I really like stating these as questions.  Just 
a couple quick comments before we start the telecon.

>1. Your site lists in metadata the cognitive skills or reading age that
>a user would need to understand the important content.

I want to point out the work going on in the Dublin Core Metadata 
Initiative Education group on labeling the audience of content.  Please 
refer to a working draft from 2000: 
http://dublincore.org/documents/education-namespace/

I am trying to figure out the current state of the DC-Education  proposal.

>4. Terms that should be familiar to the intended audience audience are
>favored over terms that are less likely to be understood.

>9. Disabled users within your audience are likely to understand any
>abbreviations or acronyms.

there is a level 2 success criteria under checkpoint, "Checkpoint 1.6 
Provide information needed for unambiguous decoding of the characters and 
words in the content." that reads, "abbreviations and acronyms are clearly 
identified where they occur." and it references checkpoint 
4.3.  "Checkpoint 4.3 Annotate complex, abbreviated, or unfamiliar 
information with summaries and definitions." which has a level 1 success 
criteria that says, "acronyms and abbreviations are defined the first time 
they appear."

Thus, a couple questions to answer:
1. is providing expansions for acronyms and abbreviations a level 1 or 
level 2 success criterion?
2. the difference between the two success criterion is that at level 2 we 
say "identify where they occur" while the level 1 says "defined the first 
time they appear."  (There is an open issue related to the definition of 
"first time" http://www.w3.org/2002/09/wcag20-issues#691)
3. Do we choose one checkpoint for this success criterion or are there 
really separate criteria?
4. Is there overlap between the checkpoints that we need to address or is 
this redundancy necessary?

Thanks,
--wendy
