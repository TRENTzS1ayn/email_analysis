Daylight Savings Time ended in some countries on Sunday, 27 October while 
it began in others.   W3C bases the teleconference schedule on Boston 
time.  The clocks in Boston "fell back" one hour today to UTC-5.  Thus, the 
time of our weekly telecon will change for some people.

An article about Daylight Savings Time observances around the world is at:

To check what time the conference is in your part of the world, use a time 
zone convertor such as this one:
