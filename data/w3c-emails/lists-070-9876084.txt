Gregg mentioned on the last phone call that:
 the most important thing in checkpoint 4.1 is that there be support for
user against that are being developed that will give simplified (or symbolic
?) renderings (unless I misunderstood - in which case ignore this email)

 I think support for these user agents includes using  unambiguous language.
(Bengt - is this right ?)

 In other words the following proposed requirements would now be merged into
a level one requirement:
 - Is the content unambiguous? (currently proposed at  level 2)
- Support for conversion into symbolic languages has been given (currently
proposed at  level 3)
-or a controlled language is used.  (currently proposed at  level 3)


perhaps by writing some version of:
" Is the content unambiguous
 ( by the use of either:
-unambiguous  text
- markup support
- or use of a publicly available controlled language)
"

Note  this could be done through mark up RDF.
But -
 then we should aim  to make some kind of mark up support at least at an
stable draft stage by the time WCAG 2.0 comes out.
Note: this is not so hard as we also read have an informal draft, but it
needs review and some work. Basically we would need to  ensure that the
draft is compatible with developing user agents and get the RDF scheme
checked over.  A bit of brainstorming with the Dublin Core grope would
probably also be required.

I need Gregg's and Bengt's conformation on this email that I have understood
this right.
Also my continuing apologies if I find it hard to communicate well on the
calls - they are well past my bed time

All the best,

Lisa Seeman
