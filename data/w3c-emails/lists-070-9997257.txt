I agree too... as i told also in my last post, i think that we need to put a
paragraph about the control of the validation logo. There is a rep inside
W3C that has the authority to ask logo removal for not correct exposition in
web sites? I think that, for example, if we let to put A, AA, AAA to web
sites that are not conforming to the guidelines some developers could take
these web sites as example (a good example for them but a wrong application
of guidelines).

What do you think about?
