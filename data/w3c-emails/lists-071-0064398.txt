The content should be available without the use of CSS. (By the way, this is
a test of whether the seperation of content from its presentation is
reflected in the technical modelling...)

A XAG-compliant XML format has a default stylesheet (as does XHTML). Perhaps
what we mean is that the default styling, for any medium, should be
sufficient to "read" the content - rather than saying this only applies to
HTML, which as Joe pointed out is very different to XML in regards to
stylesheets.
