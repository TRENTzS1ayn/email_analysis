Thanks, Jason (and Gregg)!

I'll accept either "at least one of these technologies" or "one or more
of these technologies" as a friendly amendment.  "One or more" is
probably better.  But then another question arises: is there some upper
limit? If a given user has *none* of the technologies on the list, do we
still require that he or she be able to access and use the resource?
That, I think, would make a mockery of this criterion (which may be an
argument in favor of eliminating it altogether).

With thanks to John and Cynthia for completing this action item so
expeditiously, my comments appear below.

I agree with Gregg: this is better than the original wording, putting
aside the question of whether checkpoint 4.2 should be included in the
guidelines at all, which I acknowledge remains an open issue.

I assume you intend "some" in the above proposal to mean "at least one".
Is this potentially ambiguous? Should it be clarified, for example by
saying "at least one of these technologies" or "one or more of these
technologies"?

Whoever interprets "some" as meaning "more than one" will argue that
content for which there is only one such technology, i.e., a technology
the non-availability of which does not cause the content to become
inoperable, doesn't meet the success criterion.
