I also looked to see if there were any items in the Techniques document
that I thought should be repositioned as Best Practices.  

 

The action item as I understand it was to review the best practices and
the techniques document to discern if there were Techniques that would
be better in Best Practices and Vice Versa and to discuss with Michael
if we agree with the current way Best Practices and Techniques are
handled. I kind of sensed a gasp on the conference call when I said
everything is OK concerning the best practices vs. techniques (as if it
is unbelievable that we could have got this aspect of the documents
right the first time). 

 

If the action item was different than above, feel free to let me know.
I'll try go back to try to find something wrong with the current
documents.  :-)

 

Cheers
