Cross-technology seems to be more suitable to what we are trying to say
in the core techniques.  My vote is for cross-technology techniques.

I think that cross-technology is better because they will show up on all
the technology specific checklists -- and this suggests that.

Also, it is not clear that general guidelines have to be used with
something else.
