I realize that General and Cross-Technology were discussed at
the most recent audio conference as terms to replace the existing
term - Core.  I do not have a better term in mind but thought we were to
have gone away and come up with other possibilities.  

Seeing as how we are into actual selection, I prefer 
Cross-Technology Techniques.

Cross-technology seems to be more suitable to what we are trying to say
in the core techniques. My vote is for cross-technology techniques.

I think that cross-technology is better because they will show up on all
the technology specific checklists -- and this suggests that.
 
Also, it is not clear that general guidelines have to be used with
something else.
