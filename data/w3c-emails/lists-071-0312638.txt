Some content can never be separated from CSS because it never 
involves CSS. Multimedia is an example.

Some standards-compliant methods of displaying images purely using 
CSS would be disallowed by a surface reading of the paragraph quoted

Anyone care to explain that, using as few acronyms as possible?
