The guidelines for creating an accessible markup language specify that
created languages should have a default style sheet.  HTML is an 
example;
when we say "can be read without style sheets", we really mean that
they can be read with the default style sheet, such as the one included
in the HTML 4.01 specification.  (It's also incorporated into XHTML's
definition, therefore.)

For example, "without styling" would mean that strong text wouldn't
show up as bold in a visual browser.  It would mean that headings and
text would flow together and be indistinguishable.

So obviously the requirement "without styles" is broken, because all
use of HTML or XHTML requires that some style sheet be applied -- even
if it is the default style sheet of the browser, which parallels that of
the HTML 4.01 default style sheet.
