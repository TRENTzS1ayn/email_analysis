Well, yeah.  But WCAG 1.0 has always had problems with CSS.

When the first drafts were produced, they DID require CSS, or at least 
they
recommended it for every single thing under the sun, nearly.  This was,
in my opinion then (and still now, based on history) premature and 
would have
blocked the adoption of WCAG 1.0.  Simply put, way back then there was 
no
support (in browsers, in development tools, in the developer community) 
for
CSS.

Thus WCAG 1.0, in final form, was forced to back off from a mandate for 
CSS.

However, as this is literally a different millennium, times have 
changed and
there _is_ widespread support for CSS.  The original WCAG drafts weren't
wrong -- just premature.

This is a correct statement.

Meyer's statement is a correct statement.

Why do you say "no"?

The two statements, in my opinion, seem to be saying the same thing.

Don't make me quote _Teach Yourself CSS in 24 Hours_ to you. ;)
