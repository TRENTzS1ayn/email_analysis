This looks to me much more like trying to develop policy than any technical
explanation of twhat is required for streamed media to be accessible.

Internet radio is not accesible to Deaf people unless it has captions or
signed captions. Whether it should be or not isn't something that the WCAG
group should be dabbling in. WAI doesn't invalidate anything - it just lays
out the technical information required so that people can make sensible
decisions of fact (is Internet radio accessible as is?) and based on those
they can make policy decisions (should internet radio reqiure captions?
SHould all movies always require audio description? Starting tomorrow?)

My interest in this group is in writing techniques. Providing techniques for
captioning internet radio streams is one thing, but working on techniques for
deciding when they become mandatory is something that is best decided by
policy makers, and something that will be decided differently in different
areas.

Grace periods and exemptions to allow people to conform are not what the WCAG
group is about - and they seem to be closely predicated on the application of
WCAG to North America - or are you arguing that a grace period of about 2
years would be appropriate for Vietnamese-produced net-TV and educational
video supplied in English/French/Bislama over the internet by the government
of Vanuatu?
