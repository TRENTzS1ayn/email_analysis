Examples found in real-world sites, please? (Examples *plural*.)

Nobody has been able to provide real-world counterexamples.

He's only the world's leading independent authority (i.e., non-W3C 
authority) on cascading stylesheets, having written two books. I'll 
forward the message and see what he has to say.

>I don't work for WAI, I don't speak for WAI, I don't represent WAI.

Yeah, we know, despite Charles's return address being charles@w3.org 
(check the original message headers). Something about Fundaci?n 
Sidar. We know that.

I agree in principle, but it will be difficult for WAI, as opposed to 
some other group at W3C, to impose semantically-correct Web authoring 
rather than syntactically-correct authoring (e.g., <h1> vs. 
<p><strong><big>).

Anyone care to explain that?

>And just to remind Joe, who seems to identify me with WAI,

Uh, no. Whenever possible, when a contributor to this esteemed list 
makes a statement that WAI (read well: WAI) is apt to simply accept 
and run with, I admonish WAI (nota bene: WAI) not to do so. In those 
cases, I respond to an author's remarks *to* the list and *to* WAI.

>I do not work for WAI, I do not speak for WAI, I do not represent WAI.

Yeah, we know.

>My participation in WAI activities is exactly the same as Joe's - as

I don't merely claim to have "some knowledge," I actually do.
