Summary:

Policy decisions are, I believe, outside the scope and the competence of
WCAG - we need to make it possible to use WCAG in policy-making, but should
not be trying to create off-the-shelf policy. This means we should expect
people to profile WCAG and require subsets, so we should be clear about who
each requirement is serving (who will miss out if that requirement is not in
a given policy for immediate application). Not much else that is new - just
responding to some of Joe's questions.

(I've made the policy argument before too. If you've been reading this list
for three years this message might not be interesting).

Well, technically correct, but beside the point. Is there a shorter term than
"a sign language equivalent to captions"?

The point of my strawman is that in participating in WCAG I am not proposing
to require all online audio feeds to be accessible. I am helping to outline
the features that Web Content which is accessible actually have. Proposing
requirements taken into account in a given design brief is something that the
commissioning organisation should do, subject to the principles and laws of
the environment they work in.

Huh? I would indeed countenance somebody fixing the problem. I won't
countenance participating in work where we say "oh, we can fix it by
declaring that despite clear contrary evidence it isn't a problem".

And I don't believe WAI, the WCAG group, nor even W3C as a whole, has the
ability, nor the responsibility, to fix it. WCAG can describe the problem,
and what the technical requirements are to fix it.  The actual costs, and
whether they are reasonable or not, is something that varies from country to
country and case to case - and is outside the scope of this working group as
I understand it.

No, it seemed obvious enough to me. Things are not forbidden if they are not
required to meet WCAG conformance.

Ah. You seem to confuse WCAG conformance with meeting legal requirements in
North America. In order to conform to WCAG, there are certain things you need
to do which hopefully amount to making your site accessible. With different
levels, there are sets of requirements for making your site "barely
accessible", "reasonably accessible" and "very accessible" - my personal
interpretation of the intent of levels A, double-A and triple-A.

When somebody should meet the requirements of WCAG, whether the cost is
reasonable or not, and such considerations, seem to me outside the scope of
the working group. If internet radio without captions is inaccessible in two
years, it is because it is inaccessible now. (In fact the one thing that
might change that is technology development, which complicates our
predictions).

I agree with the above. I just believe that the policy bit of it needs to be
done in areas where policy is made.

[the new bit (well, new-ish)]

Yes. In explaining how to work WCAG into policy this group should be working
with the Education and Outreach Group on the importance of being able to
make profiles of WCAG to deal with implementation details like unreasonable
burdens, and on the importance of the guidelines themselves making it clear
who is not getting accessibility if a particular requirement is not met. Then
the policy makers can weigh up their situation and make better-informed
decisions, which balance the needs of "consumers" and the needs of
"developers".

Canada and the United States, collectively, are an edge case - just a larger
one than my choices (I should have put a comma after Net-TV to seperate the
two examples more clearly).

Do you consider that WCAG defining a two year period (from the publication of
WCAG or from today?) would be appropriate for the expected 25-state European
Union, Mexico, Russia, Australia, South America, and those African states
that produce audiovisual Web content, or just for your local edge case?

This is the real question. If you do, then I simply disagree, but we can
leave it to the group to decide.

Otherwise, my suggestion is that we recommend that particular aspect of the
question be answered by people better-placed to weigh the additional factors
required, by describing what is required (in terms of features Web content
needs) to really fix the problem, and being clear that this description is
not a complete ready-made off the shelf piece of policy for an organisation,
government, local soccer club, etc.
