"Au contraire, mon ami". Actually I think that WCAG is one of the groups
which is relatively successful in getting people to use semantically-correct
code, and not just syntactically correct code. In terms of authoring I
actually think that the Authoring Tools group has more impact, but they rely
on WCAG for a lot of basic specification.

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) has a default style sheet to ensure that all
valid SVG produces some image even when no presentation information has been
given. The default stylsheet provides a silhouette - which is generally not
useful.

OK, I hadn't understood that before. (It seems you should admonish the WCAG
group actually, but that's a detail one might miss when working in the
group).

I work for W3C. WAI is a part of W3C. All people who work for IBM's
accessibility unit work for IBM. People who work for IBM generally don't work
for, nor represent, IBM's accessibility unit.
