Hello Joe, Charles and others

** Examples **

Here are some examples of documents that differ when rendered without a
style sheet (or with a browser's default style sheet).  I hope that this
helps to clarify the discussion.

Alis Technologies, Inc.
    http://www.alis.com/en/index.html
Drop down lists don't correspond anymore.  eg "Languages" is no longer
associated with the languages choices.

Autonomy, Incorporated
    http://www.autonomy.com/
A large amount of additional text information appears in the non-CSS
version.  This actually seems to be a good thing, in this case.

Avaya Communications
    http://www.avaya.com/
Drop down lists don't correspond at third level.  Eg "Avaya Global Services"
is no longer related to the list of Avanya Global Services.
    
BEA Systems, Inc.
    http://www.beasys.com/framework.jsp?CNT=homepage_main.jsp&FP=/content
Drop down list: all list items are repeated, and are turned into text.
    
BitFlash Graphics, Inc.
    http://www.bitflash.com/
Additional text at the end of the page.  Looks like a menu list.

Bowstreet
    http://www.bowstreet.com/
Additional text at the end of the page.  Looks like a menu list.

** Methodology **

Examples are drawn from the A's and B's of the W3C member's list.
    http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List

I displayed each example in Safari (with style sheet enabled) and in
Internet Explorer (with style sheet turned off).  I noted where there was a
semantic difference between the two.

At the same time as sending this e-mail, I sent a note to the Web master of
each example to let them know about this debate.  They may gain from the
discussion (and it seemed like the polite thing to do).
