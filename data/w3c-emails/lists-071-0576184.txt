This is valuable and, indeed, surprising information. Now, could we 
run the same test on the tiny number of W3C members with valid-HTML 
homepages?

If we see the same effects there-- and let's assume valid CSS, which 
is even less prevalent than valid HTML-- then we've certainly got 
something to talk about. Now, whether we have something to *regulate* 
in WCAG 2.0 is a separate question.
