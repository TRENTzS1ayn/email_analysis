Hi,

Question: the NFB put together a list of guidelines for the web, and one 
of them seems quite pertinent;  I know that we have run into it in 
several ways, and it's definitely disorienting for a vision-impaired 
user.  I am wondering where similar language is found in the current 
WCAG 2.0 draft, if at all.  If it's not there, does anyone have any 
thoughts on the requirement?

"Ensure that menus and other navigation controls can be operated without 
causing form submission or screen changes."  For us, there has to at 
least be some warning to the user, or there has to be some kind of user 
action required before form submission or screen change.

I tried to find this under Guideline 2 somewhere, but maybe it's too 
late at night for that?  <smile>

Thanks for any guidance/thoughts,

-kerstin
