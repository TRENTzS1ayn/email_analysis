Good... this is the best thing

Yes... some countries like Italy will work for make "zipped" version of the
WCAG.
Referring also to the ISO about accessibility, i think that we must to
evalutate well the "core" points to make them all testable so the countries
could start with the full receipt of the "core" guidelines.

One thing is: how a webdesigner can assure that the page visible for eg. in
www.xxxxxxxx.com has not changed since the validation? I've thinked about a
procedure like the "checksum" that is done for the validation of files: a
web generated page is always HTML/XHTML so apply a checksum to this page
could give the real "photo" of the page and let the user to check (with a
checksum validator) is something has been changed.

What you think about?
