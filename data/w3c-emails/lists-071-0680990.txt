Potentially. Let's think about it further, particularly the
implications for standardization.

Yes. In other words you have to scope your claim appropriately, and
there might be some restrictions on the use of icons in circumstances
where they are liable to mislead readers into the erroneous conclusion
that the whole site conforms. I also agree that one couldn't make a
blanket claim that "this web site conforms to WCAG 2.0 at the minimum
level" unless the whole site actually conforms, as is currently true
of WCAG 1.0.

It needs further thought, yes.

This proposal would be implemented in policy as follows:

All content meeting conditions xyz would have to conform to WCAG 2.0
at some level (whether at the minimum level of some other level above
the minimum).

Content not satisfying conditions xyz would not be required to meet
WCAG 2.0 at all, i.e., it would be scoped out of the policy
requirement. In effect this is what all policies that I am aware of
effectively do (I am not aware of any government which has mandated
that all Web content within its jurisdiction must conform to WCAG 2.0;
usually the policy is qualified, e.g., all government-produced
content, or all content in education, associated with the provision of
goods or services, etc.). It would be perfectly possible to exempt
certain types of content as well, based on other criteria, and to
state this in a policy exception. The net impact would be that either
content is required to conform to WCAG 2.0 at the minimum level, or it
isn't required to conform at all, with no middle ground, that is, no
subset of the minimum created.
