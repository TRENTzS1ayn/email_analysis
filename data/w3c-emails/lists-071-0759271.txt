Gregg/John/Loretta/Wendy:

Thanks for the responses - I think Loretta was right, John was right, 
too, and then Gregg found the issue addressed in Checkpoint 3.4 
(predictable). The issue was indeed drop-down lists (or other controls) 
that fire selections when users walk through, or arrow down/up, those 
selections, instead of only firing the event (selection) when the user 
has explicitly finished choosing.  I think there are still ways of 
scripting such lists where the ALT ARROW DOWN does not work in all 
cases, and those cases (I believe) should be discouraged.  From reading 
3.4, I think the issue is addressed by telling users to at least let the 
user know when content/context is going to change.  Thanks, Gregg.

Cheers,
-Kerstin
