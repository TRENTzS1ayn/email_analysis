Regarding Phill's issue discussed in today's teleconference:

8: flicker (eliminated by WCAG 2.0 reorganization?)
http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/issuereports/wcag2_issues.php#8

This issue is not closed by the new reorganization. These comments were
made on the 8/2002 draft and proposed that the minimum and Level 2 success
criteria for checkpoint 2.3 (Avoid causing the screen to flicker) should be
moved to level 3. In the 6/2003 draft, the previous Level 2 success
criteria have been moved to Best Practice so that part of the issue is
resolved. But the previous minimum success criteria are now the required
success criteria so this part of the issue is still open unless we are
confident that this is a testable success criteria.
