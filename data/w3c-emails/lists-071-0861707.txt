Hi,

Since we've been using Bugzilla to track issues, I've received a number of
questions regarding how to use the system.

I've drafted a WCAG Bugzilla User's Guide [1] that addresses some of these
questions and describes in greater detail how we are utilizing Bugzilla for
issue tracking. 

In addition to some basic information about how Bugzilla works, the draft
includes specifics about commenting on issues, submitting new issues and
contributing to the maintenance of the data.

If you haven't already, please feel free to create an account [2], review
the users guide and experiment with the system. Then, let me know if you
have additional questions, ideas, comments or concerns about how it all
works.

Thanks,

-Ben
