No, I am not saying anything about WCAG 1.0 or about lack of
experience of the problem. To the contrary, the problems with flicker
have been known for a very long time. However there are patterns not
involving flicker that also cause seizures, and the exact tests for
these are, as I understand it, still in need of clarification.
