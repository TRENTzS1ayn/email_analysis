I think this is a bad approach - the submit input is specifically designed so
even simple systems know what to do with it.

This seems the interactive equivalent of using a font tag to specify a
heading, because a few browsers had a bad way of handling heading elements.

I agree that there is a general problem here, because usability for some is
compromising other people's ability to rely on their systems. It is a
software issue, and it is to some extent addressed in UAAG.

If JAWS really does this I think that is a grave mistake in their interface
programming (or in the discussions of it they have had with browser makers,
who admittedly they don't control).

my 2 cents worth
