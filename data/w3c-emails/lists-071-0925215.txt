What I don't understand why it is desirable to have the Submit event
fire when they ENTER key is pressed even if the SUBMIT button does not
have focus. The SUBMIT button could even be off the screen, yet pressing
the ENTER key causes an action to occur. Accidentally submitting a form
is an error that I have observed quite often, and not only with JAWS
users.

I think this is a bad approach - the submit input is specifically
designed so even simple systems know what to do with it.

This seems the interactive equivalent of using a font tag to specify a
heading, because a few browsers had a bad way of handling heading
elements.

I agree that there is a general problem here, because usability for some
is compromising other people's ability to rely on their systems. It is a
software issue, and it is to some extent addressed in UAAG.

If JAWS really does this I think that is a grave mistake in their
interface programming (or in the discussions of it they have had with
browser makers, who admittedly they don't control).

my 2 cents worth
