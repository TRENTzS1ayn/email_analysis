Hi all,

Gregg and I have been working on an updated guidelines document that
attempts to pull together some ideas, proposals and decisions from the past
couple months. It provides a series of views that will hopefully help us in
discussions regarding the organization of the document.

An introduction to the changes we've made, followed by a more detailed
changelog is available for review at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2003/09/reorg4/reorg4.html.
