(Thank you, John)

Well, although almost everyone subscribed to this list is an Accessibility
protectionist, I'm really struck by this article -- this can't be true. Is
this a job-creation measure, or a method to punish either unaware or
unexperienced site producers/owners? Is it something else, e.g. a technology blockade by
declining everything not 100% accessible (okay, chuck away Flash)?

I don't think Accessibility or Discoverability matters should be a
duty-by-law, but a kind of altruistic (I don't do it for me, I do it for other people)
option and a self-imposed duty related to the thought there are people who
are not that competent to make content accessible for everyone (right now).
And remember, when you created your first Web page, did you think about (color)
blind people or other disabled Web users? I didn't, sorry (so I'm glad to
see I'm not in prison right now).

Last but not least, I think W3C's way is best -- to (strongly) recommend
Accessibility to all Web site owners or content providers, alluding to all
people who cannot handle blinking screens with grey-on-black text and who want to
know what 150k image adorns the upper part 'above the fold'.


Don't get me wrong,
 Jens.


PS.
This is one of the topics I definitely don't need before having had
breakfast.
