Hey Folks
The WCAG theme song is set to become a worldwide hit - well sort of.
ACB Radio in the UK features blind broadcasters in eight countries,
broadcasting to a world wide audience in over 70 countries. People listen to
ACB Radio using free software on their computer. http://www.acbradio.org 
I sent them a link to the WCAG theme and they wrote back.
"Hi David, We love it!  With your permission we would very much like to add
it to the ACB Radio Cafe rotation?"
So we have a new marketing technique for the WCAG Guidelines! 
The MP3 song is for download at:

Hi guys,

This sounds great to me. Probably a good idea to move the focus to
implementation testing and draw out the rest in that context.

Let me know what I can do to help,

-Ben
