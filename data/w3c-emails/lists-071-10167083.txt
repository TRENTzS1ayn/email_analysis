1.  View 3 and 4 appear to be the same contentwise.  Am I missing something?
2. Table of Contents for  all views is the same. 
In fact the TOC itself is a listing of guidelines and checkpoints. Is that  necessary? The text of the guideline and checkpoints  may be dropped from TOC.
The TOC could be:
Core checkpoints for guideline 1
Extended checkpoints for guideline 1
Core checkpoints for guideline 2
Extended checkpoints for guideline 2
...
...
Appendices

3. There can be a link to list of checkpoints presented   
by guideline and  by core/extended.
4. Will the Introduction  not be a part of these views?
5. Words like perceivable, operable, etc should be links when used  in the body for the first time.
