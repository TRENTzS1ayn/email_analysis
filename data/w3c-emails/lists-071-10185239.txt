Hi,
in the italian webaccessibile discussion list
(http://itlists.org/mailman/listinfo/webaccessibile) web developers are
discussing about a proposal of a "standardization" for the access key.

Most of them agree that is best to use number instead of letters,
starting from zero.

There are some techniques about a "map" for the accesskey?

eg:

0 - Home Page
1 - Access Key page
2 - Site Map
3 - Contact e-Mail ...

At the page:

http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/forms/accesskey.html#assign

there is another example that is the same definition used by the U.K.
Guidelines for accesskey in public web sites.

So... what suggest the WCAG Working Group?
