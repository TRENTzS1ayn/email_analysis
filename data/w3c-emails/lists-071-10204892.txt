Hello all,

We did not have an opportunity to discuss this during today's telecon, but 
we need to know who is interested in attending a WCAG WG face-to-face in or 
around Tokyo on 21 and 22 November.  We are still working to find a host 
but need to make some sort of announcement tomorrow because of the 8 week 
deadline in the W3C process document.

Please complete and send the following two sentences.  Send this in a 
private email to me.
1. I [do/do not] support having a WCAG WG meeting in Japan 21 and 22 November.
2. I [am/am not] likely to attend a WCAG WG meeting in Japan in November.

Thank you,
--wendy
