What do you mean? We (the ones Roberto mentioned, here in little Italy...
:-) suggest using numbers for accesskey. Far Eastern languages already use
numbers? This wolud be okay. Or do they use number for shortcut software
menu? This would be a problem.

The problem with accesskey is that it the alphabetic values create conflict
with browsers or user agents' shortcut. So we need to suggest neutral
(numeric?) chars for use, better if with some standardization. No
accessibility feature should have implementation problem in the real world
if we want somebody to use them.
