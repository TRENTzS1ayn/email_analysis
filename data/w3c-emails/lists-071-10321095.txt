To second what Tom is saying - in my view the problem with access keys
conflicting with browser accelerator keys is a user agent problem. The
problem is that the same modifer key is used to activate keys that are in
separate "namespaces", the browser namespace and the document namespace. The
solution is to use a different accelerator key for the access keys defined
in HTML, then the entire set of keys is available. I believe Opera does
handle access keys in this way and we're just waiting for other browsers to
catch up. The issue of discoverability remains but is a separate issue.
While we need to log user agent issues with our techniques, I think we
should avoid coming up with recommendations that will hopefully become
invalid at some time in the near future. Michael
