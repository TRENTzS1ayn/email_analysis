That's was one of the reasons why Plone implemented a proper access key
translation scheme. I think someone did point out though that Asian
users might use the number keys for language functions, that really
needs investigating properly.

I  agree  the application of the number in accesskey simply because:

- the numbers are known to universal level
- the numbers do not depend on the language (e.g.:H=Hepl in English, but
in 
Italian  is A=Aiuto, etc.)
- the numbers do not interfere with eventual keys it fix to you from the

system or the programs
- the numbers are only 10, and this simplifies the application and the 
understanding of the accesskeys
- from 0 to 9 it can be one hierarchical scale.
