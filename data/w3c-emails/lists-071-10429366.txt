As I said in my first message, the statement above is not valid.  Many far
eastern languages use numbers for shortcuts on the menu due to the
complexity of the language.  A single keystroke does not map to a single
character.

I'm researching it currently, but I believe that ALT+1 is used as a shortcut
in some far eastern languages for either the File or Help menus.

I  agree  the application of the number in accesskey simply because:

- the numbers are known to universal level
- the numbers do not depend on the language (e.g.:H=Hepl in English, but in 
Italian  is A=Aiuto, etc.)
- the numbers do not interfere with eventual keys it fix to you from the 
system or the programs
- the numbers are only 10, and this simplifies the application and the 
understanding of the accesskeys
- from 0 to 9 it can be one hierarchical scale.
