The other problem with numbers is that at least one is used by a screen
reader: IBM Homepage Reader uses the numeral 1 to begin  reading in
heading mode.  See: http://wats.ca/resources/accesskeys/19, which
specifies that the only 'free' ascii keys are:
AccessKey / (slash) 
AccessKey (backslash) 
AccessKey ] (right square bracket) 
Note: "At that point it was then pointed out (by Jukka "Yucca" Korpela -
a well respected accessibility expert) that even these keys would be
inaccessible to users not using a North American Standard (QWERTY)
keyboard"

As I said in my first message, the statement above is not valid.  Many
far
eastern languages use numbers for shortcuts on the menu due to the
complexity of the language.  A single keystroke does not map to a single
character.

I'm researching it currently, but I believe that ALT+1 is used as a
shortcut
in some far eastern languages for either the File or Help menus.

I  agree  the application of the number in accesskey simply because:

- the numbers are known to universal level
- the numbers do not depend on the language (e.g.:H=Hepl in English, but
in 
Italian  is A=Aiuto, etc.)
- the numbers do not interfere with eventual keys it fix to you from the

system or the programs
- the numbers are only 10, and this simplifies the application and the 
understanding of the accesskeys
- from 0 to 9 it can be one hierarchical scale.
