Andy,

Please can you tell us a little more about your project.
Could you provide a little more detail on what you intend to cover at 
the workshop?

Are you considering the benefits that SVG would offer?
We are developing a set of SVG symbols for use by people with learning 
difficulties on the internet.
Be sure to visit the a-z site as many popular topics, and further 
symbols are listed there.
They are not intended to be exclusive, and contributions and comments 
are sought.
whilst copyright, they are royalty free for use on the internet, and 
hence perhaps not proprietary.

Is there an intention to provide translations in other languages?

thanks

Jonathan Chetwynd
