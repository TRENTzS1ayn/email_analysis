OK. I know this isn't the case with Japanese, which is about the only asian
language keyboard I am used to.

But even closer to home a number of European keyboard layouts (the French
AZERTY and its relatives) require the shift key to get to numbers.

The short answer is that it seems every key is used by some technology (or
isn't available - how many people know which key is the arabic 'alif' (their
letter a)?

Browsers need to get first call on the function of a key they use, since the
user will normally learn the browser before the page, and will want
consistent control of their browser. So the browser may need to re-map the
key that it allows to activate something which has been given an access key.
This can be through a "pass-through" key (like Opera and some screenreaders
do), or a modifier (alt+ctrl like Amaya uses, or alt like Windows Internet
Explorer) that gets to a key combination not used by the browser (actually
Amaya doesn't get this right either), or by not reserving characters,
allowing just the key itself (like iCab does).

If it changes the activation letter (for example remap 'a' to alif on an
arabic keyboard, or to 'shad' which is the letter on the key that is 'a' on
a qwerty keyboard) the browser needs to tell the user. Since this means the
page author can't predict what will be the actual activation method, the
browser needs to tell the user for all accesskeys that are declared -
something like what iCab does is one possibility.
