Hello Loretta/Doyle,
I am just not sure what  the Make Accessible feature really does. I am a JAWS user and a PDF file is as usable or unusable as  it was before I run the Make Accessible feature on it. I'll be glad if you can enlighten me on this.
Thanks,
Sailesh

  Doyle,
    The Make Accessible command is now available in Acrobat Pro 6.0 for the Mac 
  as well as for Windows.
