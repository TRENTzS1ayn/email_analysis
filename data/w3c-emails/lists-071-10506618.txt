Sailesh,
  Make Accessible is a command that attempts to analyze an untagged
PDF file and infer logical structure from the marks on the page. This
would be used by an author who is trying to repair accessibility problems
in an existing PDF file. The best analogy is that it is doing OCR on
the logical strucure. Like OCR technology, it is imperfect, and the
results should be reviewed and corrected, if necessary, by the author.
  In Acrobat 5, this command was only available on Windows. In Acrobat 6, 
it is available for both Mac and Windows.
  When the Adobe Reader 6.0 is presenting an untagged PDF file to assistive
technology, it automatically runs MakeAccessible internally to infer
logical structure. This can make loading an untagged PDF considerably slower
than loading a tagged PDF, but makes it possible, for example, to 
read tables even in an untagged PDF.
