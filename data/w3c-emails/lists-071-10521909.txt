All,

Re the idea to write WCAG 2.0 in a controlled language to make the
document easier to understand (for non-native and native English
speakers alike!) and to translate ...

The VOA Special English Word Book (public domain) is posted at
http://www.voaspecialenglish.com. There's a link in the left column,
under About Us.

(Background: the source code was created in lord-knows-what format for a
printed version, then copied-and-pasted from an orphan Zip-type system,
then I had to reformat it line by line for our site.)

Since it's intended for international broadcasting, the list of 1500
words skews somewhat toward news and science terms. It would need a
supplemental dictionary, specific to Web design, of what the AECMA
Simplified English standard (used for aircraft maintenance documents)
calls "technical names" and "technical verbs."
