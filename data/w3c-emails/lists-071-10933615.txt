One topic is always engaging me, and that's the entire Usability /
Accessibility complex, where I really often refer to something very important, which
seems quite often to be forgotten -- alleging that when something is not
usable, it ain't accessible, either (certainly there are other people testifying
the same, but I don't know anyone of them).

If I rely on this conclusion and if I also allege that Usability is no topic
about which you can never simply write a technical paper about (only take
these entire Usability engineering and testing processes and the fact that you
cannot create a 100% usable Web site, which sufficiently illustrates the
character of this topic; maybe you agree), I can only reason that this is at
least something which should appear on the WAI site.

I hope you see the point, and I hope you're aware of the crux that there
might be Web sites which are accessible (and thus fulfilling maybe all the
elaborate issues recommended by the WG), but whose unsatisfactory Usability
destroys all the effect... and I again think that this is worth being written down
anywhere in all the documents related to Web Accessibility, nonetheless
coming to the initiative's defence, to prevent all the reputation being undermined
by this missing note.


Only some thoughts again,
 Jens.


PS. Maybe the W3C could support a nice completion of the WAI efforts by
publishing the most popular conventions related to Web Usability; but I hope it
will never create a UWG -- it just won't do.
