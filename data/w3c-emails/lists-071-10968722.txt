Gregg said on this afternoon's joint call with ATAG that "Write clearly"
isn't testable.  I beg to differ. Clarity isn't *machine-testable.(
However, it *is* possible to achieve a high degree of inter-rater
reliability for written work.  In the US, the Educational Testing
Service (ETS) trains teams of people to score high-stakes examinations
that can determine whether students are or are not admitted to
university.  These evaluators read and score student essays, and achieve
enough inter-rater reliability for their results to be accepted by many
coleges and universities.  Teachers using the Learning Record (a
portfolio-based learning assessment tool) achieve inter-rater
reliability ratings of 89% last time I heard the statistics.  
 
The key is in Gregg's phrase about raters "who know what they're talking
about."  I would argue that it's possible to train people to read Web
content and make informed judgments about its clarity.
