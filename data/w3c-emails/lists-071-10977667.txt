The Timed Text Working Group invites your working group(s) to comment on 
the 2nd public draft of "Timed Text (TT) Authoring Format 1.0 Use Cases 
and Requirements" [1]. We expect to accept and process comments that we 
receive on or before Dec 1, after which time the Timed Text Working Group 
intends to publish this document (possibly with changes to address 
comments) as a "Working Group Note".

Please send comments to the public reflector <public-tt@w3.org, which is 
archived at [2].

Regards,
Glenn Adams, Chair TT WG
