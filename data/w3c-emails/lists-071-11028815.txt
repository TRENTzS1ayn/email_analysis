Hi,



Just a minor note Ive been reading the draft, and some of the notes that 
have been inserted are using ambiguous dates eg does 6/10/03 refer to June 
or October.  Clarification of these would help indicate recent changes for 
someone scanning the document.

Why do they call the small chocolate bars 'fun size'? Wouldn't be more fun 
to eat a big one?
