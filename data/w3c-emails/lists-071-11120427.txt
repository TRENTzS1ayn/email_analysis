Due to the change in times that is now 15:00 - 16:30 UTC

regrets - I am in an airport and will be getting on a plane. Probable regrets
for next week, by the way.

I am working on a technique for using annotea to provide context-sensitive
help for form attributes. I'm not sure exactly where this fits in WCAG, but I
note that it is something that JAWS implemented a magic HTML attribute to
cope with, and it has been raised as a potential requirement for XAG
