I was to write two paragraphs on the use of long descriptions in frames and 

Long Descriptions in Frames:

The use of "Longdesc" (Long Description) in Frames is not recommended
because the "Longdesc" command is currently not well supported by User
Agents.

Here is a paragraph on Text Based Menus: 

Although graphical based menus are accessible when "alt text" is used, there
are advantages to creating menus that are completely text based. Graphical
text is not easily scalable. The size of graphical text cannot be increased
easily by those who may need a larger font. Alternatively, text based menus
allow for relative font sizes to be used on menu links. Relative font sizes
can be easily increased in most browsers without the use of assistive
technology. (WCAG Principle, Perceivable)
