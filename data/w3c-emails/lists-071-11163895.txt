Looks good.

By the way. If you don't use Longdesc - what do you use?

 For pictures - longdesc can be required as level 1 but d-link cannot.  So
if you recommend against longdesc, then we must make  descriptions be level
2 items.     (unghh)

We really should get longdesc supported!!!.   

Also, this is one of those things where - if we recommend against longdesc,
are we tailoring our recommendations based on bad user agents?

 

Hmmmmmm.  Tough one.

Subject: [TECHS] Londesc paragraph, and Text based menus

 

I was to write two paragraphs on the use of long descriptions in frames and 

Long Descriptions in Frames:

The use of "Longdesc" (Long Description) in Frames is not recommended
because the "Longdesc" command is currently not well supported by User
Agents.

Here is a paragraph on Text Based Menus: 

Although graphical based menus are accessible when "alt text" is used, there
are advantages to creating menus that are completely text based. Graphical
text is not easily scalable. The size of graphical text cannot be increased
easily by those who may need a larger font. Alternatively, text based menus
allow for relative font sizes to be used on menu links. Relative font sizes
can be easily increased in most browsers without the use of assistive
technology. (WCAG Principle, Perceivable)
