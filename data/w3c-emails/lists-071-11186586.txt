A further problem: the number of words that is reasonable will vary by
language. I suggest that if you want to be precise, state a requirement
which doesn't specify an arbitrary, language-specific number. For example
"the number of words comprising 5 sentences of average length", where the
average length is computed by reference to the text of the content.

Yes there's still an arbitrary number here, but it isn't so
language-dependent and makes the length relative to the complexity of the
remainder of the content. I am sure others can come up with more creative
proposals.
