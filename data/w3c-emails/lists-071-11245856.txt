Speaking strictly for myself, I don't see much use for the LONGDESC
attribute where the <frame> element is concerned-- I've never found
myself wanting such a description.  I agree with David that the title
attribute is more important, and it seems to me that all three of the
tools mentioned-- IBM Home Page Reader, Window-Eyes, and JAWS-- do now
support the title attribute for frames.  So I think we're good there.

Hi Gregg

[Tech doc] Longdesc works fine for Images etc. We wouldn't deprecate
that use of LongDesc in "straight" documents. It is when the Londesc
command is used to describe frames where its support breaks up.  So it
is only as a description of Frames where we are not recommending it.  At
this point WindowEyes, Jaws and Home Page Reader don't have predictable
or clean support of Londesc in Frames. We've tested this quite
extensively.  I'd be fine with calling these companies up and lobbying
them for us.  (Perhaps I could get them to clean up with their flaky
"Title" attribute support also.)  If someone has some contact names I'd
be glad to pursue it in a nice and diplomatic way. (On the other hand,
it seems Frames are on their way out anyway)

Cheers

Looks good.

By the way. If you don't use Longdesc - what do you use?

 For pictures - longdesc can be required as level 1 but d-link cannot.
So if you recommend against longdesc, then we must make  descriptions be
level 2 items.     (unghh)

We really should get longdesc supported!!!.   

Also, this is one of those things where - if we recommend against
longdesc, are we tailoring our recommendations based on bad user agents?

 

Hmmmmmm.  Tough one.

I was to write two paragraphs on the use of long descriptions in frames
and 

Long Descriptions in Frames:

The use of "Longdesc" (Long Description) in Frames is not recommended
because the "Longdesc" command is currently not well supported by User
Agents.

Here is a paragraph on Text Based Menus: 

Although graphical based menus are accessible when "alt text" is used,
there are advantages to creating menus that are completely text based.
Graphical text is not easily scalable. The size of graphical text cannot
be increased easily by those who may need a larger font. Alternatively,
text based menus allow for relative font sizes to be used on menu links.
Relative font sizes can be easily increased in most browsers without the
use of assistive technology. (WCAG Principle, Perceivable)

Cheers
