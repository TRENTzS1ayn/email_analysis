To find out what time the meeting is held in your city, there are several 
time converters such as: http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meeting.html

The meeting will be held:
Thursday, October 30, 2003, at 9:00 PM UTC (also Greenwich Mean Time, 
London is in this time zone)
Thursday 4:00 PM in Boston (Eastern Standard Time)
Friday 8:00 AM in Melbourne (Australian Eastern Daylight Time - Australia 
is still observing daylight savings time)

Best,
