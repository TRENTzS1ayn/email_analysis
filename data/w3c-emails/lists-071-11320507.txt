DISCUSSION

Review of HTML techniques [1] preparatory to discussion on thursday call.
David will add a little content to a couple sections. Checklist items need
to be converted to true-false statements. We also agreed that down the road
we'd like "user-friendly" checklist items that assist in the process of
developing a site; these would exist alongside the present true-false
statements used in conformance evaluations. We also agreed a book-style
index would be useful to add later. We will generate numbers for the
techniques to faciliate discussions. 

On Techniques Gateway [2] we talked about different levels of alternative
text (e.g., the difference between alt, title, and longdesc in HTML, though
we tried to generalize). We came up with some definitions we liked to put
into the next draft of the document. We briefly discussed headings within
the Gateway document, which were confusing. It is already a goal to align
the Gateway with the Guidelines, once a solid organization emerges, and we
thought a lot of the header issues would be addressed by that process.


ACTION ITEMS

* Ben: Convert checklist items as TF statements
* Tom: Create "yes/no" versions of checklist items
* Ben: Generate technique numbers in XSLT
* David: Write up longdesc on frame findings
* Tom: Discuss concept of multiple levels of text equivalent with UAAG group
