The current wording of Example 2 under Guideline 1.4 at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-20031027.html reads as
follows:
* Example 2: an acronym in a page title.
 
In the following heading, "People of the W3C." the acronym "W3C" is
marked as an acronym. Because it has been marked appropriately, the user
agent would
be able to speak the letters of the acronym one at a time rather than
attempting to pronounce it as though it were a word.
 
Proposed rewording
* Example 1: an acronym in a page title.
 
In the following heading, "People of the W3C." the acronym "W3C" is
marked as an acronym. Because it has been marked appropriately, the user
agent would
be able to speak the expanded name of the organization ("World Wide Web
Consortium") rather than speaking the three characters of the acronym.
 
There are two problems with the current wording:
1. Only one example is given, but this one is called "Example 2"
2. The example is wrong in two ways, I think.  First, if the letters
"W3C" are coded as an acronym, the user agent (screen reader) should
*expand* the acronym to its full meaning, not read the three letters
separately: <acronym title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</acronym>.
Second, screen readers by default pronounce the characters "W3C" as
"double u three see" because there's no way to turn it into a word using
the rules of English pronunciation.
