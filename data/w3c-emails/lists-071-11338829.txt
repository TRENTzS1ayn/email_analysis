Ahhh   Thanks. 

Boy - we should make a list of these.  Decisions that we made based on what
works rather than what we wished or thought best.   Then at the end we can
walk this carefully to be sure we are happy with these "until user agent"
like decisions.

Thanks David

Hi Gregg

[Tech doc] Longdesc works fine for Images etc. We wouldn't deprecate that
use of LongDesc in "straight" documents. It is when the Londesc command is
used to describe frames where its support breaks up.  So it is only as a
description of Frames where we are not recommending it.  At this point
WindowEyes, Jaws and Home Page Reader don't have predictable or clean
support of Londesc in Frames. We've tested this quite extensively.  I'd be
fine with calling these companies up and lobbying them for us.  (Perhaps I
could get them to clean up with their flaky "Title" attribute support also.)
If someone has some contact names I'd be glad to pursue it in a nice and
diplomatic way. (On the other hand, it seems Frames are on their way out
anyway)

Cheers

Looks good.

By the way. If you don't use Longdesc - what do you use?

 For pictures - longdesc can be required as level 1 but d-link cannot.  So
if you recommend against longdesc, then we must make  descriptions be level
2 items.     (unghh)

We really should get longdesc supported!!!.   

Also, this is one of those things where - if we recommend against longdesc,
are we tailoring our recommendations based on bad user agents?

 

Hmmmmmm.  Tough one.

Subject: [TECHS] Londesc paragraph, and Text based menus

 

I was to write two paragraphs on the use of long descriptions in frames and 

Long Descriptions in Frames:

The use of "Longdesc" (Long Description) in Frames is not recommended
because the "Longdesc" command is currently not well supported by User
Agents.

Here is a paragraph on Text Based Menus: 

Although graphical based menus are accessible when "alt text" is used, there
are advantages to creating menus that are completely text based. Graphical
text is not easily scalable. The size of graphical text cannot be increased
easily by those who may need a larger font. Alternatively, text based menus
allow for relative font sizes to be used on menu links. Relative font sizes
can be easily increased in most browsers without the use of assistive
technology. (WCAG Principle, Perceivable)

Cheers
