Hi Gregg

I've adopted the suggested changes laid out in your last email.  Here's how
it reads now.


Migration from WCAG 1.0 to 2.0


This Working Draft of WCAG 2.0 is a follow-on and evolution of WCAG 1.0 and
reflects feedback received since the publication of WCAG 1.0 in May 1999.
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group is working carefully
to enable organizations and individuals that are currently using WCAG 1.0
(which remains stable and referenceable at this time) to ensure that they
will eventually be able to make a smooth transition to WCAG 2.0. To
understand how this eventual transition would be facilitated, please refer
to the (draft) Mapping <http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2003/10/27-mapping.html>
Between WCAG 1.0 and the WCAG 2.0 Working Draft for more detail on current
correspondences. Although the same approaches to accessibility are followed
in 1.0 and 2.0, the organization and structure have been improved
significantly. The principles have also been worded to make it easier to
understand their application across the wide range of existing and emerging
technologies.

Technology Specific Guidelines 

The main WCAG 2.0 Working Draft document does not include
technology-specific implementation requirements or techniques, but it does
include links to technology-specific requirements as well as
technology-specific examples and techniques. 

Priorities 

One significant change is that this WCAG 2.0 Working Draft does not assign
priorities to guidelines, as did WCAG 1.0. Instead, guidelines include three
levels of success criteria. [insert starts here].  The reason for this is
that each success criteria, regardless of priority category that it would
fall into, could make the critical difference between accessibility and
inaccessibility for some group of users.  Given this, it is impossible to
make some checkpoints more important than others without implying that some
users are more important than others.  Thus, the guidelines have been
reorganized based upon a number of factors as outlined below.

 

Conformance 

Guidelines are divided into three categories of success criterion.

*         Level 1 Success criterion: 

1.      do not specify how information is presented

2.      are reasonably applicable to all websites

3.      are testable (machine or reliably human)

*         Level 2 Success criterion: 

1.      may require an author to present content in particular ways

2.      are reasonably applicable to all websites

3.      are testable (machine or reliably human)

*         Level 3 Success criterion: 

1.      are additional criteria that go beyond Level 1 and 2 that may be
applied to make sites accessible to more people with all or particular types
of disability

2.  are testable (machine or reliably human)

Good start. The first part of insert is right on the money.  However, the
levels do not reflect the amount of change.

They are a mixture.   The mixture is in the latest draft.

I would go with your start. Then just say "the three levels are determined
as follows" 

 

Or something like that.

 

Thanks David.

Subject: Paragraph on rational for abandoning the "Priority" system

 

I was tasked with introducing a paragraph that gave the rational for our
shift away from the 1.0 "Priority" system. I've tried to put it into lay
persons terms so that most people, including those whose first language is
not English, can understand it. I suggest the explanation be added to the
section of the Guidelines called "Priorities and Techniques".  Here is how
the whole section would read with the inserted paragraph

Priorities and Techniques

WCAG 1.0. Instead, guidelines include three levels of success criteria.

the organization and structure have been improved significantly.[insert

guidelines are not divided up according to "Priority".  The reason for this

reorganized based upon the degree to which a checkpoint may require an
author to adjust the presentation or expression of content.    [end of
