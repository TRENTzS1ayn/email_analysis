As discussed in the call today, we are planning to post a public working
draft of the HTML Techniques for WCAG 2.0 to the Technical Reports page.
This is a draft, only a draft, and there are lots of incomplete areas.
Still, if there are issues that you believe need to be addressed before we
post it publicly, please send them to the list by the end of the day Friday,
October 31. Please identify that the issue needs to be addressed before
going to TR, or we will assume the comment is a general one that can be
addressed after this working draft is posted.

The current draft is available at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-HTML-TECHS-20031020.html.
