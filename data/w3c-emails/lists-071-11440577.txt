Regarding the HTML techniques draft, I think something is missing in the
Title element technique:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-HTML-TECHS-20031020.html#title

Here it just says that you should use the title element to define in a
simple phrase the purpose of the document. 

What I think is very important, is that this description is specific to the
page. I see a lot of websites where every page has the same title, for
example the name of the organization. I think it would be wise to make it
explicit that titles should preferably be unique within a website.
