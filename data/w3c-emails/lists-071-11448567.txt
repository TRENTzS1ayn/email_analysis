Pre Google, the title element and its contents were a major factor in search
engine rankings.  The title was used totry to define the content.  Even now,
on Intranet searches it greatly aids usability by having carefully thought
out and definitive titles.  Lots of Intranets and internal search engines
are just a mess of indistinguishable documents with titles and abstracts
blurring into each other because of the lack of attention given to this
issue.  Given that users search so much, its amazing that so little effort
is put into managing this.  But then again document management is not an
easy issue.

Regarding the HTML techniques draft, I think something is missing in the
Title element technique:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-HTML-TECHS-20031020.html#title

Here it just says that you should use the title element to define in a
simple phrase the purpose of the document.

What I think is very important, is that this description is specific to the
page. I see a lot of websites where every page has the same title, for
example the name of the organization. I think it would be wise to make it
explicit that titles should preferably be unique within a website.
