You must image a page title like a book chapter title not as an abstract
of the book.
There are specific meta elements. for Eg. the page of HTML Techniques
could be have this elements:

<title>HTML Techniques for WCAG 2.0</title>
<meta name="description" content="This document describes techniques for
creating accessible Hypertext Markup Language content [HTML4], [XHTML1].
This document is intended to help authors of Web content who wish to
claim conformance to "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0"
[WCAG20]." />

a good idea is to have the <h1> element that recall the page Title (good
also for search engine indexing) with the description that follow the
title.

Regarding the HTML techniques draft, I think something is missing in the
Title element technique:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-HTML-TECHS-20031020.html#title

Here it just says that you should use the title element to define in a
simple phrase the purpose of the document.

What I think is very important, is that this description is specific to
the
page. I see a lot of websites where every page has the same title, for
example the name of the organization. I think it would be wise to make
it
explicit that titles should preferably be unique within a website.
