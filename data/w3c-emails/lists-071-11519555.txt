In the HTML techniques document, there is two techniques for the Embed
element,  called "Alt content for embed":
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-HTML-TECHS-20031020.html#noembed>
and Alt text for embed.

However, EMBED is no longer supported in HTML4+. I do not think we should
give techniques for elements that are no longer in the HTML specification.
If we do want to include techniques for obsolete elements for backwards
compatibility purposes, this should be made explicit with each technique
that uses them.

In the next section below, called "Embedding multimedia objects", it does
mention that you should use EMBED within OBJECT for backward compatibility,
however it does not say that EMBED is no longer part of the specification
and will lead to invalid documents. If I were a casual visitor, I would
think that OBJECT is the preferred way, but also that EMBED is still allowed
which is not the case.

Also, I think we should include some more examples of how to embed a movie
or sound fragment (for example an AVI or WAV file). I am currently building
a website with some movies and sounds, but have had a very hard time finding
out how to make this accessible and cross-browser. My added problem was that
we create these pages on the fly (server-side), without knowing the actual
width and height of the movies. 

The current example for movies are Flash-only, where there normally is one
designated plugin. This is contrary to other movies which can use different
programs to be played, depending on the user's preferences, operating
system, browser, etc.
