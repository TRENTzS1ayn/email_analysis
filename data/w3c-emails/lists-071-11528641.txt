Good point.
Remember also my consideration about image maps and object element
(object is not well supported by browser like IE).

Subject: HTML techniques - Embedded objects (no blocker)



In the HTML techniques document, there is two techniques for the Embed
element,  called "Alt content for embed":
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-HTML-TECHS-20031020.html#noem
bed>
and Alt text for embed.

However, EMBED is no longer supported in HTML4+. I do not think we
should
give techniques for elements that are no longer in the HTML
specification.
If we do want to include techniques for obsolete elements for backwards
compatibility purposes, this should be made explicit with each technique
that uses them.

In the next section below, called "Embedding multimedia objects", it
does
mention that you should use EMBED within OBJECT for backward
compatibility,
however it does not say that EMBED is no longer part of the
specification
and will lead to invalid documents. If I were a casual visitor, I would
think that OBJECT is the preferred way, but also that EMBED is still
allowed
which is not the case.

Also, I think we should include some more examples of how to embed a
movie
or sound fragment (for example an AVI or WAV file). I am currently
building
a website with some movies and sounds, but have had a very hard time
finding
out how to make this accessible and cross-browser. My added problem was
that
we create these pages on the fly (server-side), without knowing the
actual
width and height of the movies.

The current example for movies are Flash-only, where there normally is
one
designated plugin. This is contrary to other movies which can use
different
programs to be played, depending on the user's preferences, operating
system, browser, etc.
