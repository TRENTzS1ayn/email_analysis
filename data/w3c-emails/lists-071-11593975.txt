Hi, I have sent this suggestion to the Accessibility web content group
but it also deals with HTML/XHTML as well.  An HTML document is attached
that explains a suggestion for using the <section> element to improve
accessibility in the XHTML 2.0 draft.  Thank you for your time in
considering this suggestion and expanding on ways to make accessibility
better for mobile device and disabled users.

Thanks,
Seth Honeycutt
