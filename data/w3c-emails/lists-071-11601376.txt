I agree, and I think that the current example for movies (Flash-only):

http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-HTML-TECHS-20031020.html#noembed
<embed src="moviename.swf" width="100" height="80"
      pluginspage="http://example.com/shockwave/download/" />
  <noembed>
    <img alt="Still from Movie" src="moviename.gif"
    width="100" height="80" />
  </noembed>

may be misleading, as it is available a good solution for swf files, by Drew
McLellan in an article in A List Apart
http://www.alistapart.com/articles/flashsatay/, that in synthesis leads to a
code like this:

<object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="file.swf"
 width="100" height="100">
 <param name="movie" value="file.swf" />
 <a href="page.htm"><img src="noflash.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="alt
text" /></a>&nbsp;
</object>

It is valid, and if the browser doesn't play objects with a MIME type of
application/x-shockwave-flash, it will go for the next child element (in the
example img, but may be a text).
