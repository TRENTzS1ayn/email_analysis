Hi Wendy, Seth,

I believe that the section element of XHTML 2.0 (which can be nested, as said in 
the WD) already covers this issue together with the navigation lists, as their 
name says, created for navigation elements:

<http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-xhtml2-20030506/mod-list.html#edef_list_nl>

I don't believe what has been sent adds anything new to what is already known, 
and I personally think the HTML WG is handling adequately both accessibility and 
device independence issues.

My 2 cents,
Regards,
carlos
