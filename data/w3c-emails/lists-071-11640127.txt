It is possible to have both the embed element and validity - this was what
the modularisation of XHTML was designed to allow.

You simply need to create a DTD that includes HTML and allows embed to be
included - essentially by adding a module for it. If we are going to propose
the possiblity of doing this we should create the appropriate DTD and show
how to include it in the document...

Support for object in Internet Explorer isn't that great - it prefers to be
told exactly which plugin to use for code, which is a problem for anyone who
wants to develop a more accceissble plugin or a specialised one for some kind
of content. But it isn't unsupported either - and only really broken for
images.

Support for object in browsers goes back to 1998 versions of Explorer
and Netscape, and is now pretty standard. It would be good to have some more
clear information about exact levels of support - does anyone have a
favourite reference for comprehensive information about what browsers really
support?
