Concise seems perfect: in italian we say "conciso", and it means exactly
what we intend to say. 
Maybe it's the best choice.

Hmmmmmm     
compact......
interesting word.   What does that sound like to others.
Though not quite as good as concise, its eems more common than concise Seems
more accurate than brief.

How about people from other countries.  Which word is easier to understand,
has the right meaning, and is easy to translate.

Concise
Compact
Brief
Short

For me personally, concise is a word in my passive vocabulary, not in my
active vocabulary. In other words: it's not a word I would use. Instead I
would use words like brief, compact  short, etc.
