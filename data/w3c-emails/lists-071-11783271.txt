Seth,
  Firstly, see the tables module for the content models [1], then read on.

This is valid, but maybe unnecessary, since a table is for structuring 
tables of data,  not whole documents and sections.  <td> can hold any 
Heading, Block or Inline element (see "Flow"[2])

<tr> can only hold <th> or <td>, not <section>

This is what <thead>, <tfoot> and <tbody> are for!  <tbody> can be 
repeated as many times as you need for each different section.
<table>
    <thead></thead>
    <tfoot></tfoot>
    <tbody></tbody>
    <tbody></tbody>
    <!-- More if needed -->
</table>

See <col/> and <colgroup>, or try nested tables.

The id of an element must be unique within a document.[3] therefore, 
this is not possible.
