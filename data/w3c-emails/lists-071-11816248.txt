Better practice would be to put the correct example first and the things
to avoid after that.  Or just publish the thing we'd like to recommend
and omit the bad examples altogether.

In the techniques document, there is a technique about using image and
text links side by side:
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-HTML-TECHS-20031020.html#imag
etex
tlinks>

There are three examples that accompany this technique. However, the
first two are the 'don'ts' and the third one is the correct example.
Can't we use mark-up to show that the first two are unwanted examples,
for instance like the illegal examples in the HTML spec section 11.2?
<http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/tables.html> 

Especially when reading technical documents, people tend to gloss over
the text and look straight at the examples to see how the technique
should be applied. I think it must be very clear if examples are given
for unwanted situations.
