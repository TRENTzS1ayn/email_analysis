I agree: "Brief" is better than "terse" (and it's shorter than
"concise"...)

Subject: HTML techniques - "Terse" substitutes for header labels (no
blocker)



Going over the HTML techniques draft, I came across the technique called
"Terse substitutes for header labels":
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-HTML-TECHS-20031020.html#data
tabl
es_abbr>

I am not a native speaker of English, but I do read a lot of books and
articles in English (on average 500-1000 pages per week for the last 10
years or so) so I do not think I have a limited vocabulary. However, I
had never heard of the word "terse" before. 

When I looked it up using dictionary.com, it said "Brief and to the
point; effectively concise". Wouldn't "brief" be a better word, i.e.
"Brief substitutes for header labels". Or even "short", to use the
simplest words to convey the meaning.
