Right.  I hadn't quite seen just how important that consistency was until
you pointed it out.

I actually think there is some need for a CMS/ATAG techniques in here
somewhere that should address these issues.  The ATAG also needs such a
branch to address these types of things, especially in CMSs.  But Authoring
Tools should also address them for consistency checks across projects.

Agreed.  Every page should have a unique and informative <title> element
that allows users to orient themselves with confidence.  It's even
better if the <title> corresponds closely to link text elsewhere on the
site-- this makes it much easier  to be certain  that one has followed
the corect link and arrived at the correct place.

For example, if the link text reads "How-tos and Demos," the <title> on
the destination page should contain that phrase.
