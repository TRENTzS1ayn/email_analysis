Dear Wendy, Dear Jason,

This is a mail to acknowledge and have a status of your participation 
in the implementation of QA Ops GL.

Wendy has asked me to participate to the next WCAG F2F in Tokyo in 
November 2003. I have agreed to come to explain. (Olivier may join).

We will be happy to explain in more details the QA Framework. If you 
have preliminary questions and/or things you would like to see covered 
at this F2F, please inform us.

Best Regards.

> One of the criteria of success of the CR phase will be to gather the

> Operational Guidelines.
>
> By applying, we don't mean to say "comply" but only going thru the Ops 
> checklist and report to the QAWG what they think they're already 
> doing, what they expect to do in the future (and by when), and what 
> they don't expect to do (with rationales).  It will not be necessary 
> to implement everything (but better if all) but do what you can or 
> what you think is valuable.
>
> We would like by the end of the announced CR period, the 4th Technical 
> Plenary in March 2004, to have at least 5 WGs having done this work 
> and give us their feedback with their rationales.
>
> The phase will be to
> - give you the guidelines with a start kit.
> - do not necessary help you apply the guidelines
> - gather your comments and the results of your auto-evaluation (2/3 
> months later)
> - work together to modify the guidelines and/or either to help you 
> implement them.
