Hallo Yvette,

I disagree with you in this point. Being a non-native speaker as well, I find 
concise a very common word, and easily tranlatable to Spanish, German, and as 
far as I know to French (also I find terse adequate). Furthermore, the use of 
"compact" IMHO might only lead to confusion.

Furthermore, I don't believe we shall write the guidelines (although targeted to 
different audiences), neither with a high-school level nor with a 10-years-old 
native speaker in mind. If we get into that, the average English-level of a 
person with Masters Degree in Spain might be comparable with a four-years-old 
native speaker (sad but true). This thread of reasoning can lead to serious 
problems for the editors of the guidelines.

regards,
carlos
