Plain language version of Guideline 1.8 plus success criteria, benefits,
and examples

 

This document contains a series of proposals for a "plain language_
rewording of WCAG 2.0 Checkpoint 1.8 with Success Criteria, Examples,
and Benefits

 

This is submitted in partial fulfillment of an action item taken by John
Slatin, Katie Haritos-Shay, and Doyle Burnett during a call in late
September or early October, to generate a plain-language version of WCAG
2.  

 

This message is partial in two ways: (1) It addresses only Guideline
(now Principle) 1, Checkpoint (now Guideline) 1.8, and the relevant
success criteria, examples, and benefits.  Other guidelines, etc., will
follow.  (2) It is not really "plain language," in the sense that this
text has not yet been compared to the 1500-word "special lexicon" used
by Voice of America (or other similar lexicons).  Thus it's actually
best understood as an attempt to simplify and clarify.  We're still
working on the formal plain language issues, but wanted to put this out
to start generating discussion.

 

Items labeled "Current wording" are taken from the September document
Reorg 4, available at http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2003/09/reorg4.html
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2003/09/reorg4.html> .  This document was
current at the time Katie and Doyle and I took on the action item to
attempt a plain language version.  Of course the proposed rewordings
will need to be correlated with later updates.

will be able to recognize different types of content based on other
cues.

Proposed wording for Examples of Guideline 1.8 


(Informative)


Example 1. A form that includes both required and optional fields.

 

Labels for required fields are shown in red and include an asterisk.

 

Example 2. Results of an online examination.

Incorrect responses are preceded by a blue, bell-shaped icon and grouped
under a heading that reads, "Incorrect responses."  Correct answers are
grouped under a heading that reads, "Correct responses" and each
response is preceded by a gold icon in the shape of a star.

 

Example 3. A bus schedule.

 

A bus schedule is presented as a table. Columns that list morning and
afternoon times use different background colors. In addition to the
background colors, , standard abbreviations are used to indicate morning
and afternoon or times are shown in 24-hour format (for example, 2:34pm
or 14:24).
