Refer to WCAG 2.0 Scope. A statement reads:
"...and usable by people with a full range of disabilities. "

Probably  what is meant is  "usable by people  having different kinds of disabilities"
Does "people with full range"  imply   only those those individuals each of whom have  all disabilities  imaginable? Probably not.
