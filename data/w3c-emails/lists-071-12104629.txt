Good catch! Maybe "... the full range of people with disabilities"?

Sailesh:
I think "full range of PWD" reduces PWD to some inanimate objects or produce  like full range of something or the other.
So I stick to my earlier view that is reproduced below:
Refer to WCAG 2.0 Scope. A statement reads:
"...and usable by people with a full range of disabilities. "

Probably  what is meant is  "usable by people  having different kinds of disabilities"
Does "people with full range"  imply   only those those individuals each of whom have  all disabilities  imaginable? Probably not.
