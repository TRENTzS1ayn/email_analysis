To All Discussing This -

Good dialogue that we?re having ? I have a problem with using the word
?full? as it makes it sound all inclusive which is what I know we?re
striving for.  I really do think something like ? usable by all people
regardless of disability or usable by people having many different types of
disabilities or usable by people having different kinds of disabilities.

Again, ?full range? seems (to me) to imply something a bit odd and I cannot
fully rationalize my thought process.  It?s almost like if you do not have
the particular full range of a particular disability, we may NOT be talking
about you.  The full range of autism, the full range of blindness (total) -
I don?t know.  Thoughts?
