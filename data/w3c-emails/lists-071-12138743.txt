Techniques Gateway issues list:
http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/condensedreports/core_issues.php

Issue 518:
http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/condensedreports/core_issues.php#518
consensus from last week: let's try to find accessible resources. where we 
can't find an accessible resource, we'll send the site a message that tells 
them they are not accessible and explain that we would like to link to them 
but are working on an accessibility project.  thus, we will favor 
accessible resources over inaccessible ones and encourage inaccessible ones 
to become accessible.  If unable to find an accessible resource (or one 
that is willing to become accessible) should we will link to it but warn 
the user before they go there?

Issue 519
http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/condensedreports/core_issues.php#519

gateway. link to these from (throughout) html techinques, i.e. 
mini-checklists embedded in html techniques that link to techniques gateway.

Issue 524
http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/condensedreports/core_issues.php#524

Issue 528
http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/condensedreports/core_issues.php#528
Thinking about how people use the documents...if a reader hasn't looked at 
guidelines, will absolute statements make sense?  We need to make sure that 
techniques will make sense on their own (to some extent).
action: tom to play with the strcuture of atomic techniques gateway techniques.
