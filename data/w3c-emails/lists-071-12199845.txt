I think the objective was to say that the guidelines are meant to apply to
people with all different types of disabilities.    This is in contrast to
guidelines that apply to some (different disabilities) but omit others.

 

  'different types of disabilities"  could mean just   vision, hearing, and
physical.    The ALL was meant to make the goal to include all. 

 

(or at least all that can be addressed by web content design.  Lower back
pain and chemical sensitivity being two that are not in this category).  

 

What we had was clearly bad English.     But how to do we do it well to
cover all.  

 

 

Full range is the best I've seen of the suggestions.  Implies not only types
but degrees.   

 

hmmmm

I would agree with Sailesh - full range is a confusing phrase as it could be
implied that a person or persons have the full range of a GIVEN disability.
I feel, "usable by people having different kinds of disabilities" is the
best way to present what I am guessing we're trying to say.

Refer to WCAG 2.0 Scope. A statement reads:

Probably  what is meant is  "usable by people  having different kinds of
disabilities"
Does "people with full range"  imply   only those those individuals each of
whom have  all disabilities  imaginable? Probably not.
