http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-HTML-TECHS-20031104.html

2. Testability of the success criteria in WCAG 2.0, with suggestions
   for change. See
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2003OctDec/0234.html

3. Clarification and refinement of the text of WCAG 2.0, with
   attention to the use of language, terminological consistency and
   avoidance of unnecessary complexity. See the proposals posted by
   John Slatin on behalf of the subgroup.
