But I like Kirsten's suggestion that we "turn this around" and talk
instead about "users with a wide range of abilities" etc.

There's a difference between (a) "people with the full range of
disabilities" and (b) "the full range of people with disabilities."
 
(a) *might* be misconstrued as referring only to specific individuals
who have many disabilities themselves (i.e., a person who has blindness,
deafness, motor impairment, and cognitive disabilities all at once)--
though in all honesty I htink you'd have to work at it to (mis)read it
this way.
 
(b) designates a range of people, each of whom has (one or more)
disabilities.
 
I'm not necessarily arguing for "full range," but I do think (b) is
clear.  Perhaps "broad range of people with disabilities" or "wide range
of people with disabilities" might address Doyle's concern about our
seeming to claim too much if we tak about "the full range of people with
disabilities."

I agree with the word ALL but still have an issue with the phrase "full
range" - knowing full-well we mean all.  Maybe it's the educator in me
that had a problem with the term/phrase, "full inclusion" some years
back.  Maybe it's because the phrase will not translate well in other
languages - I don't know.  All types of disabilities is what we are
talking about.  I feel the term "full range" is a bit vague but it's not
a make or break issue with me - only my opinion.

I think the objective was to say that the guidelines are meant
to apply to people with all different types of disabilities.    This is
in contrast to guidelines that apply to some (different disabilities)
but omit others.

 

  'different types of disabilities"  could mean just   vision,
hearing, and physical.    The ALL was meant to make the goal to include
all. 

 

(or at least all that can be addressed by web content design.
Lower back pain and chemical sensitivity being two that are not in this
category).  

 

What we had was clearly bad English.     But how to do we do it
well to cover all.  

 

 

Full range is the best I've seen of the suggestions.  Implies
not only types but degrees.   

 

hmmmm

I would agree with Sailesh - full range is a confusing phrase as
it could be implied that a person or persons have the full range of a
GIVEN disability.  I feel, "usable by people having different kinds of
disabilities" is the best way to present what I am guessing we're trying
to say.

Refer to WCAG 2.0 Scope. A statement reads:

Probably  what is meant is  "usable by people  having different
kinds of disabilities"
Does "people with full range"  imply   only those those
individuals each of whom have  all disabilities  imaginable? Probably
not.
