Although no formal decision has been made for logistical reasons, the
next meeting is likely to be 9 January rather than today, with
checkpoint 4.1 as its primary topic. So, unless you receive urgent
e-mail from Gregg and Wendy to the contrary, it can be assumed that 9
January is the date.

Checkpoint 5.2 has received some discussion on the list and may also
find its way onto the agenda unless a proposal is generally agreed
upon beforehand.

In a broader context, an internal draft of WCAG 2.0 incorporating
recently agreed upon changes is in the works, as is a
revised Requirements document for the WCAG 2.0 techniques (including
checklists etc.).
