I'm concerned that "browse the resource" will not apply to Web
applications 
since "browsing" isn't usually a task associated with an 
application.  Perhaps "Make it easy for users to interact with a
resource, 
to know their place in it, and to find information they need" ??

This concern applies to the rest of the Guideline but I do not have a 
proposed rewording.
