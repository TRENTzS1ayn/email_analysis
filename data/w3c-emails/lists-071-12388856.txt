Can we simply say, "These guidelines provide recommendations to developers 
and managers who wish to make Web content more accessible and usable by 
people with disabilities."

In other words, remove the adjectives and simply say "people with 
disabilities."  Later, we can enumerate the types and combinations of 
disabilities or leave it to the EOWG documents.
