I propose that we add the following group of prospective users for the Techniques documents:

Trainers/developers of training.

Rationale: People who develop accessibility training materials and programs need access to clear, detailed documentation of techniques for meeting WCAG 2 checkpoints and success criteria.  Some of these people may be members of EO, who need the best materials we can supply.

WCAG is no longer the only game in town, especially in the US.  Helping trainers see how WCAG 2 techniques documents can help them provide excellent training is also a way to get the trainers on our side, i.e., turn them into advocates for WCAG 2.0.

  Attached is version 0.3 of the Techniques requirements. I apologize that I
  did not complete this before the holidays, but you know, things get busy.
  This version incorporates comments received to date (unless I've lost track
  of any) and adds a little more structure.

  The plan is that this version should be close to ready to post as a public
  draft. We have tentatively scheduled a teleconference for Wednesday, January
  8 at 10:30am U.S. Eastern Time (I think this is 15:30 UTC). This call would
  be for people who want to discuss the Techniques in detail. On the January 9
  WCAG call we will hopefully be ready to request the group's approval to post
  this to TR - keeping in mind that it is still a draft.
