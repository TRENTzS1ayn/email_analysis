Nice one Wendy.

Unless someone has an objection to this -- I think we should try it out
and move on for now.  If someone sees a problem with it when
incorporated - then re-raise it.  

Please look over the great work done by our two subcommittees so we can
get the Plain language and testability work incorporated.

Thanks 
 
Gregg

Can we simply say, "These guidelines provide recommendations to
developers 
and managers who wish to make Web content more accessible and usable by 
people with disabilities."

In other words, remove the adjectives and simply say "people with 
disabilities."  Later, we can enumerate the types and combinations of 
disabilities or leave it to the EOWG documents.
