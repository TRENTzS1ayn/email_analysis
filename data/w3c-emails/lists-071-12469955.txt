Should we add something about being explicitly associated to this one?
1.1-SC2 - non-text content that is designed to create a specific sensory
experience (such as music without words or visual art) 

has a text label or a text description.

Subject: Decisions for new wording - as far as we got.



Here are the new guidelines and principles - up to half way through 1.2


 

 


Proposed wording for Principle 1


Principle 1: Content must be Percievable.

 


Guideline 1.1


For non-text content, provide text equivalents that serve the same
purpose or convey the same information as the non-text content, except
when the purpose of the non-text content is to create a specific sensory
experience (for example, music, visual art) in which case a text label
or description is sufficient. 

 


Level   1


1.1-Sc1Text equivalents are explicitly associated with non-text content,
except when the non-text content is intended to create a specific
sensory experience (for example, music without words, visual art).

 

* The text equivalent fulfills the same function as the author intended
for the non-text content (that is, it conveys all of the intended
information and achieves the same function as the non-text content).

 

1.1-SC2 - non-text content that is designed to create a specific sensory
experience (such as music without words or visual art) 

has a text label or a text description.

 

 

 


Level 2


 

(no items in level 2)

 

only item here was deleted for consistency with changes to 1.1 that
eliminate the phrase "expressed in words"

 


Level 3 


1.1-SC3  A single text document (e.g script) is provided that includes
all important visual information, dialogue, and other important sounds).

 

 

 

 

 


Proposed wording for Guideline 1.2


1.2  Provide synchronized media equivalents for time-dependent
presentations.


Level 1


Proposed wording for Guideline 1.2, SC 1


1.2-SC1. an audio description of visual events is provided for
audio-visual media 

 


Proposed wording for Guideline 1.2, SC 2


1.2-SC2. Captions are provided for all significant dialogue and sounds
in time-dependent material.

 

 

WE NEED TO ADD A DEFINITION:  time dependent - need def that captures
that it includes audio and visual information presented at the same
time, as well as audio or visual with interaction, or in combination
with real time events.  

 

 

 


WE STOPPED HERE - THERE ARE MORE SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR 1.2 BUT WE DID NOT
GET TO THEM YET...
