Hello,

My husband works in the audio industry so I asked him to comment on the "20 
dB" figure cited in Guideline 1.7 [1], level 2 success criterion 1:
""
Audio content does not contain background sounds OR the background
sounds are at least 20 decibels lower than the foreground audio content.

Note:

A 20 db difference in sound level is roughly 4 times quieter (or louder).
""

His email response follows. He references a resource [2] from Shure 
Brothers that describes how to record speech so that it will be 
intelligible. Note that the success criterion implies a 20dB difference 
when the user hears the audio and the Shure reference describes recording 
of speech (rather than the difference that the user might hear when 
listening to the playback).  It says, "If speech level is 20dB to 30dB 
above background noise level, intelligibility will be fair to good.  If 
speech level is 30dB to 50dB above background noise level, intelligibility 
will be good to excellent."  Perhaps we ought to use 30dB - 50dB instead of 
20dB?  Is there a resource that demonstrates that 20dB is sufficient?

There is also a white paper, "Understanding Sound System Design and 
Feedback Using (Ugh!) Math" that has more detail. [3]

>10dB - twice as loud or half as loud
