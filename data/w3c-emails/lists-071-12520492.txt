Why do we need more than two *levels* of conformance?

> 2 - match to WCAG 1.0 in structure and measures

WCAG 1.0 is significantly broken in "structure and measures." If we match
2.0 to 1.0 too closely, then 2.0 ends up significantly broken, too.

i.e., we need only two levels, Core and Extended.

though WAI, as ever, uses the longest, hardest-to-understand variants of
those concepts. Why can't they be nouns?

Yes. And so we don't end up with checklists of checkpoints, a term
understandable only to WAI insiders.

which is a *benefit*. The two-layer approach is massively simpler to
understand than 1.0, and also easier to *communicate*.

Adding an alt text *is* telling the author how to present his or her
information. This isn't a slippery slope we're on; we're *always*
interfering with authorial expression. The issue is how much.

>        b) the criteria are reasonably applicable to all websites in general

Oh?

How about Web applications? All-multimedia sites? All-Flash sites?

How well has this blandishment actually been *tested*? It hasn't, I
assume.


>        c) are machine or HHIR testable.

HHIR stands for...?

I warn against reliance on machine-testing as a goal. It took months to
explain to the Working Group that colour need not be machine-testable.
Untold hours of wild goose chasing ensued before the Group finally
accepted that, as with the correctness of an alt text, that issue must
rely on human judgement, inasmuch as it pertains to one participant's
cherished term, contrast. It is my impression that WAI wants to fit as
many square-peg testing criteria it can into the round hole of *machine*
testability.

I remind WAI that Web sites are forums for human creativity. They are not
credit-card numbers with check digits. A wide range of criteria can and
will always be testable only through human interpretation.

If you present it that way, everyone will ignore Category 3. They're
obviously frills.

which proves the folly of the approach. Category 1 is the basic level. How
can a guideline have no basic implementation? (If that is the case, why is
such a guideline its own category? Why isn't it collapsed onto another
guideline?)

or, more accurately, the confusing A/AA/AAA terminology.

Why is that in any way even remotely desirable?

>   - The familiar A, AA, AAA would be there.

They're an albatross we need removed from our necks.

Are we starting with a clean slate or not? Are we building a new house, or
whitewashing the old one?

>   - The guidelines would look more like 1.0 but would be generic.

The former is not a requirement for the latter.

>   - Transition would be easier to understand.

No, it wouldn't. WCAG 1.0 is already virtually incomprehensible to
non-insiders. A WCAG 2.0 that's even more complicated but is grafted onto
the structure of 1.0 is not going to be easier to understand.
