For what it's worth, I just went to follow the link (under 2.4) to the
list of browsers that support the <link> element. The destination page
is in German (the good news is that it uses the lang attribute, so JAWS
actually pronounced the German).  It would be a good idea, I think, to
warn people know when links point to pages in languages that are not the
same as the language of the current page.  Hmmm, we may need to ad this
one to WCAG as well (under 3.1 or 3.2 or whatever).
