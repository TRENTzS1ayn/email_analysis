Hi, here are my suggestion:

Intended users:
---------------
As said by John, is important to add in the "intended users" the "Trainer
developers".


Testability:
------------

There are a contrast in these two paragraphs:
"Techniques related to Success Criteria must be testable. Guidance about
testing methods may be provided. "
and this:
"Example implementations should be provided for untestable Techniques where
possible."

I think that we could correct all these with one sentence:

"Guidance about testing methods for Techniques related to Success Criteria
or example implementations for untestable Techniques related to Success
Criteria must be provided."

these are my two cents :)
