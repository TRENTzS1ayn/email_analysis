Joe, just because the Web is "real" doesn't mean it has to be completely
opaque.  It's been a staple of writing instruction for a Very Long Time
that good writers put up a few signposts along the way to help readers
stay oriented.  It's a good idea for print, and a good idea for the Web,
too.

Using the all-but-unsupported hreflang, for example? Please read the
spec.

For the love of God, no. Get yourself out of the mindset of warning
people of what's available on the real Web.
