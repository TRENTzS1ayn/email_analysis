Usability problem on the matter of tabindex for a W3C form?:
1. The W3C Search form http://search.w3.org/
gives two choices as radio buttons- search W3C.org or Search WWW.  For a screen reader user like me, these buttons are read after the Go button following the  search edit box. If it is presented before the  Go button it wouldme more helpful.
2. In forms mode if I navigate between the buttons with up/down arrow keys, it reads _both_buttons as  "Search w3.org". 
3.   While on the subject,  the label for the search bbox  is not read in  forms mode with JAWS.
4. There is no link to the "W3C Search"  page from the w3c.org home page... But I could find it only on  the W3C.org/WAI page.

I had highlighted these to the Webmaster a few months ago.
Thanks for the attention.
