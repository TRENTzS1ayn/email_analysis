I don't believe that the automatic readability scales are reliable enough to
include as a recommendation for content authors.  They provide a very rough
guide but are very easy to fool.
 
Other recommendations are mostly common sense although I would expect that
many might  disagree that content broken into short pages is better for
everyone.  A long page is easier to print and mark up with highlighting and
may be easier for some to navigate.  A major problem with trying to address
cognitive disabilities in the design of a Web page is that a barrier for one
individual might actually be exactly what another needs to maintain
attention and to understand how the content is organized.
