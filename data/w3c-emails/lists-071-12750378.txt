ACK, and by the way, there is also a clear statement according to Jakob
Nielsen (and every experience you ever made testing interfaces): Only provide the
functionality to search a site, not the Web. If users want to search the
Web, they use their preferred search engine (portal applications might represent
an exception, but I don't use any portal to search the Web, either).


Best regards,
 Jens.
