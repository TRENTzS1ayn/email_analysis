Some unsorted feedback...

So I'm interested in further recommendations, because I see advantages
(don't have the need to 'tab' down fifty navigation links) as well as
disadvantages (maybe some Usability problems; it has to be determined how profoundly they
are, I guess).

I think an alternative 'tabspace' might be helpful, but changing the order
within a form only confuses users, so I'm not sure if this feature is needed
at all (assuming the 'default tab order' is consistent). IMO it's
inconsiderate to change the tab order of form elements because it only proves that the
displayed order ain't sufficient. In consequence I'm not sure if the HTML
Techniques example is appropriate.

AFAIK there is an established convention by (normally, in some cases there
might be exceptions) displaying the 'Submit' (or whatever similar) button
first, followed by the negative option ('Cancel', 'Reset'). A good example are
operating systems (check the UNIX or Windows dialogues), inter alia. I don't
think that this has to be changed, and the more common a solution is
(convention), the better Usability it offers.

Related to the 'priority' or 'importance' sorting (of buttons) I think it's
quite reasonable not to offer 'Okay' first when the user is e.g about to
format its hard drive -- but I'm not that familiar with dialogues of this kind.

What do you concretely mean in this case? (I better want to ask first before
starting to criticize anything...)


All the best,
 Jens.
