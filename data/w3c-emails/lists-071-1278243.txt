assuming that I have got the gist- 

I think the testability thing is overdone, and I am not sure why we need techniques to be testable. The success criteria are testable. Making the techniques testable may be overkill , (with negative and positive criteria, and test cases.....) - might reduce usability. 

Overdoing descriptions, commentary, implementation notes, links to resources or training materials, may also reduce usability. The thing should read well, give you a sense of context, similar to the old techniques. But too many links to resource 

will be confusing. 

In general I find this document hard to understand. for example: 

<quote> 

Where technologies work together (e.g., HTML and CSS), relevant joint techniques must be presented with the host technology (e.g., HTML). If techniques do not involve interactions between the two technologies, they must be presented with the techniques for their respective technology only. 

Techniques must state to which versions of the technology they apply, that is, describe a practice to avoid or that will have a positive accessibility impact. They may specify all versions, all versions prior to or later than a particular version, or enumerate particular versions. 

</quote> 

is obtuse, but the point is actually simple (unless I have missed the point). 

I think it means, for each technique state what technologies (and dependent technologies and versions of technologies) apply. 

CSS also has application to XML. 

all the best, 

Lisa

  Subject: [TECH] Requirements for Techniques v0.3


  Attached is version 0.3 of the Techniques requirements. I apologize that I
  did not complete this before the holidays, but you know, things get busy.
  This version incorporates comments received to date (unless I've lost track
  of any) and adds a little more structure.

  The plan is that this version should be close to ready to post as a public
  draft. We have tentatively scheduled a teleconference for Wednesday, January
  8 at 10:30am U.S. Eastern Time (I think this is 15:30 UTC). This call would
  be for people who want to discuss the Techniques in detail. On the January 9
  WCAG call we will hopefully be ready to request the group's approval to post
  this to TR - keeping in mind that it is still a draft.
