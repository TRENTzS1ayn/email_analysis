I have the same problem. I don't think we could raccomend accesskeys without
considering the real-world implementation problems. As already said, there
are very few keys we can use without keyboard commands conflict. Yes, it's a
user agent problem, but without a basic key scheme raccomandation, every
user agent will go on in that way, and accesskey will not be implemented by
designers. We need a robust solution in the real world. Any idea?
