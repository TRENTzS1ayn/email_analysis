Jon,
  I'm asking primarily from a User Agent point of view. We are worried
about the accessibility implications of access keys in PDF files. We
have the advantage that there are many fewers user agents for this
format, but the disadvantage that nearly all keystroke combinations
are already in use for something. 
 It is valuable to know that Opera provides a mode for enabling and
disabling access keys. 

Thanks, Loretta
