Our trick is to give access to the technique whilst doing a fantastic job of making it invisible.
if you do a thing well, people don't notice the technique, in many cases describing is redundant,  and in the case of humour or magic, well as the saying goes.....

so rather far from where we are now....
I've found that the reductionist approach taken in the past has left many things near impossible to achieve, 
so the earlier we demonstrate accessible examples of what we wish to promote, as well as 'fictional' guidelines the better.-)
