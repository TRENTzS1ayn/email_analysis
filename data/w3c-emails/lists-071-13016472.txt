small but important addition to 3.4, (use consistent presentation)
 
it is very important that key terms and  key information that the user
most typically - 

we want to supply users with a schematic/ summaries of sites and pages
so they can find the content that they need. To do that we need
important content marketed up, as important content - the author needs
to provide and create a structure

 

(note: this is  similar to 3.4   however we are adding a requirement  to
_identify_  important content- and then incorporate it into structural
mark up )

 

 

 

All the best
