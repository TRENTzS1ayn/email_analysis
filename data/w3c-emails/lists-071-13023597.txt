Moving on to checkpoint 4.3 - 
Assure that technologies required to render the content are listed and
widely available -- OR -- Use widely available technologies to render
content, and list the technologies that are required [level 2 guideline]

 
 
 
I am not completely comfortable with the way this is handled. I think
interoperability between operating system (such as is inevitable by
using w3 technologies - as required by WCAG1.0) needs to be included and
should be level one. Alliteratively this section could be removed and
put in the introduction to the guidelines, IE: that we have an
explanatory text that explains that following these guidelines is only
useful when the user, in what ever environment they may be in, can
actually make use of the accessible fetchers
 
 
 
next point:
 
Something that affects me a a developer of new techniques
Technologies and features on the required list are available in at least
two independently-developed implementations. (it is preferable that the
technologies used for the implementations have been supported for at
least one prior version of the software)
if the new technologies are server side but the resulting html is widely
accessible - I assume that that is OK? Needs to be clear.
 
 

All the best
