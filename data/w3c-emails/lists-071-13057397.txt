The assumption here is that all guidelines are *machine*-testable.

My feedback is that Chris is ideologically reluctant to accept that some
accessibility guidelines will never be machine-testable. It took hours and
thousands of words of explanation before he would finally reluctantly
conded that colour combinations for colour-normal visually-impaired people
could not be machine-tested.

Of course it's possible to test all accessibility provisions. It would be
very interesting to have multiplatform, standards-compliant tools to
facilitate all kinds of testing-- machine- and human-driven. But if this
is a cover story to twist and deform WCAG into an undifferentiated set of
machine-testable guidelines, we have a problem.
