Apropos the subject line, what's a "4.3"?

A terrible idea. Some ancient HTML techniques, like <a rel> or <a type>,
are virtually unsupported. And now we're going to limit what future
technologies people can use?

Why not just de-invent the Web?

In any event, for W3C technologies, we elsewhere require valid code. If
it's in the spec, *you may use it*, and it is not your problem that IE6
still has 90% market share and nobody has a user agent that supports it.
Or, more relevantly to this esteemed Working Group's history, it is not
relevant that the heavily-favoured Jaws program does not support it.
