Apropos the subject line, what's a "3.2"?

Let's see. You run a very large database-driven site whose pages do not
exist until they are requested by the visitor. Please explain how every
single page <title> can be unique, especially if the pages are search
results.

What if you were searching for 20 different terms at once? Then separately
for 20 different terms? What would the page <title>s be?

*Real* *examples*, please, not blandishments and diktats. Prove it can be
done in real-world sites.

Still an appallingly misguided and irrelevant concept. As has been
demonstrated already, page authors cannot be expected to simultaneously
write valid HTML and also write HTML that can be spontaneously remixed by
some user agent or other. How many times do I have to tell you this before
you believe it?

Skill-testing question: If Freedom Scientific comes out with another
whiz-bang feature, as they did with browsing by headings and links, will
WAI WG obediently turn around and flirt with the idea of forcing authors
to write their sites to facilitate this company-specific peccadillo?

Give me a break. I won't let anyone tell me I have to link every word I
write to a lexicon, and neither will any other writer.
