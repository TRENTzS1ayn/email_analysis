Worth adding to that

Some EURO accessibility stuff is being written using the lexicon concept
. And a parser is being made for them to do it.
Parsers isn't hard things to write.

All the best

Last time this was discussed I believe it was pointed out that you could
readily link a lexicon to a page. That's one link per page. Or one link
for the site encompassing the Voice Of America broadcast transcripts
(assuming they have such a thing - maybe they could ask the NSA to
provide it for them <grin/>) which really do use their lexicon.

The difficulties with this part of the proposal are about how to choose
an appropriate lexicon, not about whether there can be tools that do it.
I made a set of tools for the published literature of an aboriginal
language (admittedly a small body of work, and no you cannot see it -
nor can I anymore, because there are issues besides accessibility in
play). Some large companies use such tools for developing their own
content.

In other words, I think you're misreading the statement. I also think
that the proposal is interesting, but not fully developed (then again,
WCAG 2 is currently a working draft, so the proposal is probably at an
adequate level of development).
