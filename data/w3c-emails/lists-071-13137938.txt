Most web developers I know say this is machine testable against a table 
of colour combinations.  It's a parsing nightmare, but so many other 
things are too.  But at the same time I don't see anyone willing to 
invest their time in this when so many other things, especially in 
accessibility, need attending too.

All I am doing is making a point that colour combinations are machine 
testable.
