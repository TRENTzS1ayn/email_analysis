Chaals,

as usual on the button, but would add that it's not sufficient now to 
create accessible new technology and pages.
What is significant is the need for simple and good authoring tools.
Unfortunately there still isn't a great html authoring tool, smirk kind 
of looks promising. jsketch is great for SVG.

But, and many of you may not credit this, but publishing is still a 
very complex issue.

Teaching staff at our college after 2 years working on peepo, have not 
really come to terms with the reality of the separation of these two 
activities. Indeed that college doesn't have the skill set to manage 
there own site and farms this out.
creating a navigeable site is just not trivial. SVG does nothing to 
improve this issue, which is a fundamental barrier to public access.

Accessibility has to mean good tools for publishing complex sites, and 
it doesn't yet.
We haven't developed the lexicon that describes what a site is, and so 
it's still a dream.

thanks
