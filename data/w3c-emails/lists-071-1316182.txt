I agree. It is supposed to address the needs of audiences that aren't
well met by more technical documents such as WCAG techniques, as well
as to provide a more integrated, tutorial-style explanation of

have the opportunity to comment on this work and to collaborate with
EO to ensure that the resulting documents are technically sound and in
accord with the guidelines.
