There is no misconception here, and you do not need to type in values 
manually.  You can parse both style sheets and pages.  With style sheets 
you can identify the color and background-color and compare their 
compatibility.  If you have been informed otherwise you have been 
misled.  If you have a programming background you would know that this 
is not difficult.  Trying to apply it to HTML soup is another question 
all together, but to well formed markup it is not a problem.

There is software that detects skin tone within images using this approach.
