I think this is where the developer should choose fonts appropriate for 
the device; screen, print, whatever, and set them in relative units.

There are other techniques like using a choice of skins/switcher css for 
the user.  Users need to also take some responsibility for configuring 
their computer and user agent so that their base system responds 
according to their needs; ie font sizes, types etc.

Its pretty straight forward to be able to parse the following and 
compare the contrast between the color values and conclude which has 
enough variation in color contrast.  There is probably a need for more 
complex rule sets for various problematic color combinations, like red 
and blue, when combined tend to make it difficult for aging eyes to 
focus on.  But its machine testable.

eg

Ex 1

content {
color: #000000;
background-color: #FFFFFF;
}

Ex 2

content {
color: #33CCCC;
background-color: #6699CC;
}
