Excuse me for my comments, but I want to add two notes: First of all, where
should the definition of legibility be set to, what is readable, what is not?
That might not be a current problem, but I imagine cases where a future
validator says 'your page ain't readable by visually impaired users' where the
color scheme e.g. bases on dark blue on light gray background (which is often
legible); maybe the site author also provides alternative mechanisms to
improve legibility which are not analyzed.

On the other hand, I basically agree that such a mechanism is constructable,
I'm convinced that it ain't that difficult to create an application which
analyzes color values and calculates a value which represents a legibility
factor. But if you want to go further, you will soon encounter other problems
which will not be testable, some of them include 'real' Accessibility issues,
others will be non-testable Usability criterions (and as I often remarked on
this list: unusable means inaccessible).


All the best,
 Jens.
