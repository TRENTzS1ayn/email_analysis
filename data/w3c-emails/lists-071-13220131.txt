Dear Jason, Gregg, WAI Content Guidelines Working Group, 

I would like to ask if the Errata for WCAG 1.0 (http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WAI-WEBCONTENT-ERRATA) could be updated to reflect the changes in guidance so far incorporated into WCAG 2.0 (for example, the fact that the flash rate considered unacceptable for content has changed from a range of 4 to 59 hertz  to a new range of 3 to 49 hertz).

I am asking this as the Chair person of the EuroAccessibility Consortium's Task Force 3 who's task is to produce a harmonised European approach to evaluating the accessibility of Web content.  

In order to be as flexible in our approach as possible we are looking to take into account the changes in guidance being suggested in Version 2 of the guidelines, but have the issue that if we do incorporate these changes our approach would then be in breach of the guidance given in WCAG 1.0.   

We would very much like to see this matter resolved quickly, and would state again that an updated Errata would be most beneficial as everyone could work with the new material in WCAG 2.0 on the official basis that WAI considers it to be an errata to WCAG 1.0.    

Very Best Regards 

Alistair 

Alistair Garrison
