To The Group -

As an individual with color deficiency issue - red/green, blue/yellow and
some other visual conditions that limit color combination identification -
I'd like to chime-in on this topic.  I believe full-well that authors can
come close to  determining color combinations that work "okay" for most web
users but also believe it will NEVER be perfect.  Color values can be
machine testable but it seems unlikely that running such a test will solve
ALL the probable vision issues related to color and color combinations.

Then there is the issue of how colors render with different computer
systems, monitors, etc.  I recall a Photoshop expert saying, how different
colors were on Macs compared to PC's  - had to do with light intensity as I
recall.  

I am only saying what I am because of my own experience with color
deficiency and the fact that these issues are so specific to each individual
that science DOES NOT have all the answers.  We need to remember, it's NOT
just about color - it's about the overall ability to perceive visually of
which color is a part of that perception.

I am not agreeing or disagreeing with anyone - only stating my views as a
person who has SIGNIFICANT issues related to color issues (again, not JUST
the color aspect).
