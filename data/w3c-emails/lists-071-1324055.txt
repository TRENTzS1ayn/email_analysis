overnight I wondered if OS developers should be included as an 'audience', there are so many issues around configuring computers that might benefit from being more closely related to browser usage.

for instance many teachers in a recent 'configuring to meet the needs of SLD users' training were unaware of much that is currently possible.
eg changing the tooltip font size, but shouldn't this be related to the header size in any case?

obviously this is a large topic, sorry if it seems to also be off topic...
