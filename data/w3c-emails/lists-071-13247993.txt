Subject: Late Regrets - I Guess (message follows)



I was out of town and did not receive an agenda via e-mail.  Not sure
what
happened.  I had assumed that there must not have been a meeting due to
Tokyo.  Did write to the group to have an agenda forwarded (never
received
one).  Anyway, late regrets - I tried my best.

I assume there is NO meeting this coming Thursday.
