Response to post please!

mouse gestures represents a potential problem similar to pop ups.
perhaps my previous post wasn't explicit enough.
maybe the guidelines already include recommendations, but they aren't 
springing to mind.
apologies if so..... especially if my smiley face has some esoteric 
meaning I've not taken into account, Judy

please take a look and comment
