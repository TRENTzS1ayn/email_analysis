> mouse gestures represent a potential problem similar to pop ups.

They do nothing of the sort. Mouse gestures are a user-agent issue. If any
accessibility issues were extant, they would be the domain of the User
Agent Accessibility Guidelines.

I can quite readily see accessibility *benefit* to mouse gestures, which
are already implemented in Opera. I can see certain mobility-impaired,
visually-impaired, or dyslexic persons liking them, for example. And
besides, they're always optional.

As ever, as soon as somebody invents something new, fun, useful, or (most
often of all) attractive, there's an immediate denunciation on this
esteemed List. "Problem." Hardly.
