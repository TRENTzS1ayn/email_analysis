Matt, Doyle and Joe

David was the only respondent prepared to consider* before shooting 
their mouth off, we all make mistakes.....
presumably you're also GB present and appreciated David!

All your further thoughts would be appreciated. it's a long time since 
anyone in WCAG put anytime into the script-tech document.
I wrote and edited with the help of Jim and Wendy, and it still has a 
long way to go.

Less hot air from you folks and a little more shoulder to the wheel 
could be a prayer for the day.
javascript crap is very prevalent, if you don't know this already have 
a chat with Jim, or take a look at some of my pages :-)

thanks

*I gave a link where javascript is used to implement mouse gestures, 
and mentioned that I'd updated the script techs document that I 
maintain.
Surely that makes it clear that this is nothing to do with user agents, 
or browser implemented mouse gesture.

copy of original mail below:

not sure what the accessibility issues might be, but didn't work for me 
on mac, only pc with ie6.

have added link to script techs document:

thanks
