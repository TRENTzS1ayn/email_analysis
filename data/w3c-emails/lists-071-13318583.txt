Hello everyone,

I have a major deadline/presentation Friday morning, which I'm having
trouble with because I've not been feeling well these last two weeks. I'm
feeling better now but have a lot of catching up to do. Unfortunately this
prevents me from attending the meeting.

Yvette Hoitink
CEO Heritas, Enschede, The Netherlands
