WAI-GL crap is also prevalent and more germane to our discussion.

In all fairness to my esteemed colleague, he does glancingly bruise 
an important point. WAI needs a much more real-world evaluation of 
issues that straddle browsers and content. Pop-up windows; longdesc 
handling; user stylesheets; and frame and iframe handling are topics 
that come to mind.

WAI's reflex in such cases tends to be simple: BAN IT! even though 
none of the people advocating the banning has ever bothered to survey 
the existing uses of those technologies, let alone ways to deal with 
inaccessibility that do not force authors to rewrite their work the 
WAI way.

I certainly agree with Phill's posting:

My working philosophy for today is: If we have a chance to offload 
what would otherwise be a Web Content Accessibility Guideline onto 
one of the other guidelines, let's do it. WCAG WG tends to screw up 
more than the other working groups do. WCAG WG also seems less 
clueful about the Web, and more contemptuous of it, than the other 
working groups. The more we let other working groups handle these 
issues, the fewer problems we'll have after everyone's guidelines are 
frozen and published.
