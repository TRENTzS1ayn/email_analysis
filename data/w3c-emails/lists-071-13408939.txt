This is a good and interesting point.

 

It would be good to "migrate' 1.0 toward 2.0 to make later transition
easier.  However, I don't think we can revise 1.0 using the errata
mechanism.  I think that can only be used for real mistakes.  

 

Judy?   Is this correct?  Or can we use this to amend the old guidelines?


 

In either case we need to open a discussion on how to assist in
harmonization and transition.

 

Thanks.

Subject: WCAG 1.0 - Errata Update Needed...

 

Dear Jason, Gregg, WAI Content Guidelines Working Group, 

 

I would like to ask if the Errata for WCAG 1.0 (
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WAI-WEBCONTENT-ERRATA>
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WAI-WEBCONTENT-ERRATA) could be updated to reflect
the changes in guidance so far incorporated into WCAG 2.0 (for example, the
fact that the flash rate considered unacceptable for content has changed
from a range of 4 to 59 hertz  to a new range of 3 to 49 hertz).

 

I am asking this as the Chair person of the EuroAccessibility Consortium's
Task Force 3 who's task is to produce a harmonised European approach to
evaluating the accessibility of Web content.  

 

In order to be as flexible in our approach as possible we are looking to
take into account the changes in guidance being suggested in Version 2 of
the guidelines, but have the issue that if we do incorporate these changes
our approach would then be in breach of the guidance given in WCAG 1.0.   

 

We would very much like to see this matter resolved quickly, and would state
again that an updated Errata would be most beneficial as everyone could work
with the new material in WCAG 2.0 on the official basis that WAI considers
it to be an errata to WCAG 1.0.    

 

Very Best Regards 

 

Alistair 

 

Alistair Garrison
Chair - Task Force 3
