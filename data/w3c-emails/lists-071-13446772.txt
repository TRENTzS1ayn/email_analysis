I would suggest "WCAG 1.0, Second Edition" as per a number of updated
W3C specs (XHTML, XML, etc) that use such terminology.

http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/

"This document is the second edition of the XHTML 1.0 specification
incorporating the errata changes as of 1 August 2002. Changes
between this version and the previous Recommendation are illustrated
in a diff-marked version."

"This second edition is not a new version of XHTML 1.0 (first published
26 January 2000). The changes in this document reflect corrections
applied as a result of comments submitted by the community and as a
result of ongoing work within the HTML Working Group. There are no
substantive changes in this document - only the integration of
various errata."

http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006

"This second edition is not a new version of XML (first published 10
February 1998); it merely incorporates the changes dictated by the
first-edition errata (available at 
http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-19980210-errata)
as a convenience to readers. The errata list for this second edition
is available at http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-V10-2e-errata."

http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/PER-xml-20031030/

"This document is a Proposed Edited Recommendation of the W3C. This
third edition is not a new version of XML. As a convenience to readers,
it incorporates the changes dictated by the accumulated errata
(available at http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-V10-2e-errata) to the Second
Edition of XML 1.0, dated 6 october 2000. In addition, markup has been
introduced on a significant portion of the prescriptions of the
specification, clarifying when prescriptive keywords such as MUST,
SHOULD and MAY are used in the formal sense defined in [IETF RFC 2119"

As Joe Clark pointed out, this is what I proposed in May:

This is the approach which I feel would have the greatest benefits to
the working group, the Web developers, and the general public.

WCAG 1.0 is with us now, and is being used -- likely in an "unpatched"
mode by developers, most of whom NEVER look at the errata -- and will
continue to be used as WCAG 2.0 work proceeds.  Once WCAG 2.0 is
adopted, there is no guarantee that WCAG 1.0 will fall by the wayside;
there is a lot invested in WCAG 1.0, from official policies to software
tools, which will make the idea of an easy switch very hard to do for
some audiences.

Those audiences will benefit greatly from a WCAG 1.0 Second Edition,
especially if work on WCAG 2.0 takes longer than expected.
