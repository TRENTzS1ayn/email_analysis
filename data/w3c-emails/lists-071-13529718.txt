:
In the example for abbreviation, are WWW and SSN not acronyms?  After reading these examples I began to wonder what I should  expect to see under acronyms. Definition from Merrian Webster online Dic. (that's an abbreviation!)
Abbreviation:  a shortened form of a written word or phrase used in place of the whole <amt is an abbreviation for amount, or rehab for rehabilitation>
Acronym: a word (as NATO) formed from the initial letter or letters of each of the successive parts or major parts of a  compound term
