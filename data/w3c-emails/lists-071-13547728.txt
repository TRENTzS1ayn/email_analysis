To:"Sailesh Panchang"<sailesh.panchang@deque.com>,<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>

one of my co-workers was architect at alta-vista so I asked him; seems
that 'most' search engines should be expected to parse text that is in
elements and can be expected to parse certain attribute values, like
alt, as well.

Under the section that talks about:
Using markup (and style sheets) where possible rather than images
promotes accessibility,
it says:
* Search engines can use text information.
 
Question:  Do search engines really  scan alt text given for images  ?
They might be able to but do they really do so now in practice? This
claim should be justifiable.
