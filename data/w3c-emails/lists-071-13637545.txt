Section 10.2 says:
Also while the title attribute can be used on most elements, it should not be used on the img element. The semantics of title are too easily confused with alt and longdesc... and browser support is inconsistent.  
Comment: This is a retrograde step... the title attribute is an excellent  vehicle for conveying context / navigation specific info and  should be retained. What is needed is  more education  on the correct use of alt, title and longdesc. Also consistent browser implementation   for these attributes should  be encouraged through user agent guidelines.

So the HTML tech doc should not suggest that title not be used on images.
