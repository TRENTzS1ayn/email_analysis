Longdesc should be described as a link to another document that explains
what the image is about and how it works if it is a chart or table.
Note the _link_.
 
The TITLE attribute can be used on the Anchor, but not in the <img> tag.
The TITLE attribute should not be used on an image that is used for
navigation.  However, as the Anchor is used it can provided useful
information using the TITLE attribute.
 
I hope this helps.
 
Sincerely,
Lee Roberts

Section 10.2 says:
Also while the title attribute can be used on most elements, it should
not be used on the img element. The semantics of title are too easily
confused with alt and longdesc... and browser support is inconsistent.  
Comment: This is a retrograde step... the title attribute is an
excellent  vehicle for conveying context / navigation specific info and
should be retained. What is needed is  more education  on the correct
use of alt, title and longdesc. Also consistent browser implementation
for these attributes should  be encouraged through user agent
guidelines.
 
So the HTML tech doc should not suggest that title not be used on
images.
