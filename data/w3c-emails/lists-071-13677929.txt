MessageI beg to differ. Alt provides  a short desc for the image. Title can be used in certain situations to provide  additional info about the image- context or grouping, etc and can be used quite effectively for the benefit of vision impaired users. Some browsers  display the title as a tool tip / on the status bar that can be accessed by sighted users as well.   
  When an image is made a link and is accompanied by a  redundant text link ( section 9.3 of HTML techniques doc), it is OK as the doc suggests to have a null alt (and a null title if I might add).   That does not mean alt should not be  used on images or image links and  accordingly the techniques doc does not suggest that as it suggests that title should not be used with IMG element.

  The most effective   way to convey the destination of an image  that is a link (and has no adjacent text link) is through the alt and again the title on the IMG is not needed. Title attribute in the anchor might  help for instance if the image link conveys a grouping not apparent to a non sighted user. 
  While browser support for longdesc  will improve over time  and become consistent (I hope), it can be used to provide a fuller describtion   of any image when circumstances warrant ... not just  charts and tables.
  Sincerely,
  Sailesh

  Longdesc should be described as a link to another document that explains what the image is about and how it works if it is a chart or table.  Note the _link_.

  The TITLE attribute can be used on the Anchor, but not in the <img> tag.  The TITLE attribute should not be used on an image that is used for navigation.  However, as the Anchor is used it can provided useful information using the TITLE attribute.

  I hope this helps.

  Lee Roberts

    Ref:
    http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-HTML-TECHS-20031104.html
    Section 10.2 says:
    Also while the title attribute can be used on most elements, it should not be used on the img element. The semantics of title are too easily confused with alt and longdesc... and browser support is inconsistent.  
    Comment: This is a retrograde step... the title attribute is an excellent  vehicle for conveying context / navigation specific info and  should be retained. What is needed is  more education  on the correct use of alt, title and longdesc. Also consistent browser implementation   for these attributes should  be encouraged through user agent guidelines.
     
    So the HTML tech doc should not suggest that title not be used on images.
