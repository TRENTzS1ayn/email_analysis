Screen reader support info requested in Editorial note in Section 6:
JAWS For Windows 4.50.138, 4.51.119 and 5.0.621 support access to lists and navigation. So does Windows Eyes 4.50 (release Sept 16, 03). They announce presence of nested lists,number of items in list,  going to top of list and end of list.
WindowEyes also allows  skipping forward and backward between list items. ... useful when  individual items occupy more than one line. 
Home Page Reader 3.0.02 (with update patch) does not recognize lists.
