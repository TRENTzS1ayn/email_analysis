The purpose of the meeting is to resume detailed consideration of the

(http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/), to agree on wording that will appear in
the next public draft of WCAG 2.0.

At the face to face meeting, the working group progressed as far as
guideline 1.6 (not including the success criteria thereof).
