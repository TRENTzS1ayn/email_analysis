Hi,

Screen readers like JAWS with multilingual synthesizers like Eloquence are
beginning to be able to swich language on the fly. In JAWS it has worked
since before version 4, or it mayh have been added in version 4, and with
the release of JFW 5  in september JAWS kan now identify the language if it
is marked up. The question is not tto markup every word that may originate
from other languages  e.g. English but to markup a block of text written in
a another language, and then hope that the screen reader has an installed
synthesizer that can speak this language, and you never know on the
devvelopper site of the webpage but that is life!

Also remember that for braille devices the same applies for reading
contracted braille.
