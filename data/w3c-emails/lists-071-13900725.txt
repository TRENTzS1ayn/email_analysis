Hi Claus,

In the examples I gave in my article
(http://www.heritas.nl/wcag/language.html) which examples do you think would
need to be marked up? How can we give clear guidelines so a developer knows
which foreign words have to be marked as such? 

My personal estimate is that the Shell website would be OK as it is (page
marked up as Dutch even though there are some English words) where the
LogicaCMG website would need a lot of markup to identify English texts.
Marking up foreign sentences would fall into the 'must do' category for me,
whereas marking up occasional foreign words would be a 'should do' or even
just 'could do' depending on how easy it is to recognize the word when
pronounced in the main language of the text. "Sitemap", even when pronounced
in Dutch, can be easily recognized. "Email" on the other hand, becomes a
different word with a different meaning when pronounced in Dutch (thanks to
Ineke for the example).

There will always be cases where there just isn't a solution within the
current HTML specs, even if you want to go out of your way to mark up every
foreign word. Cadeaushoppen is an example of this: the word 'cadeau' is a
Dutch gallicism, 'shoppen' is a Dutch anglicism but the combination will
probably never be in the official Dutch word list. It would be wonderful if
the HTML standard could incorporate a mechanism to phonetically describe how
to pronounce such words, but that's just blue sky thinking. Working within
the current standards, we can only attach one language to each word. 

Also, could you please clarify what you mean by contracted braille? I am not
familiar with this term but would deduce that it involves language-specific
abbreviations to speed up braille reading, is that a correct assumption?
