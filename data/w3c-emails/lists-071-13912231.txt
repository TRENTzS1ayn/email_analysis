Gegroet Ineke,


well, thank you for clarification, but ain't this rather a problem in
screenreader programming since these obviously don't represent the (more or less)
natural flow and extensions of a language? Language is context sensitive (take
the email example), and if it's impossible (what I think it is) to develop
an application which is really able to understand (not to read) language, this
problem will simply never be solved.

And also imagine there are new or made-up words in a language, should they
be ignored since any new e.g. JAWS version doesn't support it? And for what
version of an e.g. screenreader should an author 'optimize' his site? Is it at
least realistic?


Best regards,
 Jens.


PS.
I absolutely agree that this problem exists, but I'm not sure if it can or
even should be solved (perhaps even violently, as I perceive these ideas).
