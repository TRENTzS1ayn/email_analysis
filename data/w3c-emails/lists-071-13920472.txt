Very interesting message about multilingual texts, Yvette! Thanks.

You asked about the term "contracted braille." Your assumption is correct-- it involves dot-configurations that represent multiple letters or even entire words.  In English, for example, the word "for" is represented by a Braille cell containing all six dots.  The word "the" is represented by dots 2,3, 4, and 6.  (The cell is arranged in two columns of three cells each; numbering goes vertically, so column 1 contains dots 1-3 and column 2 has 4-6.)

Hi Claus,

In the examples I gave in my article
(http://www.heritas.nl/wcag/language.html) which examples do you think would need to be marked up? How can we give clear guidelines so a developer knows which foreign words have to be marked as such? 

My personal estimate is that the Shell website would be OK as it is (page marked up as Dutch even though there are some English words) where the LogicaCMG website would need a lot of markup to identify English texts. Marking up foreign sentences would fall into the 'must do' category for me, whereas marking up occasional foreign words would be a 'should do' or even just 'could do' depending on how easy it is to recognize the word when pronounced in the main language of the text. "Sitemap", even when pronounced in Dutch, can be easily recognized. "Email" on the other hand, becomes a different word with a different meaning when pronounced in Dutch (thanks to Ineke for the example).

There will always be cases where there just isn't a solution within the current HTML specs, even if you want to go out of your way to mark up every foreign word. Cadeaushoppen is an example of this: the word 'cadeau' is a Dutch gallicism, 'shoppen' is a Dutch anglicism but the combination will probably never be in the official Dutch word list. It would be wonderful if the HTML standard could incorporate a mechanism to phonetically describe how to pronounce such words, but that's just blue sky thinking. Working within the current standards, we can only attach one language to each word. 

Also, could you please clarify what you mean by contracted braille? I am not familiar with this term but would deduce that it involves language-specific abbreviations to speed up braille reading, is that a correct assumption?
