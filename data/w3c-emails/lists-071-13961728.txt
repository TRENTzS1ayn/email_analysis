FYI, another term for this game is "Buzzword Bingo", and may actually be
more common.  Compare:

The comic strip "Dilbert" helped to popularize the concept, which is
credited to Silicon Graphics founder Tom Davis:

For an international audience including American readers, it would
make more sense to refer to "buzzword bingo" instead of "bullshit
bingo."
