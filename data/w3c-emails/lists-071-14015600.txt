Hello Kynn and list,

Great solution! I hadn't heard this name for the game before but I agree it
is more appropriate for a professional document. If it's more common than my
term, even better. I have accordingly changed the name in the online version
(http://www.heritas.nl/wcag/language.html) to 'buzzword bingo'.
