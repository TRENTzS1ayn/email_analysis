Since the entire discussion only centers to sitemap spelling, I'm quite sure
there will be a realistic solution soon. And to participate to this
high-level discussion, I propose to fight all spelling mistakes first since they are
the greatest danger for screenreaders, and in step 2 please prohibit at least
all language changes, including technical terms and Latin and Greek
vocabulary.

Well, my last serious attempt: a) Encourage voice browser etc. vendors to
extend the vocabulary they ship within their software, to make sure common
terms resulting from IT ('email', 'client', 'server' etc.), medical science,
physics, Latin ('conclusio', 'id est', 'errata' etc.) and so on are integrated
properly (whereby paying attention to each languages extended vocabulary); b)
recommend to semantically mark up phrases and paragraphs from other than the
documents language; c) emphasize hyperlinks directing to other language
sources; d) honor language dynamics by accepting them and thus prioritizing a).

PS.
I'm convinced that the WAI is one of the most important things the W3C
created, so I start feeling angry seeing some ignorance (like the initiative
reacts related to usability, which is again strongly interconnected to all
accessibility issues, but this seems to be irrelevant to most on this list). Are
there really only people seeing -one- part of the puzzle?

PPS.
I hope the next topic will get more serious and realistic again. Excuse me
for being that offensive at provocative, at last I'll now stop intervening
here.
