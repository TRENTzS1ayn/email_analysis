I'm wondering whether the best approach is to say:

1.if this is a passage or phrase that is clearly in another
language or uses a different script, use lang or xml:lang to indicate
that 
(for a different script this can sometimes be useful for
rendering visually - eg. browsers sometimes automatically apply Japanese
vs. Chinese fonts to the same character based on the language info)

2.if this is a borrowed word or phrase, use your judgement to
guess what a voice browser will do with it in the language of the page,
then mark it as in a foreign language if you feel it is appropriate.
you might not mark it up if you think 
a. the tts process will do a pretty good job anyway in getting
the gist across (either because it may be in the dictionary or the
guessed pronunciation will be close enough to be understandable, or
because the pronunciation has been adapted to the phones of the native
language (eg. voir-dire) ), or 
b. if you think that the tts process will just bypass a word in
another language (which might be worse than a bad pronunciation).

PS:  I think the Japanese Macudonarudo would come out fine in a tts
process, because the Japanese script used (katakana) is close to
phonetic.  (Fortunately, because if you were to worry about that you'd
have serious problems, since there are hundreds of everyday words and
many more trendy borrowings in Japanese.  (naifu, fo-ku, chi-zu,
compyutaa, eskareetaa, erebeetaa, pen, doaa, etc, etc are all standard
words for everyday items in Japan, and they continue to assimilate such
words, but if they are written in japanese script its easy to word out
the pronunciation, which generally becomes Japanised too in the
process))
