Context isn't machine-testable.  However, it's probably possible to design user-testing scenarios that would effectively capture whether a word or phrase strikes users as "foreign" when encountered in a specific context, and whether or not language markup makes a difference to comprehension.

But are these testable?

Surely the deciding factors are:
1. context
2. audience
 
Firstly, any ambiguous words should be marked up - not only in the accessibility sense but where those words are not core to the language
in question - and for all possible user types. The markup should be:
<foreign>...</foreign> or some such meaningful tag.
 
To decide if a word or phase is foreign to the language context it is 
written in, one criteria would be to see if the author's spell and grammar checker picks it up. That's, of course, if the author does not know themselves that the word is "foreign" [in the broadest sense of that word].
 
So: looking at the ambiguity of /r?sum?/
 
1. Context:
When a user has their browser set to "french" then all the french words
around our "ambiguous" word should guide how a screen reader reads the
"ambiguous" word - i.e. as regular french
 
Conversely, "le weekend" is pronounced with French intonation by French people.
 
Where /r?sum?/ appears in an English language context then by default
the local language intonation should apply e.g. English.
 
2. Audience:
When /r?sum?/ appears in a non-French language context then the audience rule applies. 
There needs to be not only a language setting but and internationalization  setting that says: "pronounce borrowed foreign words with their "native/foreign" or "local" intontation.
 
Finally, usually as a block of text is translated from one language to another the foreign/borrowed/ambiguous words remain the same.
This situation is only trumped when the context language is the same as the ambiguous word or there is a more commonly used local word in the context 
language that better captures the sense of the word for the context audience.
 
[i]US English > [ii]UK English > [iii]French > [iv]German
 
[i]    Where is your r?sum??
[ii]    Where is your CV?
[iii]   Ou est ton curriculum vitae? [missing accents]
[iv]   Wo ist dein Lebenslauf?
 


Thanks,

I think we need to bring this back out to the question "in question," though - here, we have only solved one small problem.  Can we legislate this kind of change?  And, if yes, or if no, how do we answer Richard Ishida's question: what constitutes language change that MUST be marked up, and what constitutes language change that SHOULD be marked up, etc.

We've run into terminology issues here at Boeing, not as a screen reader problem but as a usability issue, and have recently switched from "sitemap" (one word, which is common) to "text index" which we found more commonly used and descriptive. Maybe this small change could help?

In Dutch, the word 'sitemap' (one word) is used a lot. This is yet another
example of the Dutch habit of glueing words together, which is gramatically
correct in Dutch. This is so normal for me I didn't even recognize this as
not being entirely English...

Dutchmen pronounce 'sitemap' with the English pronounciation. It is not
(yet) in the Dutch standard wordlist. Just like the word 'cadeaushoppen',
this is another example of a word whose language cannot be identified within
the current HTML standards since it's neither Dutch nor English.

I believe the term is site map (two words) and yes, if 
written as a single word, sitemap - screen readers will not 
pronounce the word as would be desired.

Sitemap is not an official word  in German or Dutch and can be 
pronounced by screenreaders in Dutch as sietemap (ie as ea in sea 
,just like bietensap or fietstas).
        

English screenreaders sometimes have said "sigh tuh map", for this 
word, rather than "site map".
