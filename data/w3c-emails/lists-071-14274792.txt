What is the current status of WCAG1.0 checkpoint 10.5? From my 
understanding, it was added to account for a small percentage of older 
screenreaders that read adjacent links without pause between each, but 
this was when the guidelines were written in 1998. Presumably the market 
share has altered dramatically since that time.

The checkpoint itself [1] begins "Until user agents (including assistive 
technologies) render adjacent links distinctly..." Since it's almost 
2004, I'd like to know if that particular "Until..." has come to pass.

A 'test case' is available according to the UA Support for Accessibility 
page [2] but the link is dead, the page is ancient, and the URL suggests 
it was relevant in 1999.

I'd suspect no decision has been formally made, but for my peace of my 
mind, if I happen to fail this point and only this point in 2003, do I 
pass or fail triple-A?
