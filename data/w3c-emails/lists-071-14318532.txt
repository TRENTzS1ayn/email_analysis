Currently, you "fail" triple-A, but this is a bug in the whole
WCAG 1.0 process to begin with.  There is method by which any
particular person or group was authorized to say that the "Until
user agents..." clauses have been met.  The page author is not
allowed to claim these clauses are fulfilled, and the working
group has not claimed that function either.

Therefore, there is no way you can achieve Triple-A compliance
with WCAG 1.0 unless you meet ALL the requirements, including
all of those that begin with "Until user agents..."  This is not
an accessibility issue, but a "formal procedures" issue.

It is for this reason that the "Until user agents..." clauses are
so disliked and opposed by many, including myself.  The plans for
WCAG 2.0 have long been to totally eliminate any such requirements
that are tied to a specific date in time with no way of certifying
that the conditions have been universally met.

This is just one of many reasons to consider WCAG 1.0 triple-A to
be effectively unreachable; there's little reason to pursue that as
a goal, and instead the goal should be to pursue increased
accessibility and usability for people with disabilities.
