Where is it stated that a page author isn't allowed to make the claim?
I'd be interested in reading up on that. Or is that the bug in this
case, that the door is open for page authors to make that determination?

Completely unrelated to the issue at hand, but since you've got me
curious - will there be checks in place to make sure obsolete guidelines
don't live past their expiry date?

But isn't that the entire point of WCAG 1.0 in the first place? I can
understand deviation between what was, 5 years ago, and what is, in late
2003. But until WCAG2.0 is released, what else can the average developer
be expected to use as a framework for accessibility?
