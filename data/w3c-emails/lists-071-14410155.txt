It's not an absolute pronouncement for the group -- it's an accurate
statement of the situation.

It's not a situation of belief.  The case where "until user agents"
is resolved is NOT defined by the working group or by the specification.

...which is the same effective result as saying that it's not
superseded yet.

This is another reason that a WCAG 1.0 Second Edition is crucial.
If the Working Group has decided to allow certain "until user
agent" checkpoints to be automatically passed by all users, then
this needs to be communicated.  The current situation, in which
the criteria are undefined, is not useful to Web developers, and
really must be remedied soon.  And it should not wait for WCAG
2.0.

You have well-meaning folks like Dave Shea who want to do the
right thing, but the WCAG 1.0 specification doesn't define the
mechanisms by which "until user agents" clauses should be ignored.
