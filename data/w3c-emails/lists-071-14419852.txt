It's not.  But there is no mechanism for making that claim, and no
guidelines by which page authors are "allowed" to specify that such
a state has been reached.

In fact, within the WCAG working group, you will not find unanimity of
opinion.  One respondent said that the conditions for negating the
checkpoint weren't met, because of Lynx.  Another said that they
were.  Is it enough for Safari to support something?  Safari and Opera?
Opera and Mozilla?  Mozilla and Internet Explorer?  Which operating
systems count for "until user agents"?  What languages?  If there is
only one browser in Croatian, does that mean the checkpoint applies for
Croatian pages if the browser doesn't do the right thing?

This is why every single checkpoint with "until user agents" is
fatally flawed.  Checkpoints were given with expiry conditions but
with no information on how those conditions can be met.

To some degree, it can be left up to the author -- but then, so can
all checkpoints.  Reducing accessibility to a series of subjective
decisions made by Web developers with incentive for self-approval,
who likely don't have much knowledge of assistive technology or people
with disabilities is a Real Bad Idea.

Dave, as you and I discussed a while ago, most Web developers are
in the dark about the basics of screen readers, let alone other
assistive technologies.  In order for a Web developer to have the
knowledge necessary to make this decision, they'd have to, well,
know as much about Web accessibility as the WCAG working group
members (even though there's not a unanimous opinion yet).  This
defeats the whole purpose of the guidelines, which is to summarize
information for Web developers who AREN'T Web accessibility
experts.

That is why this is a problem.  Web developers aren't given enough
information to know which rules apply and which don't.

I wouldn't say the bug is that it's left open, I'd say that the bug
is that the "until user agents" clauses don't actually give Web
developers adequate guidance, and requires them to be experts in order
to know whether a checkpoint should be followed.

E.g., you, Dave, are one of the best Web developers around, with skill
that surpasses 99% of the folks out there (and I do admire your work,
and quote you in the Web Accessibility Techniques course), and you
don't even know for sure what those checkpoints are supposed to mean.

Yes, you are smart enough to figure what works for you, but the point
of a standard set of guidelines is to avoid that whole thing where
everyone figures it out themselves. :)

I am not an active member of the WCAG working group currently, so I
will leave this for someone else to answer.  I'm just here as a
kibitzer and an interested party who has to do a lot of the WCAG-to-
Web-developer education himself.

 From what I understand, if anything similar to "until user agents"
is necessary, it will be in technology-specific checkpoints, and not
in base guidelines.

Yes. :)

This is why some of us have been pressing for the WCAG working group
to issue a WCAG 1.0 Second Edition, to fold in errata and bring the
"until user agents" clauses up to date.  You have correctly identified
what I, as a quasi-outsider, see as a serious problem:  WCAG 1.0 is
currently unworkable in the details, and needs some tweaking to restore
it to a form in which 2003/2004 Web developers can address accessibility
until WCAG 2.0 appears.
