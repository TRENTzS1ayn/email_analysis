I'm not against your proposal. A text near the field may be okay, but I
don't know the way non-sighted can use it (where should we put it? I suppose
*just before* the field...). I also think that putting the format help text
in the field is more compact, and the fact that it is *inside* the field
could help. But it's true that some people have trouble using it. Also, the
author should prevent placeholder text from being processed if the user
won't modify it... I suppose this is a little too complicated for simple
sites: the outer field solution it's probably better.

But we need a good way to display format example text, anyway. The
guidelines should advice the better way to display them. Before the field is
ok? There's a proper markup to display them?...
