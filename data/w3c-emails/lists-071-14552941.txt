Suggestion for the gateway techniques

What if gateway techniques went though different scenarios and diseased
what would make this compliant.
 It may help get rid of some of thoughts bad alt tags out there......

For example gateway techniques could separately consider scenarios such
as
 an image in a link : in this case a text equivalent should let the user
know were the page links to 
An image in in a link that contains extra information: in this case a
text equivalent include were the page links to, and any extra
information in the image
A background image: should have a blank text equivalent
A background image with a message: a text equivalent should include the
message of the image or implied content
A spacer image: should have a blank text equivalent
A bullet: a text equivalent should let the user know it is a bullet 
A bullet with an extra message (e.g. "new"): a text equivalent should
let the user know it is a bullet and give any extra information in the
image

I could go on but you probably get the idea...

Don't you just hate it when people suggest more work.

All the best
