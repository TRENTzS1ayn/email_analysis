I don't think it's a good idea to put formatting instructions (such as
date format) in placeholder text.  For one thing, the instructions may
disappear as the user's data replaces the placeholder text, so the
instructions are no longer available to someone who may need them.

If it's necessary to provide such instructions, it's probably best to
include them in the <label> element for the <input>.  This way the
instructions will be visible to anyone who needs to see them, and will
be audible to people using screen readers.

I'm not against your proposal. A text near the field may be okay, but I
don't know the way non-sighted can use it (where should we put it? I
suppose *just before* the field...). I also think that putting the
format help text in the field is more compact, and the fact that it is
*inside* the field could help. But it's true that some people have
trouble using it. Also, the author should prevent placeholder text from
being processed if the user won't modify it... I suppose this is a
little too complicated for simple
sites: the outer field solution it's probably better.

But we need a good way to display format example text, anyway. The
guidelines should advice the better way to display them. Before the
field is ok? There's a proper markup to display them?...
