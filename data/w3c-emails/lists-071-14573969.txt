Which, I guess, leaves it open to a judgement call by the page author. 
Or at least, there's nothing specifically forbidding this as it stands.

Of course, dwelling on your single Croatian browser example, there's 
always the question of who determines the cut-off points. WCAG, I'd 
assume, is inclusive as possible - but if page authors are building 
English sites, to be used by English readers, a particular point dealing 
specifically with Croatian user agents isn't that relevant. If it's 
hard-wired into WCAG, then more work is being expended by the author 
than necessary.

Good point. User checks are inevitable in cases where software can't 
comply, otherwise the guidelines would quickly devolve into a silly list 
of rules like "always use #000000 text on a #cccccc background to ensure 
contrast isn't blinding while legibility is maintained."

This is a realistic evaluation. By the same token, I'd presume the 
'until user agent' checkpoints were created in a conscious awareness 
that the points mentioned would eventually become irrelevant. Perhaps 
the wording is wrong, but any shifts in the future should allow for 
updating if the clauses become useless.

Planned obsolescence. It's what got us here, but it shouldn't be 
ignored. A second edition of WCAG1.0 would go a long way toward 
satisfying questions like mine.

Well now, we ended up in the same place. That's saying something. :)
