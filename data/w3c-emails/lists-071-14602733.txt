...
For example gateway techniques could separately consider scenarios such
as
 an image in a link : in this case a text equivalent should let the user
know were the page links to 
An image in in a link that contains extra information: in this case a
text equivalent include were the page links to, and any extra
information in the image

My 2 cents...

In this example I suggest one common scenario we might want to look at is the standard practice of using logos as links to home pages. This practice involves using the image for at least two functions (organizational identifier and navigational function). In this scenario would it not be best to recommend both placing the alt text for the organizational identifier within the img alt tag and including the navigational text information within the title attribute of the address element? This could also apply to other instances where images in links are used to attempted to provide context to the linked page (i.e. an image of a computer that links to a store's computer sales page. In this case "computer" would be placed within the img alt tag and "Link to Computer Sales page" within the title attribute of the address element). Let the img alt tag describe the image and the let the address title describe the link.
