The Accessibility Institute Web site's How-to section includes scenarios like these.  For example, our Graphics section includes short tutorials about the following items:

Alt Text for a Logo
*?Alt Text for Decorative Images and Spacers
*?AltText for a Link that contains both Graphics and Text
*?Including a Graph and Its Description on the Same Page
*?A Graph with a Description in a Separate, Linked File
*?Associating a Graph and its Description with the longdesc Attribute
list end
If anyone has a chance to look at these, I'd be glad of any feedback.  Each tutorial includes a working example, a brief description of the example, a slightly longer rationale/explanation of the technique employed, a link to source code for the example, an audio recording of JAWS reading the example (and a text transcript ofwhat it says), plus a link to the relevant WCAG 1.0 checkpoints and Section 508 (US) requirements.  The source code and applicable standards links open in new browser windows, as per the preference of our users.

...
For example gateway techniques could separately consider scenarios such as  an image in a link : in this case a text equivalent should let the user know were the page links to 
An image in in a link that contains extra information: in this case a text equivalent include were the page links to, and any extra information in the image

My 2 cents...

In this example I suggest one common scenario we might want to look at is the standard practice of using logos as links to home pages. This practice involves using the image for at least two functions (organizational identifier and navigational function). In this scenario would it not be best to recommend both placing the alt text for the organizational identifier within the img alt tag and including the navigational text information within the title attribute of the address element? This could also apply to other instances where images in links are used to attempted to provide context to the linked page (i.e. an image of a computer that links to a store's computer sales page. In this case "computer" would be placed within the img alt tag and "Link to Computer Sales page" within the title attribute of the address element). Let the img alt tag describe the image and the let the address title describe the link.
