I heard somewhere (perhaps from someone at Freedom Scientific?) that the
company plans to propose the context-help attribute as an addition to
XHTML sometime in the future. If that happens, then we can recommend
that developers use it.  But in the meantime-- proprietary attributes
line the road to madness for end-users and developers alike.
 
My two cents' worth.

While on this subject:
For making a form accessible to JAWS 5.0 users, an HTML tag that Freedom
Scientific supports is  ContextHelp. Here is an example... it is not  a
standard though.
<label for="pcp" >Name of PCP:</label>
<input type="text" id="pcp" tabindex="10" ContextHelp="Enter name of
primary care physician" />
When JAWS encounters this it says "Press Insert+F1 for help" and one can
hear the help text and then press Exc to excape... all this in forms
data entry mode. Must say it works well for me.
