Hi,

We have already recommended this to the W3C/WAI and hope that the attribute 
not remain specific to JAWS.  I discussed this with Al Gilman in DC last 
week and there does seem to be some discussion within W3C on the matter.

I heard somewhere (perhaps from someone at Freedom Scientific?) that the 
company plans to propose the context-help attribute as an addition to XHTML 
sometime in the future. If that happens, then we can recommend that 
developers use it.  But in the meantime-- proprietary attributes line the 
road to madness for end-users and developers alike.

My two cents' worth.

John

While on this subject:
For making a form accessible to JAWS 5.0 users, an HTML tag that Freedom 
Scientific supports is  ContextHelp. Here is an example... it is not  a 
standard though.
<label for="pcp" >Name of PCP:</label>
<input type="text" id="pcp" tabindex="10" ContextHelp="Enter name of 
primary care physician" />
When JAWS encounters this it says "Press Insert+F1 for help" and one can 
hear the help text and then press Exc to excape... all this in forms data 
entry mode. Must say it works well for me.
