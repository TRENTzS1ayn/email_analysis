Please don't. To equate silence with approval is presumptuous.

Moreover, you link to *nine* separate messages with significant issues.
Don't try to gloss this one over. Also, as guidelines are rewritten, so
must their plain-language versions, unless they are rewritten in plain

these nine messages are mere betas *and cannot be adopted on the basis of
no complaints about them*.
