Since XHTML 2.0 currently has one element for both acronyms and 
abbreviations [1], we felt we should head that direction as well.  We 
should clarify this in the HTML Techniques document.

from the XHTML 2.0  spec:
The abbr element indicates that a text fragment is an abbreviation (e.g., 
W3C, XML, Inc., Ltd., Mass., etc.); this includes acronyms.
