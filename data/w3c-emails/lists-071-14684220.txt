Yes, and thank you Chris.

PF expects to be working on "orientation in forms" in the new year.
The 'context help' HTML extension attribute and Jaws function are
included in this topic, and set off this round of consideration.

A check on what is provided in XHTML 2.0 is in the PF charter and a
backward-compatible pattern of XHTML 1.1 practice is in the WCAG
charter.  We need both and hopefully they won't be taking
unnecessarily divergent tacks.

We would like to work with y'all on this.  I'll follow up with Jason Gregg
and Wendy on how to organize the charge.
