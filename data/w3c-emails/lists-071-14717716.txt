It seems that any change in content that could cause other pages to 
cease or begin conforming to a "recommendation" is the 
second-most-serious form of erratum. (New features are the most 
serious.)

So any content change is not small.

The document states: 'In this Process Document, the term "erratum" 
(plural "errata") refers to any class of mistake, from mere editorial 
to a serious error that may affect the conformance with the 
Recommendation by software or content (e.g., content validity).'

*Any class of error*. In my reading, that includes the case of "it 
didn't seem to be an error at the time, but events have since proved 
otherwise." But that-all could certainly be interpreted as adding a 
new feature, the most onerous of processes.

According to the spec, you have to send it out for review anyway. The 
only errata you could fix without review are typing or markup errors.

According to the spec, if we change the content, it has to be 
reviewed. This is a red herring, and it is-- perhaps 
unintentionally-- a mechanism for the WAI politburo to *block* 
changes. "Well, this particular person disagreed on the mailing list 
five years ago. We don't have consensus."

 From my reading, all the proposed errata are Category 3. All.

We know that.

But the Working Group is not all that hot at managing its time as it 
is. We wouldn't be sullying a pristine organizational system here.

You'll spend weeks-- WEEKS-- shifting deck chairs on the _Titanic_ 
arguing over slight revisions to proposals that are provably false to 
begin with. You let outright untruths sit in drafts for months at a 
time. And, after mistakes are clearly pointed out and alternatives 
given (at, say, f2f meetings), you carry on as if it never happened. 
And this, implicitly, constitutes the excellent time management that 
a revised WCAG 1.0 would threaten.

WAI is in no position to chastise us in advance for proposing a 
mechanism that would *improve* WCAG 1.0 on the supposed basis that 
it's a zero-sum game: More time spent improving 1.0 means a worse 
2.0. WCAG WG is already well on the path toward a rather lousy 2.0, 
as I and others have documented at length here and elsewhere.

As Kynn points out, 1.0 is still gonna be used for many years, even 
after 2.0 comes out. 1.0 has serious flaws that are known and 
acknowledged. "Fix those first" is what people are saying here.

True. But "weighed carefully" seems to be a euphemism here for "you 
have to prove it to WAI staff beyond a shadow of a doubt."

which it will. If we get something published in 2004 I'll be surprised.

I strongly support producing a WCAG 1.0 Second Edition, or any 
similar errata-corrected version of WCAG 1.0, even if it means 
slowing down 2.0.

Remember, fixing 1.0 is a task with known parameters. Whereas writing 
2.0, experience has shown, is a matter of watching the WAI politburo 
spin fantasies out of thin air, institute them in official drafts, 
and then resist months of effort to get them turned back to the real 
world. Giving a choice between fixing something, where the endpoint 
is at least easy to visualize, and letting the princes and princesses 
of the Working Group build castles in the sky and move themselves in 
even before the masonry has dried... well, I'll take the easier 
metaphor.
