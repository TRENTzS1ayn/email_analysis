Ugh.  Wendy quoted the XHTML 2 spec:

from the XHTML 2.0  spec:
The abbr element indicates that a text fragment is an abbreviation
(e.g., 
W3C, XML, Inc., Ltd., Mass., etc.); this includes acronyms.

Ugh! It would be better to say something like, The abbr element
indicates that  a text fragment is either an abbreviation or an
acronym..<

abbr title="By the way">BTW</abbr>, I wonder how the linguists feel
about making acronym and abbreviation synonymous?

Since XHTML 2.0 currently has one element for both acronyms and 
abbreviations [1], we felt we should head that direction as well.  We 
should clarify this in the HTML Techniques document.

from the XHTML 2.0  spec:
The abbr element indicates that a text fragment is an abbreviation
(e.g., 
W3C, XML, Inc., Ltd., Mass., etc.); this includes acronyms.
