Agenda

1. Plain language proposals
Please review the remaining plain language proposals [0].  If there are
no comments on the list by 17 December,  we will adopt each proposal and
move forward.

[0] List of links is at the end of the message

2. Assigning guidelines to volunteers
In this week's discussion, we are looking for volunteers to take one
guideline and summarize and prioritize the related issues.  For example,
the color contrast Guideline has 17 issues associated with it in
bugzilla [1].  Some of these issues could be addressed in a  proposal by
the subgroup who took an action item last week (myself, Loretta, Doyle,
Mat, and Gregg), other issues might best be handled in a future draft.
The goal of divvying up the Guidelines is to more quickly process public
comments and prepare our next public working draft.

3. Briefing about errata management and W3C process.
We will be working on errata for WCAG 1.0.  I will summarize the errata
that need to be discussed and the W3C process we will use to address
them.
