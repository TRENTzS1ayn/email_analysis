Absolutely agreed. Btw, several months ago I proposed at least a more
generic solution [1], either by adding a <term /> element or by replacing <abbr />
and <acronym /> by <explanation /> to offer a single element which is
semantically sufficient for abbreviations, acronyms, as well as technical terms
(which <abbr /> obviously is not, since it per se doesn't even match acronyms).

If the current solution is challenged by the WAI WG, what about this
suggestion?


All the best,
 Jens.
