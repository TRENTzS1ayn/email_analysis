David,
Do you like the  suggestion of what type of content could be included in
the gateway techniques. 
Do you think different scenario should be included with different
techniques for fulfillments, or should the gateway be restricted to
clarifying? 

All the best

...
For example gateway techniques could separately consider scenarios such
as  an image in a link : in this case a text equivalent should let the
user know were the page links to 
An image in in a link that contains extra information: in this case a
text equivalent include were the page links to, and any extra
information in the image

My 2 cents...

In this example I suggest one common scenario we might want to look at
is the standard practice of using logos as links to home pages. This
practice involves using the image for at least two functions
(organizational identifier and navigational function). In this scenario
would it not be best to recommend both placing the alt text for the
organizational identifier within the img alt tag and including the
navigational text information within the title attribute of the address
element? This could also apply to other instances where images in links
are used to attempted to provide context to the linked page (i.e. an
image of a computer that links to a store's computer sales page. In this
case "computer" would be placed within the img alt tag and "Link to
Computer Sales page" within the title attribute of the address element).
Let the img alt tag describe the image and the let the address title
describe the link.
