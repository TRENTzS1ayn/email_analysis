Hi Yvette -

I am now really confused - what else is new.

In my read and from previous discussions I think "we" are saying that
content (at a minimum) must be operable via the use of a keyboard or its
assistive technology (AT) equivalent (alternative keyboard interface).

If someone has developed an alternative keyboard (assistive technology
device such as Intellikeys, for example) an author would not have to know
such a device existed so long as their web content was operable via a
keyboard or its equivalent and the information it puts out. I think when we
talk about a keyboard, we are talking about the functions of the keyboard
(the information sent to the computer) and not what we envision when we look
at a keyboard.  

An alternative keyboard can be hardware (Intellikeys, again) or software (on
board keyboard).  So long as the author's content can be accessed and
operated by the information sent from the keyboard or other such interface,
it seems that they'd comply.

Yvette, let me know if I have understood you correctly.  I will talk with
you soon.
