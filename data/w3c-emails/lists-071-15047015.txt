I agree with you so far.

The last example says "If it's written to work with devices that do not have
keyboards and it can not be used by any other devices that do have
keyboards, then it does not conform." 

To me the sentence means that if you develop content specifically for
devices that have no keyboard, you cannot conform to WCAG. Because of your
answer, I can see that my interpretation is probably not the way it was
meant. Your interpretation makes a lot more sense :-) But if I interpret it
like this, perhaps other people will as well. 

There is no plain language rewrite of these examples yet, but I think it
would be wise to get rid of the ambiguity of the current wording since you
and I have totally different interpretations of the same example...
