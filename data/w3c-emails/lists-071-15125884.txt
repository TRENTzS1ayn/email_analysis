In my mind, a <term> element is too vague.  For example, I think some
people will use such an element to isolate technical terms, or perhaps
new terms in a document. (So that they can style them differently from
the surrounding text.)  (I can think of other uses too.)

What we're talking about here is specifically something that has a
longer form, so that's why I'm happy with an abbr element name (using
the word 'abbreviation' ((where that last word could be another
application for a <term> tag)) in its non-technical sense).

That's not to say that a <term> tag would not be useful.  I'm forever
marking up stuff as <span class="new-term">...</span> or such.
