I think we need a common term for the same behavior: a syntethic term, which
can be explained/expansed by a longer expression. The CSS rendering should
be achieved with extra class attributes, if really needed. We don't need a
too rich markup: html is good because it's simple. For expansions or
personalized markup, xml or other sgml languages are ok.

Yes, it's true. But abbr or abbreviation could be tricky, because they mean
a not so (not enough) general thing, as I see them. An abbreviation is
always proununced as the full word, the acronym isn't.

There are some linguistic trickery that can not be solved, perhaps, with
abbreviations.

So a more general term should be better. The only reason not to do is
backward compatibility: and then we should use the same abbr we already
have, and without introducing a new 'abbreviation'. In the other case, if we
choose to use a new label, it shoul be more general, more abstract. Perhaps
not 'term', but more abstract and less problematic, from a linguistic point
of view, than abbreviation.

I hope I have explained myself... :)
