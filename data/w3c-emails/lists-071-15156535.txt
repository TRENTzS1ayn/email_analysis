As a linguist I think that since all acronyms are "abbreviations" in the
generic sense of the term, but that not all abbreviations are acronyms in any
sense, it is not wrong to call the whole lot abbreviations and put them in an
element called "abbr".

As a web professional I think it is not wrong to use "accortado" as the
element name either.

I do think there is value in looking at the ruby element [1], introduced in
XHTML 1.1 and currently included in XHTML 2, which is designed to provide the
kind of expansion that we want for abbreviations of various kinds, and which
allows simple styling to give us the different choices we would like to have
for presenting these things. If there is some reason not to use ruby itself,
then I think its structure is still a very good model for any new element
that does what we want.
