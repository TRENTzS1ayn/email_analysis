I'm delighted to hear from Chaals and Richard that the linguists have no
objections to lumping acronyms and abbreviations together under a single
element <abbr>.  If ruby is available as an additional option, so much
the better.

As a linguist I think that since all acronyms are "abbreviations" in the
generic sense of the term, but that not all abbreviations are acronyms
in any sense, it is not wrong to call the whole lot abbreviations and
put them in an element called "abbr".

As a web professional I think it is not wrong to use "accortado" as the
element name either.

I do think there is value in looking at the ruby element [1], introduced
in XHTML 1.1 and currently included in XHTML 2, which is designed to
provide the kind of expansion that we want for abbreviations of various
kinds, and which allows simple styling to give us the different choices
we would like to have for presenting these things. If there is some
reason not to use ruby itself, then I think its structure is still a
very good model for any new element that does what we want.
