Slow down a minute. From your own email it suggests that two self-proclaimed
linguists are OK with the idea, and one is not...

To be clearer about ruby, I am not suggesting it in addition, but that it be
used instead of the abbr element, which could then quietly die out (based on
the fact that you can transform any acronym/abbr element in existing HTML to
XHTML 2 by putting them in a ruby element, giving them a default class, and
then leting authors tweak them for different ways of pronouncing stuff...

Or you could use a smart transformation - the sort of thing the UBAccess
and WebThing do, to go from stuff where one instance is marked up using abbr
to a more celanly marked up page, via the kind of mechanisms that are being
mooted for dealing with vocabulary and grammar stuff.
