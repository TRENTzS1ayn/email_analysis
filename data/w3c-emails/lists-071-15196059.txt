Evidently I read Chass' post about <abbr> and <ruby> carelessly-- and as
a result my last post misrepresented his position.  He does *not*
support simply lumping everything together under the <abbr> element and
using <ruby> as supplement; he proposes replacing <abbr> with <ruby>.
 
I stand corrected (thanks, Chaals). I don't know enough about ruby to
have anopinion.  So I'll shut up.
