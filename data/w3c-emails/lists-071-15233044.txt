Oh. Me neither.

Well, that's something. As it happens, browsers don't seem to do it. You
could write a script that post-processed your pages, to turn what you are
prepared to write into what users can actually get value from in the software
they have available.

I believe that a design principle here is that tings should be self-contained
- the more special-magic processing you need to do on a given element, the
less happy the HTML group is. Which is why the slightly verbose stuff seems
to get there.

Personally I avoid touching source code if at all possible, since decent
tools (the very few) get it right, whereas I make typos and find it hard to
read. Which strongly colours the way I see verbose source code as an issue.
But I claim that this puts me in touch with the masses and what they really
care about...
