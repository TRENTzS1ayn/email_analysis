At yesterday's meeting, I promised to send some details about using Bugzilla
to find open issues relevant to each guideline.

Overview of WCAG Bugzilla Structure and Organization:

Issues in Bugzilla are organized into products and components. Issues
related to the Guidelines document itself are stored in the "WCAG 2.0"
Product and are organized into components that correspond to various
sections of the document. A complete list of components can be viewed by
selecting the "Component" link on the query page and viewing components for
the WCAG 2.0 product. 

Components for WCAG 2.0 that are prefaced with "G:" and have been updated to
correspond to the language and numbering of the guidelines in our latest
internal working draft. [1] 

Using Bugzilla to find open issues (condensed version):

Step 1: If you haven't already, create a Bugzilla account[2]. As a
registered WCAG Bugzilla user, you will be able to more effectively query
and track issues. 

Step 2: Search for issues by guideline by opening the query page, selecting
the WCAG 2.0 Product and the appropriate component and activating the
"search" button. 

Note that you don't have to fill out any field on the query page you don't
need. Filling out additional fields will limit your search.

Step 3: Review the resulting issues list, which should include a list of all
issues associated with the relevant guideline.

A comprehensive resource for help with using the Bugzilla query form is
available at [3]. It describes each of the form fields on the query page in
detail and provides some useful advice for performing more advanced queries.

Using the static issues list to find issues:

The static issues list [4] can also be used to locate issues using find in
page. Each issue in the static list is followed by data related to that
issue. So, to search for all the issues related to Guideline 2.3 (flicker),
you could search for the string "G: flicker."

In addition to searching the Bugzilla system, it is a good idea to also
search both the mailing list [5] and the public comments list [6] archives
for relevant issues. 

Hope this helps,

-Ben
