DISCUSSION

Work statement [1]: focused mainly on membership requirements for our task
force. People need to be members in good standing of the larger WCAG group
but can focus their time commitment to techniques, or split their time.

Techniques gateway: explored the level of detail the techniques should
should have to provide sufficient information but not go out of scope.

QA materials: reviewed the summary Jenae had posted [2] as well as
information posted by Olivier of the QA group [3]. QA materials are in
Candidate Recommendation status and WCAG is one of the "example
implementations" required for them to proceed to Recommendation. There is
some stuff we need to do now to fulfill those requirements, and other stuff
we should wait until a final recommendation exists. We reviewed a number of
the questions Jenae posed in our overview, and have action items to
formalize our QA processes.

Future meetings: there will be a meeting 17 December, however due to the
impact on most of the group members of the Christmas and New Year holidays,
there will be no meetings on 24 December and 31 December.

IRC minutes at [4].


ACTION ITEMS

* Lisa: Write proposal to list about approach for adding content to Gateway
* Wendy, Ben, Michael: Identify latest Gateway techniques and republish
* Jenae: Coordinate with QA task force
