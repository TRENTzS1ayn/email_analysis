I don't mind the way that WAI-GL operates with the listing of 
participants. It allows people like me, who can only offer miminal 
contribution, still an avenue to do so, and to also change status 
easily, if we come into position to be able to do so (time, notice most 
of this Sunday has been taken with WAI issues (see wai-xtech), but 
that's my choice).

I just do not have the time to allocate a high involvement, so the way 
that WAI-GL has operated I think is pretty fair, but I don't feel the 
same for other WGs.

Take for instance the AUWG Charter requires 3-6 hours a week, etc.

http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/charter4

I can't get on this list even though I am trying to make a contribution, 
yet I know others on this list I sincerely doubt are fulfilling anywhere 
near these requirements.  I'm not trying to make an issue, just a point.

As an independant developer, I would have to pay the cost of so many 
international phone calls to participate.  I don't mind the WAI-GL 
participants structure, but if it becomes more and more difficult to 
contribute then I can probably better invest my energies elsewhere, and 
you'll tend to find those of us, who are independant developers, who 
have a unique perspective on these issues, will just drop away.
