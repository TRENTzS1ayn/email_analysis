Hi group,

I can't attend the teleconference next Thursday since we present a new
website that afternoon (totally accessible of course!) with a large
celebration afterwards. 

Since this is the last scheduled telecon for this year, I wish everyone in
the group pleasant holidays in whatever form you choose to celebrate it.
I'll talk to you again in 2004!

Yvette Hoitink
CEO Heritas, Enschede, The Netherlands
