Hi tech task force,
Last week I took an action item to draft our QA Process Document. The QA
Process Document template for "QA Framework: Operational Guidelines" can
be found here [1]. I've completed the draft but it is rather blank
because I have questions for the group. As soon as we are able to
discuss some of my questions, I'll check with Wendy about posting the
document.

Following are my questions for the group:

Question #1: What test material are we providing? For example:
Technology specific techniques, test suites, test case, test pages, etc.
And we need to assign names for a)"test materials type" and b)"test
materials name".

Question #2: We need to add a "... public web page for QA information
that is named /Test/...", what should be on this page? Should we post
the QAPD here?

Question #3: Will we have Authoring Guidelines or Test Material Manual?
"This is typically a separate WG document that describes the format of
the test materials and is used to ensure that test material
contributions are in an appropriate format and include the requisite
information to facilitate consistency, assessment, and inclusion of the
test materials." Do we already have a document to fulfill this
requirement?

Question #4 How are we going to track submissions? 

Comment #5: Should we have a format for submission? Do we need to know
the Guideline, Checkpoint, technology, test type: automated or manual,
anything else? We could provide a sample submission.

Question #6: What kind of license will apply to our Test Material? We
may note be able to answer until we know all the sources.

Question #7: Do we need a process for going through the submissions that
have been "received"? Does this need to be addressed on calls? How does
a submission get from "received" to "accepted"?

That's all for now! Hopefully, we can answer a few of these questions
and then decide when and where we would like to post the QAPD.

Please let me know if you have any questions about my questions!

Thanks,
Jenae
