Joe,
Are you confusing the smoke with the fire?
that is who cares whether one's in good standing, members know who the 
regular contributors are.
Don't let's worry that the smoke gets all the attention.

BTW, have you ever visited a turd world country?
They spend hours polishing turds:

Many years ago I was  a youth staying up in the hills above Manali in 
India.
I asked the landlady for a mat, the bed-cots were rather uncomfortable.
She in her kindness cleaned the floor and polished it with cow dung.
This continued every day for a month or two.....

Like the South American tea, I later discovered that mat means 
different things to different people.
She just assumed I was a very fussy tenant.

thanks
