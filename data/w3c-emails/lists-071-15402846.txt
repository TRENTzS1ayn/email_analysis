Chaals, I have to disagree on this one. I also believe that "good 
standing" is of very little value, and de-bases WAI.
Who needs post-holders in a young, dynamic and exciting environment?

The whole WAI process misses a significant beat, okay so other 
organisations aren't ideal role models either, but that's not to say 
that WAI can't be improved on. The most significant issue or problem as 
I've mentioned in the past is:

 >>>>>>>    We don't appeal to very many users...    <<<<<<

this is a direct result of the current process, which places far too 
much power in the hands of "stakeholders" and gives users nothing.
They're the only people able to sit still, even if their pants are down.
People with learning difficulties have taught me that the feedback loop 
needs to be as short as possible, and we're nowhere near that at 
present.

When we have real input from users to UA, authoring tools as well as 
WCAG, we won't need good standing, and we'll be sure that we've 
something to crow about. Until then I'm happier with Groucho ~:"

thanks
