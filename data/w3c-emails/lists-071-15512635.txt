To The Group -

A summary of public comments on WCAG 2.0, Guideline 1.6 follows.  Presently,
Guideline 1.6 in the current working draft is written to read [1]:

Guideline 1.6 - Foreground content is easily differentiable from background
for visual default presentations. [level 2 guideline]

Level 1 Success Criteria for Guideline 1.6

1.    No level 1 success criteria for this guideline

Level 2 Success Criteria for Guideline 1.6

1.    text that is presented over a background color or grayscale has a
mechanism that allows the text to be presented in a fashion that has a
contrast greater than ______ between text and background color as measured
by ______.[I#344] [Y]

Level 3 Success Criteria for Guideline 1.6

1.    when text content is presented over a background image or pattern, the
text is easily readable when the page is viewed in 256 grayscale. [Y]

Editorial Note:?this item may be moved or updated if the proposal for adding
a guideline on color is accepted.


2.    this item should read identically to the required item #1, except that
it should say "in default presentation mode." [Y]

End of current written work on Guideline 1.6 and its Success Criteria see
[1] below

Public Comment Summary Below -

OUTSTANDING ISSUES

- No agreed upon algorithm to be placed within success criteria for 1.6 for
measuring contrast (3 responses)

- Combine 1.6 and 1.7?  (question raised)
- Is it a usability issue or accessibility issue?
- Question the wording easily readable

PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED SOLUTIONS

- printing solutions as a possible fix or workaround

- make core as opposed to extended (two responses)

- suggest principles not an algorithm

- Use the phrase ?In default presentation mode?

 NEW PROPOSED SOLUTION(S)

- Use layered design to allow selective presentation or blanking of visual
elements, comprising, for example, foreground and background contrast.

- ?Foreground content is easily differentiated
from background in all [mediums/forms of media]?

- Plain English Re-Write see [2]

- Add a disclaimer to any algorithm used

DEPENDENCIES BETWEEN GUIDELINES

There are no known dependencies between Guideline 1.6 and other guidelines.
However, Guideline 1.6 and 1.7 have similarities related to ?layered
information?.

ASSUMPTIONS 

If 1.6 is not changed from Extended to Core, many individuals will not be
able to access pages that do not have pages that use good contrast.

Single algorithms will likely NOT solve all things for all people.  Color
deficiency is only a part of the overall problem.
