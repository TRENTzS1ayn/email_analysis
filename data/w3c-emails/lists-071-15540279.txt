Attached is an extremely rough draft of my first thoughts at possible 
mappings of CSS3 modules to
WCAG 2.0 WD 10/27/03 Guidelines and Success Criteria. I thought it might be 
interesting to
"go the other way", start with the modules and see how these would relate 
to specific WCAG points,
since groups of the CSS3 modules are likely to be implemented as profiles, 
and perhaps this
accessibility information could be added as information to the respective 
CSS3 modules. So if
one wanted to implement a particular CSS3 profile, there might be WCAG 
benefits with that profile
as opposed to another profile.

These thoughts are "off the top of my head" but are meant to stimulate 
discussion and thinking. The
document is oriented towards levels of WCAG conformance. Comments welcome;
It may not be possible for all CSS3 modules to have relations with WCAG. I 
know until I actually
generate CSS code I will not know if any of this is accurate, but this is 
just to put something
on the table. Also, CSS3 relates to future functionality which may or may 
not ever be implemented.

Thanks and best wishes, Tim Boland
