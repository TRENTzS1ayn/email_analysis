Attached is an extremely rough draft of my first thoughts at possible 
mappings of WCAG
2.0 WD 10/27/03 Guidelines and Success Criteria to CSS2.1 CR. These thoughts
are "off the top of my head" but are meant to stimulate discussion and 
thinking. The
document is oriented towards levels of WCAG conformance. Comments welcome;
not all of these sections of CSS2.1 will probably be applicable in 
practice, but I "stretched" in
including them, thinking it would be easier to eliminate them later. It may 
not be possible
to satisfy all WCAG success criteria just by using CSS 2.1. I know until I 
actually
generate CSS code I will not know if any of this is accurate, but this is 
just to put something
on the table. I like Michael Cooper's observation of strong vs. weak CSS 
implications, so I
included that as well (thanks! - I'd like to explore that excellent idea 
further).

Since CSS2.1 reflects actual implementation experience of CSS2, and does 
not involve
the conjecture of CSS3, I thought it might be suitable to do a similar 
mapping to what I did for CSS3.
Also, CSS2.1 will (I believe) soon be a CR (with a CSS2.1 test suite 
sometime) next year, so
it "has some teeth to it."

Thanks and best wishes, Tim Boland NIST
