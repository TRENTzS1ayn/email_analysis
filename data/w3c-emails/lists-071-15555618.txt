EC Expert Group on Accessibility


Dear Friends,

Just to inform you about the following:

*2010: A Europe Accessible for All*. *Report of the EC Expert Group on
Accessibility*.
A European  Expert Group has recommended a variety of policy measures
and actions that can be considered to make Europe's public buildings,
schools, workplaces, cultural venues, sports centres, historical sites,
et cetera, accessible for all its citizens by 2010.

The report is available on the EU-supported  "Social Dialogue Net" Web
site, at the following URL:
http://www.socialdialogue.net/en/en_lib_170.htm

Some translations of the document (including French, Italian and Greek)
will be available on the Web site in January 2004.

Best wishes for 2004 and Season's Greetings to all,

Ivor Ambrose
Editorial Team
