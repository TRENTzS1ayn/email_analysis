Then fix your damned minutes. How hard can it be to write these things
down?

Is it not irresponsible for the Working Group to fail to document its
decisions and rationales?

That requirement is too onerous. It's certainly very nice to say that
critics must solve the problems they identify, but that is arguably what
W3C staff, PiGS, and politburo members with day jobs should be doing. Half
the time the issue involves a failure to read the W3C's own specs, or a
failure to simply provide examples from the real Web to back up what
they're saying.

If PiGS member A makes a statement, and some non-PiGS contributor X says
it's false and explains why, it is A's responsibility to fix it. It is
certainly nice if X or someone else solves it, but in a group as
notoriously incapable of spotting its own mistakes as this, merely
pointing them out must suffice.

Further, the converse of "participant in good standing" is not
"participant in bad standing." That requires a formal banning or shunning
and applies solely to former participants in good standing. The converse
of "participant in good standing" is a participant with no standing at
all. The values, essentially, are +1, 0, and -1, not +1 and -1.
