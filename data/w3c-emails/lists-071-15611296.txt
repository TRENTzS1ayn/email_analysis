Regarding (on the topic of device independent access):

 

 3)   Is "ON CLICK" an exception since it is supported from keyboards?
Bug#: 490 <http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=490>   

 

This issue should be bumped over to techniques. It's a valid issue but is
specific to HTML and current browser implementation. The guidelines should
simply state the requirements about what keyboard accessibility means, and
in techniques we can open the discussion of how that guideline can be
fulfilled in a particular technology, based on the features of that
technology and tests of user agents.
