Hard. Harder when everyone scribing is a volunteer. Harder still to 
scribe, track the speaking queue, and talk at the same time, as the 
staff contact often does.

So. Pretty darn hard. Any attempt to capture live discussion is bound 
to lose data. You're a captioning expert, and you spend a good deal of 
time telling professionals how poorly they do it. We're open to 
suggestions, but "fix your damned minutes" is fairly unconstructive.

Very nice indeed. But that's not what I said. What I said was a 
"should", not a "must".

And are doing, on the order of hundreds of issues raised on the 
guidelines and techniques documents, all in Bugzilla.

We are in violent agreement.
