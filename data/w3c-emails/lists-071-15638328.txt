Dear friends,
now, in Europe,  is a great moment about accessibility:

1) in Italy we have the new Law
2) the Europea Plan "MINERVA" has published in november 2003 the
official
"Handbook for quality in cultural Web sites" [1].  It is an important
step
into the european cultural life on the web, because
the states members of UE will translate it in the own language and then
will be applied.

Roberto:
and... 3) :)
