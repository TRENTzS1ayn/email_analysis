Wendy,
Introducing  concept of supporting technology and  host technology is really important for the Gateway doc ... and perhaps in the main WCAG 2.0 doc.
Identifying CSS, scripting etc. as supporting and XHTML as host technology  will be really helpful. Necessary to point out the supporting technologies cannot be used independently to develop Web content and cannot be used to satisfy all checkpoints. Saying this explicitly will avoid confusion.

We have not been assuming that someone could use CSS alone to satisfy all
of the success criteria.  Since CSS is used in conjunction with other technologies, we have discussed marking the dependencies between techniques (in our xml source) so that we can generate checklists that will pull
together the various technology-specific pieces that someone might need.  Client-side scripting is also a "supporting" technology rather than
a "host" technology.  It will not be possible to meet all success criteria using only a supporting technology.
