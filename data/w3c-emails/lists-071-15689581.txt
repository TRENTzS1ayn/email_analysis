DISCUSSION

We reviewed user agent-dependent guidelines from WCAG 1.0 [1] and assigned a
number of action items to ourselves to test the current status of user agent
implementation. Of these, we believe with various levels of strength that we
can recommend deprecating 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, and 10.5, but didn't initially
think we could recommend deprecating the remainder. However, the testing may
change our responses to all of the above.

Next we reviewed the QA Test Guidelines [2] and discussed how they would
apply to our work. We got about halfway through the document and will
continue at the next meeting. Then we will begin implementing or clarifying
the procedures as necessary that we discover from this review.

IRC log of meeting at [3].

REMINDER: the next two Wednesday meetings are cancelled. The next techniques
meeting is on 7 January, 2004.


ACTION ITEMS

* Wendy: look into wcag 1.0 checkpoint 1.3 user agent support page info
(microsoft demo? timed text work?). 
* David: create a test page and test if text equivalents are shown for
client-side image maps for wcag 1.0 checkpoint 1.5. 
* Ben: look at client-side proxy tools that help with checkpoint 1.5
(muffin) - tools that convert image maps to plain text. 
* Wendy: update references to UAAG 1.0 checkpoints 
* Wendy: link to UAAG 1.0 test suite results for relevant UAAG 1.0
checkpoints. 
* Michael: test wcag 1.0 checkpoint 7.4 and 7.5 
* Michael: summarize test results for placement of form controls and
explicit association. 
* Michael: update UA info for 10.3 
* David: test for checkpoint 10.5 
* Michael and wendy: create matrix of checkpoints and user agents and who
testing
