Right

 

   In conjunction with techniques we will be developing   "Technology
Specific Checklists".    These checklists will be what people actually use
in practice since they will say specifically what must be done with each
technology to meet the WCAG.    

 

The checklists will be for technologies or sets of technologies that can
meet all of the WCAG 2.0 guidelines.  They will have to allow a person to at
least meet all of the level 1 success criteria.  ( or else they would have
to start out with a statement that in order for content presented with this
technology to meet WCAG 2.0 all content must also be presented in another
technology in a form that did meet minimum WCAG 2.0 --- which of course is
not very encouraging) 

 

 So there would be no CSS checklist.  Only an HTML plus CSS checklist.  Or
an XHTML plus CSS checklist.   Or XHTML + CSS + Scripting checklist.

Wendy,

Introducing  concept of supporting technology and  host technology is really
important for the Gateway doc ... and perhaps in the main WCAG 2.0 doc.

Identifying CSS, scripting etc. as supporting and XHTML as host technology
will be really helpful. Necessary to point out the supporting technologies
cannot be used independently to develop Web content and cannot be used to
satisfy all checkpoints. Saying this explicitly will avoid confusion.

We have not been assuming that someone could use CSS alone to satisfy all
of the success criteria.  Since CSS is used in conjunction with other
technologies, we have discussed marking the dependencies between techniques
(in our xml source) so that we can generate checklists that will pull
together the various technology-specific pieces that someone might need.
Client-side scripting is also a "supporting" technology rather than
a "host" technology.  It will not be possible to meet all success criteria
using only a supporting technology.
