In which case, is it necessary  to take great pains  to avoid  using an HTML technique to illustrate a  point  in the Gateway doc if HTML   / XHTML are going to be the "host technologies"? Where applicable, other technology-based examples may also be included (like  say, a SMIL based example in the section about multi media accessibility, or a scripting based example  when talking about device independence ).   So I feelwe we should not as a rule ban HTML(or its derivative: XHTML) based examples as it is the primary host technology and is widely used and understood.

  Right



     In conjunction with techniques we will be developing   "Technology Specific Checklists".    These checklists will be what people actually use in practice since they will say specifically what must be done with each technology to meet the WCAG.    



  The checklists will be for technologies or sets of technologies that can meet all of the WCAG 2.0 guidelines.  They will have to allow a person to at least meet all of the level 1 success criteria.  ( or else they would have to start out with a statement that in order for content presented with this technology to meet WCAG 2.0 all content must also be presented in another technology in a form that did meet minimum WCAG 2.0 --- which of course is not very encouraging) 



   So there would be no CSS checklist.  Only an HTML plus CSS checklist.  Or an XHTML plus CSS checklist.   Or XHTML + CSS + Scripting checklist.

  Wendy,

  Introducing  concept of supporting technology and  host technology is really important for the Gateway doc ... and perhaps in the main WCAG 2.0 doc.

  Identifying CSS, scripting etc. as supporting and XHTML as host technology  will be really helpful. Necessary to point out the supporting technologies cannot be used independently to develop Web content and cannot be used to satisfy all checkpoints. Saying this explicitly will avoid confusion.

  We have not been assuming that someone could use CSS alone to satisfy all
  of the success criteria.  Since CSS is used in conjunction with other technologies, we have discussed marking the dependencies between techniques (in our xml source) so that we can generate checklists that will pull
  together the various technology-specific pieces that someone might need.  Client-side scripting is also a "supporting" technology rather than
  a "host" technology.  It will not be possible to meet all success criteria using only a supporting technology.
