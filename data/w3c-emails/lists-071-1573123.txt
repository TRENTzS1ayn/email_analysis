It is also an open question whether we will have the resources to
track down this kind of information. One solution would be to create a
repository in which third parties (including user agent developers)
can provide information on u a support, though of course unless it can
somehow be verified we would have to provide it with appropriate
disclaimers as to accuracy. Of course, references to information
maintained by third parties are an ideal solution.

I suggest we may want to consider reworking the requirement somewhat.
Instead of listing the user agents that do or do not support a
technique, we should only require that for each technique we identify
whether or not the necessary feature support has been implemented at
all, by any user agent, as at the time of publication. Another option
would be to link to third-party information on u a support without
providing any ourselves, or to encourage  u a developers to volunteer
this information (linking to it if they do).

My concern is that we won't have the resources to obtain this
information comprehensively. After all, our resources are stretched to
the limit as it is.
