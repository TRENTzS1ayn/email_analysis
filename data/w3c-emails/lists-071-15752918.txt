I agree with Wendy and Loretta that the Gateway document should
reinforce the idea that WCAG 2.0 applies to a broad spectrum of Web
technologies.

Wendy's idea of providing examples of text alternatives for images used
in a variety of contexts and for a variety of purposes seems almost to
imply that the Gateway document might work by expanding upon the
examples listed in the Guidelines document.  This would help the two
documents reinforce one another-- and the Techniques documents could
then include information about how to implement the examples discussed.
(Maybe all this is already happening-- I'm not up to speed on all the
moving parts!)

I agree that we do not want to reinforce the notion that WCAG only
applies 
to HTML and need to be careful with our examples.  The Techniques
Gateway 
should be a high-level discussion about making content accessible and I 
don't think it should include technology-specific examples.  Instead of 
talking about how to use the alt attribute on the image element, we
should 
discuss how to write a text equivalent for a variety of images used in a

variety of contexts.

Although the current draft of the Techniques Gateway [1] has several 
HTML-specific examples, refer to the editorial notes scattered through
the 
document: "This paragraph is HTML-specific. Need broader range of
examples, 
or more generic explanation."  Each of those editorial notes is a to-do
for 
the editor to generalize the concept so that it is not HTML-specific.

If I interpret the consensus of the Techniques Task Force correctly, I 
think the vision of the Gateway is:
After each general discussion we will link to a list of relevant 
techniques.  For example, after the text equivalents discussion in the 
Gateway, we'll have several links into the HTML Techniques (e.g., using
alt 
on image, using the object element), SVG Techniques (e.g., using the
title 
and desc elements with the g element), etc.  But we will not have HTML 
examples included in the discussion of text equivalents in the Gateway.
I 
think that we can ban HTML examples in the general discussion because
there 
will be plenty of HTML-specific discussion in the HTML Techniques.
