The original point was about the need to encourage more people to
participate on this list.

Personally I am less likely to participate if there is a good chance
that I will get insulted on a publicly minuted list as a result. 

(You once asked Joe, why should we keep lists polite) 
 

All the best

Then fix your damned minutes. How hard can it be to write these things
down?

Is it not irresponsible for the Working Group to fail to document its
decisions and rationales?

That requirement is too onerous. It's certainly very nice to say that
critics must solve the problems they identify, but that is arguably what
W3C staff, PiGS, and politburo members with day jobs should be doing.
Half the time the issue involves a failure to read the W3C's own specs,
or a failure to simply provide examples from the real Web to back up
what they're saying.

If PiGS member A makes a statement, and some non-PiGS contributor X says
it's false and explains why, it is A's responsibility to fix it. It is
certainly nice if X or someone else solves it, but in a group as
notoriously incapable of spotting its own mistakes as this, merely
pointing them out must suffice.

Further, the converse of "participant in good standing" is not
"participant in bad standing." That requires a formal banning or
shunning and applies solely to former participants in good standing. The
converse of "participant in good standing" is a participant with no
standing at all. The values, essentially, are +1, 0, and -1, not +1 and
-1.
