Lots of acronyms in the subject line

Some reporting back from the Israel accessibility group face to face
meeting

1, 
There is a lot of burden in the requiring of the <Lang> tag.
Most sites will have vocational English words in the middle of Hebrew
Paragraphs.

fine without the Lang tag.
It was suggested that we change the wording of 3.1 success criteria 1
From
passages or fragments of text occurring within the content that are
written in a language other than the primary natural language of the
content as a whole, are identified, including specification of the
language of the passage or fragment. [X] 

To

passages or fragments of text occurring within the content that are
written in a language other than the primary natural language of the
content as a whole, are identifiable, either through the character
encoding used or through direct including specification of the language
of the passage or fragment. [X]

All the best
