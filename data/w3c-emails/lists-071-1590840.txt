IBM's Home Page Reader 3.02 does automatic language-switching as well,
assuming that the LANG attribute is present.

In the note below Chaals raises the topic of automatic language detection.

I wonder if some things could be made easier for authors by having tools

Someday this may be good enough that it would be unnecessary for authors to
do it because standard clients could do it (and translate as necessary using
network services.  Or locally for that matter).

There is at least one example I know of for automatic language 
switching - the Technical University of Tampere http://www.tut.fi 
produced a voice-based email system that auto-detects languages and 
switches synthesiser accordingly. Having one that could read XML to the 
simplistic level of being able to spot the xml:lang attribute in an 
element would be good.

cheers
