Thank you very much, Wendy, for your good explanation.

Ok.

Ok. There were two positions in the discussion in the webaccessibile ML. One
position were guessing that the check point wanted authors not to open popup
windows at all. I wasn't originally thinking that, but the discussion made
me doubtful. So we asked for.

Now, if we do not mean popup avoided, as you explained, then the changes I
proposed are not necessary. I think it's wrong to open popup windows in
general, but after all I agree that it'also wrong to set an imperative rule
about that because there may be cases where popup can be useful, if well
handled by user agent. Anyway, wcag should only point out the problems for
users when ua cannot handle them. Maybe a clarifying sentence or an example
in the techniques can help someone having the same misunderstanding like the
ones that were discussing in Italy. :) Something like stating the reverse
issue: "I.e., if ua can handle popup windows, then the authors can use them
if necessary, but be careful: popup can always be disorienting for some
users".

I thought that wasn't needed, but it seems like some foreign language people
could benefit.

Straight thinking. :)

Thanks, best
