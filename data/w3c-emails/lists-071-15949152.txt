In other words, the ISOC group in Israel are possibly doing one of two
things:

1. Asserting that there are a lot of english words which are recognised as
hebrew, although requiring a different pronunciation. Fortunately, they are
easy to spot because they use a different alphabet, and the tools recognise
them.

This would seem to be a fine claim to make - although I would like to
see some connection to what the vocabulary they are using is...

2. Assuming that words included in hebrew text that are written in latin
script are automatically english. I trust this isn't their assertion.
