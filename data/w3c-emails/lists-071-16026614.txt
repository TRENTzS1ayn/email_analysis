I'm left scratching my head at times wondering what is going on with 
decisions such as these.  I don't understand the logic behind this at 
all.  For an organisation that wants to support a semantically rich web 
I can't see it as a step forward, and for all those who put a lot of 
time into marking up their documents in a meaningful way, what does it 
say to them?
