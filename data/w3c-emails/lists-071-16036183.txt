What is the Accessibility / Usability rule of thumb for using absolute 
and relative units?  Can someone please point me to a very good 
explanation to this (with examples), because it seems to me that 
something like the above example is much better being addressed in 
relative units (maybe I'm wrong). 

I use relative as much as possible.  For what cases should absolute be 
used in place of relative?   In the case of this CSS Tech doc, which 
encourages absolute for margins, in pixels, does that only apply to 
media for screen only?  What do you do for handhelds, etc.  Doesn't 
there need to be a distinction here?  What is wrong with

BODY { margin-left: 0.5em; margin-right: 0.5em}

instead of 

BODY { margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px}

Isn't the relative one more flexible for user and device?
