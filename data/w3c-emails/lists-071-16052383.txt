Roberto, thanks for sending this!

Ironically, the HTML form for entering the color values you want to
check isn't fully accessible: once in forms mode, JAWS is not able to
report whether you're in the "Background" set or the "Foreground" set.
The joys of <fieldset> and <legend>!

John

Hi,
following the last discussion in the teleconference, i've found this
tool about coulour contrast:

in the JS function calculate() is explained as HP proposed to calculate
the good colour contrast.
