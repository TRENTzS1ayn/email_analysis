Roberto, thanks for sending this!

Ironically, the HTML form for entering the color values you want to
check isn't fully accessible: once in forms mode, JAWS is not able to
report whether you're in the "Background" set or the "Foreground" set.
The joys of <fieldset> and <legend>!

Roberto:
Unfortunately this page is (c) HP so I cannot optimize it for
accessibility issues :-/
