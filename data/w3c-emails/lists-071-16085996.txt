So far, I have yet to hear a good argument for the status quo. As it 
is, acronyms and abbreviations are a distinction without much 
difference, and even the difference is unclear and/or actively debated 
by its implementers. If it's not reliably implementable or 
understandable in the first place, it's a poor division to make, 
semantically speaking. So I'm for a single element in XHTML 2, in the 
interest of good semantics. XHTML 2 can say that abbr represents 
acronyms, abbreviations, initialisms, symbols, legends, whatever. I 
don't know why it needs to be more precise than that. The goal is to 
allow for expansion of shorthand expressions. What's the value in 
splitting hairs here?
