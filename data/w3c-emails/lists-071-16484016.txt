I don't know how that's possible when alt text resides in the <img> 
element. It isn't free-floating text.

In the following impossible example, the words "Explanation of picture" 
are the alt text.

<div id="navbar">
<p>Explanation of picture</p>
</div>

<div id="content">
[page of text]
</div>

<div id="footer">
<img src="picture.jpg">
</div>

That's just not how valid HTML works.

Sadly, no.

Loved the double top-posting.
