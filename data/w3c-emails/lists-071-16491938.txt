Two, for the overwhelming factual reasons already adduced on this list, as 
contrasted with the gassy ideology backing up a three-level plan.

As for "definition," there are lots of names we could use. Core and 
Extended are OK. Easy and Advanced work. B and A don't, really.

"PiGS," John. Person in Good Standing. The unworkable, alienating, and 
counterproductive elitism built into the entire W3C system that WAI only 
hauls out when it wants to squelch dissent. This too has been thoroughly 
adduced.
