Interesting.

Good chance to look at how this all fits together.  Some good questions/
issues raised.


Couple more questions for your collection:

1)   I didn't see the technology specific checklists in this.   The
checklists and the test suites are different things (just like technical
specs and test suites are different).    Where do the checklists come in?

2)  the list of techniques talk about things like "ALT text should be less
than X characters."    This is a "SHOULD".  Others are SHALLs.   Would the
checklist (needed for conformance) be just the SHALLs?     

3)  How will we handle the  "SHALL" do this or that or the other.  That is,
the author must do one but not necessarily more than one of them.  

Thanks for putting this forward.  Will help us figure this out.

Subject: 'End to End' Proposal


Hi Everyone,

This is a proposal to unify the guidelines, techniques documents, and test  
suites for WCAG 2. It outlines a methodology and timeline for
following the WCAG 2.0 from end to end. That means checking the  
consistancy from the success criteria, to the gateway to techniques, to the
specific technology techniques and finally to the test suites.

If people would like to contribute we are looking to pair people up, one  
 from the main group and one from the techniques task force (as much as
possible, we won't say no to volunteers). Please send a mail to Wendy or  
myself and we will add you to the timeline document which will be put up
  on the web. We would prefer if people covered checkpoints and techniques  
they have not been highly involved with to afford as much objectivity
as possible.

This was originally proposed by Jenae Andershonis, and has also been  
worked on by Wendy Chisholm and myself.

Jenae and Wendy's examples can be found at:

<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2004AprJun/att-0054/gateway-
outline.htm>

Attached to this mail are a proposed framework for reporting and  
methodology and a timeline and workplan document.


Thanks,

Tom
