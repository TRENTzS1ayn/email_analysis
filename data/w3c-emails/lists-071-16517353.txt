Hello all.

A student asked me about accessibility of javascript.

I have some doubt about what can or cannot be considered accessibile in 
JS. In fact, from a point of view, JS should simply be avoided as the 
only mean to implement a relevant functionality. I.e., the same 
functionality should be available (in other ways) even if JS is not 
active on that user agent.

On the other hand, JS events should be as modality-independent as 
possibile (onSelect instead of onClick, etc). But, still, if JS is not 
supported, this is simply not sufficient.

I'm sure this has already been discussed in the list. I've just looked 
at wcag 2.0 draft, and have not found a simple answer, so I turn the 
question to the WG.

Thanks all
