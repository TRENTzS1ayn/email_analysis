I am opposed to any model of conformance where you can claim "some/most of a
group of requirements" as opposed to a clear list (potentially with either/or
alternatives. Otherwise comparing conformance claims becomes meaningless, and
trying to use them to determine whether a particular person can expect the
content to work for them is also likely to break down.

I think their name is absolutely a marketing issue and we should hand it off
to EO if at all possible.
