Hi Maurizio,

well, of course there are things to be considered when using JavaScript.
Unfortunately, I'm somewhat disposed, but you should at least regard that
you don't generate markup via JS (a fact several 'natural persons' and
'corporate bodies' often disobey) since that markup's just not present using
any UA not capable (anymore) of JS, of course not.

And there's at least Joe Clark who summarized some issues related to
rollovers [1] (yours sincerely, Joe ;).


Best regards,
 Jens.
