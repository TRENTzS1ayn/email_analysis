I don't entirely agree with this. I view JavaScript as a means to provide
convenience rather than exclusive function. However one of the most
accessible ways I know to do it is have JavaScript generate the elements
which are providing that functionality. For example if you have a button
which links to javascript.this.print(); then if it is also generated with
JavaScript only the people able to use it will have it included in their
content. In this way I think it is extremely valid to provide redundant or
more convenient functionality which is also provided by some other server or
user agent function.
