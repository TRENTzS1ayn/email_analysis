It's not convenient to write out parts of a document if they are crucial but
not present for UAs being not capable of or not using JS. It's bad coding
style, too.

It's a difference whether you /generate/ them (elements) or whether you
/hide/ them until a specific event occurs (e.g., via CSS). The latter is
more elegant (though not inevitably good), so I disagree. (My conclusion is
a bit global, but generally applies.)

Well, if you use JS to offer functionality only available with JS, it might
be okay (if you really limit your scripting efforts to this specific action
and don't 'generate' all buttons with JS, for example). By the way, this
example 'limps' since you seem to copy browser functionality.

I disagree. It might be pretty convenient if you can print a document
pressing one of fifty buttons available in a document, but hence, what do
you print? (I exaggerate, I know.) -- And 'valid' are many approaches in Web
development (though not most right now), but that doesn't mean they are
useful or reasonable.


Best regards,
 Jens.
