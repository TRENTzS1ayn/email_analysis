Jonathan Chetwynd also did a bunch of work with others on what he hoped would
one day be a techniques document for WCAG 2 on javascript. He is no longer
involved with WAI, but maintains the document:
http://www.learningdifficulty.org/develop/script-techs.html

You might find that interesting, adn I know Jonathan is still interested in
comments.

cheers
