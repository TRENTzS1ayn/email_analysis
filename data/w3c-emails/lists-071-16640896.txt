Hi All

On our techniques call this week, several of us took the task of contacting
experts in information architecture so that we could map out how all our
various WCAG documents inter-relate, interlink, etc. 

Below is an exchange with a fellow I know that has quite a bit of experience
in this. Unfortunately, he is swamped right now with work but he offered
some preliminary suggestions in an email exchange I had with him below.

Blessings

Makes sense.

Pretty succinct advice: manage the information as a whole and write 
stylesheets to aggregate and/or syndicate the information from/to different 
publications.  When I say "whole" I don't mean "one big XML file" but 
syndicate "one XML file per thematic collection of raw information" for 
independent publications and using XSLT to aggregate from all necessary 
collections when building a piece of the output.

>How are your Guru skills on that?

I do it *all* the time as I believe that is the way information management 
should be done with markup.  All of the course delivery information is 
syndicated and aggregated in that fashion.  No databases involved, just 
text aggregation using markup.

>Would that interest you (if you are a content architect)?

As a contract or as a volunteer contribution?  My volunteer time right now 
is tapped out with chairing two subcommittees on UBL and being the 
international secretariat for the ISO committee on markup.

What specifically were you looking for as services from a content 
architect: defining the document models? writing the stylesheets?

Let me know, David.  Good luck on your committee!
