Hello David,

Thank you for contacting Ken.

Ken says:

For more information about the XML and XSLT that we are using refer to the 
list at the end of this message [1].  I think we have a good handle on XML 
and XSLT, but we need help designing how we present the information.  We 
need help answering:  What are the different ways people will use the 
information?  How should we design the presentation and flow so that people 
can easily find the information they are looking for?

I took an action item to talk with Shawn Henry who is facilitating the WAI 
Web Site Redesign Project [0].  The task force is using a user-centered 
design process [2] to redesign the WAI Web site. I would like the WCAG WG 
to use a similar process to design the suite of documents that support WCAG 
2.0.

Best,
