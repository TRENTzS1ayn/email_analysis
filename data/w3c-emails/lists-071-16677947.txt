About this End to End Exercise Template

   This template may help contributors to complete the test framework for
   a specific Guideline for WCAG 2.0. The format of the Test Framework
   has not been finalized and this process will help us to determine all
   of the information that is available.

   Please feel free to use this document as a place to store all of the
   information that you find.

   This template contains fill-in-the blank statements. The
   fill-in-the-blank sections, which appear like this, "[Guideline
   Number]". The contributor would insert the Guideline Number that they
   are working on. The template requires that the sections of the various
   WCAG 2.0 documents are copied here, please note that this may change
   as the documents progress through to recommendation.

   This template makes reference to various documents for WCAG 2.0. WCAG
   2.0, Gateway, HTML Techniques are separate WCAG WG documents.

   The exercise has the following five phases:
    1. Mapping
    2. Examples
    3. Technology Specific Review
    4. Test Cases and Test File Creation
    5. Metadata Assignments to Test Cases

   The following are some fill-in-the-blank items that are commonly used
   or repeated in this template:
     * [Guideline Number]: the Guideline Number, e.g. Guideline 1.1
     * [Guideline Description]: the Guideline Description, e.g. "For
       non-text content, provide text equivalents that serve the same
       purpose or convey the same information as the non-text content..."
     * [Level 1, 2 or 3 Success Criteria]: identify the success criteria,
       if the guideline does not have a level 1 2, or 3 success criteria
       please state so

   The End to End Exercise template follows this line.

Introduction

   This document outlines the possible test frameworks components to
   support  [Guideline x.x ]. It provides information about mapping from
   WCAG 2.0 to the Gateway Document to the various technology specific
   documents to test suites.

The Five Phases

   There are five phases to this exercise. After completing the five
   phases we will have all of the necessary information to comply with
   the Guideline.
    1. Mapping: The guideline will be mapped to the existing techniques
       documents.  These documents are Gateway, HTML and CSS.
    2. Examples: Each Guideline has examples, at this point real world
       examples will be found and created.
    3. Technology Specific Review: At this phase HTML and CSS will be
       reviewed to ensure that every HTML element, HTML attribute, and
       CSS property have been identify that have accessibility
       applications.
    4. Test Case and Test File Creation: We have many sources to gather
       test cases and test files for our purposes. During this phase that
       information is gathered.
    5. Metadata Assignments: Metadata assignments will be made at the
       test case level, allowing full flexibility is creating all other
       documents.

Parties involved -- do we want to open this up to non-wed call people?

   The [test material name] will be produced in a way that provides for
   contributions from developers and companies in the community. The
   [test material name] will be coordinated and supervised by the [WG
   Name and/or other names]. The WG appoints a moderator to lead the
   effort.

Phase 1: Mapping

   For Phase 1, start with your guideline and success criteria. Working
   through the Gateway, HTML, and CSS documents identify the information
   that supports the guideline.
