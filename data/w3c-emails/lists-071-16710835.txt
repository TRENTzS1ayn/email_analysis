Guideline 2.4: Facilitate the ability of users to orient themselves and move within the content. [level 2 guideline]
This has no level 1 criteria right now. Using markup to convey document structure like those listed for guideline 1.3  will certainly  accomplish 2.4. Therefore :
- the  criterion #1related to structure  in level 2of guideline 2.4 now can be moved to level 1. 
- Also add a note saying that compliance with 1.3 will  ensure 2.4 (level 1). 
This note is analogous  to the note for guideline 1.4 (level 1) which reads:
"Note:
Text that meetsguideline 1.1
should satisfy this criterion."


When markup is properly used for headings, paragraphs, tables,lists, etc. it is possible to cycle through them by using features of AT so that orientation and navigation is facilitated. So this is definitely level 1.
