Ben and I have been cleaning up the issues list.  This email includes
issues that have been closed or verified.  Verified issues are those that
we belive have been addressed in the latest working draft but are asking
the reviewer to confirm before we close the issue.

Closed Issues

Issue 355 - Conformance level of marking changes in language
<http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=355>
Since marking changes in language is Level 2 instead of Level 1, Andi (who 
originally raised the issue) agrees the issue is closed.

Issue 374 - User configurations for emphasis
<http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=374>
At last week's telecon we agreed with yvette's proposal that this is a user 
agent issue and to close the issue.

Verified Issues - waiting for response from reviewer

Issue 460 - Clarity of the document
<http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=460>
Resolution: A series of plain language proposals were submitted to the 
working group in Fall 2003, by John Slatin, Katie Haritos-Shea, and Doyle 
Burnett. Many of these proposals were further refined and accepted by the 
working group in the 11 March 2004 Working Draft.
