Ben and I have been cleaning up the issues list.  This email includes
issues that had been reopened. In most cases, we reopened an issue rather 
than close it to maintain the history associated with the issue.

Issue 172 - checkpoint about use of standard character set
<http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=172>
Wendy talked with Richard Ishida, Martin Duerst, and others at the 
Technical Plenary about a definition of text and how to reference unicode 
in our document.  Wendy has an action to write up these discussions and a 
proposal to close this issue.

Issue 317 - Clarifying color criteria in Guideline 1.3
<http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=317>
After adding color to guideline 1.3 it seemed the issue could be closed, 
however Gregg raised issues about the meaning of the existing text.

Issue 330 - When to expand abbreviations and acronyms
<http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=330>
The March 11, 2004 working draft now uses the language "programmatically
located" but issues and questions remain regarding this language  and many
of the previous comments are still relevant.

Issue 603 - Proposed rewording of Guideline 1.3
<http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=603>
reopened and mapped to Issue 556 because Tom took an action item last week 
to address
<http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=556>

Issue 261 - Unique label or number for success criteria
<http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=261>
Defining labels and definitions of labels [Issue 368] blocks creating the 
numbering scheme. we should have conformance nailed down in next 2 weeks 
and then come up with numbering scheme
