Thanks, Wendy.

Re: Issue #330: On 25 March I sent a proposal to the list to reword
success criteria under 3.1 [1]. The idea was to replace phrases such as
"programmatically located" in 3.1 Success Criteria with "available
through context or markup," as follows:
Guideline 3.1, Level 1 Success Criterion 2:
2. The expanded form of abbreviations and acronyms is available through
context or markup.

Guideline 3.1, Level 2, Success criteria 2 and 3
2. The definitions and pronunciations of all words in the content are
available through context or markup. [I]
3. The meaning of all idioms in the content are available through
context or markup. [I]

Hope this helps.
John

Subject: Reopened issues - week of 19 April 2004



Ben and I have been cleaning up the issues list.  This email includes
issues that had been reopened. In most cases, we reopened an issue
rather 
than close it to maintain the history associated with the issue.

Issue 172 - checkpoint about use of standard character set
<http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=172>
Wendy talked with Richard Ishida, Martin Duerst, and others at the 
Technical Plenary about a definition of text and how to reference
unicode 
in our document.  Wendy has an action to write up these discussions and
a 
proposal to close this issue.

Issue 317 - Clarifying color criteria in Guideline 1.3
<http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=317>
After adding color to guideline 1.3 it seemed the issue could be closed,

however Gregg raised issues about the meaning of the existing text.

Issue 330 - When to expand abbreviations and acronyms
<http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=330>
The March 11, 2004 working draft now uses the language "programmatically
located" but issues and questions remain regarding this language  and
many of the previous comments are still relevant.

Issue 603 - Proposed rewording of Guideline 1.3
<http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=603>
reopened and mapped to Issue 556 because Tom took an action item last
week 
to address <http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=556>

Issue 261 - Unique label or number for success criteria
<http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=261>
Defining labels and definitions of labels [Issue 368] blocks creating
the 
numbering scheme. we should have conformance nailed down in next 2 weeks

and then come up with numbering scheme
<http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=368>
