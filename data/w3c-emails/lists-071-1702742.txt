4.1 Alternate 2

 

In thinking about 4.1, a major problem we identified was existing content.
If we are asking companies to take a list of criteria such as "one idea per
sentence" and review all of the content on their site, it could take them
years.  Even Trace would fail this since we would never find the time to
read all of the thousands of pages to see if there is one idea per sentence.
(Even if we decided we won't come change anything, we wouldn't have the time
to even look at each sentence in order to comply with 4.1.  In addition,
much of the stuff cannot be changed for historical, legal, and archival
reasons.)

 

Now, how about if we focused instead on new material and revised material?
I'm not sure how to word this.  Perhaps it would look like:

 

4.1 You will have successfully complied with 4.1 at the minimum level.  If
you have reviewed all recently generated or updated materials with the
following in mind.
