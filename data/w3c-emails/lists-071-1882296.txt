Hello,

Here are the possible dates for our F2F that is co-located with the CSUN 
conference in L.A. CA USA in mid-March.  Please vote for the dates that you 
would prefer:

1. The saturday/sunday *before* CSUN (15 and 16 March)
2. The sunday/monday *after* CSUN (23 and 24 March)
3. The sunday before and the sunday after (16 march and 23 march).
if you choose this option, we might set it up so that people don't have to 
be at both (some people can't stay for the full week).  a possible division 
of the agenda: cover guidelines/checkpoints on 16 march and techniques on 
23 march.

The WAI IG is meeting the afternoon of 22 March (saturday).  People ought 
to attend to discuss general WAI IG business.  It's also a good place for 
us to get feedback about WCAG 2.0.

Best,
--wendy
