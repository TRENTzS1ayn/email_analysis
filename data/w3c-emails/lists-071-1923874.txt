I agree this could happen, with a high degree of probability.

Possibly. Here are a few options. They both run along the line of
taking the first of the potential misinterpretations mentioned by
Gregg (above) as the lesser of the two evils.

1. Rephrase the items to be considered so they read differently from
   our success criteria:
There should be only one idea per paragraph, where possible.

Words should be used with which the intended audience is expected to
be familiar.
[...]
(others can probably write the above better than I just did).

2. Use a different style (font, layout etc.) for the "items to be
   considered", in order to distinguish them from the success criteria
   (this could also be reflected in the markup).

3. Make an explicit statement somewhere in the guidelines that warns
   against this particular misinterpretation by reminding readers that
   the requirement is that a review be conducted and it is
   acknowledged that the items to be taken into account aren't
   inthemselves testable.

My current thinking, as indicated, is that the misconstrual of these
items as success criteria is less of a practical problem than the risk
of their being overlooked, which is the likely result of moving them
into a separate section below the success criteria. Essentially we
have to decide which potential misinterpretation or misapplication is
worse, and do our best to militate against it. I can say with high
confidence that, however they may be written, the guidelines will be
misinterpreted and misapplied by people who don't understand them or
who implement them carelessly.
