Interesting. My only reservation about this is that some of the above
aren't sufficiently explicit as to  what should be preferred. Try this:

Sentence length and complexity (shorter and less complex sentences are
easier to understand)
[quoting Gregg]

Avoidance of jargon likely to be unfamiliar to the intended audience

These are less ambiguous but still can't be readily misconstrued as
imperatives.

Thoughts?
