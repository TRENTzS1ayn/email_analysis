Hello,

Michael incorporated the resolutions from Thursday's telecon [1] into the 
latest draft of the "Requirements for WCAG 2.0 Checklists and Techniques" 
[2].

Please review this draft before Wednesday (22 January) and send any major 
issues to the list ASAP.  We are hopeful that at next Thursday's telecon 
(23 January), the Working Group will approve publication of the 
requirements to the  W3C Technical Reports (TR) page [3].  If the Working 
Group gives its approval, we hope to publish to TR on Friday (24 January).

Thank you,
--wendy
