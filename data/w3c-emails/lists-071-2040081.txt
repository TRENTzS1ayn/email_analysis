The further we go from definite requirements for the review, the less
seriously people will take them.
It is obvious but worth reminding everyone

All the best,

Interesting. My only reservation about this is that some of the above
aren't sufficiently explicit as to  what should be preferred. Try this:

Sentence length and complexity (shorter and less complex sentences are
easier to understand)
[quoting Gregg]

Avoidance of jargon likely to be unfamiliar to the intended audience

These are less ambiguous but still can't be readily misconstrued as
imperatives.

Thoughts?
