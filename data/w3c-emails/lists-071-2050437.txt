I haven't seen any proposal to reduce the specificity of the
requirements for the review, but only to phrase them in such a way
that they are obviously different from the success criteria. If you
think any specificity is lost in this process, I am sure further work
can be done to fine-tune the relevant statements. However, I am
confident that Avi will be careful in drafting the next version to
ensure that the items to be reviewed are as specific as possible.
