Hello,

We have two upcoming F2F meetings, both in March.

Meeting #1
4 March 2003, Cambridge, MA USA
The focus of this meeting is to advance the WCAG 2.0 techniques.

This WCAG WG meeting is held during the early part of W3C's Technical 
Plenary and WG Meeting Event, in Cambridge, Massachusetts USA. If you are 
interested in other parts of the Technical Plenary Week, which includes a 
day of general presentations and discussion on Wednesday, please note 
carefully the instructions regarding participation and registration for 
different parts of the week, and email the WCAG WG Chairs or staff contact 
with any questions.

Logistics, registration and a draft agenda is available at:

Meeting #2
15 & 16 OR 23 & 24 March 2003, L.A., CA USA
We are still determining the outcome of the votes (refer to my message from 
last week [1]), but the meeting will be held either before or after the 
CSUN conference.  Once we've determined when we'll hold the meeting, I'll 
send notice of registration, logistics, and a draft agenda.

Thank you,
--wendy
