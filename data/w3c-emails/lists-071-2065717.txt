Also, if this is a review, we need to say what should be reviewed.   It
can't be a review against a specific target or criteria or else it starts
becoming a success criteria. 

So we should be specific about the dimension and the direction and even what
is "usually the best".  But I don't think we should be specifying a specific
criteria.

I haven't seen any proposal to reduce the specificity of the
requirements for the review, but only to phrase them in such a way
that they are obviously different from the success criteria. If you
think any specificity is lost in this process, I am sure further work
can be done to fine-tune the relevant statements. However, I am
confident that Avi will be careful in drafting the next version to
ensure that the items to be reviewed are as specific as possible.
