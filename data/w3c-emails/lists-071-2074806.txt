Wendy,

I'd just like to state that it whilst it might be convenient to hold 
meetings at CSUN, this does seem to be a very regular event.

I've mentioned in the past that WAI has a very large American presence, 
and it might help international understanding if meetings were held 
elsewhere more regularly.

thanks

Jonathan
