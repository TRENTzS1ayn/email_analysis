Gregg,

There is definitely something confusing about the description of
"Technology-specific Checklists" in section 5. It states that the checklist
"must include technology-specific checklist items that address every
success criterion in the guidelines." But Section 3.2 states that "for a
given technology, it is not necessary to provide Techniques for every
checkpoint if the checkpoint is not applicable to the technology and the
technology is designed to be used with another technology."

I read 3.2 to mean that not every checkpoint will apply to every
technology. If the checkpoint doesn't apply, then neither do the the
success criteria for that checkpoint. So then how can we require, in
Section 5, that there must be technology-specific checklist items for every
success criterion in the guidelines?

For example, what would the HTML checklist item for checkpoint 1.1 Level 2
success criteria: "the text-equivalent has been reviewed and is believed to
be..."?
