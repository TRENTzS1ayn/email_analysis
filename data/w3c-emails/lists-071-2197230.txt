Thursday, 23 January, 2100 UTC (4 PM US Eastern, 10 PM France, 8 AM Eastern
Australia) on +1-617-761-6200, passcode 9224:

The main purpose of the meeting is to resolve any outstanding issues before
the techniques requirements are published to the W3C Technical Reports page.
Please review the thread starting at 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2003JanMar/0084.html

Also, there is a long list of issues to be resolved resulting from comments
on the TR draft:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/10/comments-WD-WCAG20-20020822.html
As Wendy mentioned on the list, we need volunteers to work through these
issues and put forward proposals, a topic that can be discussed further at
this week's meeting.
