Thursday, 23 January, 2100 UTC (4 PM US Eastern, 10 PM France, 8 AM
Eastern Australia) on +1-617-761-6200, passcode 9224:

The main purpose of the meeting is to resolve any outstanding issues
before the techniques requirements are published to the W3C Technical
Reports page. Please review the thread starting at 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2003JanMar/0084.html

Also, there is a long list of issues to be resolved resulting from
comments on the TR draft:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/10/comments-WD-WCAG20-20020822.html
As Wendy mentioned on the list, we need volunteers to work through
these issues and put forward proposals, a topic that can be discussed
further at this week's meeting.
