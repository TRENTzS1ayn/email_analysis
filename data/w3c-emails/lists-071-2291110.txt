The Techniques teleconference is confirmed for Wednesday, January 29 from
15:00 to 16:30 UTC (10:00am to 11:30am US Eastern/7:00am to 8:30am US
Pacific). The conference information is:

+1-617-761-6200
Passcode 92248

There has not been any discussion on the list about the latest Requirements
draft, and hopefully that means everyone is ok with posting it to TR. Unless
major issues are raised by Tuesday afternoon we will begin that process. The
agenda for this week's teleconference is to begin work in earnest on the
next step: 

1. Continue discussion of schema
2. Introduce tools available for use
