Hello,

We currently have a separate CSS Techniques document.  Please refer to the 
list of techniques documents currently under discussion/development: 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wcag20.html#techs

Note that the last time we generated a version of CSS Techniques was 16 
July 2001 [1], but that I converted the source to xml (using the techniques 
dtd) in August 2002 [2].

There has been some debate about a CSS chapter within each of the "host" 
technologies (i.e., HTML, XML, SVG, SMIL, MathML, etc.) with a separate 
CSS-specific document for overarching CSS techniques and themes.

Does this satisfy your question or are you driving at something else?

[2]  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/2002/08/css-tech.xml - note that this 
is a very sparse document.  I did it this way to highlight where we are 
missing information.  in other words, it is a sort of template for future work.
