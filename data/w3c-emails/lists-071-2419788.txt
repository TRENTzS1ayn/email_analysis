What I'm proposing is that a technique is a specific strategy (e.g., "Use 
the title element to provide a unique title for a page") and that we 
provide supplementary information for that technique (e.g., examples, 
descriptions, etc.).

Thus, a checklist is list of techniques.   A checklist does not contain the 
supplementary information for that technique.
