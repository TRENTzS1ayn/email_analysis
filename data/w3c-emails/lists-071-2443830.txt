Here's a tangent...but please hear me out.  There are likely holes in the 
proposal, but perhaps we can find a nugget of something useful.

I've recently been working on the comments received about Checkpoint 1.3 
(Make all content and structure available independently of presentation). 
This checkpoint combines a variety of WCAG 1.0 checkpoints that lean 
heavily towards HTML.  e.g.:
3.1 When an appropriate markup language exists, use markup rather than 
images to convey information. [Priority 2]
3.3 Use style sheets to control layout and presentation. [Priority 2]
3.5 Use header elements to convey document structure and use them according 
to specification. [Priority 2]
3.6 Mark up lists and list items properly. [Priority 2]
3.7 Mark up quotations. Do not use quotation markup for formatting effects 
such as indentation. [Priority 2]
5.1 For data tables, identify row and column headers. [Priority 1]
5.2 For data tables that have two or more logical levels of row or column 
headers, use markup to associate data cells and header cells. [Priority 1]
etc. etc.

Thus, I'm wondering, "What if we moved the success criteria to the 
technology-specific documents?"  Here's an idea of what it might look like 
at each of the layers:

In the Guidelines/Checkpoints we might have:
Checkpoint 1.3 Make all content and structure available independently of 
presentation

[link to] technology-specific success criteria

Benefits
...

Examples
...

Definitions
...
===

In a separate gateway document (that either exists statically or is 
generated based on user preference):

Technology-specific success criteria

Checkpoint 1.3 Make all content and structure available independently of 
presentation

[link to] HTML success criteria
[link to] SVG success criteria
etc.etc.

===

In an HTML-specifics "checklist":

HTML Techniques for WCAG 2.0

Checkpoint 1.3 Make all content and structure available independently of 
presentation

Minimum level success criteria:
HTML 1.3-1a For data tables, identify row and column headers. [link to] 
techniques for 1.3-1a
HTML 1.3-1b For data tables that have two or more logical levels of row or 
column headers, use markup to associate data cells and header cells. [link 
to] techniques for 1.3-1b

Level 2 success criteria:
HTML 1.3-2a When an appropriate markup language exists, use markup rather 
than images to convey information. [link to] techniques for 1.3-2a

Level 3 success criteria
HTML 1.3-3a Provide summaries for tables. [link to] techniques for 1.3-3a

Just a thought...
