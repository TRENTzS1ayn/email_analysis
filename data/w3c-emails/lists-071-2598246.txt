Sorry for my bad english: I hope I can explain what I mean...

I remember my studies on text-comprehension and there are some critical
issue on checkpoint 4.1.

The comprehensibility of a text rely on many factors. Some of them are
implemented in some automated readability index you can find on most
word processor. But you may notice that they are not really useful. Text
comprehension depends on text purpose, audience ability, and, finally,
on contextual information. What is 'Familiarity of terms and language
structure
'? It's very difficult to say in an objective manner.
Even the 'Length and complexity of sentencesof a phrase' is a
controversial question. In Italian language is considered bad writing to
use only short sentences. Better alternate short, medium and long
phrases and sentences as appropriated, but... when is it appropriated?

Some suggestions: text.comprehension are also influenced by two text
properties: coherence and cohesion.

Coherence: the fact that two contiguos phrases refer to the same
argument. A text is more difficult if the topic are changed often, or if
the subject is not clear and unique in contiguos phrases.

(i.e.: "I wrote a mail. The man was climbing me over."

Not so understandable, uh? What man? How does it relate to the fact I
wrote the mail?.. Lack of coherence.

Instead: "I wrote a long and articulated mail, trying to made it
understandable."

The relation is clear. This is an extreme example, but I
hope you see the point)

Coherence: the correct use of lexical connector: and, but, furthermore,
then... And the correct pronouns used to refer to an object. It's a
language issue, not a content one.

I realize that this suggestion are also difficult to express in
checkpoint, but I think it's important to try to take advantage from
some well consolidated research results, and so I ask for your opinion
about
them.

I don't know if they relate with accessibility of language, but in a
certain way I feel they should.

Hope this may help.
