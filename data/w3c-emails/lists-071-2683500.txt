Yes, I think Lisa's right. This is a good way to merge my suggestion
into the checkpoint...

... Ops: I made an error in my definitions! I named the two with the
same 'coherence' label... Sorry, it was a my mistake. What you name
'cohesiveness', it should be named 'coherence', according to what I
mean.
The meaning is right, anyway:

Good, you hit the point.
To correct my mistake, the one below should be named cohesiveness, not
coherence:

(> 2, Coherence)

2, Cohesiveness:

Yes, perfectly, *cohesiveness* involves this example. Every ambiguity in
the reference caused by lexical choices should be avoided. But this
concept involve any appropriate lexical word that convey relationship
between two sentences or concept. I mean: consequentiality, causality,
simple co-occurrency, etc. The use of And, Then, But, Furthermore, and
so on, is to explicitate the relationship between phrases. They
'connect' the phrases, giving at the same time a meaning to their
relations.

Perhaps this is a topic that may vary in different languages. In
Italian, a tipical example is the use of 'but'. It' is to avversate the
concept it preceed, *but* (au contraire, instead...) sometimes is used
inappropriately to simply
separate or distinguish some concept - not to avversate it! It's a very
common mistake. (in
English 'but' is used even in the sense of "except": Everyone but me; in
Italian we use 'exept', not 'but', so I don't know if I can explain very
well).
Or a generic And is used instead of a better, more specific 'connector'.
I can try to make some better example, if you think it's useful.

Yes. The coherence and cohesiveness involves the capacity of reader to
make the right inference between two lexical informations. The right
inference leads to the correct mental rapresentation of the text. A good
reader can make the right inference even from a bad text, with lack of
cohesiveness or coherence. A bad reader (a reader with reduced cognitive
ability,
like some disable are) cannot. A un-cohesive or un-coherent text is
always more
difficult than well-cohesive/coherent one: the problem is also in the
term of
cognitive load.

The lack of coherence leads to 'creative', 'non-authorized' inferences:
we tend to re-create a coherent mental model even if the phrases are
unrelated, as many research has demonstrated. It can be a creative
writing strategy, too... If the author use it in a conscious way!
You can eliminate lack of coherence only introducing 'bridge-concept'
that
explicitare the reference, the relations between the two non-coherent
sentences.
But you can eliminate lack of cohesiveness just by choosing the right
word instead of the wrong one!...It's a very 'superficial' question: so
it's called lexical. Even if it is in some way conceptual, obviously.
But it can be addressed working on the 'surface of the text'. The
coherence cannot.

Yes, I will think to some better example, trying to facilitate Avi's
work!

Best things.
