Historical and Third Party Copyrighted Materials


Materials which were not developed by or for the entity sponsoring the site
and whose development was not under the control of the entity sponsoring the
site are not required to meet these guidelines in order for a site to meet
the guidelines.  These items would be considered commodities or products
delivered by the site rather than being part of the site.


Roberto:
Sorry... but, for example, if i insert inside a well-conformed web site an
application with code generated by a package (or, for example, a Java
application) that is copyrighted and not accessible, with this claim i can
define "accessible" my web site?

I think that we need that we need to define in some part of the guidelines
(a checkpoint?) that:
"An equivalent version of the materials which were not developed by or for
the entity sponsoring the site and whose development was not under the
control of the entity sponsoring the site must be available for use the logo
for the level reached."
