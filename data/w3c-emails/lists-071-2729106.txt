A little suggestion for the document about Checklists and Techniques [1]:

In a lot of the text there is a reference to "WCAG", for example as in this
title:
"3.4 Relation to WCAG"


At point 6 there is:

"6 References

WCAG2 "


My proposal is that we need to make two choice, because the document content
WCAG and a WCAG2 reference:

1 - change all the "WCAG" in "WCAG2" (so we have reference in point 6)

2 - change the "WCAG2" in point 6 with "WCAG" and mantain the following
text:
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0, B. Caldwell, W. Chisholm, J.
White, G. Vanderheiden. World Wide Web Consortium, 25 January 2001, revised
22 August 2002.


This is necessary for a correct reference to WCAG 2.0 Document.
