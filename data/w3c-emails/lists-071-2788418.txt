Hi all

I knew that one would start a conversation.  Because I see big problems both
ways and no way to solve them.

If something is copyrighted and inaccessible, it is a felony (Federal crime)
to create an accessible version in many cases.   Plagiarism and the
Millennium Copyright Act are two examples.  And there are more.    

Also,  if you click on a document it downloads to your computer and you
expect it to be accessible.  (even HTML).

But if you click on a program and download it you think of it as a product,
not content.

So what if you click on a book?
A film?
A DVD?
A PDF?
A Movie stream?
A Video stream?
A Stock Quote stream in a proprietary (non copyable and therefore non-screen
reader compatible form)?

When is it content and when is it product?
When is it even legal to repackage the content accessibly (that therefore
pirate-able)? 

However, we don't want to give blanket approval that content on a web site
can just be inaccessible if it came from somewhere else......

Historical and Third Party Copyrighted Materials


Materials which were not developed by or for the entity sponsoring the site

Roberto:
Sorry... but, for example, if i insert inside a well-conformed web site an
application with code generated by a package (or, for example, a Java
application) that is copyrighted and not accessible, with this claim i can
define "accessible" my web site?

I think that we need that we need to define in some part of the guidelines
(a checkpoint?) that:
"An equivalent version of the materials which were not developed by or for
the entity sponsoring the site and whose development was not under the
control of the entity sponsoring the site must be available for use the logo
for the level reached."
