I am concerned that this puts all internet radio off the air or off the
accessibility list.  (and other content)

 

 

Comment # 5

SAP (via Audrey Weinland), 31 Oct 2002
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002OctDec/0130.html>

minimum level #2: "prepared audio presentations" What does "prepared" mean?
Not real-time? How does/do personalization/user settings affect this? If you
provide personalization, do you meet the requirement, or does the default
setting in the Web app have to comply?

 

Proposal # 5:

When we use the phrase "prepared audio presentation" to mean that which is
not real time, we are getting into "policy" issues. In the above proposals,
the only audio success criteria has been moved to Level 3. Thus for level 1
compliance, this checkpoint would not be applicable to audio content. Under
checkpoint 1.1, the audio content must have captions or an equivalent
transcript.
