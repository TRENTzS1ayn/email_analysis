two comments:

1) A controlled language is typically not easy to understand from a human
perspective. Restricted vocabularies tend use be precise but not simple
word.

2)We were saying that Use of ILS (when it is all ready) will be equivalent
to a controlled language - because it achieves the same end: IE it resolves
all the ambiguity in text. Unlike a controlled language, however it does not
use a restricted vocabulary and avoid complex syntax. It let the author
write any way they want, and resolves the meanings in the RDF.

However with your definition of controlled language this would not be
acceptable.
Could we say controlled language or mechanism that resolves the ambiguity?


All the best,

This is excellent. The definition presumably belongs in the "definitions"
section
underneath the success criteria: see checkpoint 1.1 for a suitable model.
