A few questions.
1. Would this be accessible if the person couldn't handle RDF or RSS?

Roberto:
This technology must be handled by "server side scripting" (ASP, PHP, CF,
..) but also as "client side scripting" (an example here
http://www.jsdir.com/goonline/esempio.asp?id=7). So there is opportunity for
all to "catch" contents also with XHTML (remember that RSS is well-formatted
"like" XML).


Gregg Vanderheiden:
2. Are we requiring that users have RDF or RSS savvy access?  Even on
public systems?
3. Is RDF / RSS savvy user agents our baseline for the guidelines?


Roberto:
I think we are going in the wrong direction... the original question is: if
an application/content could not be made accessible (for copyright, etc.),
how can the user make a content accessible for respect the "claim".
