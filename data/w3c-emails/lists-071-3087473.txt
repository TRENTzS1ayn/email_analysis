At the teleconference last Thursday we agreed on some final edits needed
before posting the Techniques Requirements draft [1] to the TR page. We have
also discussed this with Judy Brewer and made a few additional edits. Please
review the draft to see if there are any burning issues. If we don't receive
objections we will post this to TR on Friday.
