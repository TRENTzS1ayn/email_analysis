No one has to understand  RDF

in fact, with the approach we are working on  even the user agents will not
have to understand RDF. This is a server side solution. The RDF allows a
service or server to render an alternive accessible rendering of each site.
you can think of it as an accessible mirror site, (although this is a
simplification)
