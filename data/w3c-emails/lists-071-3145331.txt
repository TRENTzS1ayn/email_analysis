Hello Roberto,

It is not a mistake.  We removed it for the following reasons:

1. WCAG 2.0 was the only reference in that section.

2. There were several places in the document where we directly linked to an 
external resource. WCAG 2.0 was the only one that we had an indirect link 
to  (i.e., instead of linking directly to WCAG 2.0 in the text, we linked 
to a target in the references section and then the target linked to the 
external WCAG 2.0 resource). Instead, we now directly link to all of the 
resources throughout the document.

Is this an issue that you feel needs to be fixed?  If so, does it need to 
be fixed before moving to TR?

Thanks,
--wendy
