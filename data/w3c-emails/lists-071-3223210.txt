Hello,

Reminders and thoughts about upcoming events:

1. We will have a F2F meeting the Sunday and Monday *after* CSUN (23 and 24 
March).  I will be announcing registration and logistics information 
ASAP.  The focus of this meeting is expected to be general WCAG 2.0 issues.

2. Reminder: registration closes 26 February for the F2F on 4 March [1] in 
Cambridge, MA.   The focus of this meeting is Techniques.

3. There will be a WAI Glossary meeting Friday (7 March).  I will announce 
registration and logistics information ASAP.  If you are interested in 
attending in person (we will not have phone support for this meeting), 
please send me a private email.

4. We would like to hold a meeting in Europe, most likely Venice, Italy 
most likely sometime between May and July.  Please send me a private email 
with dates that you prefer and dates that you are not available.

5. Are there other events that you are likely to attend this year that we 
could piggyback with a WCAG WG F2F?  Ideas for European, Asian, South 
American and African events  are particularly welcome so that we can better 
ensure input from the wide world on our *World Wide* Web Content 
Accessibility Guidelines. Please send me a private email with suggestions.

Best,
--wendy
