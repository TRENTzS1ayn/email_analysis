The plan for this week is to continue last week's agenda as detailed
at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2003JanMar/0134.html
beginning with checkpoints 5.3 and 5.4, encompassing also checkpoint
5.2 if necessary.

If time permits we should also examine checkpoint 1.4: see Andi's
proposals at
