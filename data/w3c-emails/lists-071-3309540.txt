Great.  Nice analogy

Now - a couple more questions.  

How does the server know that it should deliver content from the "virtual
mirror" site vs the standard site?

And does this happen automatically for subsequent pages?

And if it does automatically, - what if it was only needed for the one page
and not subsequent pages?

Just trying to figure this all out.

Thanks

 
Gregg

No one has to understand  RDF

in fact, with the approach we are working on  even the user agents will not
have to understand RDF. This is a server side solution. The RDF allows a
service or server to render an alternive accessible rendering of each site.
you can think of it as an accessible mirror site, (although this is a
simplification)
