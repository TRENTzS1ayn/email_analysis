In the webopedia page abou arrow keys [1] there is the solution: an
explanation says:

"The arrow keys are also called cursor control keys"

So the right word is "cursor control keys" that are defined by webopedia [2]
as:

"Special keys on computer keyboards that move the cursor. The arrow keys,
for example, move the cursor up, down, right, and left. In addition, most
keyboards have End, Home, Page Up , Page Down , and Backspace keys."


Our sentence could be changed as:
"plus cursor control keys"

Hmmm
That may not be clear.
Are "function keys" in a qwerty layout?
Are "arrow keys"?

Hi,
We can refer to the "webopedia"
http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/k/keyboard.html

why don't add this text at the end of the phrase:

"and special keys that are available in QWERTY layout  keyboard"

?

These are my two cents ;-)

We need to add something beyond just the Unicode.   Hmmm  Just add
The following to the end of what you have   ...  "plus standard character
Entry and editing keys (up, down, left, and right arrows, etc.)

  I wonder.  The Device Control 1,2,3,4 codes in UNICODE.   Aren't those
usually
arrow keys?
The following are all std UNICODE characters

SPACE
ESCAPE
TAB
ENTER / RETURN
LINE FEED
DELETE (BACKSPACE)
PAGEFEED
VERTICAL TAB   (what is this exactly. Tab down to specified place on page?)
