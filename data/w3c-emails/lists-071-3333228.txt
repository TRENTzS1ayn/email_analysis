How does the server know that it should deliver content from the "virtual
mirror" site vs the standard site?


Roberto:
Depends. In some cases, the server control the IP address of the web server
that make the request and in other cases there is not ip request.


Gregg:
And does this happen automatically for subsequent pages?


Roberto:
Yes... an example is www.dev2dev.it: all these news are outside from the
website and are received directly from RSS feed from the network websites.


Gregg:
And if it does automatically, - what if it was only needed for the one page
and not subsequent pages?


Roberto:
You control what you wanna make public and/or if you want to receive only
one-page information or a follow-up of the contents.
