At the risk of crushing Level 2 under too many items, should there be an
item on text written in all caps?

THIS OCCURRED TO ME AFTER READING A SIGN TYPED IN ALL CAPITAL LETTERS AS
I SAT ON THE WASHING MACHINE IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM OF MY DAUGHTER'S PIANO
TEACHER'S APARTMENT BUILDING DURING LAST WEEK'S MEETING.

Could this fit under Level 1?
