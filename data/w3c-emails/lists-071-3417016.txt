Hi,
yesterday in IRC with bengt we have talk about this program as a
sobstitution for net2phone.

Net2phone limit is that it works only in Microsoft Windows platform and this
don't let the user with other OS and with no speed connection to discuss in
the teleconference.

I've test (i know, you are thinking: he is the WCAG beta tester :D) and i
have found iconnecthrere the good thing for the teleconference.

This package is usable by PC connection [1] that let the user to save his
passcode and use a little phone-client in his Windows platform or directly
by phone calling a toll-free country number (for now there are 14 countries
[2] listed) that request the user to insert login and password before start
the call.

The good thing is that there are great monthly plans [3] that, for example,
with $4.95 / month you can make 400 PC-to-phone minutes each month to the
US: 1.2 cents per minute instead of 5.9 cents per minute by net2phone.

I think this well be our support tool: 10 hours means all the thuesday
teleconferences covered by 4.95 a month and means that - if used toll-free
number - that you have no bandwidth problems.

I hope this could help :)
