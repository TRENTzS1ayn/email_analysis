Hmmmm

We can't say "keyboard or other input device" since that would allow mouse
only web pages.

But  Unicode and cursor control Keys keys should cover all that we are
looking for.  Yes?

Remember also that not everyone in the world uses QWERTY keyboards.  I
think you need to focus less on the specific characters involved and
more on enabling the functionality through some alternative method. I
would just say: "through a keyboard or other input device"

Hope that helps,
