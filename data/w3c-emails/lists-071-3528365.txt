I'm happy you found it useful :)
I think you made a great work!

It's very important the introduction you made:

Good. Just two comments:

>

This is to give rithm and good style to writing, as I know.

> 3) Coherence of paragraphs (too much change in topic or references
> between adjacent sentences makes text more difficult to understand;

Should the lenght of paragraph be addressed by checkpoint 2, rather than
by the 'coherence' issue?
Something as:
(guides to clear writing emphasize
 shorter sentences, with one idea per sentence, but they also recommend
that writers vary sentence lengths within a document; anyway, paragraphs
that are excessively long also present a challenge)

very good the distinction between 3 an 4: it's more clear! :)

Just to be sure to understand the wcag-wg method: shuld we provide in a
separate document some example for this checkpoint? I think the
scientist and the monkey example should be included!... ;-)
