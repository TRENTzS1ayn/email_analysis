It gives me a good idea of what I should be trying to do. What direction to
head.  But of course we don't know exactly what should be done for any given
piece of content.  

Were you thinking we should be more specific?

I think that the above criteria have lost clarity. Will people know what to
do?

All the best,

I think you made a great work!

It's very important the introduction you made:

Good. Just two comments:

This is to give rithm and good style to writing, as I know.

Should the lenght of paragraph be addressed by checkpoint 2, rather than
by the 'coherence' issue?
Something as:
(guides to clear writing emphasize
 shorter sentences, with one idea per sentence, but they also recommend
that writers vary sentence lengths within a document; anyway, paragraphs
that are excessively long also present a challenge)

very good the distinction between 3 an 4: it's more clear! :)

Just to be sure to understand the wcag-wg method: shuld we provide in a
separate document some example for this checkpoint? I think the
scientist and the monkey example should be included!... ;-)
