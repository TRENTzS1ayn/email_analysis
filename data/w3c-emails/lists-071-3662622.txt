Here are some notes on changes I've made to Richard's extension of xmlspec 
[1].  Also, changes between our old dtd  [2] and the xmlspec extensions [1].

Questions:
1. Not clear yet the best way to handle examples.  xmlspec has an example 
element that separates a descriptive "head" element from the class of 
obj.mix elements (i.e., from my understanding you could have 
<example><head>...descriptive text here...</head><code> ...code here... 
</code></example>)

2. I think for each technique we will have two types of examples:
     1.  instructive examples mixed with
          prose whose purpose is educational.
     2.  examples with complete markup whose
          purpose is to generate test files (ala Michael/
          Chris/Josh's test suite examples)

3. I marked up a couple techniques from the html techniques [3] as I was 
playing with this, but it's time to have a design discussion about exactly 
what we want and how we want to model it.  (fyi: the xml of the html 
techniques using the old dtd is at [4], the xml of the css techniques is at 
[5], and all of these links are available from the "Development of WCAG 
2.0" page [6])

===
Old dtd compared to new xmlspec derivative.
form: was [Old element name] now [New element name]
was example now  eg-group
was explanation now description  (reusing description element rather than 
creating new explanation element)
was sample/code now code (not sure this works.  trying it for now.  before 
our sample elements had child code elements.  since most of the code 
elements only contained code, didn't seem that we needed both.)
was name now short-name  (don't want to overload name)
was <applies-to checkpoint="xyz"/> now <applies-to><checkpoint 
href="xyz"/></applies-to>
was description/rule  now rule/p
was p/see-also now see-also/p/loc  (i have some issues with this)
