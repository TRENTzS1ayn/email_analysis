Just in case people on the list who are not actively involved in the
Techniques development are not closely following list messages with subjects
prefaced with "[techs]", I'd like to draw your attention to a couple things
raised in my two most recent posts [1] and [2]. The summary is that I would
like to solicit members of the list for discussion points around HTML
techniques, and to propose that we begin to spend the first half of the
Wednesday Techniques calls working through specific HTML techniques. This
may be of interest to a wider group than the small group working on the
infrastructure and would like to encourage you to join for that part of the
call. More details are in the messages linked below.
