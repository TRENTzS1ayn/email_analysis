Hello,

At this a.m.'s techniques telecon we talked about use cases for the 
printable version of the checklists (although the use cases seem to apply 
to checklists in general).  We came up with three uses of the WCAG 1.0 
checklist [1] based on our experiences:

1.  user: developer
task:  reviewing site, making notes in table cells. go back to checklist 
on-line. but no way to fill out on-line.

2. user: evaluation and repair tool developer
task:  making the eval tool do what the checklist does. uses the checklist 
as a guide to determine if the tool covers everything.

3. user: 3rd party evaluator
task: evaluating a web site.  since they are not the developer and perhaps 
not technical, may answer some of the checks "don't know" if they don't 
know the intent of the elements.

What other guidance can we give people when they are trying to determine 
conformance?

The User Agent Working Group published "How to evaluate a user agent for 
conformance to UAAG 1.0" [2] which includes a series of steps in prose. 
They also published a checklist for UAAG 1.0 [3].

The Education and Outreach Working Group published "Getting Started: Making 
a Web Site Accessible" [4] and "Evaluating Web Sites for Accessibility" [5].

Other resources:
WebAIM's checklist for 508 [6] and tutorials [6.5].
IBM's checklist [7]
NCAM's guidelines [8]
Dive Into Accessibility [9] sorts tips by person, disability, design 
principle, web browser (includes some assistive technologies), and 
publishing tool.

There is a lot of other great work out there, this is just a small sample 
to spawn some discussion.
