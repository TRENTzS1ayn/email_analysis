I'm passing these comments on regarding checkpoint 1.5. They come from 
Judy Harkins, who is the director of the Technology Assessment Program
at Gallaudet University, and are in response to a request for advice
about the difference between foreground and background sound such that
background sounds would not interfere with foreground sounds.

Her comments are based on the Jan 8 draft of WCAG 2.0.

Subject: Re: Foreground and Background Audio Question

Ben,
?
I think "audio presentation" is not the best term to be counterpart to
"text content."? Usually foreground audio content is speech, and that
would be the clearest way to say it.
?
So...Minimum level would be:
Speech content is not presented over background sounds or music that
seriously interfere with the intelligibility of the speech content
unless the background sounds can be easily removed.
?
I would suggest that Level 2 for audio be at the current one for level 3

Re dB level I would say at least 20 dB lower.??
?
And that level 3 for audio be the same as for visual, i.e., "there are
no background sounds or music"
?
?
Benefits,
simpler to say, Background sounds interfere with the ability of someone
with a hearing impairment to understand speech, and may also interfere
with the intelligibility of the speech to someone who is in an
environment with ambient noise.? 
?
Under examples, example 2, you might want to say "speech track" instead
of narration.? 
?
Hope this helps,
?
Judy
