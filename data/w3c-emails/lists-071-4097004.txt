I would suggest that the line between content and user agent lie with
whether the interface comes and goes with the content or not.

 

That is

 

-          if when you flush the cache, the interface code is still resident
on your machine, then it is User Agent.

o       You may have downloaded it in advance - or as an automatic step in
viewing your page. but it was downloaded and installed and persists after
the content is gone.

 

-          if the interface code comes with the content and disappears when
the content is gone, then the interface is part of the content - and not a
user agent.
