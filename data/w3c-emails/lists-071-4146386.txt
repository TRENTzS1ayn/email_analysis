> 4. What is a major section and what is a long document?

Inevitably, authors will have to make those determinations
themselves. You can't shove a formula down people's throats: "If
your document exceeds x kilobytes of text, it is considered a long
document."

> 5. Can valid long documents be devoid of paragraphs?

Heavens, yes.

Images, anyone?

Flash?

Ever watched a movie trailer?

I listen to John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show for six hours a week. Those
are pretty long documents, don't you think? And not a <p></p>
element anywhere.

I appeal to WAI to free itself from its ongoing bias that the only
true Web documents are those jammed to the margins with words words
words.
