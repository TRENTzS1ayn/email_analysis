Fix the screen readers. Don't write WCAG 2.0 to work around the bugs
in (inevitably) Jaws, which to this day cannot handle reasonably
likely combinations of valid HTML, like <img alt="" title=""
longdesc="" /> or-- heaven help us-- the same HTML inside <a
title=""></a>.

That's a screen-reader issue. It has nothing to do with WCAG 2.0's
preferred authoring practices.

Remember, *the way Jaws screws up Web pages* should not be the basis
for writing Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

That user's tools are broken. Of course, it's what a lot of people
are stuck with, but whose problem is that?

No sighted Web designer would do that, nor should they have to.

Doubtful in the extreme, and more likely to trigger angry
complaints.

Nice touch.
