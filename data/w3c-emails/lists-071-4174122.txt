I think it is if this part of content is a choice by the user to help them
access other content.
All the best,

  I would suggest that the line between content and user agent lie with
whether the interface comes and goes with the content or not.



  That is



  -          if when you flush the cache, the interface code is still
resident on your machine, then it is User Agent.

  o       You may have downloaded it in advance - or as an automatic step in
viewing your page. but it was downloaded and installed and persists after
the content is gone.



  -          if the interface code comes with the content and disappears
when the content is gone, then the interface is part of the content - and
not a user agent.
