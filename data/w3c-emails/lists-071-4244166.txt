Hi to all!

For the full text (in italian):

This document has received the support with signature of more than 130
deputy and support of the biggest association in Italy for ICT.

I hope that W3C will also support this initiative.
I think it is the first law proposal in Europe that receipt all-in-full the
WAI project:
