Hi to all!

IWA/HWG that receipt all the WAI project and assign by law to the W3C
the "normative definition" for the www accessibility is entered to the
Chamber of Deputy of Italy:

For the full text (in italian):

m

This document has received the support with signature of more than 130
deputy and support of the biggest association in Italy for ICT.

I hope that W3C will also support this initiative.
I think it is the first law proposal in Europe that receipt all-in-full
the WAI project:

WCAG
ATAG
UAAG

This for your information :)
