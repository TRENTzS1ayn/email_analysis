The Techniques teleconference is scheduled for Wednesday, March 12 from
15:00 to 16:30 UTC (10:00am to 11:30am US Eastern/7:00am to 8:30am US
Pacific). The conference information is:

+1-617-761-6200
Passcode 92248

Agenda: 

1. Baseline technology/conformance profiles
2. Pick up discussion of Chris's techniques and Wendy's questions, on list
before if possible
3. Continue discussion of "major sections"

I will be out of town this week and will most likely not be able to attend
and moderate the call. I haven't yet arranged for someone else to take this
role but for now expect that the call will still proceed. Someone will
contact the list to indicate whether the call will proceed or not. I hope it
will because next week many of us will be tied up at the CSUN conference and
most likely we will cancel next week's call.
