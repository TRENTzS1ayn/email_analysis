About the latest version of 4.1: very good job, Avi. Just one buzz in my
head... :)

Should this be 'readability' or comprehension? Yes, comprehension is
improved by readability, but capitalizing reduce readability first. Or,
better, the recognizability of letters... it's an ininfluent issue, just
a my post-coffee mumble? ;-)

Very good, anyway.
