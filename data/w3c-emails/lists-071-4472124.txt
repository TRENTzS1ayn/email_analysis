Yes John,
but he requests for this example:

"<title>Home Page - Spiegazioni della direttiva WCAG del
World Wide Web Consortium</title>"

if you use in <title> Acronym and Abbr, this text is shown in the title
bar...

If the principal language of the document is Italian, then set the LANG
attribute of the HTML element to Italian, thus:

<HTML lang="it">

Then, to identify an English-language phrase, use the LANG attribute
with the <span> attribute:

<span lang="en">I'm an English phrase!</span>

You can test this using IBM's Home Page Reader 3.02, which changes
dictionaries on the fly.

I forward the question of an IWA member:

----
I have a small issue that I am hoping you can help me with.  I am trying
to create web pages with the new standard XTML, following the rules for
accessibility set down by WCAG and Internationalizations..

1) Example: "<title>Home Page - Spiegazioni della direttiva WCAG del
World Wide Web Consortium</title>"
    On this example there is a mix of english words and italian words
because the page is wrote in italian language and is related to argument
that could not be translated in italian. I can understand that I can use
"Pagina Principale" instead of "Home Page" even if is not so nice, but I
should use <acronym> for WCAG and english spelling for "World Wide Web
Consortium". I repeat this is only an example but the concept is: how
can I switch language or how can I show acronyms inside "string"
attribute?
