If the principal language of the document is Italian, then set the LANG
attribute of the HTML element to Italian, thus:

Then, to identify an English-language phrase, use the LANG attribute with 
the attribute: I'm an English phrase! You can test this using IBM's Home 
Page Reader 3.02, which changes dictionaries on the fly. John Slatin, Ph.D.

To: WCAG List Subject: acronym in title... I forward the question of an IWA 
member: ---- I have a small issue that I am hoping you can help me with. I 
am trying to create web pages with the new standard XTML, following the 
rules for accessibility set down by WCAG and Internationalizations.. 1) 
Example: " " On this example there is a mix of english words and italian 
words because the page is wrote in italian language and is related to 
argument that could not be translated in italian. I can understand that I 
can use "Pagina Principale" instead of "Home Page" even if is not so nice, 
but I should use for WCAG and english spelling for "World Wide Web 
Consortium". I repeat this is only an example but the concept is: how can I 
switch language or how can I show acronyms inside "string" attribute?
