Yes John,
but he requests for this example:

"<title>Home Page - Spiegazioni della direttiva WCAG del
World Wide Web Consortium</title>"

if you use in <title> Acronym and Abbr, this text is shown in the title
bar...

If the principal language of the document is Italian, then set the LANG
attribute of the HTML element to Italian, thus:

Then, to identify an English-language phrase, use the LANG attribute with 
the attribute: I'm an English phrase! You can test this using IBM's Home 
Page Reader 3.02, which changes dictionaries on the fly. John Slatin, Ph.D.

To: WCAG List Subject: acronym in title... I forward the question of an IWA 
member: ---- I have a small issue that I am hoping you can help me with. I 
am trying to create web pages with the new standard XTML, following the 
rules for accessibility set down by WCAG and Internationalizations.. 1) 
Example: " " On this example there is a mix of english words and italian 
words because the page is wrote in italian language and is related to 
argument that could not be translated in italian. I can understand that I 
can use "Pagina Principale" instead of "Home Page" even if is not so nice, 
but I should use for WCAG and english spelling for "World Wide Web 
Consortium". I repeat this is only an example but the concept is: how can I 
switch language or how can I show acronyms inside "string" attribute?
