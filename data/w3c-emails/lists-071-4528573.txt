Uhm.. I see what you mean, and it's true. But research in
multimedia-comprehension field doesn't reach the same result that
text-comprehension field. I had some experience in multimedia
comprehension, and the double (or multiple) code can cause a lot of
different conditions about clearity of the content and comprehension.
It's a very tricky question... Perhaps we should distinguish the
media-specific suggestions, after stating a general 'provide clear
content'?

It's all to do, anyway.

Right: but it isn't so easy as for the code!
Text/content vary for purpose and audience, and there are some
foreign-language specific issue. I don't know how to consider that in
the checkpoint... Suggestions?
What do you mean with 'enablling a decision to be made to ignore this
instance'? I don't know if I understand, an example may help for me.
Perhaps it's possible to turn our checkpoint to that approach, but I
need to see it (sorry, my bad english... :-((  ).
