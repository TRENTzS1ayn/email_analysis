The PF history here is that lately we have been arguing for the SVG model over
the HTML model for this reason.  We just haven't got HTML to absorb the SVG
model in this regard yet.

HOWEVER, just what the structures should be is not necessarily given a 
final answer
in the svg:title svg:desc pair of element types.  This is related to the thread
about "Should a browser use the ALT string as a tooltip?" running on the UA 
list.

It's a genuine issue, the accessibility concerns are sympathetic with what 
Richard
has suggested, but we still need a well-formed process to reduce this to 
features
in the XHTML 2.0 specification.
