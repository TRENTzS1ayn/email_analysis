Using a local annotations server (I'll repeat it on a public one shortly) I
annotated the acronym "SWAD-E" in the title of the page
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/200303/anno-acc/demo.html

Part 3 below includes the context property - the critical piece that points
to a range of characters in an XML document. This uses Xpointer, so it can
refer to text in any attribute or element.

In my test run I used an annotation type of Comment (part 4 below) - there is
no reason we can't create a vocabulary with types that are expansion of
acronyms, versions in a different langauge, etc., and Lisa Seeman has already
done some work in that direction.

part 6 below refers to a body that contains the actual content of the
annotation, which can be retrieved independently (although in this example it
only works if you are running on my personal laptop, with a public annotea
server it would be accessible like any other web resource).

More details about annotea are available from http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea
The tools I used to do this are my own publicly available ones, produced as
part of the SWAD-Europe project, available from
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/200209/annodemo - they are the least user
friendly of many annotea clients, being designed for incorporation into real
interfaces, but they are the most flexible. At this stage I don't think what
I did is possible in other Annotea tools, but it should be relatively simple
to adapt them.

This approach could be used by any tools for any well-formed XML (including
XHTML but not including old-fashioned HTML), but it seems to me a repair
strategy - where possible I would markup languages that allowed as much of
this as possible to be done in the document itself.

This is the annotation stored (I numbered parts for easy reference - the
numbers don't appear in the annotation itself):

1. <?xml version="1.0" ?>
