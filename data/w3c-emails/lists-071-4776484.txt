I agree it would be a good idea to support phrasal markup within the
<title> element.

with my i18n IG hat (rarely worn I notice) on I think this makes good
sense.

I would also suggest that this follows from the requirement in XML
Accessibility Guidelines to have equivalent alternatives in a way which
are flexible (checkpoints 1.1 and 1.2) - http://www.w3.org/TR/xag#g1_0
