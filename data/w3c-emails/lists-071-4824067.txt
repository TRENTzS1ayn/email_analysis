Or choosing an appropriate glyph for characters that have very different

PS: Just today, I showed a Maggie instant spaghetti pack to my mother and
brother (both have a BSc) and asked them what do they think the weight is,
by just looking at the Urdu text printed on the box and not the English.  
My brother said 40 grams and my mother couldn't comment. She said that it
may be 10 grams, but this pack is much heavier. It was 70.
