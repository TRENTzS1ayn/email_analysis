That's not safe. That way your document won't be standard. How do you know
what will be the exact name of an Urdu font on a future desktop with a
very standard browser and a very standard set of fonts?

Since OpenType allows language-specific glyph replacements, that desktop
may not even have an Urdu-specific font. It may have an Arabic font that
has an extra glyph for the Urdu 7 to use only when some software
specifically asks for text to be set in Urdu. Annonating with a font name 
will not have *any* effect in this case.
