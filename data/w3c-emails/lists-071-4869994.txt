Yes, definitely. The more something applies in more than one place,
for example, and the more it is part of one specific rendering rather
than the 'original' text, the more sense it makes to put it offline
rather than inline.

The risk depends on how the items are matched. In Chales'
examples, if the author of that page edits the title, the
annotation still starts at character 19, but no longer at
the right word.

My current judgement is that we need both:
- Better ways for inline annotation, not limited due to the fact that
   some things are in attributes when they shouldn't.
- New (or better established) ways to link to glossaries and similar
   stuff.

I think the community implicitly already has quite a good understanding
of that distinction. On average, and for purely practical (but very
important) reasons, inline markup seem to have performed much better
in most cases, but there are good cases for offline stuff, too
(in particular stylesheets).
