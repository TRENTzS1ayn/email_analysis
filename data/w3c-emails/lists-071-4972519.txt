Wendy,

whilst M,S and T are consistent in there usage, and repeated regularly 
throughout the Guidelines, really there seams little reason for 
reducing Navigable to N.
This has been discussed at length with regard to some HTML attribute, I 
forget which.
The point is that for very little extra text the meaning is more 
immediately transparent.

back on M,S and T, don't we already have A, AA and AAA as well as 1,2 
and 3 do we need another tier?

thanks

Jonathan
