Oh AND, someone pointed out that if we use that numbering scheme - that it
doesn't translate to other languages.
But if we use  
1-2-1-4   
it says nothing.  No clue as to what it means or belongs to......
hmmmmmm. 

What is meaningful -- and yet is language independent?
Anyone have any ideas?

Hi Jonathan

We do not have A, AA, AAA anymore.

And M, S and T   are  Minimum, Second and Third 
So they replace 1, 2, 3

Wendy,

whilst M,S and T are consistent in there usage, and repeated regularly 
throughout the Guidelines, really there seams little reason for 
reducing Navigable to N.
This has been discussed at length with regard to some HTML attribute, I 
forget which.
The point is that for very little extra text the meaning is more 
immediately transparent.

back on M,S and T, don't we already have A, AA and AAA as well as 1,2 
and 3 do we need another tier?

thanks

Jonathan
