I think M, S, and T are needless redefinitions. Nobody outside of this 
list will know or care what they mean. A, AA, and AAA are at least 
recognizable.

If it's a matter of screen-reader capability, then I suggest the terms 
spelled out: "A", "double A" and "triple A". Or something else that's 
sequential, like A, B, and C.
