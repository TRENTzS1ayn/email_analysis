Gregg,

as if I need to spell it out, I agree with Matt, and would prefer, one 
English word such as Navigation to be included as a topic marker
Presumably this word could be translated for localisation

AAA is clearer than 1,2 ,3 in my opinion as AAA is clearly the best, 
whereas 1 and 3 are arguable.....similarly with A and C

thanks

Jonathan
