We decided to not use A, AA, AAA in WCAG 2.0 because 2.0 is structured in a
completely different way and  level 1 2 and 3 don't mean the same thing as
A, AA, and AAA.   So it would be confusing.  

But if we ignore that detail - and just think of it as being 3 levels of
increasing accessibility.   Interesting to consider. 

But then don't you end up with a number scheme that looks like

N1AAA2    ??

Gregg,

as if I need to spell it out, I agree with Matt, and would prefer, one 
English word such as Navigation to be included as a topic marker
Presumably this word could be translated for localisation

AAA is clearer than 1,2 ,3 in my opinion as AAA is clearly the best, 
whereas 1 and 3 are arguable.....similarly with A and C

thanks

Jonathan
