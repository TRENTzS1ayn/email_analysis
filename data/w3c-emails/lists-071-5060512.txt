Hi,
for "internationalization" of the reference, instead of M, S, T why don't
use roman number?

I (first)
II (second)
III (third)

Also this could be a mind-back for people that knows A, AA, AAA

These my two cents :)

Hi Jonathan

We do not have A, AA, AAA anymore.

And M, S and T   are  Minimum, Second and Third
So they replace 1, 2, 3

Wendy,

whilst M,S and T are consistent in there usage, and repeated regularly
throughout the Guidelines, really there seams little reason for
reducing Navigable to N.
This has been discussed at length with regard to some HTML attribute, I
forget which.
The point is that for very little extra text the meaning is more
immediately transparent.

back on M,S and T, don't we already have A, AA and AAA as well as 1,2
and 3 do we need another tier?

thanks

Jonathan
