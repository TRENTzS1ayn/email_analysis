Good thoughts. 
Remember that all this has to be read aloud by screen reader users. 
Try reading there aloud before each item in a list. You begin to see what
was nice about   N3M2
It reads quickly
But has the other problems,

Mmmmhhh... I think is a good numbering proposal. Maybe we could

[N.4] M1: where inconsistent or unpredictable responses are essential
           (...)

[N.4] M2: wherever there are extreme changes in context, one of the
           (...)



Or, mixing the letter reference and number of checkpoint:

N(3.4) M1: where inconsistent or unpredictable responses are essential
           (...)

N(3.4) M2: wherever there are extreme changes in context, one of the
           (...)


What about? Too complex?
