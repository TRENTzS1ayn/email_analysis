why not consider *, **, ***.  or any other easily found and positive 
symbol such as @, @@, and @@@, which could be agreed on.

the problem with 3 different symbols. is that the order is not 
apparent. 1st is great but so is 3/3, so is one better than three? 
Whereas most people accept that more of the same is better, even though 
this ain't necessarily so.

I don't see any problem staying with A, AA, and AAA, 2.0 is a different 
standard, so it's just different.
'Crowns' were a coin for (half) a millennia though the value changed, 
and Dollars are no longer solid silver.
