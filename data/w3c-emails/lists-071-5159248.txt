Subject: Tabindex
 
Proposal:
Tabindex can include any number 0 through 9 and may not exceed 32767.  A
tabindex of 0 should never be used because the 0 is read as a leading 0
as in 03 or 0340.  Therefore a tabindex="0" would be understood as
tabindex="" where a tabindex="03" would be understood as tabindex="3".
 

I suggest to add a simple explain and made the follow phrase:
Tabindex can include any number 0 through 9 starting from 1 to 32767.  A
tabindex of 0 should never be used because the 0 is read as a leading 0
as in 03 or 0340.  Therefore a tabindex="0" would be understood as
tabindex="" where a tabindex="03" would be understood as tabindex="3".
