That is not what the spec says. tabindex="0" is explicitly permitted
as a legal value.

<http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/interact/forms.html#adef-tabindex>
    2. Those elements that do not support the tabindex
attribute or support it and assign it a value of "0" are navigated
next.  These elements are navigated in the order they appear in the
character stream.

The spec also states "User agents should ignore leading zeros."
tabindex="0" does not constitute a leading zero. It isn't leading
anything.
