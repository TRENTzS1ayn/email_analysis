Evidently. Any number theorists in the house?

One would only do that if one wanted the element to receive tabbing
in no special way save for its order of appearance in the text.

tabindex="0" is useful. You could add a tabindex value to every <a>
element on the page. The ones you wanted people to navigate through
in a specific order you could assign a positive value to. The others
get 0. But you're consistent in that all the <a>s have a tabindex. I
could imagine this would be an issue of authoring tools more than
anything.

Evidently the validator is in error.

It shouldn't be.
