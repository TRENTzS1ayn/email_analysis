Yes,  TABINDEX='0' functions like TABINDEX="" but no, this is not because it
is treated as a "leading zero."

It is, as Joe reminds us, because TABINDEX='0' is assigned a "none of the
above" reserved value by the spec.  This is like the convention where zero
as the timeToLive is used as a code for "no end in sight."

Authors should be aware that TABINDEX='0' will collate after 32767 and not
before 1.

This is per spec but probably not what they expected.  Merits a warning,
not a prohibition.

Do we say anywhere that TABINDEX should be set on all of the tabbable
elements, or none of them?  The behavior when the elements with TABINDEX set
are walked first and the elements with no TABINDEX set are then walked can
be confusing.  An element with TABINDEX set to zero is just the beginning of
the confusion.
