Are we recruiting volunteers yet to submit and draft techniques? Or are we
still focusing on the layout and structure form etc...

All the best,

The Techniques teleconference is scheduled for Wednesday, March 26 from
15:00 to 16:30 UTC (10:00am to 11:30am US Eastern/7:00am to 8:30am US
Pacific). The conference information is:

+1-617-761-6200
Passcode 92248

Agenda:

Continue mapping HTML Techniques for WCAG 1.0 to WCAG 2.0 Success Criteria.
At the Face-to-Face meeting in Los Angeles, California on 23-24 March 2003
we continued this work, which was begun at the Face-to-Face meeting at the
W3C Technical Plenary on 04 March 2003. This has been very useful for
raising issues for WCAG 2.0.

I won't have a summary of the work in progress to send around before the
call. We will summarize the work on the call for those who were not at the
meetings, and produce a document for general consumption containing the
results of this work shortly.
