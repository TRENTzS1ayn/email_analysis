At the Techniques teleconference on 26 March 2003 we mapped HTML techniques
for WCAG 1.0 [1] to WCAG 2.0 success criteria [2] (using the 8 January 2003
draft). About a quarter of this work was done at the Face-to-Face on 24
March 2003 and we got through another quarter yesterday. We will continue
this process at next Wednesday's teleconference and hope to complete the
work then. After this is completed, we will post the mapping and the issues
that the process has raised for discussion with the entire group.

Summary of Action Items:

* Everyone: Review the two documents before the next meeting so we can speed
up the mapping process
* Wendy: Work on new draft of HTML Techniques for WCAG 2.0 (update style, in
new schema, incorporate stuff from Bugzilla). This does not include
incorporating the results of the mapping process yet.
