I have posted the notes of what I presented at the WCAG F2F  at

 

http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2003/03/newtake

 

I also posted a couple of additional notes there as well.

 

 

I haven't had a chance to incorporate all the feedback from the meeting or
to make changes based on it.   I will do so soon as I can.  But wanted to
post what I had presented for those who weren't there - and for those who
were for the record.
