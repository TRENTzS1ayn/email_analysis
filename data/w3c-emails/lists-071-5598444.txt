OK, we seem to have a different perspective. One of my basic assumptions is
that people who ignore our guidelines are also going to ignore what we say
they should do if they are ignoring us.

One of the features that I find useful in semantic-web based solutions is
that they don't actually rely on the author - they can be used by anyone.
(True, in the scenario I suggested it is slightly easier for the author, but
only slightly...)

Many authors are using this, but without saying why (typically they think it
looks cool).

I can wander around in a place that is well-signposted. In a maze I generally
get lost, so a more appropriate thing would be "I don't want you to find this
page again" - odd kind of statement really.

And most authors try to create clear navigation. There are ways the common
approaches can be improved, but not everyone can be bothered reading about
them. Let alone about how they should tell the world they couldn't be
bothered.

Agreed. I'm just proposing a different method - one that other people can
also use if the author didn't bother.
