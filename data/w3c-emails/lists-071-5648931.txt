The first required success criterion for Checkpoint 2.1 reads as
follows:
 
1. all of the functionality of the content, where the functionality or
its outcome can be expressed concisely in words, is operable at a
minimum through
a keyboard or keyboard interface.
 
I do not understand the rationale for the limitation "where the
functionality or its outcome can be expresed concisely in words..." What
functionality or outcomes does this language exempt from the
requirement?
 
This concern is related to concern over the concern about "non-text
content that can be expressed in words" that we've discussed in regard
to Checkpoint 1.1.
