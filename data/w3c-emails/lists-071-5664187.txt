I guess this is ok.  But you shouldn't be able to declare something as
accessible just by notifying people that you aren't making it accessible.  
In some places, where it is unavoidable, it is a good second level safety
net. But in general, notifying people that you didn't do something should
not be equivalent to doing it.

Not quite right. I should have expressed this as:

My argument is that we should, as much as possible, provide a way for
authors to override our guidelines as long as they notify the audience.

Example 1:
Guidelines say there must be good text/background contrast.
Author uses yellow text on white background and states "I want this text to
be difficult to read because of <some artistic reason>".

Example 2:
Guidelines say there should be clear navigation.
Author has porously confusing navigation and states "Navigation is confusing
because I want you to wander around."

Example 3:
Guidelines say content should be understandable.
Author creates easily misunderstood content and states "I am an anarchist -
deal with it."

Regarding the TH rule: If you really want to have THs in your layout table
then you can. Just explicitly state that this is a layout table.
