We are confusing issues hear
 
We all totally agree that refreshing pages messes up users on Assistive
technologies, and that they should not have to put up with it. 
 
That is not the question and never was.
 
The question is also not whether we personally like an affect or find it
annoying. 
 
The question is: Where is the best place to solve this issue
 
Assistive technologies are already starting to address it by blocking
the refresh. This is easily done at the user end.
Protocols could cope with refresh better as described in the previous
email.
 
From what I have seen working on the guidelines  so far,  we  try to put
as few restrictions on the web content as we can. If we can easily solve
things as a user agent end we do. We are not forming guidelines to help
create pages that we like, or restrict the web designer when we can
avoid it. We try to move protocols to provide for device independence
and hand control of presentation and form of content to the user. In
this case that would imply allowing refresh for users who want it and
functional alterative when they do not want it.
 
Note: Some applications need refresh (and the % does not, in my opinion,
matter) 
 
I request again for Michel to ping coordination on this

All the best
