I think the most important is to find out where refresh mechanisms are
really necessary, and to clarify all situations where they may be indispensable,
from a company and private Web site to any application.

Thus I don't see any composition of prioritized refresh uses, I first
propose to create one. And maybe the result is that the WG could only recommend a
common sense and reduced use of these mechanisms, maybe it can recommend them
to be completely banned.

In my opinion (and as I wrote before), server-side redirects are definitely
more elegant than client-side redirects. But sometimes client-side redirects
are okay, too, see situations where authors have to reference to the new
document source (e.g. when a search engine links to the old source), but don't
have any server access (to e.g. configure the .htaccess). 

By the way, I guess the refresh to shifted document versions is the most
popular use -- and even legitimate. What is more sore, to be (301) redirected to
the 'real' document, or to get a nice '404 - File Not Found' message...? --
I prefer the first variant, regardless of which redirect used -- I only want
to get the information needed, using assistive technologies or not. So maybe
the suggested refresh listing might be helpful.

 Jens.
