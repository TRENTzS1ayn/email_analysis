Would it make sense to rename the new "Additional Notes" "Additional
Recommendations"?

 

 

Hmm

That would make all the success criteria "recommendations"

 

Also "Recommendation" is what W3C calls its standards.

 

So I don't think that works.   It promotes these to the same level as
the success criteria - and they are completely different.
