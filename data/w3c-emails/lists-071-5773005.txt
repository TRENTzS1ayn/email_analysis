I had the understanding that captions would not be recommended for
layout tables. Please explain how a blind user hearing this in their
voice browser will benefit from it?

I've done a little and simple example for the layout table:


<TABLE summary="This table is used for visual layout, and contains two
coloumns: first coloumn contains links to main areas within our site,
second coloumn is main page content.">
     <TR>
          <TD>
         <A HREF="page1.htm" title="Link to page 1">Page 1</A><BR>
         <A HREF="page3.htm" title="Link to page 2">Page 2</A><BR>
         <A HREF="page4.htm" title="Link to page 3">Page 3</A><BR>
         <A HREF="page5.htm" title="Link to page 4">Page 4</A><BR>
         <A HREF="page6.htm" title="Link to page 5">Page 5</A><BR>
         </TD>
          <TD>Welcome to the Web Site of our Company!<BR></TD>
     <TR>
</TABLE>

This could be an example for a simply layout table with a two coloumns
table. I think that other examples could be added with more complicated
table but this is a little example that make it readable also from
people that are no so-expert.
