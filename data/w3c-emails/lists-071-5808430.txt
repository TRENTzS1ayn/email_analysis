Not to be trite, but it appears to me that if an author wants to invoke
personal preference that they simply not conform to WCAG. To be even
more trite, the author may state "This site does not conform to WCAG
because the author feels artistic freedom is more important than
accessibility."

Not quite right. I should have expressed this as:

My argument is that we should, as much as possible, provide a way for
authors to override our guidelines as long as they notify the audience.

Example 1:
Guidelines say there must be good text/background contrast. Author uses
yellow text on white background and states "I want this text to be
difficult to read because of <some artistic reason>".

Example 2:
Guidelines say there should be clear navigation.
Author has porously confusing navigation and states "Navigation is
confusing because I want you to wander around."

Example 3:
Guidelines say content should be understandable.
Author creates easily misunderstood content and states "I am an
anarchist - deal with it."

Regarding the TH rule: If you really want to have THs in your layout
table then you can. Just explicitly state that this is a layout table.
