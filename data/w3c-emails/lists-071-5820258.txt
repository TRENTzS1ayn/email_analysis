Our mission is not to provide authors flexibility, but rather, to
constrict them to produce materials that are accessible. If we deviate
from this objective we are doing a disservice.

Yes, I agree. I'd just like to make sure that we allow the author
maximum flexibility.

Here are some common examples where notification is used to override the
current guidelines:

* A link that opens a popup window, notifies the user.

* A video presentation that flashes warns the user pre linking and at
the start of the page.

* Notification of specific requirements for access to controlled
intranets. (e.g. Jaws 4 is required for our internal site. If you have a
lower version of Jaws then ask the I.T. dept. for an upgrade).

I think you must make an effort to comply before the notification.
