Sorry to chime in so late in the game, but is the issue the 'page
refresh' itself, or the lack of warning of this behavior?

A warning allows the user to take corrective action. It also informs the
user as to why the page changes, or why a voice browser keeps jumping
back to the top of the page.

We could put it upon the author to provide a non-refreshing alternative,
or a button to control refresh. Banning refresh does not appear to be
the solution.

I don't have experience as to why server-side refresh is better than
client-side? I think both can cause confusion.

I think the most important is to find out where refresh mechanisms are
really necessary, and to clarify all situations where they may be
indispensable, from a company and private Web site to any application.

Thus I don't see any composition of prioritized refresh uses, I first
propose to create one. And maybe the result is that the WG could only
recommend a common sense and reduced use of these mechanisms, maybe it
can recommend them to be completely banned.

In my opinion (and as I wrote before), server-side redirects are
definitely more elegant than client-side redirects. But sometimes
client-side redirects are okay, too, see situations where authors have
to reference to the new document source (e.g. when a search engine links
to the old source), but don't have any server access (to e.g. configure
the .htaccess). 

By the way, I guess the refresh to shifted document versions is the most
popular use -- and even legitimate. What is more sore, to be (301)
redirected to the 'real' document, or to get a nice '404 - File Not
Found' message...? -- I prefer the first variant, regardless of which
redirect used -- I only want to get the information needed, using
assistive technologies or not. So maybe the suggested refresh listing
might be helpful.

 Jens.
