Ain't it best to assign a CSS class to layout table captions, using the
'display' property -- here: 'display: none;'? -- I didn't test it (with an aural
browser), but it would provide a working and IMO fully sufficient solution...
the caption (and even table headers) ain't displayed, but they are read.


Regards,
 Jens.
