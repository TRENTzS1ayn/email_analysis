That sounds that blanket -- when creating Web sites, I observe several
things to be arranged. On the one hand, I want to create valid markup, on the
other hand, I want to create accessible and usable pages, and I want to create
pages usable in almost all browsers.

The third point (availability to all browsers) is something I sometimes
prefer in contradiction to accessibility, so I rather pass on 200,000 people with
a special kind of disability than passing on e.g. 700,000 Netscape 4.x users
-- anyhow I'm creating accessible pages, too. And in comparison, I feel
right.

I didn't show specific examples (because I didn't want to write this post
yet), but I hope you see the point. Sometimes there might be reasons to develop
not the entire way the WCAG suggests, but this is not inevitably wrong (or
inaccessible). So there is no need to judge all people by ridiculing 'artistic
freedom'.
