I understand this as a general discussion on a refresh mechanism itself, and
I don't think it's inevitably necessary to warn users if there is a refresh
(e.g. when taken to a 'correct' URI).

Not implicitly. Maybe he has 'two seconds' to disable JavaScript
(client-side redirect), maybe there is no possibility (and even no warning) to stop when
redirected e.g. via server-side redirect (correct me if there are reasonable
exceptions). -- I think redirects are rather an usability than an
accessibility problem, but when used with 'common sense', I've no problem with them.

I fully agree, like suggested before. A WG recommendation should look like
a) normally avoid redirects, b) use them with care (preferably server-side)
when really necessary, and c) provide alternatives (e.g. via refresh/update
buttons).

Maybe this is rather a development advantage since they cannot be blocked
(CMIIW); and you don't need to create a special page performing the refresh. In
other words: they are definitely working. (...)

Regards,
 Jens.
