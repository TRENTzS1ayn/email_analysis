I like it. 1 less doc will make it easier to use.

Subject: Gateway Techniques



Wendy and I were looking at the general/technology-independent
techniques, to 
put them into order so we can start working on them.

In WCAG 1, there are two documents, Techniques for Web Content
Accessibility 
Guidelines 1.0, and Core Techniques for Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines 
1.0. The first document lists the different checkpoints and includes
links to 
the relevant sections of technology-specific techniques. The second
document 
contains technology-independent techniques for accessibility.

For WCAG2, I'd like to propose that we combine these two documents into
a 
single document, Gateway Techniques for Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines 
2.0. This would list the checkpoint from WCAG 2.0, it would include 
technology-independent discussions and definitions for the checkpoints,
and it 
would include links to the technology-specific techniques for each
checkpoint.

For instance, this would be the place to explain what makes a good
alternate 
description, or the color contrast issues in foreground and background
colors, 
or the extensive advice that Lisa and Avi assembled on writing style.

I'm working on a rough draft based on the WCAG 1 documents, so that we
can all 
take a look at it and see whether this seems like a good organization.

Reactions? Thoughts?

Loretta
