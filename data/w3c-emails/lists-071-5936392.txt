We should be conerned that .NET causes a lot of page refreshes. While
this can provide improved functionality to some users, it can be
disorienting to others. Features such as stock tickers, sports tickers,
and chat use constant refresh. Without some kind of warning, the user
has no idea why the voice browser is repeating the top of the page
(other than from previous bad experiences).

Accessible chat programs allow the user to stop the refresh, and to
manually activate the refresh when desired. To me, this is a reasonable
equivalent to 'real time' chat.

I believe that authors bear the responsiblity to provide a mechanism
where the user can turn off and control page refresh, or provide a
non-refreshing alternative.

As for redirects, a voice browser can still be reading a previous page
after the redirect occurs. The original page should warn the user that
they are being redirected. Whether the redirect is fast or slow I think
is incidental. Visual users 'know' where they are going. Non-visual
users deserve the same consideration.

I understand this as a general discussion on a refresh mechanism itself,
and I don't think it's inevitably necessary to warn users if there is a
refresh (e.g. when taken to a 'correct' URI).

Not implicitly. Maybe he has 'two seconds' to disable JavaScript
(client-side redirect), maybe there is no possibility (and even no
warning) to stop when redirected e.g. via server-side redirect (correct
me if there are reasonable exceptions). -- I think redirects are rather
an usability than an accessibility problem, but when used with 'common
sense', I've no problem with them.

I fully agree, like suggested before. A WG recommendation should look
like
a) normally avoid redirects, b) use them with care (preferably
server-side) when really necessary, and c) provide alternatives (e.g.
via refresh/update buttons).

Maybe this is rather a development advantage since they cannot be
blocked (CMIIW); and you don't need to create a special page performing
the refresh. In other words: they are definitely working. (...)

Regards,
 Jens.
