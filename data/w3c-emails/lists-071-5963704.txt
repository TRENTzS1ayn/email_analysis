The question is whether or not the guidelines provide a normative
conformance scheme (as WCAG 1.0 does) or if they provide specific
sample conformance schemes (which can be structured to parallel
WCAG 1.0 A/AA/AAA if desired) as examples of using WCAG 2.0 as a
toolkit for building accessibility policies.

I have long advocated the latter approach.  The process of developing
an accessibility policy is very different from the process of creating
an accessible Web site.  WCAG 2.0 should be a toolkit for doing so,
in a way that is interoperable and standardized, to prevent situations
like the case of Section 508.  (In other words, you should be able to
"build" a policy approximating 508 by selecting portions of WCAG 2.0.
This will likely be much different from the "default" conformance
schemes.)
