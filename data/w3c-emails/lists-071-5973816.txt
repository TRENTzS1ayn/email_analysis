> How does this relate to the checklists?

This is the link (gateway?) between the Checklists and the technology-specific
techniques. For each checklist there will be a list of links to
the relevant items in the technology-specific documents (similar to
WCAG1), but we can also include the non-technology specific techniques.
Someone could use this document to see all the different ways that a 
checklist item has been satisfied.

Like other techniques documents, it would not be normative.
