The lack of time to disable refresh is exactly what we can change at a
protocol level.

We can allow for a non refresh alternate and define a scope for what
content to be refreshed 

Then at a browser lever (read - user agent guidelines) we give the user
the option to always use the "no refresh"  option


Hence this is a coordination issue between WAI working groups
AT, User agents, PF and the WCAG.
 
Then WCAG would merely have "provide non refresh functional equivalents"
The user who likes refresh would get them, the user who is bothered by
refresh could always have a non refresh equivalent as a browser setting
And the Author gets freedom, flexibility and to service the disabled
community with maximum usability.

( note if the  "no -refresh" equivalent is not provided there can be a
user agent default like a button or link that reads "refresh" and
executes refresh only on user command)
All the best

I understand this as a general discussion on a refresh mechanism itself,
and I don't think it's inevitably necessary to warn users if there is a
refresh (e.g. when taken to a 'correct' URI).

Not implicitly. Maybe he has 'two seconds' to disable JavaScript
(client-side redirect), maybe there is no possibility (and even no
warning) to stop when redirected e.g. via server-side redirect (correct
me if there are reasonable exceptions). -- I think redirects are rather
an usability than an accessibility problem, but when used with 'common
sense', I've no problem with them.

I fully agree, like suggested before. A WG recommendation should look
like
a) normally avoid redirects, b) use them with care (preferably
server-side) when really necessary, and c) provide alternatives (e.g.
via refresh/update buttons).

Maybe this is rather a development advantage since they cannot be
blocked (CMIIW); and you don't need to create a special page performing
the refresh. In other words: they are definitely working. (...)

Regards,
 Jens.
