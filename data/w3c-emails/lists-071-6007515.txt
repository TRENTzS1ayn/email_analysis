i have been wondering for some months now why it is that GL is just not 
appealing.

Today it occurred to me that whilst the old habit of referring to WCAG 
1.3a-2002 was dying the death at last; the subject lines were still 
more or less unintelligible. That is compared to other mailing lists, 
rather than absolutely

Recent ones which are not exceptional include:

Gateway Techniques
refresh
Summary of tables
REF 2.4b -a second required success criteria   well there has to be one
REF 1.1a - Add definition to 1.1 for ability to be expressed  in  words 
   spoke too soon

compare with IG

AbilityNet: UK Airlines shamed in web accessibility survey
"Universal" icons Re: Accessible Development Methodologies   well maybe 
not
  NY Times:  White House E-Mail System Becomes Less  User-Friendly
The RNIB replies to web design criticism
Decorators with keyboards

Do others agree?
