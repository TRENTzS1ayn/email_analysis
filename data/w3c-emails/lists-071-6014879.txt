Here is a brief summary of the table techniques as we discussed today in the
techniques call:

TH Elements
Data tables must have TH elements.
Layout tables must not have TH elements.

Summary
Data tables must have a summary (can't be NULL).
Layout tables must have a summary. It may be NULL or text to describe the
table.

Caption
Data tables may have captions.
Layout tables may not have captions.

If we agree on these points then a consensus on the details (e.g. text that
the summary should contain) should easily follow.
