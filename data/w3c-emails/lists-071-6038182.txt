Action item from techniques call today referring to technique "Use the TITLE
element to describe the document"

Listed below are several checks that could be applied to the document title
element:

1) Is there a title element that contains at least 1 character [English]?
2) Is the title shorter than 150 characters [English]?
3) Is the title unique to this directory (site? domain?)?
4) Does the title contain not only common placeholder text? (e.g. "title")
5) Does the title describe the document?
6) Does the title summarize the document?

I propose that the easily testable checks (1,2,3,4) be covered by checkpoint
1.3[CORE]. The more difficult checks should be covered by checkpoint
3.3[EXTENDED].

The checklist item for this technique could be written as: "The document has
a valid title element." (A valid title element is one as having passed all
the above checks.)

Hmmm... Do all these checks apply to individual frames as well?
Should the title contain navigational info? (e.g. "chapter 1 - birds",
"chapter 2 - dogs" instead of "birds" , "dogs")

I believe that the audience for these checks includes both the page author
and the accessibility checker. (I think there was a question raised that the
checklist items may apply to the accessibility checker but not to the page
author.)
