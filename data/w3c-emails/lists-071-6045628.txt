Dear all, (WCAG, Bcc ERT)

I have a personal legal issue that needs resolution which is taking a great
deal of my attention at the moment.

I will attempt to keep doing some tools-based work, but do not expect to
participate in discussions or meetings for a while.

I may also be very short on atttention - please excusee me in advance.

cheers

Charles
