Hi Wendy, Mike and all

On the Techniques call I took the action item to flesh out a few of the
techniques and make them more legible.  My suggested edits are below.

____________________________________________________________________________
____

Section  3.1 [CORE] Language of content can be programmatically
determined.[was 1.6 partial]   .

Old text: 

It is good practice to identify the primary language of a document, either
with markup (as shown in the example) or through HTTP headers.

Suggested new text:

It is good practice to identify the primary language of a document, either
with markup (as shown in the example) or through HTTP headers.  The lang
attribute allows assistive technology to orient and adapt to the
pronuciation and sytax that are specific to the language of the page.  This
attribute may also play a major role in the emerging global, multi-lingual,
similaneous translation web environment.

Section :   3.1 [CORE] Language of content can be programmatically
determined.[was 1.6 partial]  . 

Old text:

Identifying changes in language are important for a number of reasons:

Users who are reading the document in braille will be able to substitute the
appropriate control codes (markup) where language changes occur to ensure
that the braille translation software will generate the correct characters
(accented characters, for instance). These control codes also prevent
braille contractions from being generated, which could further confuse the
user. Braille contractions combine commonly used groups of characters that
usually appear in multiple cells into a single cell. For example, "ing"
which usually takes up three cells (one for each character) can be
contracted into a single cell.

Suggested new text:

Identifying changes in language are important for a number of reasons:

It will allow braille translation software to follow changes in language.
(e.g., substitute control codes for accented characters, and insert control
codes necessary to prevent eroneus creation of Grade 2 braille contractions)

(we may want to put a glossary at the end of the document defining things
like "Grade 2 braille contractions")

 

3.1 Text Markup

 

Old text:

The techniques in this category demonstrate how to add structure to pieces
of text.

 

Suggested new text:

The techniques in this category demonstrate how to add structure to pieces
of text.  They refer to "Inline" tags that allow control over the
presentation of specific words and phrases in the document.
