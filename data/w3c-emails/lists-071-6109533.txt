Ref 2.3   -  Delete item 3 from 2.3




Suggest that we delete item 3 under best practices which talks about
testing
pages with slower equipment.  This is something which is almost impossible
to do.  There's an infinite variety of computers, fast and slow, different
graphics cards, and different things that are going on in a computer which
could cause it to behave differently.  So suggest that we just delete it
since it's not really operable.
