Good question.

(was more awake when I wrote one of them?)

should both be "from the keyboard"

important to have the phrase since the other guidelines only ensure access
to content from keyboard -- not access to defeating of content feature.

Gregg,

What is the rationale for the phrase "using the keyboard" in item 3 but not
in item 1?

Also, I would suggest rewording item 3 as "Any moving content can be
stopped..." Frozen might not translate well.

REF 2.2 -   Two new best practice items for 2.2




Suggest that we add the following two items to the best practice
checkpoints.



#2 Any blinking content can be turned off.

#3 Any moving content can be frozen using keyboard
