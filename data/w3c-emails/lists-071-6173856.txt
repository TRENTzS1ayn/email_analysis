Sorry Gregg. I was the one sleeping this time.

I got confused by the phrase "Text that is presented at checkpoint 2"

and totally missed the phrase "Second Required Success Criteria for 1.6".

I thought you were proposing a new "checkpoint" rather than a new "required
success criteria" for 1.6.

Never mind.

Not sure I understand.  Why would it not be required.  This is an extended
checkpoint so it is already not required.

And did  you mean best practice checkpoint?

Gregg,

Shouldn't this be covered under Best Practices for checkpoint 1.6?

   Foreground content is easily differentiable from background for both
   auditory and visual default presentations.

New Checkpoint



Second Required Success Criteria for 1.6



We don't anywhere talk about a checkpoint regarding background color.  I
think that we need to have one and I think it should be required.



Suggest the following.



Text that is presented at checkpoint 2 - text that is presented over a
background color or gray scale has a mechanism that allows the text to be
presented in a fashion that there is a greater than ______ contrast between
text and background color as measured by ______.



(Yes, this will need to be filled in or deleted prior to shipping.)
