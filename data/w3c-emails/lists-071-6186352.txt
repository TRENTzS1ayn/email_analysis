Screen readers mispronounce things all the time even when they are not in a
foreign language. This morning I was viewing a site that had the word
"mousepad" on it which was pronounced "mous uh pud". This is a made up word
that is not in the standard unabridged English dictionary that I use. But
you can't do anything about it with a "lang" attribute because it's not a
word in a foreign language either.

Another site contained the phrase "premium content" and the screen reader
pronounced it as "premium conTENT". Content is an English word that is in
the standard unabridged English dictionary I use. It just happens to have
two different pronunciations. The right one depends on the context in which
the word is used.

At the face-to-face in Venice, some people commented that this particular
requirement was probably the most amount of work. We should make sure there
is a real benefit here that warrants that amount of work before requiring
this on all web sites.
