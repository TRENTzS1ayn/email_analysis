Call for Participation: Binary XML Workshop

   Position papers are due 11 August for the W3C workshop on "Binary
   Interchange of XML Information Item Sets" to be held in Santa Clara,
   CA, USA on 24-26 September. Sixty attendees will study methods to
   compress XML documents to save bandwidth and parsing time. The
   workshop goal is to determine whether a W3C Working Group might be
   chartered to produce an interoperable, accessible, internationalized
   binary transmission format. Visit the XML home page.
