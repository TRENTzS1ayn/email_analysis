As part of our efforts at Trace to develop web tools around photosensitive
epilepsy, we will be having Dr. Graham Harding visit the Trace Center for
two days next week.  Since one of the days (Thursday) falls during our
regularly scheduled WCAG call, I've invited Dr. Harding to speak with the
working group.  Therefore, on Thursday, August 7, Dr. Graham Harding will be
participating in our regularly scheduled WCAG Working Group call which is at
4PM Eastern Daylight Time.

 

For those not familiar with the epilepsy area, the work of Drs Jeavons and
Harding forms the core of the research internationally in the area of
photosensitive epilepsy, particularly around flash sensitivity.  Dr. Harding
will be visiting Trace in connection with our licensing of the Harding/FPA
photosensitive epilepsy analysis engine for use in the development of
web-related tools.  This analysis engine is the only tool known to exist
that measures the photosensitive triggers.  The current tool is developed
and calibrated for use with television signals.  With Dr. Harding's
assistance we will be adapting the engine for use in computer and
web-related work.  The goal of the work at Trace is not to define specific
limits, but rather to provide a ruler.

 

Once again,  Dr. Graham Harding will be visiting with our group at the
regularly scheduled WCAG Working Group call Thursday, August 7, at 4PM
Eastern Daylight Time.

 

IF YOU DO NOT USUALLY ATTEND THESE WEEKLY WCAG MEETINGS - BUT WOULD LIKE TO
JOIN FOR THIS CALL - PLEASE LET WENDY CHISHOLM KNOW IN ADVANCE - OR WE MAY
NOT HAVE ROOM FOR YOU ON THE BRIDGE AND MAY HAVE TO ASK YOU TO LEAVE.
Preference on the call bridge will be to the regular participants in the
weekly call.    

Wendy's email is wendy@w3.org.  

 

Thank you. 


Gregg
