The Techniques Task Force (those of us who have been meeting on Wednesdays 
to discuss techniques) would like to meet  face-to-face for two days during 
the week of 8 September to make progress on the Techniques documents.  We 
are likely to do this at the University of Toronto.

According to W3C Process, the notification of a face-to-face meeting needs 
to be given 8 weeks in advance [1].  Since this is under 8 weeks we can go 
ahead with the meeting if Working Group participants do not object to us 
holding the meeting.

We will take notes on IRC and have a conference phone available for people 
to participate remotely.

Please let me know:
1. If you have a question, objection or concern about this meeting.
2. If you will be able to attend the meeting in person or if you would like 
to attend part (or all) of the meeting remotely.
