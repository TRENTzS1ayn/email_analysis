from 4.1
1.c
 
"accessibility features and API's are used when available"

be removed

 

I think this is redundant and unhelpful. If all the guidelines so far
are implemented, this can be an open ended requirements to do what ever
the API developer happens to label an accessibility feature - open to
misuse. 

 

All the best
