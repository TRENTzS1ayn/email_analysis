There is a lot here.  I myself don't get just one concept from it.  So I
don't know if Gregg and Jason can ask the question "is there consensus on
the concept presented here?"

There are several concepts that I see afoot in this discussion.  One key
concept is that clarification will be provided both by indirectly associated
lexical information and directly associated contextual information, with a
preference for the former where applicable.  Consider the following
conceptual policy:

Provide lexical information offline (by a reference in the context to
dictionary-like resources) refined where needed by more specific contextual
information by inline markup or annotations.

Explanation:

We can draw a distinction between clarifying information that applies
broadly to many uses of a word, and information that is specific to how a
term is used in one instance of the word.  Terms associated with the first
class of clarifying information include "lexicon, dictionary, glossary,
idiom, idee_fixe, terminology, technical term, Term of Art, jargon,..."  For
this note I am going to use 'lexical' as a one-word modifier for this class
of information.  Lexical information deals with terms and is reusable across
instances of the term.   Terms associated with the second class of
claryifying information include "syntax, semantics, pragmatics, antecedent,
anaphoric,..."  For this note I am going to use 'contextual' as a one-word
modifier for this latter class of information.  Contextual information is
not expressible in general as it varies so much from instance to instance.

Notes:

1. Not all terms look like one word.  Compound terms such as "Term of Art"
may be documented in a glossary or other lexical resource.  This is
considered lexical information and not contextual.  The several tokens in a
compound term are used to identify one concept.

2. We don't need to get into definitions of syntactic vs. semantic
information to explain how to structure and express clarifying information
for the purposes of accessibility.  The category of lexical information is
pretty well defined in both academic linguistics and practice in the
Standards community. Everything else will have to be handled by annotations
of one form or another (whether markup or metadata) we don't have to get
deep into the theory of natural languages and their processing to get our
point across.
