The problem with suggesting the use of a simple lexicon is that it just
isn't available for each language. For widely spoken languages like English
lexicons such as you describe are probably available. But for languages
that are spoken by only a small population, such as my native language
Dutch, I don't think such lexicons exist.

This means this test would be possible in some languages only. I think we
should try to give requirements and tests that are universally applicable.
