The agenda for this meeting has, in effect, already been announced:
this is the opportunity for the working group to discuss checkpoint
2.3, its implications and attendant issues with Dr. Graham Harding, a
highly accomplished researcher in the field of photosensitive
epilepsy.

If there is time remaining thereafter we can continue working on open
issues with WCAG 2.0.
