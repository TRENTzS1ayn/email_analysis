Hi,
about links in tech documents:

http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-HTML-TECHS-20030728.html#link_text

the first checklist now is:

"Use link text to describe your target page as clearly as possible"

As u know there is the possibility to use the target attribute (not allowed
in XHTML strict). So the link must also alert the user about the opening of
a new window, so I suggest the change of it with the following:

"Use link text to describe your target page as clearly as possible and if
the page link is done in another window is necessary to inform the user with
the title attribute"

Eg:

<a href="external.html" title="[open in new page] link to ...."
target="_blank">Example Page</a>
