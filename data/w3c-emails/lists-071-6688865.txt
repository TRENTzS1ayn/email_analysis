Since not everyone was present, I will explain the reason for posting these
links during the tech discussion since they make little sense otherwise.

Some people doubted the MAP element was ever used to group links. In the
Dutch version (Drempels Weg) of the WCAG  however, using MAP is the
recommended technique to group links. This page described the guideline and
the technique. As a result, several accessible Dutch sites such as the
Drempels Weg site itself use this technique.

Using an unordered list was mentioned as another way to group links. One
advantage of this technique over other techniques such as <MAP> is that you
can even specify hierarchies in links, which is very useful for grouping
navigation links that have subitems. CSS gives you a lot of possibilities to
format these links (omitting bullets, placing items horizontally, spacing,
etc) so they can still look great. 

This example page (a concept for a new personal website of mine) shows one
way to use unordered links for the navigation that doesn't look like an
unordered list. The example is XHTML 1 strict / CSS 1 compliant with no
information about presentation in the XHTML. A link to a second version of
the concept is provided as the first link in the main text. 

Note the navigation in the HTML is a hierarchy specified using <UL>. CSS is
used to highlight the current topic with subtopics and not display other
subtopics.

Another example of using <UL> to group links is this link: 
http://ua.dnr.state.wi.us that was also posted during the discussion (sorry,
don't remember who brought this one up). This example includes the box-hover
effect that many designers like.
