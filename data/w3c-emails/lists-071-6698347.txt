In our techniques call today we reached a resolution for layout table
summaries:
Layout tables must not have a summary (not even a NULL summary). This
reverses our earlier decision that layout tables may have a summary.

The rationale behind the no summary rule is:
- layout tables should not be used (use CSS)
- it appears that layout tables will be deprecated in XHTML2
- the function of the layout table summary can be better expressed elsewhere
- we should not require a NULL summary just to make the author "jump through
hoops"

Data tables must have a valid summary.

Proposed description of a valid summary:
The summary must describe the relationship between cells.
The summary does not have a maximum length.
The summary must not contain placeholder text.
If the summary is less than 20 characters then it is suspicious.

Discussion:
Can the summary just link to another document (kinda like a longdesc)?
What if the table is summarized in the document - do you still require a
summary attribute?
