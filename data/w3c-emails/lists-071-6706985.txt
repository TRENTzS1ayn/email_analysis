Subject: RE: Links from Yvette

Another example of using <UL> to group links is this link:
http://ua.dnr.state.wi.us that was also posted during the discussion (sorry,
don't remember who brought this one up). This example includes the box-hover
effect that many designers like.


Roberto Scano:
I think that the use of <li> could be good for accessibility, due that with
the correct use of CSS the <li> can be modified and adapted to the website
layout.

Why also, for more accessibility, not use the "title" attribute for the UL
[1]?

In the url proposed by Yvette, the code contained is, for eg:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.wisconsin.gov/">wisconsin.gov home</a>
<li><a href="http://www.wisconsin.gov/state/core/agency_index.html">state
agencies</a>
<li><a href="http://forward.state.wi.us:9000/cpp/">subject directory</a>
</ul>

if we change it with this:

<ul title="Group of links about ....">
<li><a href="http://www.wisconsin.gov/">wisconsin.gov home</a>
<li><a href="http://www.wisconsin.gov/state/core/agency_index.html">state
agencies</a>
<li><a href="http://forward.state.wi.us:9000/cpp/">subject directory</a>
</ul>

the assistive tecnology could read the title and (i think this is not
implemented but could be done) skip all the <li> if the title of <ul> is not
of interest of the user.

What the group think about this?
