I am addressing two messages at once, here:

techniques - link text
  http://www.w3.org/mid/200308061758.h76Hwanj032692@mail1.magma.ca

proposed core checkpoint - page titles, section headings, and link text
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2003JulSep/0244.html

The theme of my argument is that we will probably need to give the authors
some relief based on machine-recognizable-as-pertinent labeling in the
syntactically-defined context.

The markup structures are not there in HTML4 but they are there in some
formats like SVG.

On the other hand, links with normally-displayed text content of
'more,' 'details,' 'continued,' are no more going to go away than
links with text content of "click here."

Fixing this problem is going to take new markup, not just campaigning
authors.

Or should I say that the problem with be abated better/quicker/easier using
some markup reform and not asking that one version of link text try to fit
all delivery contexts.

'More' links etc. are found in contexts where a logical unit is spread over
non-contiguous display regions in the layout and pagination of the content.

In HTML4 you can't reliably figure out "the details of what?" without
comprehending the natural language leading up to this link.  But if we get
people to mark the topical units of their content with enclosing
container-elements (like 'div'), and we define a 'more' element that is a
sub-species of link, then it will be clear that what is meant is "more of
the container element most closely containing this 'more' element.  The
closing 'more' link could be an optional closing element in a container as
much as the headingOrTitle is a required starting element.  Then the
assistive technology can label the link using both 'more' and the heading or
title attribute for the appropriate container.

Page titles, link texts, headings, etc. are always going to be some sort of
a compromise between conserving display consumables (screen space, time to
speak) and the error rates in understanding the message.

To actually work the problem we need to get reasonable guidance to authors
so that these identifying text fragments

- only rely on clearly traceable and duly labeled contexts
.. by this I mean that if we construct a breadcrumb trail through the
.. parse tree for the document by an algorithm[1] that has passed the laugh
.. text with the AT vendors, it is exorbitantly clear to a semantic-pragmatic
.. individual...

- are as context-independent as practical for their size

- relate the link destination to the current context
.. and distinguish it from peers (other links out of this context)
.. again as possible in the space taken and [as a fallback] as augmented by
.. the standard breadcrumb trail of contexts.

Al

[1]  The rough outline of the algorithm is that one retraces the containers
by means of the parse tree, including and excluding containing elements based
on some combination of

- prior knowledge of which element types are strong containers (form, table)
.. vs. weak containers (span, ruby)

- presence in the hypertext of author-provided labels (header subelement or
.. title attribute, whatever the format syntax provides for identifying text
.. fragments) for the containers

..and then composes the [text form of the] labels for the surviving contexts
into a abstracted breadcrumb trail of context-identifying text phrases.
