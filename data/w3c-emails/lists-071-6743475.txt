(Excuse me for quoting the entire post.)

What you're emphasizing here is even a topic non-disabled users know,
according to various Usability studies. The more the WAI WG tries to unite
Accessibility, Usability, and even textual subjects, the more complex the
recommendation will get... and at least, you cannot inform every developer about each
topic e.g. Usability contains if you won't publish mechanisms how to test
documents / Web sites (Usability engineering).

Is this the aim of the WG? In my opinion, the WG should plan where to stop,
although it does a good and important job -- and although it might be fine,
there definitely is a border between Accessibility and Usability.


Regards,
 Jens.
