Thank u! The title attribute is recognized as a valid attribute also for
<ul> so, why don't use it for describe the content of the <ul>, <ol> or <dl>
?

Searching for support of screen readers for <dl> I've found a thread in a
mailing list that talk about this page as example:
http://packages.debian.org/stable/devel/.
This page is 100% valid HTML 4.0 Transitional so I believe the problem with
this page is its size, it's over 150 kilobytes. I did some "research" and
have reason to believe that Jaws' crashing is due to the large
definition-list (<dl> tag in HTML). When I changed the definition list to an
unordered (<ul>-tag) or ordered(<ol>-tag) one and after some replacing (<dt>
and <dd> to <li>) Jaws would run just fine.

Also, is necessary to check with UAAG WG about recognizing of <dl> and <ul>
and if there is the possibility to "skip" all the <li> contained in these.
