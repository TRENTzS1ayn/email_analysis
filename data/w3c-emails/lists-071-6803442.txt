Kynn is correct and is rearticulating a point I had made on the list
previously.

<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2003AprJun/0289.html>

David is incorrect, and bases his entire argument on the peccadillos of a
preferred adaptive technology. It's none of WAI's business which features
an adaptive technology (that always means Jaws for Windows) may introduce
to spontaneously remix Web sites without authorial consent. You can't have
it both ways: A page that works well in correct structure and one that
works when the pieces are tossed into a hat and pulled out randomly.

Here is a list of links, schematically:

<ul>
<li><a></a></li>
<li><a></a></li>
<li><a></a></li>
<li><a></a></li>
</ul>

That's a reasonable HTML structure. Extracted link text isn't a structure.

Structural HTML is important. Specific page-remixing features of screen
readers are not.

That will happen in serial vs. random presentation. The proposed solution
does not solve that ineradicable problem and raises problems of its own.

That feature could and should be reprogrammed to feature the entire
sentence, ?5 words on either side, the title attribute, and a range of
other information. Or the user could just read the sentence *exactly as a
sighted person does*.

Further evidence that structural HTML is the priority, not accommodation
of individual product features. WCAG 2 needs to entirely eliminate the
bastard child of Web accessibility, "until user agents," and its cousin,
"since our preferred user agent has neato feature that permits."

Links should be meaningful in and of themselves and in context, but not if
spontaneously remixed in unforeseeable ways.

Why *are* people still claiming this is in any way worthy of WCAG 2?
