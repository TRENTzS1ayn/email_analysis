I've heard that some screen readers will pause when presented with a null
attribute value such as this.

We're trying to keep the rules as simple as possible ("don't use summaries
on layout tables") and I don't think it helps anyone to add the qualifier
that null summaries are OK. Can you think of an example where a null summary
on a layout table is helpful?

Do users want a short summary on a data table such as this? Something like
"simple data table". We're still looking for more input?

My belief is that the WAI is supposed to ask for additional information that
is not required by other formal specifications.

Should say "20 characters [English]".

The first line of the message stated that we had reached a resolution on
layout table summaries. The rest of the message dealing with data table
summaries is still just proposed.

Our resolution means the decision will likely go into the techniques working
draft document. There's still plenty of time for public review and scrutiny
before the techniques become a W3C recommendation.

Kind Regards,
Chris
