Subject: Agenda



Thursday, 7 August at 2000 UTC (4 PM US Eastern, 10 PM France, 6 AM
Eastern Australia) on +1-617-761-6200, passcode 9224
IRC: irc.w3.org 6665, channel #wai-wcag

The agenda for this meeting has, in effect, already been announced: this
is the opportunity for the working group to discuss checkpoint 2.3, its
implications and attendant issues with Dr. Graham Harding, a highly
accomplished researcher in the field of photosensitive epilepsy.

See http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2003JulSep/0232.html

If there is time remaining thereafter we can continue working on open
issues with WCAG 2.0.
