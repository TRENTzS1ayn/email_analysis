I've talk about this to a friend of mine that is blind and she found it
interesting (she said: "We have never think about this possibility!") and
she will discuss it inside an italian mailing list of blind people.

I will write here again about this when she give me back some input :)

BTW, i will check with UAAG about the possibility to implementation for the
screen readers to a functionality to skip the lists (like is done for the
links).
