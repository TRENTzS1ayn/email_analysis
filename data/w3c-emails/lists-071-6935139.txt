DISCUSSION

We continued discussion of the HTML Techniques draft [1]. We concluded the
discussion of tables, focusing mostly on issues around layout tables, such
as usage, linearization, summary attribute, caption, and table headers. We
also began a discussion of links, including grouping, content negotiation,
clear link text, titles to clarify, links with same link text but different
targets, and images in links.

Some issues were resolved to our satisfaction and the resolutions will be
incorporated into the next draft of the techniques, where they will be
subject to further review. Other issues were not as clear or we could not
achieve consensus, and there are action items to work on those.

ACTION ITEMS

Chris: pose question about header markup to list
Ben: investigate User Agent issues for title attributes in links
Michael: post query about how screen reader users use links to some lists
Yvette, David: ask people they know about how AT users use links
Michael: figure out genesis of duplicate link text check in Bobby
Michael: reword technique about images in links
Michael: write proposed technique for image and text links side by side to
same location
