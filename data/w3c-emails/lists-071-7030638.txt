Hello,

Hello Ineke, you are right, the code does nog validate.  However, it is one of the examples in the curriculum for Weg Content. The code used as example on the drempelsweg site can be found at:

http://www.w3.org/WAI/wcag-curric/sam105-0.htm

There are other examples of W3C techniques or examples that do not always validate. However, you are right that the site will need some attention in the coming weeks so that it does validate. The organisation is working on that and a new part with better explanations of the priority 1 guidelines will be implemented by the end of september. 

Personnaly i think that www.drempelsweg.nl does a fine job in stimulating compliance with the WCAG1.0 priority 1 guidelines. Besides that, many disabled people are involved in the making of the site and the explanation of the guidelines and they do a great job in motivating industry and others in making their products more accessible and signing a declaration of intent (to make their site accessible withing a year). Please visit the list of organisations that have signed at: http://www.drempelsweg.nl/overdrempelsweg/intentieverklaringen/index.php3?id=260 (left column).

Kindest regards,

Eric Velleman

Hello Yvette,

http://www.drempelsweg.nl/toegankelijkbouwen/richt/richtlijninfo.php3?id 
=5

When you  validate the map-example you mentioned, it simply does not
validate:

# Line 139, column 12: document type does not allow element "A" here;
missing one of "P", "H1", "H2", "H3", "H4", "H5", "H6", "PRE", "DIV",
"CENTER", "NOSCRIPT", "NOFRAMES", "BLOCKQUOTE", "FORM", "ADDRESS"
start-tag

  [<A href="#">Site map</A>]
              ^

# Line 139, column 25: character data is not allowed here

  [<A href="#">Site map</A>]
                           ^

# Line 140, column 5: end tag for "MAP" which is not finished
(explain...).

  </MAP></div><br><br>


       ^

When you mention examples, please validate before [priority2] . The
whole mentioned page has 26 errors. Nice for an organisation that
asserts to teach people about accessibility and  how to validate their
pages.



greetings
Ineke van der Maat
