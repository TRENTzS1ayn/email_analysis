I took an action item a couple of weeks ago to split the list of checks in 
data tables into separate techniques.  I also created two separate 
sections, one for data tables and one for layout tables.  these sections 
are far from complete and do not yet include new text based on recent 
discussions (ala caption, summary, etc.).

Perhaps on Wednesday we can talk some about how to write text for optional 
checklist items.  I put "(optional)" at the end of a couple to see how this 
would read.  Also, we ought to discuss if we want to split techniques by 
element or concept.  thead and tbody are currently in one technique but 
they could be split into two.

I have not yet split up the mammoth examples.

Just wanted to get something to the group before Wednesday. I'll continue 
working on this the next couple of days.

Best,
