MacWorld magazine's review of LIFT Nielsen Norman Group (LIFT NNg) has
just been published. LIFT NNg was built in conjunction with Jakob
Nielsen's Nielsen Norman Group.* The software evaluates and repairs the
usability of web sites to ensure that they follow the NNg guidelines for
making websites and intranets usable for people with disabilities. 

Summary: 4.5 mice out of 5, "thorough and useful testing tool [...]
invaluable". http://www.macworld.com/2003/08/reviews/liftnng/
