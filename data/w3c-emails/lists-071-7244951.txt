     First, thank you for asking these questions and giving us a format for 
input.
I use links lists seldom.  The main reason I would use them is if I kept 
going around and around looking for something.  I tab through links 
sometimes but find myself using arrow keys most often.  It's hard to know 
which method will get you where you want to go on a given webpage.
  It's very helpful to have some text in the link rather than just "image 
map link or graphic".  Some links have no text and some texts or graphical 
interfaces have no links and no way to access the desired action without a 
mouse.  I have complained to several sites about this, and they either 
don't answer or say in effect, "Gee, that's too bad."
Navigation bars or other grouped links are not necessarily displayed on the 
pages, although they are written about.  "Click on the bar or the drop-down 
menu at the side or bottom."  I would, if I knew where it was.  Also, I 
hate to wade through multiple layers of the same links.  Even though 
there's a keyboard command to move through them, it doesn't always work and 
you waste lots of time looking for text.  I'm very glad more sites are 
putting text versions on.
Again, thank you for giving us opportunity to have input.  I'd like to find 
someone who'd pay me for it, since i end up giving it to many sites anyway.

Sincerely,
Donna Finch
