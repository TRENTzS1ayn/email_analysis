Kynn,

Thank you for the thorough review.  I'm adding your comments to the WCAG 
2.0 issues list. 
http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/issuereports/wcag2_issues.php

I did not create issues for a couple of your comments and I need 
clarification on another.

Did not add to issues list.

Yes, we are asking which one is better. Did not add this question to issues 
list.

Are you asking for technology-specific examples? i.e., do you want to see 
HTML examples here?  Would you be satisfied if we expanded on the 5 
existing examples without including any technology-specifics?

Best,
