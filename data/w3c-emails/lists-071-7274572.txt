DISCUSSION

We began today's discussion addressing some questions raised by Wendy's work
on table techniques. This focused on issues of "AND" and "OR" relationships
among techniques, order of the techniques, prioritization of techniques
(including the concepts of "sufficent" vs. "optional"), how techniques are
grouped (by concept or code element) and granularity. We will propose
resolutions to these questions and propogate to Requirements issues that
aren't already addressed.

We continued the discussion of links from last week, based on input we have
received during the week. It was an interesting and difficult discussion but
we think we will be able to make proposals soon.

We continued reviewing the HTML techniques, using the draft at [1].
Continuing with links, we discussed tabindex and accesskey, which need some
user agent testing to help resolve questions. Links that open in new windows
unexpectedly continues to be a problem, although we hope to deprecate the
technique when user agent notification of such links improves. We weren't
sure what methods of informing the user of the link's nature were
sufficient, so we have more exploring to do there.

Finally we began a discussion of fallbacks for images, including "alt" and
"longdesc" for the IMG element and content for the OBJECT element. The
relationship of d-links to longdesc was also thorny given current user agent
support; and we noted problems with d-links. We will propose adjustments to
these techniques on the basis of the discussion.

Detailed log of discussion is at [2].
