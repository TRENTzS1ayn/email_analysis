Kynn,

You asked, "44. Appendix A Glossary: Isn't there a WAI-wide glossary in the
works?"

Yes, there is a WAI-wide glossary in the works, as well as a method for 
gathering glossary terms throughout the W3C into one place. We acknowledge 
this in the editorial note at the beginning of the glossary, "The WCAG WG 
has not tackled the definitions of the terms that we are using and 
acknowledges that we sometimes use terms inconsistently. We need to 
coordinate our terms and definitions with the WAI Glossary and are working 
on proposals for a variety of definitions. We have been looking at the UAAG 
1.0 glossary and other glossaries within the W3C."

Best,
--wendy
