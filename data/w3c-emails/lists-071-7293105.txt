Last week I asked members of a few lists, focused on assistive technology
users, how they use links and what characteristics of links facilitate or
impede their usage. I got responses from about a dozen people, mostly screen
reader users. My summary is below. The summary doesn't capture every single
comment but does capture the dominant issues raised.

RESULTS

The links list is useful on familiar pages, or where you know what link
you're looking for (especially searching by first letter); but is generally
not useful on unfamiliar pages.

There was a split preference between the links list vs. tabbing among links,
people mostly do one or the other.

There were various opinions on using surrounding context to clarify links.
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't; people reported different success
ratios ranging from "usually" works to "usually doesn't".

People don't follow links that are ambiguous and can't be clarified by
context.

Most people like links to convey information about the content of the page
and find pages more useful where this is the case. Predominantly this is for
inline links.

Links are easier to use when authors provide the title attribute and make
sure the link text is fully explained.

Other things people like to know about links (provided by the user agent):
whether it's visited, refers to the same page, protocol (e.g., FTP).

Characteristics of links that present problem: 
* Ambiguous or stock text (e.g., "click here") - many hate though some say
they're ok if context available.
* Null link text, e.g., a linked image with null or missing alt text.
* Long link text
* Useless text: things like "logo", auto-generated alt texts, abbreviations
* Multiple instances of same link text, especially if the links go to
different targets

No preference on whether links should be organized into a navigation bar or
inline with document content, both are useful depending on context.
Navigation bars should have a skip link.
