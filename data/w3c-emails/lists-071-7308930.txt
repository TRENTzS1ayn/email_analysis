Unlikely to happen soon. iCab changes its cursor (hand gains a
superimposed plus sign), but that is the only device of any kind I know of
that warns you in advance.

One hopes that any discussion of D-links will be eliminated. longdesc is
the correct mechanism for long description of <img>. Try someone's
photo-album page with D-links sometime. It was never a good idea. We have
way more important things to worry about.

iCab displays accesskeys. I see that has not been much discussed on this
list. iCab is not much of a browser due to its poor CSS support, but it
has some nice interface features.

No need to reinvent the wheel. A common WAI habit-- ignoring the prior
art.
