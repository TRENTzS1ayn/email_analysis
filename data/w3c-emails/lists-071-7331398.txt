LIFT has provided an option to include the Nielsen-Norman guidelines for
some time.  It should be noted that those guidelines are not in the
public domain: they were published in Koyne and Nielsen (2001), Beyond
ALT Text, published as a PDF document (reasonably accessible) by
Nielsen-Norman.  Single copies are available for $190 (yes, that's one
hundred and ninety dollars); if you want to make copies, you'll have to
pay $390 (three hundred and ninety dollars).

Some of the guidelines make sense; some don't.  My review of the
Koyne-Nielsen report is in the ITD Journal at
http://www.rit.edu/~easi/itd/itdv08n2/review2.html.

An alternate set of accessibility guidelines now has a tool supporting
it.

MacWorld magazine's review of LIFT Nielsen Norman Group (LIFT NNg) has
just been published. LIFT NNg was built in conjunction with Jakob
Nielsen's Nielsen Norman Group.* The software evaluates and repairs the
usability of web sites to ensure that they follow the NNg guidelines for
making websites and intranets usable for people with disabilities. 

Summary: 4.5 mice out of 5, "thorough and useful testing tool [...]
invaluable". http://www.macworld.com/2003/08/reviews/liftnng/
