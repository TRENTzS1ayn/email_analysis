In earlier discussions we arrived at a resolution that TH elements will not
be allowed in layout tables.

But in following discussions the question arose as to whether header
attributes related to TH be allowed/disallowed.

The attributes 'headers', 'axis' and 'scope' seem to have no use if there
are no TH cells but, according to the HTML spec, are allowed on TD cells.

Are there any reasons that we should be concerned about the accessibility of
these attributes in layout tables?
