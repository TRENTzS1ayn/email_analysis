I could understand and agree with John but the HTML reference [1] referring
to "summary" explain that:

"This attribute provides a summary of the table's purpose and structure for
user agents rendering to non-visual media such as speech and Braille."

"summary" is different from the ALT attribute [2] that must be specified for
the IMG and AREA elements.

So, if there is no text that presents the table's purpose and structure, why
use the attribute?
