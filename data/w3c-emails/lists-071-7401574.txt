Hello list,

Tonight we were talking about checkpoint 3.3 and providing a link to a
glossary in a document. I just want to point out that the HTML standard
already provides a mechanism for it, the <LINK> element with rel="glossary"
as attribute. (http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/types.html#h-6.12)

The HTML techniques document already mentions LINK as a technique but only
for checkpoint 1.3
(http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-HTML-TECHS/#link). Perhaps in a
future version of the techniques document it can be included as a technique
for 3.3 as well?
