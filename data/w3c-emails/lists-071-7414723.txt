Hi all,

I'm trying to find more time to dedicate contributing to WAIGL (always
difficult).  So please be patient with me as I try and get back on track and
contribute.  I'll try and look back at issues, so maybe from time to time
you may need to point me to points or issues that have been discussed
previously.

Geoff
