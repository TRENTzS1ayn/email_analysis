This new "contexthelp" attribute is potentially very useful.  Currently,
though, it's a proprietary feature-- only JAWS recognizes it (and only
JAWS 5.0 at that).  I note that Freedom Scientific plans to propose
adding the attribute to the XHTML spec; if that happens this will be a
good thing!

I wanna to point the attention about this:

"Context Sensitive Help Attribute for HTML Introduced for Web Authors.
Web/HTML authors may now use the newly defined ContextHelp attribute for
form input or other elements. JAWS will tell the user when a field has
such extra help whenever it exists. You can choose to review the help
using speech or Braille with INSERT+F1 or ignore it. The GetObjectHelp
script function has been updated to support this attribute which we will
be sending to the WAI as a recommended option to consider as a standard.

We will be updating our HTML Challenge to include examples of this as
well as other areas of our Web Content. GetObjectHelp also returns the
acc_help for MSAA and the description for Java objects.

For a demonstration of how this can be used, use the following HTML
source:
<P><LABEL for=Mname >Mother's Name: </LABEL><BR><INPUT id=Mname
name=Mname ContextHelp="For this field make sure you enter your mother's
maiden name."></P>"


Instead of ContextHelp why they don't propose the "title" attribute that
is valid for the <input> ag[1] ? ContextHelp is not defined by
HTML/XHTML so it is not possible to use it...
