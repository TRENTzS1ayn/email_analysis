Roberto makes a good point when he asks "Why use the [summary]
attribute" if the resource contains no text describing the purpose or
organization of the table?

The primary reason is to confirm that the absence of explanatory text is
deliberate rather than accidental.

It occurs to me that the problem of identifying table types could be
solved by providing a type attribute for the table element; legal values
could be "layout" or "data." or An attribute called "layout" whose
values could be either "yes" or "no," could also work.  These would
become part of the XHTML spec.

I could understand and agree with John but the HTML reference [1]
referring to "summary" explain that:

"This attribute provides a summary of the table's purpose and structure
for user agents rendering to non-visual media such as speech and
Braille."

"summary" is different from the ALT attribute [2] that must be specified
for the IMG and AREA elements.

So, if there is no text that presents the table's purpose and structure,
why use the attribute?
