All, as for the proposal of Jaws creator of the new attribute
"ContextHelp" depends from the possibility to apply it into the new
version of XHTML. But at now[1] summary is used and these new attributes
that u referer to are not used.

I agree with you that the deliberation to use summary="" instead of not
use it but at this point instead of use summary="" for the layout tables
why don't use directly summary="[layout]" and "educate" the screen
readers that this is a layout table?

Empty attribute means that there is no need of description but for eg.
the difference between alt="" and summary="" is that "alt" is a
*required* attribute instead of "summary" that is an *optional*
attribute.
