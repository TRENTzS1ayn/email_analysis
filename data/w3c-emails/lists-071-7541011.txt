I could agree with you but as in the normative documents is wrote, "alt"
must be present (also null, as explained also in some interesting
articles [1]. Using an empty summary, referring to the normative
guidelines, is not needed.

This means that this would be a machine-tester problem? Must the
guidelines adapted to machine tester esigence or to the W3C guidelines
and to the usability of the people with disability?

Btw, we could add a techniques that "suggest" to use empty summary for
layout tables but we cannot said: layout tables must have empty summary
because:

1- some people could find useful use summary for describe the layout
table (eg: "this table is formed by three columns: one for the menu, one
for the contents and one for the useful links")
2- the guidelines for HTML / XHTML, if we ask for a *must be present*,
need to be upgraded (adding in the HTML / XHTML Errata?)

As suggested by John M. Slatin, the use of new attributes could be good
but these will be applied only since XHTML 2.0 and newer
raccomandations... for the *old* HTML 4.xx and XHTML 1.x this, i think,
could be a problem...

Remember that the guidelines must be *testable* that this means not only
machine-testable... :)

What valuable information are given by an empty attribute for what the
guidelines don't have thinked to put it as *required* ?
