ContextHelp may be a good thing, but the WCAG as we have it now states
that accessibility features must be supported in at least one prior
version and in more than one AT on more than one platform.  Just because
Freedom Scientific gets the XHTML WG to add it will not make it a viable
option for WCAG compliance.

ContextHelp is the only useful propriety tag element or attribute that
seems to have been well thought out.  However, if we let software or AT
developers to dictate the standards we will be in the same position we
are currently with Netscape and Microsoft.  History has shown that
format does not work.

This new "contexthelp" attribute is potentially very useful.  Currently,
though, it's a proprietary feature-- only JAWS recognizes it (and only
JAWS 5.0 at that).  I note that Freedom Scientific plans to propose
adding the attribute to the XHTML spec; if that happens this will be a
good thing!


Roberto:
Yes... it is interesting but:

1 - Shall Freedom Scientific let W3C to add to the future XHTML spec? 2
- What about the "old" HTML 4.xx / XHTML 1.x? 3 - What about the UAAG?

One of the point of the W3C guidelines and also of the WCAG WG must be
to give guidelines to web developers and software developers and not
adapt the "proprietary guidelines"... this is IMHO...
