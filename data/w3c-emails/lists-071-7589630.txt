Machine tests could just as easily query the author about the nature of a
table based on the existence of the <TH> element. When a machine test
encounters <TH>, it would then require that a valid summary (not a null
summary) also be present in the same way that Lee describes a machine test
needing to do the reverse based on the presence of summary. 

I don't think this trivializes the importance of summary for authors.
Instead, it reinforces the idea that using technologies according to
specification (in this case, including structural attributes only when they
have meaning and purpose that relates directly to the content) is an
important part of the process. From an authors perspective, guidelines that
would require an author who uses tables exclusively for layout to add a
semantically meaningless attribute to each and every table on their site is
far more problematic than asking them to understand the difference between
layout and data tables and include appropriate markup.

Though there is a good deal of room for interpretation, the techniques from
WCAG 1.0 [1] seem to support an approach that would not require include
summary in layout tables:

WCAG 1.0 Checkpoint 5.5 says, "Provide summaries for tables." However, the
examples and prose in the techniques document for this checkpoint provides
examples that relate only to data tables.[2]

WCAG 1.0 Checkpoint 5.4 says, "If a table is used for layout, do not use any
structural markup for the purpose of visual formatting." Prose for this
checkpoint implies that the inclusion of structural markup like TH can be
misleading when used in layout tables.[3]

While table summaries don't have an impact on visual formatting, they do
provide structure to tables and, in my opinion, have the same potential to
be as misleading as misuse of the TH element. 

In the WCAG 2.0 Techniques, I think the message about summary on tables
should be:

1. Provide summaries for data tables.
2. If a table is used for layout, do not use any structural markup.
