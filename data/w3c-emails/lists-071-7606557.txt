Agree in full with this...
For example (i hope i don't made a mistake) the "lang" attribute was
found difficoult by the screen readers that needs to change the language
engine every "stranger" word and now seems that with Jaws 5.0 has been
developed the first engine with full support of the "lang" attribute:
this is a winner position of the WCAG guidelines that have requested to
the assistive tecnologies developers to cover the "tecnology hole" of
the change of language...

If summary is null or not present then test the next lines:
- if there is caption and/or there is <th> it is a data table and this
is an error that "summary" is not present
- if there isn't caption and/or <th> it *could* be a layout table or a
wrong data table and so here there is a need of an human validator.
