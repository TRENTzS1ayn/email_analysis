Subject: [eeurope-pwd] New possibility for discussion STANDARDISATION
issues




[please accept my apologies for possible crosspostings- JE]

Dear friends,

During discussions in the past, several persons showed me their interest
in
discussing and contributing to DfA and AT standardisation issues.

Meanwhile, the European Union (DG INFSO) has started funding the virtual
networking project, D4ALLnet, which is collaborating with both the EDeAN
network and the more specialised project on curriculum development
IDCnet.

This D4ALLnet project established, during spring time, the technical
infrastructure for interactive discussions, chatting and document
archiving
for several special interest groups, including the one on
Standardisation.
I have agreed with the D4ALL net consortium to act as moderator for the
Standardisation discussions.

Therefore I would like to invite you, if interested in standardisation
issues, to make yourself known to the group.

In practice, the only thing you have to do is to go to:

http://www.d4allnet.gr

and to log in with a username and password of your choice.
You will then be offered the possibility to subscribe to the different
SIGs,
including the one on standardisation.
That's all.

Currently there are 33 subscribers and I would like to increase that
number
substantially. Current discussions are about ISO 16071 (a questionnaire
for
sending your remarks to the ISO Convener is available) and the document
archive contains background material on ISO16071 and the eAccessibility
expert group's work on Standardisation.

Greetings,

Jan Engelen

PS: Be aware that only exceptionnally there will be emails sent to you
from
the D4ALLNet system. The basic idea is that you log in from time to time
to
the website to participate in the discussions. If you prefer, you can
however ask the system to send you notices per email as soon as new
material
or new discussion items have been added.
