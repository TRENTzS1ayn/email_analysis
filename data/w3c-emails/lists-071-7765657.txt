For personal experience (I represent inside W3C IWA/HWG, the world
biggest association of web professional), web develpers that don't work
directly in accessibility initiatives, for reach the "minimum level of
accessibility" only made the "Bobby" or other automatic testing tool
validation.
This is wrong also because these tools are not the "panacea" for the
validation: for eg. a lot of these don't validate CSS so there is the pr
oblem that if I use fixed size font the validator said me "xxxx approved
for level AA" but if the font are fixed size i cannot declare level 2.
The best to do is to create a policy maker (like this one:
http://www.prato.linux.it/~gbartolini/it/wcag/) where the developer in
good faith declare what points its work reached.
