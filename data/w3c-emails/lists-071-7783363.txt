Also had an action item to work on Acronyms and abbreviations

 

Here is what I came to:

 

I think the definition should be something like:
 
Acronyms and abbreviations should be tied to a definition within the
document
to a definition externally.
 
The method for this would be in technology specific techniques.  We should
also define a semantic markup technique for ambiguous words and it could
be used for this as well.   That would help solve problems with whether a
word is a word or acronym or proper name etc.  
 
Semantic markup is going to be a big need for the future.  We need to create
standard methods for it.  
 
Perhaps this should be combined with other semantic markup into a single
checkpoint with abvs and acronyms being one success criteria.
