Had an action item to work on wording of 1.1

 

Here it is

 

 

Rewording of proposed solution to include input from telecon
 
Ability to be expressed in words 
This refers to content whose function or intended purpose can be expressed
accurately and unambiguously in a reasonable number of words (for example,
diagrams, charts, illustrations,etc.)  Content such as a musical performance
or visual artwork is not considered "content that can be expressed in
words,"
if the intended purpose is to present the performance since a performance
relies heavily on the visual (or auditory) experience and cannot be
expressed

accurately and unambiguously in words (even if the musical score can be).
