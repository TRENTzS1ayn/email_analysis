In the update for jaws that Roberto sent [1], it says, "You can even use 
the Dictionary Manager to replace words with sounds or play a sound, as 
well as change the pronunciation of a word. You can also tell JAWS to 
always speak a particular word in a particular language. Imagine replacing 
a left pointing arrow symbol with a sound which plays from the right ear to 
the left. All this power is available just by selecting the appropriate 
speech and sounds scheme or by using the more powerful and flexible 
Dictionary Manager."

in this morning's call [2] we said we would define ascii art as multi-line 
ascii art, but dash dash greater than is not an emoticon and it is not 
multi-line ascii art but it is a symbolic representation created out of 
characters.

so, 2 points:
1. is the definition that we agreed on this morning accurate?
2. jaws users are (or will be) able to add common "symbols" to their 
pronunciation dictionary which answers a question we asked in the call.
