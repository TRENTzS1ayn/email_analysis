I wanna point also the focus about "Certification" of WCAG.
There are lot of companies that are starting the "WAB" (Web
Accessibility Business)...
Today I've found this example: http://www.nfb.org/seal/wacs.htm and i
think that there would be also other countries that will develop their
certification program.

I've also post in the AC Representative list this proposal: why don't
add in the copyright section and / or in the "Conformance Claims" a text
similar to this one:

"Certification
The materials contained in this web site must be considered as
guidelines. No certification programs could be start using this material
without a prior agreement with the World Wide Web Consortium".
