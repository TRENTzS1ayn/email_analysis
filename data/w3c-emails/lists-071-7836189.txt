I repeat my complaint that WAI and the WCAG WG continue to delude
themselves that everything can be boiled down to a "reasonable number of
words," i.e., "diagrams, charts, illustrations, etc." are actually
superfluous and offer no marginal benefit over "reasonable number[s]" of
words.

WAI and WCAG WG members obviously, after having had four years to study
this issue, still fail to understand that people draw "diagrams, charts,
illustrations" because *data relationships cannot be adequately summed up
in words*. Words-words-words: That's all WAI wants on every Web page
everywhere, save of course for those Web pages that must be "supplemented"
with "non-text content" for people with learning disabilities.

It is false to contend that "diagrams, charts, illustrations"
categorically constitute content that can be expressed in words. WAI and
the WCAG WG continue to flaunt their ignorance of the philosophy and
practice of "diagrams, charts, illustrations," yet WAI and WCAG WG have
the temerity to dictate to the rest of the world that "diagrams, charts,
illustrations" can be "expressed accurately and unambiguously in a
reasonable number of words."

I'll give you the same homework assignment I gave you before:

<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2003JanMar/0291.html>

Take ten examples from each of Edward Tufte's volumes and "express [them]
accurately and unambiguously in a reasonable number of words."

WAI and WCAG WG peck away at picayune peripheral issues, tending to get
even those wrong, and never quite twig to the fact that their central
themes are even more wrong.
