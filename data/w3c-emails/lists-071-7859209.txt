DISCUSSION

Action items from last week - further discussion of links, especially that
open in a new window. The research done during the week was helpful but we
also have more questions. Also discussed user agent support for OBJECT,
which is all over the map.

Reviewing the HTML Techniques [1] we continued with images, beginning with
ASCII art. Much of the discussion focused on emoticons rather than classic
ASCII art, and we decided to create separate techniques. On image maps we
looked at current user agent support for the present techniques to make
server-side and client-side image maps accessible, which generated a number
of edits. Color in images and animated images we decided to move to the
Gateway techniques, and discussed potential guideline impacts/needs related
to these techniques.

On Programmatic objects we decided that because of user agent support not to
emphasize the OBJECT element as much. For the same reason we also decided we
need to create techniques for the EMBED element, which creates interesting
problems because it's not part of the HTML specification. And to maintain
separation of technology, the HTML techniques will only describe methods
within the HTML for providing fallbacks for the APPLET, OBJECT, and EMBED
elements. Making programmatic objects directly accessible will be described
in Gateway techniques or other technology-specific documents.

We finished with audio and video, which was easy because we just decided to
move that to Gateway techniques.

Next week we hope to complete the review of the HTML techniques.

Detailed log of discussion is at [2].
