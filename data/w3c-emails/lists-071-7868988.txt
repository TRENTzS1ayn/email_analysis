"Expressed in words" is used by the WAI and WCAG WG for specific
reasons -- they feel that it meets specific needs of specific
audiences.  Presumably, even though you disagree with the dictate
of "expressed in words," you understand that they're not just issuing
it arbitrarily.

What alternate "central theme" would you suggest that meets the needs
expressed by WCAG WG via "ability to be expressed in words" but which
is more suitable in the face of your objections?

This is not asking for a simple rewording -- you claim there's a
conceptual problem.  WCAG WG would not be willing to give up on their
core concept unless they are assured that the needs which led to
"expressed in words" are still met, and not simply discarded.

Therefore, I'd like to hear from you, Joe, what replacement concept
you have to offer.  You are arguing that WCAG WG must change to
another concept than the current one -- but you have given no hint
of what may involve.  The current concept meets needs.  A replacement
must either meet those same needs, or somehow prove that those needs
don't really exist after all.

That, I think, is why you are meeting resistance to your ideas,
Joe -- apart from your abrasive method of communication.

PS:  Joe may simply ignore this email and its question, as he has
      indicated to me that he will discard any email I write which
      appears to be critical of his communication style.  In such a
      case, I'd encourage other members of the working group to
      likewise set aside the matter of Joe's manners, and instead
      continue with the approach outlined above -- ask Joe, simply
      and clearly, what he proposes as an alternative, given the
      perceived needs of the working group, needs which resulted in
      the current concept.  Thanks.
