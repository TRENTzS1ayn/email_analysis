Minor edits to the charter which is now available 
at:        http://www.w3.org/2003/08/wcag-charter-draft.html

(feel free to compare it to the old charter draft at: 
http://www.w3.org/2002/10/wcag-charter-draft.html)

1. Mission: first paragraph changed to:
  "The mission of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group 
(WCAG WG) is to develop guidelines to make Web content accessible for 
people with disabilities. In particular, the WCAG WG will further advance 
the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 towards a W3C Recommendation."

2. Mission: second paragraph "complimentary" changed to "complementary"

3. Mission: fourth paragraph.  added at the end of the fourth paragraph of 
the mission section,
         "The group is being rechartered to allow additional time for 
development of WCAG 2.0."

4. Scope:  item #1 under scope now reads:
         "Advance WCAG 2.0 further towards a W3C Recommendation, per 
requirements ...."

5. Deliverables: first paragraph, changed "November 2000" to "March 2000" 
the date we published the first TR draft of Requirements for WCAG 2.0.

6. Deliverables: first paragraph, reworded to say:
         "...and seeks to further advance WCAG 2.0 towards a W3C 
Recommendation."

7.  Dependencies: second paragraph:  added "and other resources" before "to 
clarify the work of the WCAG." (related to EOWG work)

8.  Dependencies: typo "two fold," changed to "twofold"

9. Swad dependency missing - no change made yet although discussing with 
Judy, Gregg, and Jason.

10. Task force authorization missing - no change made yet although 
discussing with Judy, Gregg, and Jason.

11. Duration: added  "...at which point the WCAG WG is expected to be 
rechartered, as part of the renewal of the WAI Technical Activity, for 
sufficient time as needed to complete WCAG 2.0 as a Recommendation and for 
post-Recommendation work."

12. Success: first bulleted item rephrased as "...including further 
advancement of WCAG 2.0 towards a W3C Recommendation" would clarify the 
ambiguity.

13. Success: second bulleted item rephrased as "Last Call and Candidate 
Recommendation implementations of WCAG 2.0"

14. Success: third bulleted item rephrased as: "Development of associated 
test materials for Candidate Recommendation and/or Proposed Recommendation 
draft of WCAG 2.0."

15. Communication: last bulleted item:  added WAI Interest Group.

The following items were made to the old draft and carried forward:
(http://www.w3.org/2002/10/wcag-charter-draft.html)

16. All references to the W3C Process Document were updated to reflect the 
most recent Process Document (June 2003).  Excerpts from the PD were 
updated to reflect minor changes in wording.

17. Duration updated to reflect continued delays in rechartering. Now says, 
"The Working Group is scheduled for 10 months, from September 2003 through 
June 2004."  Note: we are only scheduled until 2004 because the WAI 
Technical Activity charter expires and will renew at that time.  We will 
renew our charter w/the rest of the activity.

18. Deleted link to patent disclosures for WCAG WG 
(http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/disclosures.html) since it was not included in 
the agreed upon template produced by the Patent Policy Working Group.
