Web authors should never be forced to spell-check outside visitors' 
entries; that's a user-agent issue. And at least one such user agent 
exists:

<http://www.iespell.com/>

>ieSpell is a free Internet Explorer browser extension that spell 
>checks text input boxes on a webpage. It should come in particularly 
>handy for users who do a lot of web-based text entry (e.g. web 
>mails, forums, blogs, diaries). Even if your web application already 
>includes spell checking functionality, you might still want to 
>install this utility because it is definitely much faster than a 
>server-side solution. Plus you get to store and use your personal 
>word list across all your applications, instead of maintaining 
>separate ones on each application.
