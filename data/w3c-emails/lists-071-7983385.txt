You're defining the term using the term?

I suppose. I don't see how smileys or "symbolic representation[s] created
out of characters" are even worth talking about. If your user agent can be
configured to read or skip those, well, do it. Web authors should not be
constrained from using those simple, even trivial, devices.

Interesting, of course, but not relevant for Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines 2.0. Web *content* developers have no sway over how user agents
ultimately render their content. I would urge WAI and indeed WCAG WG to
resist their years-incubated impulse to craft guidelines according to the
peccadilloes of Jaws or any tool.
