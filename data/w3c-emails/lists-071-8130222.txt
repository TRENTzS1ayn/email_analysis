There seems to be a large number of languages to choose from when it comes to scripts on the server or on the client side.

Should we then be specific about the language and include jsp, asp, javascript, perl script, c, java and vb script.  Do we want to only focus on a subset of thees languages (say JSP and javascript only), or do we look at this subset (say javascript and jsp) as the core where comprahensive techniques "must" be available, and provide a forum for people to contribute with techniques in other languages which "may" be made available but don't strictly have to be.

In addition to the list of technologies, should we include xsl (xslt) techniques as well.  (Maybe DTD?).

should we go further and include voiceML and MathML as we are doing with other xml languages such as xhtml and svg.  

And.... when we look at techniques with given languages, should we be specific about the version refered to such as css 1 or 2, html 4 or xhtml 1, etc.

Is there any value or point to addressing these as part of WCAG2 Techniques?
