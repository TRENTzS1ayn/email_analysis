To The Group -

Colourblindness is a complex issue and would likely not be easily summed-up
in even a scientific formula/algorithm.  I read with interest chapter 9 of
Joe's book and for the most part came away with what I already knew about my
own disability (if I dare call it a disability - more of a nuisance than
anything).  I am one of those white males who has red-green colourblindness
- one who went some 18 years without knowing I had colourblindness (not
until I received my physical exam notice to be drafted into the military).

Joe is right - persons with most types of color deficiencies actually see
colors.  Even individuals with red-green colourblindness see the colors red
and green (depending upon the background/foreground combinations of the
presented text, if we're talking text).  There are also issues of things
like Scoptopic Sensitivity Syndrome (Irlin Syndrome) or other light
refractive, light waveform issues.

As a group, we've talked about issues that center around colourblindness but
we do need to look at the fact that this is "just" one logical connection to
what I really see as a contrast issue (and, sorry to say, probably
brightness as well).  Colourblindness is something that rings in the mind of
those who hear the word.  We all know someone who is colourblind so that
makes color issues easy to pin on a particular group.

Like so much of what we are trying to do, the issue of visual perception
(for those of us with vision) or whatever we'd elect to call it are trying
to make things better for as many individuals as possible.  Accessibility is
different things to different individuals and we'll "probably" never reach
the 100% mark with regard to total accessibility but we should strive toward
that mark.  

So - I do not fully agree with either side of the coin on whatever the issue
is here but would appreciate positive direction with regard to steps that
can be taken to make the wording (whatever) such that web authors have a
better chance of "doing it" right.

Personally, contrast is a huge issue with me...agree or disagree, it's what
makes printed text possible for me to read - plain and simple.  So - a web
authors ability to KNOW what color combinations work, especially when
presenting text over a colored background is an important issue.  And, there
will likely be no way to accommodate everyone's individual needs from the
authoring end but that does not mean authors should not follow set standards
or guidelines.  

My two cents worth.
