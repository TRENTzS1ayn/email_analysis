Fine.  I'll keep my eye on everything that is happening, but a focus on this
issue.  I'll try to find time to go over the HTML techniques and other
aspects, as well.  I've printed them, just to find time to read them.  At
the same time I'll focus on looking at server side techniques.

Hi Geoff - yes indeed, we see the need to have server side techniques as you
describe. We haven't focused too much on that yet but were planning on
turning our attention that and other kinds of techniques soon, once we pass
the current hurdle to release a substantially revised version of the HTML
techniques. Some people have already been putting thought into this; it's
possible that their area of focus is somewhat different than yours, but I
think it would make sense to start working on them together and if two
distinct types of "server side techniques" emerge, we can split the
documents or something.

Although the techniques teleconference calls are not at a good time for
Australia, we should find a way to pull you into this. Since it sounds like
you have some ideas to start with there might be a lot of progress quickly.
I'll follow up soon. Michael
