Greetings, Web Publishing Accessibility Wizard Users!

We are pleased to announce a new preview release of our Web
Accessibility
Wizard, also known as the PowerPoint Accessibility Wizard.  The newest
version is 1.0 Preview Release 9 (1.0.9).

We are now back on track for regular releases after a brief hiatus to
work
on some internal projects.  We currently plan on releasing a "real"
version 1.0 in the next month; stay tuned!

The new version extends the timeout period to December, and adds a
configuration step in which you can specify which versions to generate
(though TextOnly must always be generated), which resolutions of the
graphical version to generate (if any), and which resolution will be
"default".

It also allows you to specify a default "index" file name.  This is an
index file in each directory that your web server will look to if the
URL
ends in the directory.  This file is often called "index.html"  or
"default.html" or similar.  This index file name is in addition to the
regular file name you specify in the final step.

Finally, you can now choose to include or exclude two types of
additional
notation, the Speaker Notes entered into the small window at the bottom
of
the PowerPoint window, and "Review Comments", the little yellow
sticky-note type boxes that you can put revision comments into.

As always, details & downloads are available from:

 http://www.rehab.uiuc.edu/office/

A number of people have written asking about the ominous "Your License
Has
X Days Remaining" message.  This is a mechanism to keep everyone running
the "latest and greatest" version of the Wizard.  If we do not expire
the
"Preview" versions in some way, our 2 person team would be overwhelmed
with handling questions from people running out-of-date versions.  This
will change with the "real" version 1.0, due out soon.

Thank you for your continued interest and support,

 - The Web Accessibility Wizard for Office Team,
   Jon, Dan, and Sid
