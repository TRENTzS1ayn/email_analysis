Hi Folks

We are writing the Techniques 2.0 document.  We are considering how to treat
emoticons.  Could I get screen reader users to comment on this?

1.Do emoticons you have any trouble understanding emoticons such as
:-) and ;-)     ?  
2.Do they bother you? 
3.Do you have trouble with emoticons in tools such as MS Messenger and
various Bloggers which are graphical?
4.Do you have any other comments on emoticons.  How would you like to
see them treated in TECH 2.0?

 

 

Cheers

David MacDonald
