First of all -- what's the purpose of this survey? For me this nearly sounds
like asking car drivers if stickers or colored fog lamps are nice gimmicks
for their cars -- that sounds really exciting, but it ain't important, and of
course not in relation to car driving (and roadworthiness).

In general, emoticons are a) a matter of taste, and b) dubious and
nonserious, above all related to business sites and correspondence (here in Germany
it's very nonprofessional, I don't know how this is handled in US). So I can
only question this survey again.


Some feedback:

> 1.Do emoticons you have any trouble understanding emoticons such as
> :-) and ;-)     ?

No. Note: One problem might be a different syntax -- so :) and :-) are
equivalent, ;) and ;-), too. There are several other examples.

> 2.Do they bother you? 

Yes.

> 3.Do you have trouble with emoticons in tools such as MS Messenger and
> various Bloggers which are graphical?

N/A

> 4.Do you have any other comments on emoticons.  How would you like to
> see them treated in TECH 2.0?

See above. I don't like them treated all, either don't bring them up, or say
'Use at own risk, because not everybody knows, understands or likes them,
and they might be unserious'.



Regards,
 Jens.
