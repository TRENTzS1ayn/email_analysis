There's nothing to be more constructive *about*; WCAG WG continues to flub
the issue of colour deficiency because it refuses to do proper research.

Please do your own research first.

Memo to WAI (sic): I *have* contributed to this issue by writing an
authoritative book chapter on the subject. WAI and WCAG WG are merely
resistant to reading the prior art. A lot of this stuff has been covered
before. Go read it.

Sorry. *Please* go read it.
