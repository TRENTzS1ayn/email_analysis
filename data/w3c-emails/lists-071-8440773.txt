Re 338 [http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=338]
One rule of defining a term is not to use that term in its own definition. I
propose the following rewording:

Functionality
Functionality is the purpose or intended effect of the content. This
includes presentation of information, and also includes less static
operations such as data collection, securing a response from the user,
providing user experience, testing, confirmation, purchasing, etc.
