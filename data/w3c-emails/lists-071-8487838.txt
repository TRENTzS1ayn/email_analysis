and I don't know what that's all about, but it is not valid HTML.

One of those eat-your-own-vegan-dogfood things.

The CSS validates, though, if you can dig around to find the right URL.

1. Write valid code
2. Tweak for known incompatibilities in target browsers

Action 2 above includes Macs and various other platforms, of course.

For both 1 and 2, read _Designing with Web Standards_ by Zeldman, among
many other widely-available sources.

A *lot* of people working in Web accessibility use Macintosh or are
outright Macintosh separatists. I do not think WAI is in much of a
position to use its own invalid documents as models of CSS-based design,
however.
