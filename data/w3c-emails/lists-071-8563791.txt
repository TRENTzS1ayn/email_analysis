What huh?

The DTD choice has no effect -- zero, nada, none -- on whether you
can use tables for layouts.  It's _perfectly valid_ to use tables for
layout in XHTML 1.0 Strict, for example.

I use Transitional myself because it's a bit more secure for what I need
it to do, and because I may need to make inline changes in some of my
blog posts.  Quite honestly, there is little difference between
<div align="right"> and <div style="text-align: right;"> -- except that
the first is safer because it's more likely to work correctly.

If the working group is going to make assumptions based on why people
use specific DTDs, I would like to see that backed up with hard data,
e.g. a survey of Web developers asking them why they've chosen to use
a specific DTD, or not use one at all.
