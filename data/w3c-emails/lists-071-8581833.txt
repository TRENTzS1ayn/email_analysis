I found interesting this mensurability of the contrast.

I noticed that the complementary colour (directly opposite to each other in
the colour wheel) combination has the highest contrast.
http://www.webwhirlers.com/colors/combining.asp
"Split complementary is a colour and the analogous colours to its complement
color. Using split complementary colours can give you a design with a high
degree of contrast, yet still not as extreme as a real complementary colour.
It also results in greater harmony than the use of the direct
complementary."

Maybe this site is useful:

It's about contrast performance of the human eye.

It is interesting also to notice that even the chromatic contrast
sensitivity functions are subjected to a logarithm:
