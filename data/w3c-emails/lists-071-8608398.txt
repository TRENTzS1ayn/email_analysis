To address Roberto's comment, does anyone disagree with replacing the scope 
of WCAG 2.0 [1] with:
  "These guidelines cover a wide range of issues and recommendations for 
making Web content more accessible. They include recommendations to make 
pages accessible and usable by people with a full range of 
disabilities.  In some cases something that makes Web content more 'usable' 
by one person makes it 'accessible' to another.  The guidelines do not 
attempt to address all usability recommendations, but  instead focus on 
those aspects of usability that increase accessibility."
