Subject: Scope of WCAG 2.0 (was: Re: Minor edits to the draft charter)



To address Roberto's comment, does anyone disagree with replacing the
scope 
of WCAG 2.0 [1] with:
  "These guidelines cover a wide range of issues and recommendations for

making Web content more accessible. They include recommendations to make

pages accessible and usable by people with a full range of 
disabilities.  In some cases something that makes Web content more
'usable' 
by one person makes it 'accessible' to another.  The guidelines do not 
attempt to address all usability recommendations, but  instead focus on 
those aspects of usability that increase accessibility."
