Wendy and The Group -

Basically, I like what Roberto offers-up as a change to the "Scope" as
presently written.  The sentence, "In some cases something that makes Web
content more 'usable' by one person makes it 'accessible' to another." seems
a bit awkward but I cannot figure out a better written solution - what about
saying -

In most cases (as opposed to - in some cases) a bit more pro-active (but
what do I know).

And, I wish I could word-smith a better word for the "something" in the same
sentence.  

The flavor of what's being said, is GREAT!  Thanks Roberto!  And, I can live
with it the way Roberto has written it, too.
