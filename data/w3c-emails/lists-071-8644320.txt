Doyle flags the following sentence as somewhat problematic:

 "In some cases something that makes Web content more 'usable' by one
person makes it 'accessible' to another." 

I agree that this may be unclear to some readers, and would suggest the
following re-wording:

 "In some cases something that makes Web content more 'usable' by one
person is essential to making it even minimally 'accessible' to
another."

Wendy and The Group -

Basically, I like what Roberto offers-up as a change to the "Scope" as
presently written.  The sentence, "In some cases something that makes
Web content more 'usable' by one person makes it 'accessible' to
another." seems a bit awkward but I cannot figure out a better written
solution - what about saying -

In most cases (as opposed to - in some cases) a bit more pro-active (but
what do I know).

And, I wish I could word-smith a better word for the "something" in the
same sentence.  

The flavor of what's being said, is GREAT!  Thanks Roberto!  And, I can
live with it the way Roberto has written it, too.
