I find this more agreeable.
Some thoughts:
1. It might help to explain that usability  is a broader concept ...of which accessibility is a part. 
  2. all usability recommendations - whose recommendations? ... needs a reference I think. The guideline is like a standard so we need to be specific.
  3. Consider changing the last part to "those aspects of usability that increase accessibility to people with disabilities".
  4. The Introduction to WCAG 1.0 listed the categories likely to be benefited very eloquently.... not just PWD. 
  Can this also be incorporated here?

  To address Roberto's comment, does anyone disagree with replacing the scope 
  of WCAG 2.0 [1] with:
    "These guidelines cover a wide range of issues and recommendations for 
  making Web content more accessible. They include recommendations to make 
  pages accessible and usable by people with a full range of 
  disabilities.  In some cases something that makes Web content more 'usable' 
  by one person makes it 'accessible' to another.  The guidelines do not 
  attempt to address all usability recommendations, but  instead focus on 
  those aspects of usability that increase accessibility."
