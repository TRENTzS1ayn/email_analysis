In today's techniques teleconference we discussed the structure of Gateway
Techniques and how they relate to the rest of the technology-specific
techniques. The problems and benefits of particular approaches related to
specific use cases, or goals people have from the techniques and ways people
achieve those goals in our documents. It seemed that we did not have a
complete of use cases on the table, which we need to complete this
discussion. Everyone on the call agreed to come up with possible use cases
during this week, and email them to the list so we can review them. We will
continue the discussion in the face to face meeting next week.

So people on the list know what's going on when these messages appear we
thought it best to explain what we're doing. If members of the list who
weren't on the call would like to contribute use cases, that would be
welcomed as well. I suggest all use case proposals be posted as a reply to
this message so we can keep the thread toegher. I will also ask the IG list
for thoughts.
