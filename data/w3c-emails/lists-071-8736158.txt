Michael,

To be certain that I understand what's wanted-- please clarify what's
meant by "use cases" here: do you meanthings for which tables might be
used, e.g., "A bus schedule is presented with intersections listed
across row 1 and timepoints shown in the columns below"?

Thanks.
John

Subject: [techs] Use cases for techniques



In today's techniques teleconference we discussed the structure of
Gateway Techniques and how they relate to the rest of the
technology-specific techniques. The problems and benefits of particular
approaches related to specific use cases, or goals people have from the
techniques and ways people achieve those goals in our documents. It
seemed that we did not have a complete of use cases on the table, which
we need to complete this discussion. Everyone on the call agreed to come
up with possible use cases during this week, and email them to the list
so we can review them. We will continue the discussion in the face to
face meeting next week.

So people on the list know what's going on when these messages appear we
thought it best to explain what we're doing. If members of the list who
weren't on the call would like to contribute use cases, that would be
welcomed as well. I suggest all use case proposals be posted as a reply
to this message so we can keep the thread toegher. I will also ask the
IG list for thoughts.
