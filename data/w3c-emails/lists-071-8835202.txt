Those color combinations are accessibility issues.

A person that is red/green color difficent can not read them.

A person that is red color difficent can not read red against black.  It
all becomes black.

So, yes, they are accessibility issues.

A good start. But what are the RGB values, or range of RGB values, for
these colors?

Here are some examples of text using these colors:

http://www.aprompt.ca/greenred.gif
http://www.aprompt.ca/redblack.gif
http://www.aprompt.ca/blackred.gif

They might not appeal to your artistic sensibility but are they an
accessibility problem?
