Hello,
While trying to think about the used case scenario, I was browsing through WCAG 2 and the Gateway doc and again the same thought came up:
What is in the Gateway doc is    a lucid explanation  of every checkpoint. For instance if I do not understand what is meant by  checkpoint 1.3 that reads, "Both [information/substance] and structure are separable from presentation.", I would turn to the explanation in the Gateway doc. This piece of explanation or those following any other checkpoint in the   Gateway doc does not state any specific technique for accomplishing the checkpoints. These will be in the technology-specific docs. So I do not really understand why the content   following every checkpoint contained in the Gateway doc cannot be in the main WCAG 2 doc.  
I brought this up yesterday during the tel-conference  and it was explained to me that WCAG 2.0 is a normative doc  while the gateway is not.
 The WCAG 2 contains definitions, benefits and examples (all non-normative) for each checkpoint so why not the explanation for every checkpoint?  I think the WCAG 2 is the  best place for these  explanatory paragraphs.
A user does not have to link to another doc and read that. If he/she does not want the explanation he can just skip it and jump to the success criteria or whatever. It will save a lot of   time and effort in writing and vetting up all other sections necessary(abstract, status of doc, TOC, etc) to make the doc complete.
Well, the required success criteria can be  taken up in the  Gateway doc grouped by checkpoint but without the  present explanatory content. The techniques can be linked for every  success criteria.
