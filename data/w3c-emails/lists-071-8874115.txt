Hi All

I've got a new version of the unofficial "WCAG theme song" mp3 posted for
download at http://davidmacd.com/web_pages/wcag_theme.htm 

On this version I'm joined by "Sharky" the ScreenReader who does a rap.  He
also learns how to dance.

Here are the lyrics:

It's Fun to Write the WCAG
By David MacDonald 

Intro by Sharky the ScreenReader:

" Oops sorry I didn't realize we were rolling. I was just brushing my teeth
for a cool night on the town.  Hey everybody, WCAG is writing some new
guidelines so get on the dance floor. I'm not a very good dancer, I've got
no rhythm, but hey, I'm a rocking robot, Cool. want to dance?"

we're gonna to write a new specification
it's gonna work with the tool of verification
make it accessible
gonna make it testable
WCAG for you and me
 
we're gonna make the web understandable
make it perceivable write it tangible
make it interoperable
you know that we're unstoppable
WCAG is the place to be
 
Chorus (to the tune of YMCA)
it's fun to write the WCAG
it's fun to write the WCAG
gonna make the internet a better place
for every ability and every race

Sharky talks: "Hey man I'm going crazy with this cool beat. Hey, I am
dancing really good now. ...Want to dance?
 
if you come from Seattle you call it WICAG
if you come from Alabama you call it WUKAG
I say WICAG, you say WUKAG
but you know we're not just another TAG
 
there's Ben from Trace and Professor Vanderheiden
looking at the future beyond the horizon
Wendy, Andi, Cynthia and Jason White
staying up working till the middle of the night
 
Chorus
It's fun to write the WCAG
It's fun to write the WCAG
Gonna make the internet a better place
Even if your surfing from outer space

Sharky talks: I got carried away cause these WCSAG techno geeks really know
how to party. Par-tay. Let's do it again I don't get out much."  

Bridge (Rap)
We've got Wendy, Katie, Avi, Harvey, Lee, Andi, Judy, Marti, Loretta, Alan,
Donovan , Hoehrmann, Ian, Jonathan, William, Graham, Sean , Adam,
Kynn,Gian,Lisa, Eugenia, Marja-Riitta, Cynthia, Mark, Matt Bruce, Dick,
David, Joe, Nir, Geoff, Chuck, Leonard, Scott, Charles, Robert, , Paul,
Anne, Joel , John, Jason, Daniel Emmanuelle, Ben, Bengt, Tim, Jim, and
dozens more,

Chorus
It's fun to write the WCAG
It's fun to write the WCAG
Gonna make the internet a better place
Even if your surfing from outer space
 
it's fun to write the WCAG
it's fun to write the WCAG
gonna make the internet a better place
for every ability and every race

Sharky: Hey man, these WCAG guys are real cool dancers for nerds. David I've
been writing some poetry lately, cause I'm a sensitve artistic type guy,
want to hear it?

David: No Sharky, Wendy and Gregg are calling us, it's time to get back to
work. 

Sharky rattles off the lyrics then says: Sorry Man, I got carried away
'cause these WCAG tachno geeks really no how to party, Let's do it again, I
don't get out much!
