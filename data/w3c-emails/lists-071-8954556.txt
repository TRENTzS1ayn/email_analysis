An approach taken in the Voice Browser specifications to reduce this burden
is to allow a pronunciation lexicon in a separate resource.  Each
normally-mispronounced term can be listed once in the lexicon with its
correct pronunciation.  The formats containing text of prompts and "phrases
to catch when the user speaks them" allow reference to an external lexicon,
although there is not yet a W3C format for that lexicon.

PF is working with the Voice Browser group to help move the development of a
lexicon format specification along.

The point Yvette is making has also been raised emphatically in our group 
by others.

If these English words are not in the Dutch dictionary, however, people
needing help understanding the terms are at risk of being left in the lurch.
  Ideally the language information could be in a glossary or other lexicon as
well, avoiding the need to add tags to every use of these terms.

We could link to an external lexicon with the html:link element IF we get
the assistive technology and voice browser users of speech technology to
agree on some basic processing rules as to how the lexicon is applied, and
that the lexicon should be applied.

The ability to refer to a lexicon is already avail
