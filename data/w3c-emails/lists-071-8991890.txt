My notes for tomorrow's WCAG f2f extravaganza are up:

<http://joeclark.org/f2f/?GL>

You'll want to read the recommendations first. The deficiencies 
document is more of the same, really.

<http://joeclark.org/f2f/recommendations.html?GL>
<http://joeclark.org/f2f/deficiencies.html?GL>

I concentrated on two areas of expertise: Multimedia and colour. I 
have workable recommendations. Only a few *examples* are given 
because that is a hefty writing task that does not need urgent 
completion, but I'll be able to back everything up in the meeting.

I also seem to have the largest available list of 
stylesheet-switchers. That could come in handy later.
