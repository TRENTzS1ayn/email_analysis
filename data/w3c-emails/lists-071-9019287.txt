Likely approaches to use  Gateway and Techniques doc for WCAG 2.0
1. Developers wanting to implement WCAG 2.0 or those testing for compliance
In all likelihood they will consider core checkpoints first and then regard extended checkpoints 

They should be able to conveniently identify Gateway and Techniques doc  content relating to core checkpoints and extended checkpoints 
2. Developers /  managers debating on  development methodologies  might want to check out techniques offered by one technology versus another technology for complying with   specific required success criteria / checkpoint 
3. An individual who   has decided to follow a particular technology path will want to focus on the specific techniques suggested for various checkpoints in the relevant technology doc and not concern himself with other technology docs.
4. Those considering   switching from one technology to another 
5. Those who are pursuing WCAG 1.0 and are now checking how WCAG 2 will affect them. They mmight use the checkpoint matching document, WCAG 1 and WCAG 2 for  comparison 

Any of the above users will want to navigate from the WCAG doc or the techniques doc to the explanatory  content for a checkpoint   to gain a clearer understanding of the issues involved.

6.   Those concerned mainly with policy level issues will not delve into specific technologies. They will  keep switching back and forth between the checkpoint and details in the WCAG doc and the explanation in the Gateway doc. 
Example:
- Individuals responsible for framing Web access standards / policies for their organization / state  
- researchers
- for preparing edu and outreach related  presentations

  Sorry I wasn't clear. I mean ways people will go through the techniques
  documents, the kind of information they're looking for. A person creating a
  bus schedule will need to know about tabular markup (probably in the Gateway
  Techniques) and the specific HTML codes to use or avoid (in the HTML
  Techniques). There are different possible ways they may look for this
  information, and we need to make it easy for them to find it regardless of
  the route they take. I provided a little more explanation in my post to the
  IG list [the archive seems to be down so no URL]. Michael
