Reorganization proposals:

There are currently three proposals on offer.

1. The latest Review draft of WCAG 2.0:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2003/07/review_draft.html

2. An initial reorganization proposal, prepared in response to
   teleconference discussions:

3. A third proposal, due to the joint efforts of Wendy, Cynthia and
   Kerstin:
See the documents cited at
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2003JulSep/0500.html
   and the explanations in that message.

Some questions to consider in preparation for the meeting:

1. What problems are the reorganization proposals intended to solve?

2. What are the differences of approach, priority and perception that
   are reflected in these proposals? Can they be reconciled? How can
   we clarify the trade-offs involved in each alternative?

3. Which, if any, of the proposals do you favour? Why?
