MessageJohn, Gregg and All -

I too, think musical performance is a good idea as opposed to musical
composition.  I like Gregg's idea of one checkpoint and proposed
wording.  Nice job - thanks.

  Very nice John,



  I would suggest "musical performance" instead of "musical composition"



  And I would like to see it stay as one checkpoint.   Something like



  1.1          For non-text content, text equivalents are provided that
serve the same purpose or provide the same information as the non-text
content, except when the purpose of the non-text content is to create a
specific sensory experience (for example, musical performances, visual
art) in which case a text label and description are sufficient.



  Details about context etc can be put into the success critieria.



  Gregg

  Importance: High



  At last week's telecon, I took an action item to try re-wording
checkpoint 1.1 in order to address objections (my own and others') to
the language about the ability to be expressed in words, and to
incorporate ideas that came up during the telecon.  Here's what I've
come up with.  I apologize for not getting this out sooner.

  ==Proposal begins==

  Current wording
  1.1 [CORE] All non-text content that can be expressed in words has a
text equivalent of the function or information that the non-text content
was intended to convey. [was 1.1]
  Proposed wording
  1.1          For non-text content, text equivalents are provided that
serve the same purpose or provide the same information as the non-text
content, except when the purpose of the non-text content is to create a
specific sensory experience (for example, musical compositions, visual
art).

  1.2          Non-text content whose primary purpose is to create a
specific sensory experience (such as musical compositions and visual
art) is identified by text labels and accompanied by text descriptions
as required by the context in which the non-text content is presented.

  Discussion
  This proposal breaks Checkpoint 1.1 [CORE] into two separate but
closely related checkpoints.  Each addresses a different type of
non-text content.  Would require renumbering existing checkpoints 1.2
and following.



  The proposed Checkpoint 1.1 replaces the phrase "can be expressed in
words" with a different test: the requirement for a text equivalent does
not apply if the purpose of the non-text content is to create a specific
sensory experience.



  The change is designed to eliminate a phrase to which many people
raised serious objections while preserving the idea that different types
or different uses of non-text content call for different types of text
alternatives.  This consideration also prompts the decision to break the
existing checkpoint into two.



  The question whether a particular set of ideas or experiences, etc.,
"can be expressed in words" is at best difficult to answer and utterly
impossible to test.  It is much easier (for content authors, developers,
evaluators, and users) to figure out whether a particular media
presentation was designed primarily to create a specific sensory
experience, as music and painting are.  This proposed change gets us out
of the business of deciding what is truly ineffable and back to problems
of design and implementation.





  The proposed Checkpoint 1.2 addresses non-text content such as music
or visual art whose purpose is to create a specific sensory experience.
It calls for text labels and descriptions (not equivalents such as
tone-poems, word-paintings, etc., etc.) as warranted by context.  The
proviso about context is messy, because what the context requires is a
judgment call.  But it's also unavoidable, and it is human testable.  It
is also possible to provide substantive guidance, either in Gateway
Techniques or in EO documents or both, as well as examples in the WCAG
2.0 document itself.
