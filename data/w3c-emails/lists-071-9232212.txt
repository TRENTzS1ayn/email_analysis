Some references about color deficiency, color blindness, etc.
 
1. Aries Arditi, "Making Text Legible":
http://www.lighthouse.org/print_leg.htm
2. Aries Arditi, "Simple Steps to More Readable Type through Universal
Graphic Design":
http://www.lighthouse.org/bigtype/universal_graphic_design.htm
3. Catherine Rigdon, Safe Web Colours for colour-deficient vision:
http://more.btexact.com/people/rigdence/colours/
 
And a very different kind of reference:
 
Oliver Sacks, _Island of the Colour Blind_.  Sacks, a neurophysiologist
and a superb writer, describes a trip to a Micronesian island with a
very large population of achromatopes.  Sacks has written a number of
things about visual and cognitive deficiencies, all fascinating.  He's
best known for Awakenings (1969), which describes his discovery of
l-dopa as a treatment for Parkinson's while working with patients who
had suffered post-encephalitic Parkinson's after the encephalitis
epidemic of 1918.  Other outstanding books by Sacks that may be relevant
to our deliberations are _The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat_ and
_An Anthropologist from Mars_.
 
Happy reading.
