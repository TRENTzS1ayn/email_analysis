Hi,
following the yesterday discussion and also reading some of the last
post i'm thinking what will happend when we will give out the WCAG 2.0
for the local countries normatives.

As all we have discussed also in the Venice F2F that we have hosted as
IWA/HWG, the "CORE" must be the "start point" for the countries and all
the points must be "testable" (machine and/or human testable).

With the EU Parliament Resolution (2002)0325 [1].
In this document is cleary shown that the WCAG are recognized as
"standard de facto" and  calls on the EU institutions and the Member
States to comply with the authoring tools accessibility guidelines
(ATAG) 1.0 by 2003.

Analizing this document we found interesting these point:

"4. Considers that translations authorised by the W3C should be made
available in the languages of all Member States as soon as possible
(coordinated by W3C, possibly with the help of the translation services
of the EU and experts from different Member States);"

For this, we have offer support as IWA/HWG with the webaccessibile.org
project for italian localization and I can involve our international
staff for localization in local language for have the "official
translation" but a question must be done: who ufficialize the
translation? Remember that all normative documents are only in english,
as defined in every W3C document.

Returning to WCAG Working Group competence, point 31 of this document is
important for our future work:

"Stresses the fact that, for websites to be accessible, it is essential
that they are double-A compliant, that priority 2 of the WAI guidelines
must be fully implemented;"

What will append in all the Europe if we define a CORE version of WCAG
2.0 that is a lot different by Level 2 of WCAG 1.0?

I know that some also in this list said: Europe don't make laws but
suggestion to member states... but member states create laws with the
suggestion/directives of Europe....
