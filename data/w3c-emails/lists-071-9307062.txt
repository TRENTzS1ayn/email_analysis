Those are the same thing. Dichromatism and daltonism are other terms.

Or achromats. Since, according to Joel Pokorny, "the prevalence of
achromatopsia is reported to be 0.003% (Waardenburg, P. J. Achromatopsia
congenita. In Genetics and Ophthalmology. P. J. Waardenburg, A.
Franceschetti and D. Klein. Assen, Royal van Gorcum: 1695-1718, 1963),"
WCAG 2.0 doesn't need guidelines for this group. Still, the spectre of
achromatopsia errantly haunts WCAG 1.0 and influences nonexperts in the
development of 2.0.
