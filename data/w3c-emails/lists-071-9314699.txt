Someone asked if a video showing sign language had to be captioned.

It is more interesting than it first looks.

My thoughts were as follows....

ASL is the most widely used Western language with no written form (besides
"SignWriting" - a non-text transcription technique that is not widely
accepted in the ASL community).

Captions would therefore  actually be subtitles

Rationale

Captioning is the process of putting a text version of the audio in the same
language as the audio (with descriptions of sounds intermixed).

Subtitling is the presentation of text in another language under a video
program.


If you have a program that has people signing ASL-- but no spoken audio, it
is not possible to caption it -- since there is no text version of American
Sign Language.   English subtitles would not be captions but subtitles since
English is a different language from ASL.  

One could require "signwriting" perhaps -- but it is not clear how
understandable that is for people who don't know sign language syntax and
grammar.

Below are some sentences that a deaf signer translated into sign language
for me.   (Actually translated into the closest English word description of
the signs).  Not the different way the signs are used and the different
syntax and grammar.   They aren't perfect but they are good at showing that
ASL and English are quite different in rule, presentation and vocabulary.

Other's thoughts?
