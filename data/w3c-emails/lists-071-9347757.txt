Transcripts shouldn't be *required*.

When you say "basically," how many Line 21 or WST caption files have you
attempted to convert to a manner of presentation *and markup* that would
make them intelligible as transcripts?

(The converse is actually also true: If you start out with a transcript
presented and marked up for reading as a printed or onscreen document, how
to you convert it to captions? Cf.
<http://joeclark.org/book/sashay/serialization/Chapter13.html#h3-1685>.)

Why are the terms "transcript" and "audio description" even appearing in
the same sentence? Transcripts of descriptions are a non-starter.
Descriptions must be *synchronized* with the video.

Explain what that means, other than "Authors must code a system to let
visitors arbitrarily and randomly recode their HTML." Oh, and it's gotta
still meet the guidelines afer being recoded, right?

For heaven's sake, colourblindness and colour deficiency ARE THE SAME
THING.

*Only* achromats (0.003% of the population) see in greyscale. *Nobody*
else does. The above *perpetuates* the Working Group's entrenched
misunderstanding of colour deficiency, which I have attempted to remedy
*at length* in writing *and* face-to-face.

Please, Working Group, GET A GRIP. How many times must you be corrected on
a falsehood before you finally quit reiterating the falsehood?
