Hello All,
Having arrived on the scene  only recently, I began by reviewing the Requirements Doc for WCAG 2 at
http://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2-req/.
I  wonder if there are others on the list  who also think there is a need tostrengthen WCAG 2  in line with three specific goals, namely:  
Goal 2. Ensure that the conformance requirements are clear
Goal 3. Ensure that the deliverables are easy to use
Goal 6. Ensure that the revision is "backwards compatible 
Thanks,
