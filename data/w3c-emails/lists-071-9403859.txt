Hello,

1. I believe the words Priority 1, 2 and 3 with their definitions conveyed  that the focus of the checkpoints was on successively increasing levels of   accessibility ... vital -essential-desirable for accessibility, in a way better than that conveyed by the  terms coreand extended. Admittedly, there   are different perspectives on the priority levels assigned to some checkpoints in WCAG1. But a P3 checkpoint  enhances accessibility and therefore usability and shows the way ahead as is intended for "best practices".  So why not  stick with the terms P1, P2 and P3... it will also be   "backward compatible"... Goal 6 for WCAG2 in requirements doc. The required success criteria should be  categorized as  P1 or P2 or P3.

2. The best practices (as presently documented)  should be put in a separate document distinct from techniques.It can be linked to the techniques doc. What is "best" may be very situational   and might depend on the circumstances : the technology used for creating the Web content, user agent, as well as access technology used by end user, the intended audience for a particular website,  etc.
