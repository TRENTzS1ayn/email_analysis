I have to agree with Sailesh to some extent, when I first looked at the
WCAG 2.0 draft I was a little taken aback. Although I will admit the
mapping document does go some of the way to easing comparison between
the two versions. People using and conforming to version one might be
surprised.

However what has struck me as something that we should perhaps aim at is
presenting a guideline which is future proofed. It is 4 years since the
original guideline was published and there is still work to do on the
current, this means that WCAG 1.0 will, by the time it is replaced, have
had a lifetime of 5 years or more. Personally I regard the Priority 3
guidelines as eminently achievable for the most part with today's
browsers and today's multimedia. As such should we not look to adding an
amount of future proofing to WCAG 2.0 since it too has to last 5 years
are we sure it will remain relevant?
