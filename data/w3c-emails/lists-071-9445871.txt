"Core" is also used in the ISO TS/16071 [1] where the two level like AA
and AAA has defined as "primary" and "secondary".

In one of my last post [2] I've focalized the idea that we need to have
a "solid" core that must be similar to the Level 2 of WCAG 1.0 for not
stop the e-europe project that request AA for guidelines.

This is the way, IMHO...
