I am dyslexic (although possibly not with an average reading level) and
I have no problems with this what so ever. I would suggest that it
actually fits in with the way that I tend to read anyway. Rather than
reading large words my brain tends to extrapolate from context, I
imagine everyone is perfectly capable of this they just never do until
it becomes the most efficient method.

It is interesting.

Dan brickley wrote a bit of ruby code to do something like this to
whatever
text you feed it.

might be interesting to use it in conjunction with UBAccess' tools for
presenting text. There seem to be different ways of mixing things that
cause
more or less problems, and they seem to mirror the way that some people
perceive plain text anyway.

(I think that my problems in typing the letters in order are different
again...)

cheers
