Interesting *how* garbled words are processed.

If we talk about the "brian" as opposed to the "biran"
the word takes more time to process largly because of the
possible ambiguity with the intended word "brain".

We process information rapidly at many levels:

o phonemes [sounds]
o words [units with meaning]
o syntax [structure]
o narrative [pragmatics, semantics and psycho-social inputs]

Chomsky's universal grammar would have us believe that it is the 
our innate knoweledge of how language "hangs together" that allows
us to process what is "supposed" to be present.

Coincidentally the eye does some rather similar cunning filling-in-of-
the-blanks in the field of visual perception.

Gordon.

I am dyslexic (although possibly not with an average reading level) and
I have no problems with this what so ever. I would suggest that it
actually fits in with the way that I tend to read anyway. Rather than
reading large words my brain tends to extrapolate from context, I
imagine everyone is perfectly capable of this they just never do until
it becomes the most efficient method.

It is interesting.

Dan brickley wrote a bit of ruby code to do something like this to
whatever
text you feed it.

might be interesting to use it in conjunction with UBAccess' tools for
presenting text. There seem to be different ways of mixing things that
cause
more or less problems, and they seem to mirror the way that some people
perceive plain text anyway.

(I think that my problems in typing the letters in order are different
again...)

cheers
