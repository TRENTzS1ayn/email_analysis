Hi,

Finally got a chance to go over the recent drafts.  Just a point.

1.3[CORE]

Under Definitions for Checkpoint 1.3 there is this phrase; "Presentation is
the rendering of the content and structure in a form that can be sensed by
the user."

What is meant by "sensed"?  It's wording that is rather foreign to me.  It's
kind of "touchy feely".  I'm thinking "easily comprehended" rather than
sensed.

Yours truly,
Geoff Deering
