Would it be worth officially defining some of these terms in the
document at some point? As the use cases showed many people using this
document will want it clearly stated with no ambiguity. It is important
that we don't let our familiarity with the documents or the processes
and thinking that have gone into them stop us from seeing how non GL
users see the documents. 

Personally I think that "sensed" is fuzzy enough in this case, to make
it worth either defining at some point in the document, or re-terming.
Perhaps "Presentation is the rendering of the content and structure in a
form such that users are aware that it exists." would be a better way of
phrasing it.

Jeff, good question about "sensed" versus "easily comprehended."

All the checkpoints under guideline 1 are (or should be) aimed at making
it possible for users to actually *perceive* content-- that is, to be
aware that it exists.  It's a much lower level of abstraction than
understanding (which the checkpoints in Guideline 3 address).  The issue
of whether I understand a given resource is moot if I don't even know
it's there.

So the notion that content can be "sensed" isn't as fuzzy as it might
sound: in fact, sensing/perceiving is much more readily testable than
"understanding," which is as fuzzy and vast as the sky.  And as
important, of course.

Hope this helps!
John

Hi,

Finally got a chance to go over the recent drafts.  Just a point.

1.3[CORE]

Under Definitions for Checkpoint 1.3 there is this phrase; "Presentation
is the rendering of the content and structure in a form that can be
sensed by the user."

What is meant by "sensed"?  It's wording that is rather foreign to me.
It's kind of "touchy feely".  I'm thinking "easily comprehended" rather
than sensed.

Yours truly,
Geoff Deering
