2nd try

Jason White(Chair - WCAG WG),
Wendy Chisholm (Staff - WCAG WG)

we have identified that the WCAG WG might be an excellent candidate for 
a partial or total implementation of QA Operational Guidelines[1] (QA 
Ops GL). (CR version of the document will be published soon in one week 
or two. The preliminary version is available at 
http://www.w3.org/QA/WG/2003/09/qaframe-ops-20030905)

One of the criteria of success of the CR phase will be to gather the 
experience (preferably successful) on implementations of the QA 
Operational Guidelines.

By applying, we don't mean to say "comply" but only going thru the Ops 
checklist and report to the QAWG what they think they're already doing, 
what they expect to do in the future (and by when), and what they don't 
expect to do (with rationales).  It will not be necessary to implement 
everything (but better if all) but do what you can or what you think is 
valuable.

We would like by the end of the announced CR period, the 4th Technical 
Plenary in March 2004, to have at least 5 WGs having done this work and 
give us their feedback with their rationales.

The phase will be to
- give you the guidelines with a start kit.
- do not necessary help you apply the guidelines
- gather your comments and the results of your auto-evaluation (2/3 
months later)
- work together to modify the guidelines and/or either to help you 
implement them.

Would you like to participate in this work?
