This is a very good point Tom.

I think there is some cause to take the draft of this document and show it
to people who are not familiar with it, but are familiar enough with the
issues to revue it with a fresh perspective.  The document has to clearly
define the guidelines, but also be in a language that is common and easy for
all those involved in web development to understand.  It is important that
it is very clear and easy to understand for all.

Would it be worth officially defining some of these terms in the
document at some point? As the use cases showed many people using this
document will want it clearly stated with no ambiguity. It is important
that we don't let our familiarity with the documents or the processes
and thinking that have gone into them stop us from seeing how non GL
users see the documents.

Personally I think that "sensed" is fuzzy enough in this case, to make
it worth either defining at some point in the document, or re-terming.
Perhaps "Presentation is the rendering of the content and structure in a
form such that users are aware that it exists." would be a better way of
phrasing it.
