  "I think there is some cause to take the draft of this document and show it to people who are not familiar with it, but are familiar enough with the
  issues to revue it with a fresh perspective.  The document has to clearly
  define the guidelines, but also be in a language that is common and easy for
  all those involved in web development to understand.  It is important that
  it is very clear and easy to understand for all.

  Well I suppose the public comments  received on WCAG 2 will help. Also the Edu and Outreach Work Group has reviewed the June draft of WCAG 2 and sent in their comments.
