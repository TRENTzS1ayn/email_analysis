Subject: Penn State University Rolls Out Web Accessibility Program

Hello

As a person interested in web accessibility within the educational
market we wanted to share with you some examples of what Universities
and Colleges throughout the United States are doing. Many are rolling
out new internal policies and LIFT tools in order to aid the web
designers with compliance.

Penn State University Policy and tool use:

Policy:
Penn State University's Web Accessibility Policy and Guidelines were
established as a commitment to meeting the ethical and legal obligations
that the University has under The Americans with Disabilities Act of
1990 and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. Link to the Policy:
http://www.equity.psu.edu/access_psu/psu_accessibility.asp

Product Used: Site License of LIFT for Dreamweaver NN/g

Penn State's LIFT Pilot Program:
The Information Technology Services (ITS) of Penn State University
solicited the assistance of web developers, content managers, and web
coordinators from university departmental units to evaluate UsableNet's
LIFT for Macromedia Dreamweaver. The team consensus was positive, making
a critical accessibility tool for evaluating and repairing web pages
available to Penn State by a resulting licensing agreement. Link to more
about purchase: http://www.equity.psu.edu/access_psu/lift.asp

Generally we have found that many Universities are following a similar
path. For example, a small pilot group within an active web design
committee takes on the task of setting up a policy and reviewing
products that will aid their process. With many Universities going
through these steps, you have a chance to leverage the work they have
already done and benefit from content that exists to speed up your own
efforts.

Penn State University is just one of many excellent examples of how a
university has approached and implemented their accessibility program
using LIFT. If you would like us to help with your efforts or you would
like to obtain a demo of products being used to help just go to:
