I guess that is giving it enough exposure.  Can?t really do much more than

"I think there is some cause to take the draft of this document and show it
to people who are not familiar with it, but are familiar enough with the
issues to revue it with a fresh perspective.  The document has to clearly
define the guidelines, but also be in a language that is common and easy for
all those involved in web development to understand.  It is important that
it is very clear and easy to understand for all.

Well I suppose the public comments  received on WCAG 2 will help. Also the
Edu and Outreach Work Group has reviewed the June draft of WCAG 2 and sent
in their comments.
