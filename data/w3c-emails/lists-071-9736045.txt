I agree, because one problem might be 'ambitious' Web sites (providing
accessible and standard conformable content) being annulled by cooperation
partners delivering inaccessible (advert) code -- will they force their partners to
comply with W3C or especially WAI standards (and are they at all able to
enforce this)? Or won't they, because they either don't care of foreign code or
they don't even see the problem?

Maybe the only realistic opportunity to get rid of (inaccessible) adverts.

-- By the way, this topic is like a gray area because there are several
characteristics only matching in the advertising sector... not only are foreign
providers responsible for an almost sensible Web site section (related to
content 'above the fold'), but also there still is a discussion about online
advertising efficiency [1, 2]. And in general, is a 'common sense appeal' really
enough?


Best regards,
 Jens.
