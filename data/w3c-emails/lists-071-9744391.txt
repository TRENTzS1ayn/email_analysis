Hello Everyone,

Thanks for the replies so far. However I would like to make clear this
is more of a who's who for UK accessibility. It is not a company
directory. I merely wanted to make a nice list of everyone I could find
who uses accessibility in the UK and how they use it (ie work, research,
interest etc). 

Thanks,

Hello Everyone,

I am doing a little survey on people who work with accessibility in the
UK. I was also planning to publish a directory. If people from either
list are happy to reply to me with as much or as little information on
what they do and where they do it in the UK that would be great. Please
remember to say whether you want to be listed in any directory that is
published.

Thanks,
