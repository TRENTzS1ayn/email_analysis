I disagree with the suggestion. If the ad (which is content on the page)
doesn't conform, then the page doesn't conform.

If we write a conformance system that allows for variable conformance within
a page (this part conforms to extended, that part conforms to core, or to
"doesn't break the rest") then it would be fine.

I can't imagine that ads provided by a third party are different from any
other application provided by a third party, and don't think it makes sense
to allow a claim of conformance for something that doesn't conform. (I've
argued the detail before). It causes all kinds of problems, including one of
credibility.
