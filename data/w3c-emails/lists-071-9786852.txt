DISCUSSION

Discussion on the Techniques Gateway focused on what content belongs in this
document, and what belongs elsewhere. This was driven in part by a concern
that people would go straight to the techniques and miss the guidelines
altogether. We solve this problem to some extent by the design of the views
(the readable transformations of the XML source for the techniques) and need
to attend to that in the design of views. The explicit relationship of
techniques to Success Criteria is also part of this, so that needs to be
worked into the document. Regarding organization, we decided it probably
makes the most sense to organize the Techniques Gateway in the same way as
the guidlelines, even though other technology-specific documents may be
organized in different ways (e.g., in related groups like "forms" and
"tables"). The ability to view gateway techniques in the same "semantic" way
is then an issue but should be addressed by the explicit relationship of
technology-specific techniques to the gateway techniques.

We had a shorter talk about use cases. We like some of what has come out of
that work so far. We'd like to create a few additional personae to explore
questions of internationalization, but then we thought use case work should
focus on describing how people will use the techniques, independent of
particular personae we would assign. We also need to consolidate and
formalize them.



ACTION ITEMS

*Ben, Tom: coordinate with Loretta to implement the CKW reorganization
proposal part about moving stuff from Guidelines into Techniques Gateway
*Tom, Michael: think out and mock up some views
Editor: Rewrite techniques in "technique form" - checklist-item, examples,
etc.
*Tom, Roberto: work on international use cases
*Tom: coordinate with Wendy to find information on Japanese use cases
*Tom & Sailesh: consolidate use cases
*Michael: get on Thursday agenda to talk about Sailesh's concern about
people missing the guidelines, and about what goes into guidelines vs. what
goes in techniques
