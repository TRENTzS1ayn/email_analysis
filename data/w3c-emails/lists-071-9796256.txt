I use a number of browsers, and I'll often use my least favourite browser if
I can turn Flash ads off.  But sometimes I do want to follow an ad.  What is
really annoying is there seems to be no facility in Flash to facilitate
middle mouse button opening windows in the background (sorry Mac users), or
the normal right click to allow the user to open in another window, which in
some tabbed based browsers creates and action to just open it in another
background tab.  There seems no other option but to left click and have it
open in another window, which is not following the spirit of accessibility.

What is Macromedia doing to address this problem, if anything?
