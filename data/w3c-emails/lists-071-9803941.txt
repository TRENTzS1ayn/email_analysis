Also textual banner ads are not always good for the accessibility.
This is the reply that I've received by Google regarding the possibility
to resize the text:

"Thank you for your email.

Currently we do not offer the option of changing the font sizes of the
ads. However, we appreciate your taking the time to offer us this
feedback
regarding our ads and encourage you to continue to let us know how we
can
improve Google AdSense. As AdSense is still a young program, new
features
are under consideration and your feedback is very helpful.

Sincerely,

The Google Team"

These are the "standards" for the banner ADS:

So, IMHO, we need to refer to this and suggest accessibility guidelines
for these...
