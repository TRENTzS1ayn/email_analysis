Could you or anyone else please send me any links to the standards for
browser plugin APIs so I can see this for myself.

I am also interested to find detailed documentation on the standards
browsers are based on (maybe I should be asking this on the WAI-UA list.
Why I ask this is because I am working on the document for promoting server
side accessibility techniques, and I remember way back in the mid 90's
reading that if redirects were implemented properly using "permanent" then
the browser was meant to update bookmarks with the new URL.  I know no one
even did, but I need this documentation to really track how browsers are
going addressing these issues and the general state of this area.

I believe that Macromedia (and Adobe, who have a similar problem with SVG)
are waiting for browser manufacturers to improve the plugin API so they can
do this. The problem is that there is no standard way of plugging
browser-type objects together. There was some effort to address this at W3C
through the component extension taskforce. The principle is that "plugins"
should be able to have other plugins. This is particularly valuable as an
approach for accessibility - rather than the model in IE where you specify
the plugin to handle some media object, you could specify the type of media
objecct and people coul use the plugin they prefer - you could have an HTML
plugin running inside flash, with a mathML plugin running inside that, if
that was how the content appeared.

In the meantime people occasionally implement the functionality within flash
or SVG but it is still the same as the mess at the browser level.

And on a Mac almost every browser is tabbed, and you can plugin and use a
three-button mouse (under X you can actually copy and paste with the mouse
alone using left and midle buttons). Otherwise alt-click (for middle) or
ctrl-click (for right) are the normal method.
