The requirements for a sensible replacement, as developed by a task force
including many manufacturers, me when I worked for WAI, and various others,
are at http://www.w3.org/TR/CX

There aren't "standards" - the closest thing is the Netscape plugin API which
is known to be limited. There will be more documentation available at
Mozilla.org on how they do it now, and there may be information for each
operating system (Apple OS X seems to have a fairly standard system).

IE introduced some features with the object element in HTML 4, such as
"codebase" which is a reference to the code that has to be run for a
particular object (i.e. the plugin identity) - if you find examples of the
object element on their site you will probably see what it looks like, or you
can read the definition in the HTML specification:
http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/objects.html#edef-OBJECT (this approach
was explicitly rejected, in part because for accessibility one needs the
possiblity to use a different plugin for a given type of content).
