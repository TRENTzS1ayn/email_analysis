Hi Charles,

    There was a long discussion at the meeting (60 min) on this and the
group conclusion was that ads differed from other content on the page for a
number of reasons.

1 - you pay for other content and can choose it.  With Ads, they pay you and
you usually subscribe to a service.  You don't control the ads, nor do you
know what they will be like.   

2 - if you can't find a service that has an accessible form of something,
you can skip that feature on your site.   You can't skip the ads if that is
what is paying for your sites existence.  

3 - there are often accessible forms of most things.   There are only
limited Ad services.   If a lucrative one existed that had only accessible
ads...  then that would be great. But doesn't seem to be the case.  If none
exists, the sites only options are to post accessible ads or shut down site.
(or, of course, ignore any accessibility). 

4 - People coming to the site are coming for the content there.  Not the
ads.  If the ads are not accessible (but do not block access to the
information on the site), then the individuals did not miss anything that
they came for.   [ Note that this exception on ads did not apply to ads that
the site had control of.  For example, ads for that companies own products.]

5 - if the people are interested in the Ads, they could go to the ad site.
The ads would continue to have to meet the requirements of WCAG to be
considered accessible.  But he site could be accessible if the third party
ads were not.....   as long as the ads did not block access to the site
content. 


I think I captured most of the content of the working group discussion.  If
I missed a point - someone please let me know, or post a correction.




Gregg

I disagree with the suggestion. If the ad (which is content on the page)
doesn't conform, then the page doesn't conform.

If we write a conformance system that allows for variable conformance within
a page (this part conforms to extended, that part conforms to core, or to
"doesn't break the rest") then it would be fine.

I can't imagine that ads provided by a third party are different from any
other application provided by a third party, and don't think it makes sense
to allow a claim of conformance for something that doesn't conform. (I've
argued the detail before). It causes all kinds of problems, including one of
credibility.

cheers
