Normally I'd agree to this point of view (because it's only consequent), but
in this case I think the considered way is best. First of all -- will
someone pass on integrating (thus using) ads if they are inaccessible? I don't
think so, because online advertising is still a uncontrollable (often in relation
to delivered source and content) must (despite its humble efficiency).

So, if this topic is being handled carefully (e.g. by treating adverts as an
exception), not only ad providers will possibly improve their source (code)
while a growing awareness of Accessibility importance offers an incentive to
measure up to this level -- and this will maybe rather succeed than trying to
force external content or ad partners to deliver valid and/or accessible
source.


All the best,
 Jens.
