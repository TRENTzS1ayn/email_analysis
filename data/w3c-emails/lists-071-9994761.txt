Ah 

One additional point -

 

Although we do not set policy,  there was a strong sentiment that we should
design our guidelines keeping in mind the constraints of those that do.  The
goal would be to create something that could be adopted without extensive
editing or opting in and out.   The industry representatives in particular
were concerned that if we didn't, they could face different versions adopted
into regulation by different countries, states, etc making it much more
complicated for them. (or impossible - if they actually edited them in
conflicting ways).
