My action item to look at Guideline 1.3 through the documents
 

Summary


Level 1 Success Criteria for Guideline 1.3 seems well supported by HTML
techniques document. Beyond that I did not find clear techniques to the
level two success criteria a Information presented using color is also
available without color and without having to interpret markup . 

I found gateway techniques had less details on what tasks needed to be
completed, then the success criteria had itself 


CSS techniques document did not directly address this guideline,
although , of course, there was a lot of implied and defacto useful help
for this checkpoint.

 
 

All the best
