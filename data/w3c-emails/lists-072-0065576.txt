1) We definitely need to define these terms if we are going to use them

2) note that "data model" and "markup"  are programmatically determinable -
but "context" usually is not.     Even "data  model' and 'markup' are not
however unless they are done in a standard way known to the 'program' that
is 'programmatically determining'.   Thus the techniques or rather the
checklist is needed to determine if this item has been met I think.

Thanks, Jason.

I've just been looking at 1.3 after reading Lisa's message, and it
occurs to me that the language there may be useful with respect to issue
#330 and difficult phrases like "programmatically located" and
"programmatically identified."  Would it work to say "... Available
through context, markup, or a data model"?

Or perhaps we should go in the other direction first: we need
plain-language equivalents for "programmatically identified" and
"programmatically located."  Everything I've tried ends up sounding like
either a use case or an aspect of user agent functionality; I'm having
trouble getting at what the content provider should do.

One of the main reasons for using expressions such as "programmatically
identified" and "programmatically located" was to cover the case where
the content is not written in a markup language, but is provided in
another format that allows structural distinctions to be preserved.
Examples include XML information sets, API's, and data structures such
as the structure trees used in tagged PDF.

If we want these to be included, we need to say something more precise
than "context", and something more general than "markup".

Suggestions?
