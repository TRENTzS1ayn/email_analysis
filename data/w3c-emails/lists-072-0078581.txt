Perhaps the existing definitions need some tweaking.  From the glossary in 
the 11 March 2004 draft:

programmatically located

Programmatically located means that the meaning can be found, though there 
may be multiple meanings for a word.

Editorial Note: This provision is dependent on the definition of a standard 
way to associate dictionaries and the availability of on-line dictionaries.

programmatically determined

Programmatically determined means that the specific meaning can be determined.

It would be helpful to have real-world examples implemented in a variety of 
technologies that demonstrate these ideas.  We could then generalize the 
examples and include them in the informative section of the guidelines then 
build upon them in techniques.
