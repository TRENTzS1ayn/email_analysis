Hi Folks,

In the most recent draft of the Gateway to Techniques  
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-TECHS-GATEWAY-20040420.html>, a  
proposal has managed to prematurely slip itself in. Technique 2.4.2 "Bread  
Crumbs"  
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-TECHS-GATEWAY-20040420.html#breadcrumbs>  
looks at the common navigation aid formally called 'Path Navigation'. As  
soon as this proposal is fully completed it will be submitted to the list.  
The version in the techniques is a draft, although any comments are always  
welcome please treat it as such.

Thanks,
