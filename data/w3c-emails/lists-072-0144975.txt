Agenda for this week

1. Action items  

2. Conformance 

    - Do all items at all 3 levels needed to be testable?  [1]
 
    - Do we want to have advisory items that are not testable in the
guidelines doc?

    - Working definition of the criteria for placing items in each of the
three levels [2] 

    - consensus about whether or not all of the 3rd group 
      need to be met to claim 3rd category of conformance?  

   - what do we want to call the 3 levels of conformance 
         - should we coord w/EO
         - is the naming more of a marketing than technical issue?)

3.  open issues,  
-  Color - Issue 317
          <http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=317>

[1]  Current Proposal
Success criteria for all levels would be testable.   Some success criteria
may be machine-testable. Others may require human judgment.  Success
criteria that require human testing would, in the judgment of the working
group members, yield consistent results among multiple knowledgeable
testers.   
 

[2]  Latest proposal - based on John's submission and working group
discussion - but does not yet reflect our decisions regarding scope - so
will need discussion and editing. 

LEVEL 1 SUCCESS CRITERIA
 
    1. Do not set limits on content or presentation;
 
    2. Achieve a minimum level of accessibility through markup,
        scripting, or other technologies that interact with user agents,
        including assistive technologies;

    3. The working group felt could be reasonably be applied to all Web 
         resources;


LEVEL 2 SUCCESS CRITERIA

   1. Build on Level 1;
 
   2. Increase accessibility both though additional facilitation of user
agent based        
       accessibility and through content and/or presentation that provides
direct 
       accessibility without requiring intervention by user agents or
assistive technology;     
 
   3. The working group felt could be reasonably be applied to all Web
resources;

 
LEVEL 3 SUCCESS CRITERIA

1. Go beyond Level 1 and 2 to increase direct and user agent enhanced
accessibility
