Seems to be two basic requirements. The first is that the structure of the
document represent distinctions in its markup (rather than them being
expressed through dire"ctly applied colour, although the defaqult
presentation may very well use colour as the visual indicator).

The second is that the default visual presentation provide some clue beyond,
or other than, colour, to distinguish things.

This is one thing for code, where one might use CSS classes or key off
attributes or elements such as ins and del, but it will be more difficult for
authors using images in formats that don't allow for CSS-type styling, since
it will involve forcing changes to some images. (This is relevant to the
current proposal for conformance levels. I still think that proposal is
flawed, and more importantly premature in the development of WCAG 2, but it
seems worth noting).
