I think this was originally something like

1. Do not set limits on default presentation and contents;
That is, what the author expects to be presented to the majority of people
who view their content. 

But it still isn't clear whether we need this one or not.  Some are much in
favor of it but I wonder if it is covered by #2 or not.   It is sort of --
but not specifically......

This makes sense to me, but given that I am still guessing at what the
actual
requirements will be I am not certain yet how to apply priorities...
