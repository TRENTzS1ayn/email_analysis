1. That is the issue I have been raising on the list and in last week's call : the main distinction between level 1 and 2 is freedom of content presentation. At least this was the assumption till the March 11 draft. This was the basis for categorizing criteria as level 1 and 2. Now the   words:
"    2. Achieve a minimum level of accessibility through markup,...", require us to reconsider the classification. 
And should we throw  the concept of "freedom of content     presentation" out of the window? Ref: mails from John and Charles.
2. And is use of mark-up etc the only way of providing "minimum accessibility"? Consider a link to an audio presentation. The author might  present the text transcript on the same page itself. This I suppose  is "direct accessibility without requiring intervention by user agents or assistive technology", and  is hence a level 2 resolution of the problem. So complying with a level 2 criterion can also ensure minimum accessibility- a feature of level  1 at present. In other words minimum accessibility can be provided by a level 1 or 2 criteria, right?   
Using a title attribute on an image is  markup and when used along with alt enhances accessibility. It depends on user agent and AT. So it is a level 1 criteria that is  doing the  enhancement. Right?
Looks like we  still have some way to go!
