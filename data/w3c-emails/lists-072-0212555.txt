    Present draft: "Success criteria for all levels would be testable.   Some success criteria
may be machine-testable. Others may require human judgment.  
Success criteria that require human testing would, in the judgment of the working group members,  yield consistent results among multiple knowledgeable testers."
Comment:
Wording of the last sentence is confusing. I believe what is meant is:
"Judgment of the working group members" applies to identification of    criteria that can be tested with  consistency  and reliability  by humans. Right? 
Do we intend to list these tests?
Consider following alternatives:
1. In the judgment of the working group members, certain success criteria can be tested by humans in a manner that is capable of yielding consistent results among multiple knowledgeable testers.

2. Claims of conformance  to success criteria can be based on human testing is such testing has yielded or is capable of yielding consistent results among multiple knowledgeable testers.
