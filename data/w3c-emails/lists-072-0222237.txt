Ah 

Good point

 

So it looks like Level 1 items should be something of the form

 

 "Do it directly or in a way that a user agent can present it" 

 

And level 2 (or 3 ) might be

 

 "Do it directly"

1. That is the issue I have been raising on the list and in last week's call
: the main distinction between level 1 and 2 is freedom of content
presentation. At least this was the assumption till the March 11 draft. This
was the basis for categorizing criteria as level 1 and 2. Now the   words:

"    2. Achieve a minimum level of accessibility through markup,...",
require us to reconsider the classification. 

And should we throw  the concept of "freedom of content     presentation"
out of the window? Ref: mails from John and Charles.

2. And is use of mark-up etc the only way of providing "minimum
accessibility"? Consider a link to an audio presentation. The author might
present the text transcript on the same page itself. This I suppose  is
"direct accessibility without requiring intervention by user agents or
assistive technology", and  is hence a level 2 resolution of the problem. So
complying with a level 2 criterion can also ensure minimum accessibility- a
feature of level  1 at present. In other words minimum accessibility can be
provided by a level 1 or 2 criteria, right?   

Using a title attribute on an image is  markup and when used along with alt
enhances accessibility. It depends on user agent and AT. So it is a level 1
criteria that is  doing the  enhancement. Right?

Looks like we  still have some way to go!
