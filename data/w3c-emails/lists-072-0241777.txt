Yes 

That is what is intended I believe.

Your alternative wording #1 is closest.   The word "certain" isn't quite
right since it would apply to all of the non-machine testable items   so it
would become

 

1. In the judgment of the working group members, the success criteria that
are not machine testable can be tested by humans in a manner that is capable
of yielding consistent results among multiple knowledgeable testers.

Subject: Definition of human testability

 

    Present draft: "Success criteria for all levels would be testable.
Some success criteria
may be machine-testable. Others may require human judgment.  
Success criteria that require human testing would, in the judgment of the
working group members,  yield consistent results among multiple
knowledgeable testers."
Comment:
Wording of the last sentence is confusing. I believe what is meant is:
"Judgment of the working group members" applies to identification of
criteria that can be tested with  consistency  and reliability  by humans.
Right? 
Do we intend to list these tests?
Consider following alternatives:
1. In the judgment of the working group members, certain success criteria
can be tested by humans in a manner that is capable of yielding consistent
results among multiple knowledgeable testers.

 

2. Claims of conformance  to success criteria can be based on human testing
is such testing has yielded or is capable of yielding consistent results
among multiple knowledgeable testers.
