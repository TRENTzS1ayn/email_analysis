Yes 

That is what is intended I believe.

Your alternative wording #1 is closest.   The word "certain" isn't quite
right since it would apply to all of the non-machine testable items   so
it would become

 

1. In the judgment of the working group members, the success criteria
that are not machine testable can be tested by humans in a manner that
is capable of yielding consistent results among multiple knowledgeable
testers.

Subject: Definition of human testability

 

    Present draft: "Success criteria for all levels would be testable.
Some success criteria
may be machine-testable. Others may require human judgment.  
Success criteria that require human testing would, in the judgment of
the working group members,  yield consistent results among multiple
knowledgeable testers."
Comment:
Wording of the last sentence is confusing. I believe what is meant is:
"Judgment of the working group members" applies to identification of
criteria that can be tested with  consistency  and reliability  by
humans. Right? 
Do we intend to list these tests?
Consider following alternatives:
1. In the judgment of the working group members, certain success
criteria can be tested by humans in a manner that is capable of yielding
consistent results among multiple knowledgeable testers.

 

2. Claims of conformance  to success criteria can be based on human
testing is such testing has yielded or is capable of yielding consistent
results among multiple knowledgeable testers.
