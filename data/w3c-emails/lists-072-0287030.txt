Hello,

Here is an updated charter for review and discussion at our teleconference 
today.  It is based on the charter that was approved last October [1] 
and  incorporates changes required by the updated W3C process, in particular
the W3C Patent Policy [2].

When you read the charter, pay special attention to these sections:
         * Milestones -- (required section) comments on planned schedule?
         * Voting -- note clarifications
         * Participation --
                1. Note the clarification on Good Standing and relationship
                    to working group teleconferences for purposes of voting.
                    One does not have to be in Good Standing to be listed as
                    a contributor.
                2. Note the distinction between subscribing to the mailing 
list
                    and joining the group. An incomplete draft of a new "how to
                    join" page is available [3].

The charter is available at: http://www.w3.org/2004/04/wcag-charter.html
