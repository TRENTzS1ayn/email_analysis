Hello Joe and list,

Respectfully, I disagree with you. The WCAG working group is open to anyone
willing to donate time, it's not just a matter of money. I am an example of
that myself. My company, Heritas, is tiny. I run it together with my
fiancee. We cannot afford to fly me around the world (donations welcome!),
but out of our interest in web accessibility I decided to join WCAG anyway.

Even if I cannot afford to join every face-to-face meeting, I still feel a
valued member of WCAG, which I think is reflected in my PiGS status. I have
to admit it brings a smile to my face when I look at the PiGS list and see
Heritas listed between the big names such as Microsoft, IBM and Adobe. 

The bottom line of my viewpoint: you can make a difference in the WCAG if
you want to, even if you can only donate time and effort. In my opinion,
that makes it a democratic process. I just wished more people from smaller
companies would take the effort...
