This interview with Robert Glushko will be of quite considerable
relevance
to WAI's dealings with its participants.

I note that the Charter advanced today by Wendy--

Roberto:
Charter is based to the process document, that has been developed by W3C
and approved by W3C Representative. W3C is a consortium that define
guidelines where there is the possibility also for external people to
partecipate.
I work also with UNI/ISO and in these consortium "private" cannot
partecipate: every people that wanna develop an ISO must be a
representative of an ISO national organization and this person can be a
member of an international ISO working group *if and only if* the
national working group approve his nomination.
So, at least, W3C has more "democracy" for partecipation than every
other organization.
So.. at the end: wanna have more "benefits" than an "invited expert"?
Become W3C member, pay the membership feed and you have more
rapresentativity and possibility of activity.
