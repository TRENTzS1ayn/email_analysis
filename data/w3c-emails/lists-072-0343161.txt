The bottom line of my viewpoint: you can make a difference in the WCAG
if
you want to, even if you can only donate time and effort. In my opinion,
that makes it a democratic process. I just wished more people from
smaller
companies would take the effort...

Roberto:
Yep! there are a lot of other working group that are more "strict" in
the partecipation... For eg. in some working group if you miss two
teleconference without regrets, you will be removed from list.
