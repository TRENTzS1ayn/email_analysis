Gl3.2 example3:
frames that do not track history making the back button behave
unexpectedly. 

Issue requests clarity on the purpose and recommendation of the example.

The issue that is being raised is that if a frame is navigated  without
adding to history then the users back button will not go back to the
prior page, but rather to the last page that was entered into history.

Outside of clarity the current phrasing is quite HTML centric.

Propose:


Example 3: preserve navigational history

If UA supports navigaional history content author should not alter the
history nor should they prevent the current page from being added to the
history collection as these actions would make navigation unpredictable.
