Why don't refer to viewpoint instead of frames and new windows, like in uaag 1.0?

    Oggetto: Issue 707
      
    Gl3.2 example3:
    frames that do not track history making the back button behave
    unexpectedly. 
    
    Issue requests clarity on the purpose and recommendation of the example.
    
    The issue that is being raised is that if a frame is navigated  without
    adding to history then the users back button will not go back to the
    prior page, but rather to the last page that was entered into history.
    
    Outside of clarity the current phrasing is quite HTML centric.
    
    Propose:
    
    
    Example 3: preserve navigational history
    
    If UA supports navigaional history content author should not alter the
    history nor should they prevent the current page from being added to the
    history collection as these actions would make navigation unpredictable.
