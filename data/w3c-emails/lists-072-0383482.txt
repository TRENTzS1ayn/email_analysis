1) Do all Success Criteria need to be testable?  [1]

Unanimous consent - Yes, all Success Criteria need to be testable
 


2) Do we want to have advisory items that are not testable in the guidelines
doc?

No Consensus on this question.

Unanimous Consent -- If we have some - then we will create an appendix to
store them until we decide if they will go into guidelines, gateway doc,
style guide or other place.

         resources;

resources;
