...and every usability consultant and/or company linking to a page where you
already are [1] is inconceivably credible (that's almost always the first
that catches my eye). I cannot resist -- it's unbelievable what
professionals don't know the basics of their domain, CMIIW.

ACK, some findings definitely confirm this. By the way, maybe you remember
LSA (Latent Semantics Analysis), a rather scientific method calculating the
familiarity of links (by determining the vector length of a term) [2]?
Though, I think that stuff (including CWW [3]) is /really/ scientific ;)


Best regards,
 Jens.
