    Oggetto: Re: Highlights from  April 29th
    
    Good edits! But I have a question about the first item under Level 2
    success criteria. It reads as follows:
    
     
    
    <begin current>
    
    1. Increase accessibility either through additional support for user
    agent based accessibility or through content and/or presentation that
    provides direct accessibility without requiring intervention by user
    
    agents or assistive technology; 
    
    </end current>
    
     
    
    I don't think we can talk about "direct accessibility" that doesn't
    require "intervention by user agents." It's my understanding that all
    Web content has to be rendered by some user agent (either some
    mainstream browser or something specially designed to meet the needs of
    a particular gorup of users).
    
    If I remember right, one important goal here was to encourage people to
    provide content and use presentation techniques that take full advantage
    of the functionality of mainstream user agents such as desktop browsers,
    PDAs, Web phones, etc., , thereby enhancing accessibility for users who
    don't have specialized assistive technologies . We *also* want to
    encourage people to do even more to take advantage of what assistive
    technologies can do.
    
     
    Here's a proposal that addresses the first point; it comes at the second
    point-- about assistive technology-- a little indirectly.
     
    
    <begin proposed>
    
    Level 2 success criteria: 
    
    1.    enhance accessibility for people who rely on widely available
    products such as desktop browsers, PDA's, Web-enabled cell phones, etc;
    
    2.    encourage use of content and/or presentation techniques that do
    not require assistive technology;
    
    3.    do not interfere with assistive technology
    
    </end proposed>
    
    Thanks.
