Issue 681 [1] is a question from Greg Lowney who interprets "operable via a 
keyboard or keyboard interface" [2] to mean that if the user's operating 
system has mousekeys the author does not need to do anything to the content.

If this is likely to be a common interpretation, I propose adding a note to 
the guideline that says, "Keyboard and keyboard interface does not include 
mouse emulators such as mousekeys."

If this is not likely to be a common interpretation, I can respond to Greg 
and clarify the intent with him.

Cleaning up the examples (issues 381 [3] and 702 [4]) should further 
clarify the intent.
