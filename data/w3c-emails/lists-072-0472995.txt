One appreciates Yvette's suggestions. Sadly, there are issues!

>>According to spec, pixels are defined as a relative unit of

Only inasmuch as the spec was ignored in writing WCAG 1.0. The anti-design 
ideology prevailed.

There are lots of ways around that.

I just don't see how that is necessary. I am aware that oldschool WCAG 
supporters think assigning any font size is tantamount to human sacrifice, 
but they were and are quite wrong.

I really don't know how that's our problem. We're writing valid code... 
apart from providing alternate stylesheets, which is absurdly easy, what 
else are we supposed to be doing?

We're writing Web content, not presaging every oddball misrendering of 
valid content.

"Body text" (as distinct from "display").

As has been explained several times on this list, standards-compliant Web
developers solved this problem years ago through stylesheet-switchers.
It's also a user-agent issue, that is, the reader's problem, not solely
ours.

That relies on valid code more than fonts. The screen reader isn't looking 
at the colours.

It's easy to avoid in the first place.

Using any font size says the same thing to the user. And the user may 
override it.

This is the way we design the Web. The CSS spec (and even the still-legal
font element in HTML) are predicated on it. It is a perfectly acceptable
and *expected* method, as the recent WAI usability study documented.  
Typographic design of Web pages is necessary, expected, and *completely*
legal. If you oppose it, you are saying that the Web cannot be
graphic-designed.

We have methods available right now.
