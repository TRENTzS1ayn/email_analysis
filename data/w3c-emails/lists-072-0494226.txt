Issue 492 - Need a separate criterion for success feedback
<http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=492>
We contacted Greg about success feedback in response to issue 496
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-comments-wcag20/2004Apr/0003.html>
I offered to help him draft a proposal for either a guideline or success
