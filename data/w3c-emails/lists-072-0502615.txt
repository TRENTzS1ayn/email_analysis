Hmm. Sort of... the CSS spec, If I Recall Correctly, doesn't really suggest
that pixels should be a readily variable size under user control, which is
the essential requirement for reasonable user control of rendering size.
there is also very little a user can choose as a base from which to choose
their preferences in a way that will meet some expectaion of designers -
unless we accept something like "what IE does in Windows by default" as a
baseline. In practice people often do assume 12 points as a default size,
equating to some number of pixels I forget, so maybe it is no worse than
any other arbitrary choice.

Right. Many other browsers allow for proper zoom now, as well as text size
control (the two seem like different things really). But significant ones
like IE and Safari don't :-( This is an implementation problem I think.

[aside] Maybe you overestimate peoples' aversion to human sacrifice? (I
personally note taht there is a preparedness on the part of some to sacrifice
the effectiveness of some humans to concerns that I think are trivial, but
that kind of diversity of opinion is why we have these discussiuons :-)

see below for more on this point (of a less facetious nature).

Agreed.

It is indeed partially a user-agent problem, partially something that can and
in my opinion should be addressed by content producers offering styles which
include rendering at the users default size.

But I think there is a benefit (admittedly not at the same level as some
others) in providing a default presentation that uses the user's preferred
size. Having to change styles for each site I use is a cognitive load I don't
need, extra work that my hands don't need (and I have reasonably efficient
access to the functions offered), and doesn't transfer from site to site
easily unless it is provided  by the under-implemented but valuable
"alternative stylesheet link", which was only specified last decade, and a
stylesheet switcher built into the pages. (For an example of this that
doesn't quite actually work, see http://www.theage.com.au - a site mentioned
on IG recently who have taken some big steps towards real standards
compliance, to my joy - I read the site most days).

True, but for the reasons I suggested above, it is one that does have an
impact on users. While using size variation is indeed an important cue in
typography, it seems perverse in a medium which almost uniquely offers
control over the baseline size to a user that a designer would seek to usurp
that baseline. Which is quite different from using the normal sizing features
of typography to emphasise particular features or parts of content. Despite
the relatively poorer quality of online typography compared to print,  I
regularly come across sites which think it is sensible to use a smaller type
than that I typically find in my printed reading material. If some human
sacrifice is less heinous than others, then some typography decisions are,
likewise, less user-friendly than others...

So where does that leave us? I think there is value in asking authors not to
make normal text bigger or smaller than a user likes it - but I am not yet
ready to compare this value to that of other requiremmetns we have and will
have. (Clearly it isn't the most important thing in terms of preventing
access...)

But as noted above, I think there are some issues with the proposal, and look
forward to a revised version.

cheers
