This seems backwards. Presumably we believe that all tests will produce
consistent results when done by reasonably knowledgeable people, with some of
them also being sufficiently simple to automate completely.

Otherwise we have no basis for deciding whether a particular test that a tool
does is in fact a valid one or not, and in the case of two conflicting
results from tools we would not have any way of declaring which was
accurate...
