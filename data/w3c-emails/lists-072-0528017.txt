Subject: Suggestion for this Editorial Note

 

Editorial Note: We are looking for a word to replace "page" that applies
across technologies. For visual applications, "screen" would apply, but
would not apply for speech-based technologies such as VoiceXML.

 

How about 'media'

 

Print media

Paper media

Screen media

Voice/Speech media
