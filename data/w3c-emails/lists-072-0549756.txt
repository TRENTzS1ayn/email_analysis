Sorry, my point was more subtle. I understand the general principle of
agreeing on the results of tests. (This is why I participate in
EuroAccessibility under my Sidar hat - Sidar thinks it is very important
that we clarify and agree on how to test WCAG 1, at least across Europe).

But we often seem to be saying "for things that aren't machine testable, we
want to get consistent results from people". And I just wanted to clarify
that we expect all tests to be testable by people, with consistent results,
including those that are often automated.

For example, validation of HTML and XHTML code is something that machines do
more efficiently than people, and on average more accurately. But there are
bugs from time to time in validators, which a group of people who know the
relevant specification can all identify. In such a case, I believe we want to
say that the people are right and the machine test is wrong. Otherwise it
will be necessary to identify the particular machine tests we trust, which I
think will add about 2 years to the timeline...

cheers
