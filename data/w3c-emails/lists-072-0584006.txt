Not quite, I don't think.

Many English uses of "it's." But what's the big deal? Who cares? And where 
is the *evidence* (as opposed to supposition) that this harms any disabled 
person?

Homographs and polysemic words are features of many languages. The Web 
Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 will be laughed out of town if it 
even flirts with the idea of forcing us to use markup like <span title="it 
has">it's</span>.

And I wouldn't advise people to bring up the similar case of adding nikud 
to Hebrew.
