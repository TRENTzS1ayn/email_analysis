Two or three different types of links to a homepage wouldn't violate that
rule because they are different interactive elements associated with the
same functionality. That's exactly the reverse case of the criterion I'm
describing: the _same_ element associated with _different_ functionality. 

An (extreme) example of a violation of this criterion would be two links
called "Home", one going to the homepage of the current subsection of the
website and one going to the homepage of the overall website. This would be
hard to understand for most people, let alone people with a learning
disability.
