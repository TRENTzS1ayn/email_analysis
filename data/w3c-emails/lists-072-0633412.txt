It's been a great effort to create 5 examples. It's gotten to the point
where it's succeeded. It's meant that the dog remained in the mall. The
puppy was left behind, it's forgotten. It's owner was an eleven year old
child. It's forgotten to take the dog home. 

The last three sentences show three different meanings of "it's". Especially
"it's forgotten" may mean either it has forgotten (active) or it is
forgotten (passive) which can't always be resolved from context.
