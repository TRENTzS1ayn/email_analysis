The last sentence in Yvette's list of examples--

>It's forgotten to take the dog home. 

Is not something a native spaker of English would say:
(1) A native speaker would not use the pronoun "it" to refer to a person
(2) A native spaker would not say "It is forgotten to take the dog
home."  On the other hand, a native speaker might well say "It's been
forgotten," which would expand to "It has been forgotten."

This doesn't mean that a sentence like the one in the examples list
would never appear on the Web!  But the others are better examples.

Still, I would agree with Chaals: requiring markup of such commonly
occurring contractions would make the guidelines appear unreasonable and
create resistance.

It's been a great effort to create 5 examples. It's gotten to the point
where it's succeeded. It's meant that the dog remained in the mall. The
puppy was left behind, it's forgotten. It's owner was an eleven year old
child. It's forgotten to take the dog home. 

The last three sentences show three different meanings of "it's".
Especially "it's forgotten" may mean either it has forgotten (active) or
it is forgotten (passive) which can't always be resolved from context.
