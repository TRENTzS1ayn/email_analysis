I believe I was the one who introduced the word "resource."  I don't
particularly like it, but my earlier use of the word "page" was
critiqued (appropriately) because it didn't allow for situations where
there was no page, such as Voice XML applications.  So I used the term
"resource" because it was more general, I had heard it before in
reference to Web-thingies, and I couldn't think of anything better.More
recently, the talk about aggregation has (in my view) made the case for
the more general term even more compelling.

Two or three different types of links to a homepage wouldn't violate
that rule because they are different interactive elements associated
with the same functionality. That's exactly the reverse case of the
criterion I'm
describing: the _same_ element associated with _different_
functionality. 

An (extreme) example of a violation of this criterion would be two links
called "Home", one going to the homepage of the current subsection of
the website and one going to the homepage of the overall website. This
would be hard to understand for most people, let alone people with a
learning disability.
