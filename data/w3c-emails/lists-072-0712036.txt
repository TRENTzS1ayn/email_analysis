Hi group,

Yvette:
I don't think you can rate the clarity of the text without taking the target
audience into account.  When I read "write clearly" I automatically ask
myself "for whom?". There is an entire spectrum of learning disabilities,
ranging from people with a 100+ IQ with dyslexia to people with brain damage
who have an IQ of 60-. "Write clearly" for the first audience requires
totally different strategies than writing clearly for the second audience.


Roberto C:
I completely agree with you, Yvette.

Writing a text, reading it and pretending that everyone can understand it is
an utopia! We cannot avoid to consider all kinds of social and intellectual
differences human race is rich of: I simply cannot expect that my relation
or my web page is perceived the same way by all web users, and I do not
consider it as a limit, but as a completely normal thing.

When web professionals try and study a web site usability, they simply refer
it to a particular target of potential users, and try to adjust the whole
project on that target (I know it's not a simple process, but that's its
essence). 

It doesn't mean excluding people and saying "you'll never understand it",
but I cannot imagine that any text is easy to read and to understand for
everyone. 

Best regards,

Roberto Castaldo
