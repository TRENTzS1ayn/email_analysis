But this is exactly the point I'm trying to make: there is a whole range of
learning disabilities out there. Your test method gives a false impression
of accessibility for people with learning disabilities! 

Just because some people with certain learning disabilities find the text
clearly written, doesn't mean the the text is clear for "people with
learning accessibilities" in general. The text can be perfectly clear for
people with dyslexia or ADD but not for someone with Down's syndrom or a
brain injury. Your method is like asking a person with limited vision to
test the accessibility for all people with vision problems (including blind
people using braille).
