I, too am from a small company and can add to the discussion that the
cost of the teleconferences (approx $30 a call) can sometimes be
prohibitive.  There is very little likelihood of me ever attending a
face-to-face meeting, unless it is in Australia, and I do feel that
sometimes I cannot contribute as much as I would like due to that fact.

Hello Joe and list,

Respectfully, I disagree with you. The WCAG working group is open to
anyone
willing to donate time, it's not just a matter of money. I am an example
of
that myself. My company, Heritas, is tiny. I run it together with my
fiancee. We cannot afford to fly me around the world (donations
welcome!),
but out of our interest in web accessibility I decided to join WCAG
anyway.

Even if I cannot afford to join every face-to-face meeting, I still feel
a
valued member of WCAG, which I think is reflected in my PiGS status. I
have
to admit it brings a smile to my face when I look at the PiGS list and
see
Heritas listed between the big names such as Microsoft, IBM and Adobe. 

The bottom line of my viewpoint: you can make a difference in the WCAG
if
you want to, even if you can only donate time and effort. In my opinion,
that makes it a democratic process. I just wished more people from
smaller
companies would take the effort...
