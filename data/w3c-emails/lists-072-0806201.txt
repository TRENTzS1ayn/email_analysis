I will run a test on it. but it doesn't fail the current guideline
(flashing) - and I don't think it will fail the new ones either. 

 

The pattern might fail at Level 3 if they had more stripes in the header -
but I don't thing there are near enough to cause a failure.

I came across this the other day: (WARNING: may cause seizures)
http://www.gkr.com.au/

 

I believe this link would be a problem for people with epilepsy (it
certainly induced a headache in me).  The big question - would it fail the
relevant guideline?
