To a lot of English speakers, active voice + short sentences = clarity.
Then, too, to a lot of people, the last time they learned to write was
fifth grade (to paraphrase something I heard once.) 

Not all Web authors -- or lawyers or scientists or so on -- are writers,
and not all writers are good communicators. Thus, when told "write
clearly," chances are they do not know how, and so interpret that
defensively as censorship. 

I have watched online authoring become a dominant topic within the
Society for Technical Communication. (In fact, there was a recent
article about WCAG and the group.) The idea is that the Web offers new
opportunities for technical writers -- if they could just convince
project managers. 

Writers can find myriad lists of elements that go into "plain English."
What I have yet to find (maybe I haven't looked enough) is a collection
of similar elements for other languages. For example, is referring to
someone directly ("you") considered rude? Is passive voice preferred to
subject-verb-object? Is narrative form better than vertical lists? 

Multilingual groups like this within W3C seem ideally suited to generate
lists of common plain-language principles to help Web authors. I would
volunteer to compile any submissions for use as, say, a WCAG appendix
item or linked document.
