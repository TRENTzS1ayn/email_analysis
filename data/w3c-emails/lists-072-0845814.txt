Interesting and important point, Avi.

In a writing class I taught about 10 years ago, an Asian woman said
something that opened up a whole world of difference for me.  I had
returned several of her papers with suggestions for getting more
directly to the point.  She was clearly very bright, but she just
wouldn't come to the point, no matter what I said, no matter how I
marked up sentences, suggested transitions,e tc.  Finally she told me
that in her culture it was considered rude to come directly to the
point-- especially for a woman addressing a man.

And of course there are cases in which speaking clearly and
unambiguously can result in the death of the speaker.

To a lot of English speakers, active voice + short sentences = clarity.
Then, too, to a lot of people, the last time they learned to write was
fifth grade (to paraphrase something I heard once.) 

Not all Web authors -- or lawyers or scientists or so on -- are writers,
and not all writers are good communicators. Thus, when told "write
clearly," chances are they do not know how, and so interpret that
defensively as censorship. 

I have watched online authoring become a dominant topic within the
Society for Technical Communication. (In fact, there was a recent
article about WCAG and the group.) The idea is that the Web offers new
opportunities for technical writers -- if they could just convince
project managers. 

Writers can find myriad lists of elements that go into "plain English."
What I have yet to find (maybe I haven't looked enough) is a collection
of similar elements for other languages. For example, is referring to
someone directly ("you") considered rude? Is passive voice preferred to
subject-verb-object? Is narrative form better than vertical lists? 

Multilingual groups like this within W3C seem ideally suited to generate
lists of common plain-language principles to help Web authors. I would
volunteer to compile any submissions for use as, say, a WCAG appendix
item or linked document.
