I had the same problem a few years back while helping a Chinese woman
studying at Cambridge (UK) check her essays. Her paragraphs would lead you
towards an idea, but never actually state the point clearly before going on
to another tack.

She was astonished that I was telling her to state the point clearly
up-front and dot all the I's and cross the T's.  She was amazed that
spelling everything out so clearly wouldn't be insulting to the reader, who
she expected would want to play a part in reaching the conclusions.
