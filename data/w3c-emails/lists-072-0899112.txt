I think we just have to tell people "write well" and give references
to what we mean by that, and don't say "write clearly."  There are types
of writing for which you do NOT want to "write clearly."

Heck, there are types of writing for which you don't actually want to
"write well."  This type of rule presented as a rule causes more
damage than it's worth.
