When I participate in this group from Sidar, I am representing (along with
other Sidar contributors) a large number of people who, in addition to
generally trying to do this work unfunded, have to track it in a language
which is not their native one.

The cost of full-time participation, or remaining in good standing, is
therefore often prohibitive, particularly for anyone whose primary
interest is the techniques task force and not the guidelines themselves.

Although some tweaking of the charter could ameliorate that a little (for
eample by valuing action items completed, or participation  in task
forces, at a similar level to dialling into a meeting of the main group),
I don't think that this changes much in the democratisation of the group.

Because I think that in the absence of sufficient funding to pay for any
volunteer who asks for it and does some work, the process provides a
remarkable degree of democracy already. The working group is committed to
responding to issues raised by anyone, which simply requires explaining
the issue in an email. When Last Call arrives this becomes a meaningful
commitment, and one can expect them to have to demonstrate that they have
indeed responded to the issues.

I  recognise  that this is not perfect, and that attrition, and the
prioritisation can act in some ways against the democratic nature of the
process, but this also permits the democratic aspects  to function given a
relatively  small amount of surveillance (the real price of democracy) on
the part of "Joe Public". Any further contributions that people can make
become part of the foundations on which the group is building, and are
available for future reference.
