I would like to repeat John's comment earlier that we do not anymore have
anything that says  "write clearly"  or anything like that.

I was using that as an example of something that was not testable and opened
up this discussion.

There have been some very good comments that have resulted.  But I wanted to
be sure people didn't think that was currently in our guidelines. 

Thanks

 
Gregg

I think we just have to tell people "write well" and give references
to what we mean by that, and don't say "write clearly."  There are types
of writing for which you do NOT want to "write clearly."

Heck, there are types of writing for which you don't actually want to
"write well."  This type of rule presented as a rule causes more
damage than it's worth.
