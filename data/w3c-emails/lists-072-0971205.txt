Most Far Eastern people would feel that way about business cards.  Also,
don't stick their cards in your back pocket, or offer them grubby versions
of your own.  Best to have little business card holder.  After a Japanese
person gives you their card (which you should take with two hands to be
polite and with thanks), you should take a moment to read and even briefly
discuss it, or at least read out or comment on some aspect of the
information.  Then, if you are sitting at a table, you will do well to lay
it carefully on the table before you - neatly, and not covered up.

You might find it interesting to look up some of the many books and articles
covering cultural differences.  There's a lot more where these came from...
