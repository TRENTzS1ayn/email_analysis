We'll get right on that once you and others learn to quit top-posting-- an
*actual* problem. In the case you're complaining about, people get two
copies of a single message. Big deal.

Were you unaware that many people read the Web version and aren't
subscribers? Cc:ing people is generally *preferable*.

Loved the ALL-CAPS SUBJECT. Way to defend those netiquette protocols!
