This may be worth looking at. Annotations for content types - to enable
more information hiding, enhanced navigation, and better rendering of
content...
http://www.ubaccess.com/contenttypes.html 

IMS (Educational content) and DI (device independence) are also looking
at this- if we can build in everyone's needs, we should get something
really useful.

All the best
