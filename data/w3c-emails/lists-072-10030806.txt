For what it's worth, Gregg, when I hit "Reply" in MS Outlook, the reply
goes *only* to the individual sender of the message; when I hit "Reply
all," the reply goes to both the list *and* the individual sender. I
can't find anything in the Options that will let me configure this, and
none of the other lists I'm on behave in quite the same way.  So maybe
it's something about the way the listserv is configured?

(Well, and then of course there's the "broken user agent" problem, i.e.,
Outlook, but that's another story).

We'll get right on that once you and others learn to quit top-posting--
an
*actual* problem. In the case you're complaining about, people get two
copies of a single message. Big deal.

Were you unaware that many people read the Web version and aren't
subscribers? Cc:ing people is generally *preferable*.

Loved the ALL-CAPS SUBJECT. Way to defend those netiquette protocols!
