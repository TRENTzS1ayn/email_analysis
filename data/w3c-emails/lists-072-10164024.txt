John's proposal:
<begin proposed> 

Level 1 success criteria

1.    Do not set limits on content or presentation;
2.    achieve a minimum level of accessibility through markup,
scripting, or other technologies that interact with user agents, including
assistive technologies;
3.    may reasonably be applied to all Web resources;
4.    are testable. some success criteria are machine-testable.
Others require human judgment. Success criteria that require human testing
are capable of yielding consistent results among multiple testers.


Level 2 success criteria

1.    Build on Level 1;
2.    enhance accessibility through presentation;
3.    may reasonably be applied to all Web resources;
4.    are testable. some success criteria are machine-testable.
Others require human judgment. Success criteria that require human testing
are capable of yielding consistent results among multiple testers.

Level 3 success criteria

1.    May provide essential benefits for users with specific
disabilities;
2.    may enhance accessibility for a broad range of users with
disabilities;
3.    may affect content as well as presentation and markup;
4.    may reasonably be applicable to selected resources;
5.    are testable. some success criteria are machine-testable.
Others require human judgment. Success criteria that require human testing
are capable of yielding consistent results among multiple testers. 

</end proposed>

Yvette:

I like this! I especially like the phrase 'minimum accessibility' in the
description of level 1. Perhaps we could even pull that into the
description, for example:

Level 1 - minimum accessibility
Level 2 - basic accessibility
Level 3 - advanced accessbility

The reason why I call level 2 'basic' is because in my opinion, basic
accessibility can only be achieved by setting boundaries on what you can do
in your presentation (requiring good contrast between text and background is
a good example). 

I hope that using phrases like these will stimulate people to aim for level
2 at least. It gives a clear signal that level 1 is only minimal and people
shouldn't think they created a website that is accessible to everyone with a
disability just because they pass level 1.
