Hi Gian,

You're absolutely right in your remark. I didn't take the telephone
costs
into account in my reaction. My WCAG phone bills used to be around 30
USD as
well, but I now have a new carrier with an introduction offer of 1
eurocent
per minute (about 1.2 dollarcent). 

This means the monthly cost of attending the WCAG teleconferences
(estimated
at 8 hours per month) is about 2 Big Macs for me at the moment, or 10
Big
Macs if I used the standard phone company or once the introduction is
over.
I use the number of Big Macs to represent the purchasing power of the
WCAG
monthly phone bill in my country. Big Mac is one of the few products
that is
available in exactly the same composition worldwide, which is why it is
used
often to compare prices. 

It would be interesting to compare the number of Big Macs that 8 hours
of
phone calls to the US cost in different countries to get an idea of the
costs involved. I'll start the list:
