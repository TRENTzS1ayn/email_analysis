This weeks agenda will be focus on Ian's comments and the Conformance issues
and strategies that we didn?t get to last week.

1 - Ian's posting.  

2 - Should there be intermediate between 1 and 2 and 3 
(Current requirements doc conformance statement says yes so if we come to
different consensus we need to change requirements doc)

3 - Should definitions of how we sorted into levels 1, 2 and 3 be updated? 
- do we want to stick with L1 is only invisible 

4 - Should checklists be normative?  What are the issues? 
 
5 - whether conformance should be based on technology status at time WCAG
becomes official or whether we should lean into the future.




See you Thursday.
