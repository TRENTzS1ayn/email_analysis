In Australia I pay AUD 6 / hour (that's about 4 euros, and a little more than
half the minimum wage, but I have no idea how many big macs) to call the US
with a pretty standard subscription. There are cheaper solutions available

Generally I buy a discount phone card and it costs me about 2 beers (6 in the
"third world" where the beer is cheap by foreigners' standards) in a country
where I don't have a real subscription.

e.g. Spain: 10 euros covers 4 calls (6 hours). UK 5 pounds gets me about 2.

There are also Voice over IP services for those lucky enough to have
reasonable bandwidth - W3C uses it a lot for people who work from home. But I
don't have the bandwidth myself. It works out at around the above-quoted
prices.

(The problem with the big mac standard is that while they are cheap food for
poor people in the US, they are relatively more of a luxury item in some
places. It works better for travellers than it does for measuring local
price in local terms. And for some definition of luxury :-)
