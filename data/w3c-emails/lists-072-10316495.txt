DISCUSSION

Test matrix and Gateway techniques - we didn't have updated versions of
these to review but we looked at open questions to faciliate getting the
documents ready for our next meeting. 

Submission form - we talked about the techniques submission form to allow
members of the public to submit techniques. We resolved a few issues and
should be able to post it soon.
