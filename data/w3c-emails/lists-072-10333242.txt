You wouldn't make those two links because they aren't.

I don't see why. Twice as many targets to hit.

I suppose they could, but we have other priorities for user-agent remixing

It is nothing of the sort. It is *correct* behaviour for Web *designers*. 
Their visual sensibility is perfectly valid when combined with valid code 
and standards compliance. Stop hating the visual Web.
