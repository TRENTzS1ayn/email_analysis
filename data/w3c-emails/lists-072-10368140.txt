Screen readers sit on top of another application, and present the output as
voice. Sometimes they also add new input or control functions. But generally
they rely on the underlying application. So bookmarking and so forth are left
to the individual browser, and the screen reader doesn't have any
functionality for it. (Nor is it relevant to screen readers).

Talking browsers such as WebSound, BrailleSurf, or Home Page Reader, will
have functions. Check the help documents...
