JAWS 5.0 has a bookmarking feature of sorts: users can set markers at
specific points on Web pages, then jump to those points.   These markers
can be saved, and even shared with other users.  Haven't used this
feature much, but it's interesting that it exists.

Screen readers sit on top of another application, and present the output
as
voice. Sometimes they also add new input or control functions. But
generally
they rely on the underlying application. So bookmarking and so forth are
left
to the individual browser, and the screen reader doesn't have any
functionality for it. (Nor is it relevant to screen readers).

Talking browsers such as WebSound, BrailleSurf, or Home Page Reader,
will
have functions. Check the help documents...
