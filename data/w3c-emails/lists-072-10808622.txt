OK, I populated the WAI-HC list (HTML4/CSS2 review) with the following
emails:

jasonw@ariel.ucs.unimelb.EDU.AU
raman@Adobe.COM
dsr@w3.org
phill@austin.ibm.com
DPawson@rnib.org.uk
po@trace.wisc.edu
hakkinen@dev.prodworks.com
murray@maloney.mail.net
asgilman@access.digex.net
 
Several things:
  - some of you didn't explicitly askek to be on it (yet), so just
reply niet if you don't want to be on it and feel free to call or be
called if you want to chat.

  - http://www.w3.org/WAI/group/HC/ is our home page, please review it
and send comment to this list about the charter, missing items,
presentation (it's clearly in the building now), missing links,
etc. Right now it's still pointing at the FP list, but that will
change soon.

  - I assume only Jason, Dave Pawson, and Gregg will need member site
   access passwd (the others having one already), tell me if I'm wrong.

  - who else should I contact to be on HC ?
   I'm already planning on asking Harvey Binham and Greg Lowney to work on
   TABLE.
