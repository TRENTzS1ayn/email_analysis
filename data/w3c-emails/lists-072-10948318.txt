Spekaing of ALT #require

One thing that's worth mentioning is that in the case of INPUT, the
fact that it's an INPUT image is determined using the type attribute
(=image), and SGML doesn't allow another attribute (like ALT) to be
#required in a context dependent way.

Also note that since the ALT text is conveyed using regular markup
content in <OBJECT>, attribute dependent semantics as well, the HTML4
specs cannot make it required.
