Thanks for pointing that out Dave, I missed it since I focused on the
media definition section (15.1.3) and not the Notes at the end of the
document (27.3.1).

Is this that the section you were thinking about ?

I think it should be re-integrated in the media section itself and
should be improved like Jason suggests:

Any volunteer for the complete & correct media section working ?

This should include the issue with the default being only applicable
to style and the fact that media isnot clearly defined in the LINK
section but only in the STYLE element section.

We started with REL but then Murray mentioned a proposal separating
"dictionary" out and I thought building on it rather than aside would
be better.

The downside of building on something that itself is not cast and
stone (which I think is the case for REL=dictionary) is that
everything can fall apart if the foundation falls.

Murrau, do you have more details on the status of the generic
DICTIONARY proposal (I think it's part of a more general LINK type
proposal) ? Should we push for it ?

I also think having a separate attrib for the class itself should
simplify any parsing specification we can come up (like for media).

Like Jason, I think that we have to define the base dictionary type
names for HTML4 (much like screen, print, are there for media).
