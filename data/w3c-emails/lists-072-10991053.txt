As you may have seen on the WAI group page, Al Gilman, who is (will
be) the chair of the Formats&Protocols WG, is also chairing, with my
help, this group (nothing unexpected, HC is an off-spring of FP).

Time is short in HC land and we need to conduct business in a
timely manner, so don't be surprised if you see assigment requests
flying around in the next few days. 

For those now up to speed with W3C process, one of the main role of
the chair is to coordinate editing duties, another one is to declare
consensus, that is, that an item is done.
