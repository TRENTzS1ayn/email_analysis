Here is a more precise formulation of the dictionary linking proposal
which I outlined in a recent message to this list. It is based on some of
Al's comments, and credit is due to him for having developed the
underlying concepts.

The link to a dictionary is denoted by a REL attribute which takes the
following form:
rel="dictionary (ENTRYTYPES)"
where the ENTRYTYPES parameter, enclosed in parentheses as shown,
comprises a list of key words. If more than one key word is given, then
each is separated from its successor by a comma and a space, as in:
(type1, type2, type3 [...])

Each key word informs the user agent that the dictionary file includes a
particular type of entry. Dictionary data types include the following:

ABBREVIATION (abbreviation expansions)
DEFINITION (textual definitions of terms)
PHONETIC (phonetic data, which may for example be used by speech
synthesizers)
ETYMOLOGY

Several questions come to mind:
are the parentheses surrounding the list of dictionary types necessary or
appropriate? What other types should be added to the list?

It is the responsibility of the user agent to make use of dictionaries
appropriately, in accordance with the kinds of data which they are
declared to contain (see the ENTRYTYPES parameter discussed above).
Speech-based user agents, for example, may respond automatically to
dictionaries which provide phonetic data and abbreviation expansions.
Dictionaries containing textual definitions may be rendered by treating
each occurrence within the document of a defined term as a link to its
dictionary definition.

Example:
<link href="dictionary.xml" rel="dictionary (abbreviation, phonetic)">

I would welcome any comments on this proposal, including amendments,
alternatives, corrections and criticisms. Once our final position has been
worked out, a concise formulation needs to be written by one who has
experience in such drafting.
