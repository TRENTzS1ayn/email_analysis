Can anyone remind me of the motivation for being able
to recognize the link is for a dictionary independent
of what kind of dictionary it is?

Unless there is a strong motivation for this ability
I would have thought that a single rel value for
each kind of dictionary would suffice, e.g.

   rel=abbrev-dict
   rel=phonetic-dict
   ...
