The short answer is the RDF is intended to be used
to identify resources and make assertions about
what those resources are. So, you could say that
a resource exists at a specific URL and that it
is a "phonetic dictionary". Any application that
wanted to find a phonetic dictionary would look
at the list of resources identified and get that
resource.

As far as picking a winner, I have to say that 
LINK has not been widely adopted for a lot of
uses so far. However, MS and NS are both behind
RDF as a way to do what we need.

I agree that the W3C architecture group should
be consulted on this.
