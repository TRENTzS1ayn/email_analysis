CSS1 uses the property list-style-image to set the image URL.
A simple fix would be to allow this property to take a descriptive
string following the URL, e.g.

  list-style-image: url(warning.gif) warning

where the text "warning" takes the role of alt text for
the list bullet image.

A general trend in CSS1 was to provide separate properties
corresponding to each part of a compound property, e.g. 
border-left-width versus border. It would make sense to also
provide several properties related to the list bullet image,
e.g. width, height, alt text and alignment. For instance: 

  list-style-image: url(warning.gif)
  list-style-image-text: warning
  list-style-image-width: 16
  list-style-image-height: 16

I believe that these could be added without difficulty to CSS2,
provided we insist. I don't care much about the exact names of
the properties which we can leave the CSS&FP group to decide.
