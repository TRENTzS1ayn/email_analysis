I talked to Ralph Swick this afternoon (after reading the latest RDF
doc) and he told me their goal was indeed to be able to describe
things like dictionary type and structure from the link to the
dictionary itself (i.e. before fetching the dictionary itself). Is
wasn't clear in the current RDF spec and should be made clearer in
next version (he pointed me at the fact that RDF can assert anything
about anything, and a LINK is something).

He also thinks that dictionary themselves should be expressed in RDF
syntax, but that's another topic.

I think this doesn't close the issue really and we should articulate a
requirement proposal, rather than a solution, regarding the need of
pointing to accessiblity-relevant dictionary (like phonetic for speech
browser).
