I agree we want to arrive at a requirement statement.

I still want some worked examples.

I believe that we need this because we are likely to be facing a
decision between asking for functions in HTML vs. trusting that
the functions are covered outside HTML.  To make that decision
responsibly, we need one more level of investigation into the
alternatives.

Specific functions which would be good to cover in the examples:

- how browser recognizes that a dictionary is useful w.r.t.
an HTML document without explicit mention in document.

- how author indicates that a dictionary is to be preferred
for a specific use w.r.t. current document (, current entity).

- Repeat above two for stylesheets.

- how browser detects text resources associated with an
image. 

- how does the author community converge on a taxonomy for
distinguishing different text resources associated with the
same image in a widely-recognized way?

I see this as an action item which could be performed outside the
HC working group in response to a request from the HC working
group.  If we don't do it in HTML because RDF does it for us, we
will probably need to put "How to do it in RDF" in the Guidelines
for site managers and browsers.

I don't know who should lead the work.  

I believe that there needs to be a team because we need to cover the
following classes of expertise:

- RDF expertise
- HTTP expertise including the new Internet-Draft on Alternative
indications (headers)
- Someone with in-depth knowledge of accessibility requirements
including experience using some non-GUI browse mode.

I will wait 24 hours for more comments here before I try to precipitate
this activity elsewhere.
