Please look over 

HTML4/CSS2 Accessibility Review Plan

http://www.access.digex.net/%7Easgilman/web-access/wai-hc-draft-plan.html

for any show-stopping problems.  This plan calls for an individual to
serve as document integrator and three cross-background teams to work
on groups of issues.  Think about where you fit in.  Tell me what I
left out.

Barring major problems I will modify this per your comments, ask
Daniel to mount it at

http://www.w3c.org/WAI/HC/

and recruit people to fill those assignments.

Regards,
