I wanted to throw into the discussion a quick implementation example of the 
invisible D link graphic contrasted with a visible graphic and the current 
text D.  Gregg and I discussed this a little off line, and I wanted to open 
the example up for comments.

We have the requirement in the Digital Talking Book work to provide image 
descriptions, which are implemented as in-line text after the image.  In 
looking toward DTBs that serve a range of users such as LD and Dyslexic, 
the in-line text description becomes less practical. In looking at the D 
link text tag, it came across non-intuitive both visually and aurally. 
 When the topic of the invisible D graphic came up, I decided to mock it up 
using actual samples from one of our books.  After some interesting 
reactions to the invisible graphic from sighted users, I added the third 
option of a stylized, small D link graphic along the lines of what you find 
on the CNN site for links to zoomed images or videos.

try it with the browser of your choice under various conditions (graphics 
loading on and off, with speech, without).
