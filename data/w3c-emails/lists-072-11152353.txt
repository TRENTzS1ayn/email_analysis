Essentially, we need to decide whether RDF will provide an optimal
solution, or whether it would still be preferable to pursue changes to the
reserved link types in HTML. If this working group opts for RDF, as I
think is likely, then the task of working out the details could be added
to the list of action items for the FP working group. How far is the RDF
specification from being completed and submitted as a proposed
recommendation? Obviously it should be reviewed by the FP group at some
stage prior to becoming a standard, and perhaps the dictionary
requirements could be considered as part of such a process.
