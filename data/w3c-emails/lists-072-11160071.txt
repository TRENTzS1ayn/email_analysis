to follow up on what Daniel Dardailler said:

I agree we want to arrive at a requirement statement.

I still want some worked examples.
- how browser recognizes that a dictionary is useful w.r.t.
an HTML document without explicit mention in document.
DP: Suggest we tackle this on a default then priority basis.
1. Default, left to stylesheet to determine (since the
stylesheet
knows the 'customer' capability -e.g. I am clever, I can deal with
this through to I don't know what to do with this, help me browser.
2. Author intent. I would like the reader to use dictionary X,
  knowing from the content the difficulties that may arise
3. Browser does its best.


- how author indicates that a dictionary is to be preferred
for a specific use w.r.t. current document (, current entity).

DP: As above, for the entity being dealt with, ?? using some
      characteristic. Indication that a dictionary is necessary 
for this item

- how browser detects text resources associated with an
image. 

DP: Bottom of the ladder. No one else has suggested how it might
be interpreted, hence I must. This also caters for the lazy
author.


- how does the author community converge on a taxonomy for
distinguishing different text resources associated with the
same image in a widely-recognized way?

DP: How about putting a scoped indirect interpretation. The author
scope is that of layer one - he/she knows about major routes
only. The stylesheet world uses that selection, in the knowledge
of
what the customer wants and has available. This keeps the author
input 'simple' in terms of an n way switch, permitting the
stylesheet
interpretation the flexibility to grow with technology to
encompass
more and more 'routes' to resources.
