Chris, I think you're the best positioned to answer these questions
from Jason.

My understanding from a recent chat with Chris is that the CSS2 WG is
still debating most of the issues of interest for us: numbering,
attributes selection, footnotes, etc.

> T.V. Raman and Chris Lilley.
> 
> 2. The selection of elements based on generic attribute values is still
> not possible; only CLASS and ID values are admitted as selectors.

> 3. Notes (including footnotes and end notes) are briefly mentioned in
> section 20.3 (printing) as yet to be developed. Is it expected that such
> work will be completed before CSS 2 becomes a standard? Without the actual
> proposals, it is clearly not possible to assess the degree to which they

> treatment of notes; the braille requirements can be postponed for
> consideration in the Braille CSS work).
