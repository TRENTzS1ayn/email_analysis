If the description is to be used as a replacement of the image (it
completes ALT), then I still question the "invisibility" of the link
in the case where several images are laid out together to form some
kind of mosaic or other tight formatting wanted by the author:

Smaller issue: Is it really 'invisible'.

When the mouse rides over it the cursor changes to the hand,
indicating (on Netscape) that a link is there. Curiosity then takes
over.

Only invisible if you don't suffer from wandering mouse syndrome.
