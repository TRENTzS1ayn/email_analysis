It would help to have a rough idea of what resources we have
amassed here.

Please send Daniel and me
<dd@w3.org,asgilman@access.digex.net>
an email indicating:

1. What browse modes you use frequently (answer yes to all that
apply):

     GUI, no screen magnification or sound:

     Eyes-free with audio (speech) only:

     Braille (with or without any other):

     Screen magnification:

     Text-mode, sighted:


2. Please give a rough assessment of your knowledge
(e.g. none/some/expert) of the following:

     Braille formatting standards:

     Adaptive technology in general:

     HTML:

     CSS:

3.  What are your top (about 1-3) issues that you feel the HC
group absolutely must address?

4. The rough level of effort (% of full-time effort) you can put
into the HTML4/CSS2 review between now and Oct 15:

Please let us know this.  It will help us focus on getting done
what we can.
