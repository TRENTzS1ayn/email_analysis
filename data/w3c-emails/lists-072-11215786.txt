An invisible D-link is also not invisible if you tab through the links. 
  The highlight sort of disappears or highlights a teeeeny tiny point on 
the screen.

I personally think it should be VISIBLE.   I think we should come up with a 
small icon that is recognizable even when small and is also attractive. 
  People could have the option of making it invisible if they chose to keep 
their layout clean.  But we would encourage the use of the visible icon.

I do think that many will find the descriptions instructive.

What should it look like?

Well, if there is a latin word for description that starts with D  i would 
use a nice little D.  The alt text could then also be D (yes it would need 
an alt text - so we dont want to use a graphic symbol that needs a long alt 
text).

When we get to the point where all subpieces (gifs etc) are downloaded with 
a page, the D-links should autodownload along with the page (even if 
graphics autoload is turned off)

If the description is to be used as a replacement of the image (it
completes ALT), then I still question the "invisibility" of the link
in the case where several images are laid out together to form some
kind of mosaic or other tight formatting wanted by the author:

Smaller issue: Is it really 'invisible'.

When the mouse rides over it the cursor changes to the hand,
indicating (on Netscape) that a link is there. Curiosity then takes
over.

Only invisible if you don't suffer from wandering mouse syndrome.
