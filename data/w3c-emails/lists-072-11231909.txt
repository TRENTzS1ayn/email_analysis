First, it seems like a bad idea to add semantics information like ALT
text to a piece of style sheet.
DP: Agreed. Nothing to do with how the content be shown

The reason is that it's possible, likely in fact, that a particular
style sheet be dropped in favor of another one by the browser, so any
valuable information would be lost.
DP: Agreed.

Second, the real place for content is the markup, 
DP: This is the critical point.  ALT text is content. We may add
a few adjectives to 'content', but content it is, therefore it should be
part of the document.
