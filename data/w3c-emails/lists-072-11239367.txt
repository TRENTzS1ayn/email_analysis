It is hard to review this material without the web of links to 
element and attribute definitions in place.  That is why I would
like to be able to offer Interest Group members a virtual document
with the changes and non-changes integrated.

It is easier to see "what we failed to notice that also needs to 
change" in this format.

We could pick a version and do our proposals as changes relative
to that version, regarless of what is latest.  I bet the HTML
editing team could deal with that in the meet/edit process.

I don't know about CSS.  There are lots of issues there.  We
need something releasable to the public for IG review of our
change proposals.  If it is more dynamic, we may not want to
tie ourselves to change pages, as you say.  But I think that
HTML is very stable and we can base off it.  We don't have
to do exactly the same thing for the two documents.
