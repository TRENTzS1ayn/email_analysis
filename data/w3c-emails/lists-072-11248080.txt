I would agree with Hakon.

Style sheets should be used to help out in the case of more generic bullets
like redball.gif
--given that one of the hoped for results of deploying CSS is that
html pages will take less time to download because authors no longer need to
embed gifs for obtaining stylized bullets,
the style sheet would also be the right place for mapping a generic set of
gifs to a generic set of semantic attributes, e.g. bullet.

But where a bullet is more specific e.g. *WARNING*
the style sheet is the wrong place to stick that information in.
