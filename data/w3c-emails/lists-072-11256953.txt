Let me soften what I just said.

[Daniel and I have been debating whether the WAI team should
prepare change proposals as fully-formed change pages or as some
kind of a more strategic "change directive."]

What I am really reacting to is the sense that the HTML team, at
the very least, is extremely tired of making changes by now.  For
us to want to change things at this late hour, it will make it
easier for them to cooperate with us if we can do what we can to
make our suggested changes meet the quality standards of
fully-tested, plug-and-go drop-in components for their document.

That said, I have to face reality.

Change pages are a solution; what's the requirement?  Perhaps the
requirement is that we should be talking to the editors of the
HTML and CSS documents to learn what would make their lives
easier and try to conform the format we put our change proposals
in as closely to what they want as we can.
