I believe that RDF is also pitching itself as a capability for solving
the "generic" case.  If the red ball is a captive slave of the stylesheet
then the stylesheet is a fine place to put its generic text alternative,
but if the same red ball is used more widely and independently of the
particular stylesheet, we want to look further up the supply chain
for where text alternatives can be introduced and propagated through
the system.

ClipArt libraries of images for use a bullets should contain ALT text
nominees up front.

Agree.  CLASSify the item appropriately.

PS: note that in the draft workplan I asked that we create a
generic information model of content expressible as text and
associated with an image and then look at all the ways the image
enters the system and see if we need to be able to explicitly
alter the text-item associations at that point or not.  The
discussion above suggests that we need to be able to set some of
these things in the clip art library, in the style, and in the
document.  Not necessarily one opportunity per attribute, either.
