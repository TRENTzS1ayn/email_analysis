AGENDA

* Review prototype of relationship of documents [1]
  Questions:
  - does each tech-specific technique refer to only one success
    criterion?
  - do we keep general info in with "traffic cop" functionality?
  - what are the different use cases or paths through the info?
  - how do we balance between educating people vs people getting to
    where they want to go quickly?
* Review additional end-to-end analyses, especially ones including
  test cases
* Gateway techniques [2]
