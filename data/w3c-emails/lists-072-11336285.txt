Further to Al's comment, extensions to the predefined list of media types,
including new base types and the addition of parameters to existing base
types, should be governed by the style language, and not by the HTML
specification. The parsing rules should be rewritten to omit all reference
to truncation of the media type value, and should instead make it clear
that parameters which follow the key word that designates the media type
are to be recognized to the extent that they are defined in the relevant
style language.

The media type should only be deemed to correspond with the capabilities
of the output device if all parameters specified in the media type are
recognized and found to match the properties of the output medium. To
state this point differently, partial matching of media types should be
prohibited, since parameters that follow a key word such as SCREEN, PRINT,
AURAL etc., are likely to act as qualifiers which restrict the range of
output devices to which the style sheet is applicable.
