Upon reflection, it is plainly evident that the image itself, together
with ALT text, should be found within the document rather than as part of
a style sheet. If an audio or braille-based user agent is formatting the
document, then it will only apply styles which are explicitly labeled as
pertaining, respectively, to the AURAL and BRAILLE media types. Thus, the
author's SCREEN (or perhaps PRINT) style sheet, in which the image
corresponding to the list bullet is referred to, will under such
circumstances be ignored completely by the user agent.

Consequently, if the image is intended to convey any semantically
significant content, then it will need to be included in the HTML document
itself, in the manner that Daniel has suggested.
