What would be a good name for this class? Here are some ideas:

 -  character-cell-array
 -  text-only
 -  tty
 -  console
 -  terminal

"character-cell-array" doesn't seem quite right. I have used
"text-only" quite a lot myself. "tty" is my favorite I think
and consistent with the "<TT>...</TT> element which has been
part of HTML from day one.
