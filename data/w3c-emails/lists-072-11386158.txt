Folks, I'm in Thessaloniki (Greece) for two conferences all next week
(29 to the 4th): AAATE (Assistive Techno) and Infosystems 97.

I'm taking a copy of the HC archives  as of today and I hope I'll be
able to connect but in case of silence, you'll know where I am.

(Al, I'll try to call you to give you my hotel number.)
