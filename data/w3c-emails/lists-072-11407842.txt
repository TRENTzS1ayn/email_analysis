To:w3c-wai-hc@w3.org(HC team)

I have not scheduled a telecon and for the time being I don't
expect to.

I posted a somewhat reduced plan at the somewhat reduced URL of

  http://www.access.digex.net/%7Easgilman/web-access/HC-plan.html

You will note that Jason and Daniel have agreed to work on a
crisp proposal in the functional area including the LONGDESC
attribute.

The general area of "logical reading order of text" and TABLEs
still merits your attention.  But be careful to read the latest
HTML draft and Dave Raggett's review of how they got there.

We have a new issue regarding the grouping of OPTIONs within
a SELECT.  Check the IG or WG archives for a recent post by
<megazone@livingston.com>.
