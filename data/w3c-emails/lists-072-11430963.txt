Further to my last message, the sections of the CSS 2 draft which discuss
flow objects and the "visual flow model" appear to be of limited relevance
to the reading order problem. The flow model is primarily concerned with
the positioning of elements in a two-dimensional space (the canvas) rather
than manipulation of the document's structure. However, some of the
properties (FLOAT in particular) might perhaps be extended to accommodate
additional functions associated with controlling the presentational order,
as discussed in my previous message. It might of course be more convenient
to define entirely new properties rather than burdening the existing
properties with new syntactic constructs and additional purposes which,
although related to positioning in general, are not directly concerned
with visual formatting.
