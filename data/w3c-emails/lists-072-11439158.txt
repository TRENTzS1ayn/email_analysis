All of the reading order transformations (and more) were part of AsTeR.

Doing such things requires a generic tree transformation language, and CSS is
in general not capable of such tree transformations.

In the run upto the October deadline, let's try and do the following:

1) Clearly identify suggestions as
a) Wish list in an ideal world
b) For consideration for our current deadline
c) Whether feasible within the constraints of HTML4 and CSS1.X as currently
defined.

This is not to dissuade speculation about what ideal solutions would look
like; but
at this point we risk missing our stated goals for the end of October if we
put up ideas that are not based on an understanding and acceptance of what
HTML4 and CSS are capable of.
