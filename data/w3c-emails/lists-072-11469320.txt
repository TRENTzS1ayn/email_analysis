This seems like a reasonable approach.  

sequence {ID1 ID2 ID3}

Contained in the style sheet you could easily have a different order 
for differing media types. 

The question I see is what to do with non-labelled elements?  Would you
not present them?  I think that is extreme.  Present all of the sequenced
elements in the given order, then the non-sequenced elements in the order
in which they appear in the document?
