I see this as an appropriate topic for browser creativity.

Given that we know the order may wish to vary based on the medium,
we should let those expert in the medium make the call.

An example of how one might want to handle this is speech is to
present things in HTML-text-appearance order until hitting the
element ID1 which starts the sequence constraint.  The the order
would be 

element marked ID1
  link to element ID4 textually between ID1 and ID2
  etc.
element marked ID2
  link to element ID7 textually between ID2 and ID3
  etc.
element marked ID3
element ID4
etc.

The elements subject to the continuous-text constraint would
be read in sequence once one of them was encountered, but the
places where other items had been deferred would be filled
with placeholders linking to where they appeared in the
presentation sequence.

That is just an example of a feasible policy with some thought to
minimizing disruption.

As I say, the HTML policy should be not to have a policy other
than that the browser should allow the user the choice to read
ID1, ID2, ID3 consecutively in the right order.

It's broken if you can't discover or follow the sensible order.
It's not necessary to fix it to make any global order a
straightjacket.
