This is indeed a problem with the "sequence number" approach, and it is
one reason why I thought that, in general, a "tree transformation"
method would be preferable. It does not require each element to be
equipped with an ID value and can move entire classes of similar elements
by means of a single style property. Would the current HTML table
proposal, perhaps with the addition of an attribute to indicate the
"orientation" of the table, be sufficient, or is there a genuine need for
the ability to reorganise a table totally by means of ID values being
associated with each cell? I find it hard to envisage circumstances in
which such a complete reorganisation would be necessary, except where the
table markup is misused, and as mentioned earlier, such a practice should
not be tacitly endorsed by the WAI markup work.
