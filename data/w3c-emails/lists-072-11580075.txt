Agreed-- interactivity is essential.

Including the ability to read cell contents where the contents span more than
  one line of the visual display.
The fact that table cell sometimes span many lines of a visual display is a
  formatting artifact that is  a consequence of the constraints of the display
  width etc.
and the seech user should not be penalized for that.

Yes-- though there is a notion of a "table cell"in HTML, browsers expose this
       minimally if at all and most screenreaders are completely unaware of
       the concept.

Let me add a few:

1) Before starting to navigate the user needs to have an idea of the table
  dimensions --number of rows and columns.
If a cell has an embedded table, the user needs to be alerted to that when
  dimensions --number of rows and columns.moving to that cell.

row and column spans are an interesting challenge.

Given knowledge of the table dimensions the user needs to be able to navigate
  dimensions --number of rows and columns.either using relative movement (left
  dimensions --number of rows and columns.right up down)
or using absolute  goto movements ie goto cell i,j

Columnal movement is typically hard in today's HTML since it has such a strong
  dimensions --number of rows and columns.row-oriented bias.
Again most of the enhancements here need to come from the user agents.

I'll leave the requirement/optional nature of goto open-

In addition, many tables are not meaningful unless the user has the ability to
produce customized renderings where these minimally include speaking a cell
with its row/column headers and in the ideal world include renderings of the
form
"Total population growth in %s was %s " cell (i,2) , cell (i,1)
