My current rough take on the situation is that there is inadequate
support for the "keys" kind of relationship as discussed in 

   more on TABLEs

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-hc/1997OctDec/0004.html

and that it's worth defining default rules and explicit markup to
support both this and its companion "is-a" kind of relationship
that I suspect is covered sufficiently with AXIS and AXES.  The
defaults can be made more effective if we have predefined class
names for row-major, column-major, etc. classes of tables.

That "rough take" comes with lots of caveats, like:

I need to do as you did and go over the current draft closely again.

I don't consider this message an explanation, just a pointer to
a potentially useful concept.
