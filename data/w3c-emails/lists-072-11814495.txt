The idea of OPTGROUP is a way to represent a group of semantically
related options. In menus, this is often done using a horizontal
rule. In forms by a group box.  In some sense there is a similarity
between SELECT and UL.  Each describes an unordered list of things,
however its not practical to nest SELECT elements like UL in an LI
since this screws up current browsers. The OPTGROUP element is a
clean work around.

Pull-right is a visualization tactic. The abstraction is the
key thing for HTML. Each OPTION element must be unique but
several can have the same caption text provided they differ
in the value attribute. The uniquenes requirement is because
we can't easily extend SELECT to have hierarchical values
without problems for existing browsers. The OPTGROUP technique
will give us what we want though for accessibility.

Please let me know if you feel this is a sufficient priority
for HTML 4.0. We would have to put a clear case to the HTML-WG
togther with our proposal. Something which doesn't effect 
the code for visual browsers would be easier to get agreement
on.
