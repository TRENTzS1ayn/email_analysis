My sense is that this is in the middle zone of priority where the
full consultative process is required to find the right choice of
action.

It is important enough for the disabled users so that we as the
HC tiger team should not quietly take it off the table.  But we
need to substantiate the importance through discussing the issue
with the IG.  And we could wind up deciding that we don't want to
go for a 4.0 change because anything we can negotiate at this
late date is incompatible with what we really want to do
eventually.
