Rectangular and non-rectangular areas can be dealt with
using the axes attribute on the cells in question to
specify the headers that describe them. The proposed scope
attribute is a simplification. I am worried that an approach
based on row and column numbers will be brittle and subject
to problems as tables are modified.

You are right about sharing vocab etc. I think that Daniel D. 
expects us (WAI-HC) to come to a consensus on the changes required
to HTML 4.0 which can then be formally used to justfify these
changes to the HTML-WG. 

If we find we want to use more than a few examples, I suggest
we consider writing a separate NOTE describing best practice
for creating accessible tables.
