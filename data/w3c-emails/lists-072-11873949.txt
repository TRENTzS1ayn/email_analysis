I don't think that is browser behavior.  Tags that are not recognized
are ignored.  Content of unrecognized elements, on the other hand is
displayed because their containers are ignored and the content could
as well be text/plain.

I don't understand why plain text as content in an OBJECT doesn't have
the same problem with old browsers as plain text in the content of
a MAP.  I hope Dave can clarify this point.

I believe that for LONGDESC to be a solution, there must be some default
browser behavior defined.  I believe that there is not consensus on this
point, nor on what the default behavior is.   There is a smaller issue
as to whether the HTML spec or a separate document is the place to 
publish the default behavior.

That point will generate more discussion, you will need to explain it.
