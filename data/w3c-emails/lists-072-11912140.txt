That may be the only option.

It makes all the difference in the world to the writer of that
resource what is going to be done with it.  If it is an inline
like <OBJECT DATA=...> you do one thing.  If it is going to be
turned into a link, you write something else.  For a hypertext
resource that will be browsed as its own page, you may well
include a reminder on how to get back using your browser "back"
function, or you include lots of pro-forma stuff that goes with
being a page on your site.  This would not be included in a
resource designed to be applied inline.

From the author perspective it is unacceptable to have no idea of
what "normally" is going to happen with what you are writing.
If you can't tell the authors that, they likely won't write it.
We will be more effective if we can be reasonably definite.
