Here is an example where we need to go to all the technicians
fast, because the uncertainty is "what's the best way to do this"
and not "will the IG want us to do this."  That is 

Provide a capability to associate a TABLE with a
resource which provides additional information concerning
the data in the table.

There is one possible implementation of this capability which is to
use (in the HEAD of the document containing the table):

<LINK REL="dictionary" TARGET=the-ID-of-the-table 
 HREF=the-URI-for-the-resource >

This uses existing syntax in a possibly non-conflicting way.  The
text of the spec would have to be restated to broaden the usability
of TARGET in LINK.  If there is an actual problem with that, there
is another possible implementation by putting the LINK without
a TARGET inside the TABLE or adding an attribute to TABLE.

All of this we would prefer be done in a fashion which is cooperative
with but not dependent on the best use of RDF.  The fastest way
to make that happen is that an RDF expert get involved.  I could
take a stab at it by reading their documents but that would get
done "some day."
