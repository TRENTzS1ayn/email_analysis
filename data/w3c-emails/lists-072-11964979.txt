As a result, I don't see how OBJECT gives us a conditional
hypertext block that gets inlined when the image is not displayed
and hidden when the image is displayed (but accessible to an
off-screen model by attribute query).

We may need to define both LONGDESC for a normally-minimized
(i.e.  displayed on the current page as a link, sometimes) HTML
resource and ALTSRC which is defined as an URL to be inlined in
lieu of the image when the image is not displayed.  We would then
have to change the completeness rules so that either ALT or
ALTSRC was required, not ALT is required regardless.
