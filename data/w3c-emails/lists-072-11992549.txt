I had not considered using AXES to point at a TD because as
defined in the current draft this is illegal.  If we changed the
semantics of AXES so that it could point to TD and TH, to either
a coordinate value or an axis definition, then at least we could
connect all the connections we need.  But it's worth the extra
attribute to keep these separate.

In the "multidimensional space" metaphor, I think it is
sufficiently valuable to distinguish between references to a
coordinate [value] and [the definitions of some] axes so that the
markup should make this distinction known.

We could mark what I call a KEY link with the attribute name
COORDS for "coordinates" and leave AXES for references to axis
definitions as currently stated in the draft.  COORDS gets a list
of IDs of cells containing data values and AXES gets a list of
IDs of cells containing field descriptions or coordinate
definitions.

At least that gives us a name for what I think is missing that
goes better with AXES.
