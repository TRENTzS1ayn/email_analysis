If nobody in the Interest Group responds, this item is dead as a WAI
proposal.  I can see reasons why it could be good for the blind, and
reasons why it could be bad.  Without a positive response, I don't think
that we should ask HTML to change, here, in the name of the WAI.

What blind users use heavily in Lynx are:

Tabbing through the clickables (anchors and form fields).

Moving to things by string-matching

Numberwise navigation among the clickables plus top/bottom.

Through the efforts of various volunteers but particularly one
low-vision programmer, these have been extended with good effect
to navigation among OPTIONs within SELECT lists.

It is not clear that folding the list wouldn't just confuse things.

I don't know.  We have to go to the Interest Group with out ears
open on this one.
