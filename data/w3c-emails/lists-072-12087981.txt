A yet more minimal way to get to the same capability would be to
use LH or equivalent between OPTIONs.  The browser can fold at
these points, and number linearly or hierarchically.

The example would look like


<form>
  <p>Nested selections
  <select name=pizza>
    <lh>size</lh>
      <option>medium
      <option>large
    <lh>toppings</lh>
      <option>onions
      <option>meat balls
  </select>

</form>

This may have the advantage of getting the group label displayed in 
legacy browsers as opposed to the NAME attribute which hides
except in new releases.

PS: if the OPTGROUP container is what we recommend, the attribute
name should better be LABEL in preference to NAME.
