Thanks for posting your strawman attribute definitions.  I would
like to see examples and motivation for these.  An important point
to remember is that we won't be able to get authors to deal with
accessibility features unless these features are very simple to
understand and easy to author. At first glance your strawman appears
to fail this test.
