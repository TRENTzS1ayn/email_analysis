I would think graphical browsers would make it a link if the image is
displayed, or include the text inline (preferably in a box to indicate
it stands alone from the 'normal' text) if image loading is off.

Default for non-graphical browsers would be to include it inline - setoff
in some manner from the surrounding text.
