Sorry for the delay, I've been at InterOp...

Once upon a time Dave Raggett shaped the electrons to say...

That - and for simple backwards compatibility with the existing userbase -
is why I took pains to make the proposal compatible with the 4.0 browsers.

If a graphical browser chooses to do nothing special with axis/axes on a
TABLE it shouldn't be a problem.  Nor should it be a problem if they ignore
the OPTGROUP in a SELECT.

>A compromise is to get the HTML-WG to agree to something like:
><form>

>  <select name=pizza>
>    <optgroup name=size>
>      <option>medium
>      <option>large
>    <optgroup name=toppings>
>      <option>onions
>      <option>meat balls
>  </select>
></form>

I don't see how this is substantially different from the original proposal
for basic organization, and it does not appear to allow for the hierarchy
development.

<SELECT name="ComOS">
<OPTGROUP id="master1" axis="Product Type" value="Comm Servers">
<OPTGROUP id="master2" axis="Product Type" value="Routers">
<OPTGROUP id="group1" axes="master1" axis="Model" value="PortMaster 3">
<OPTGROUP id="group2" axes="master1" axis="Model" value="PortMaster 2">
<OPTGROUP id="group3" axes="master2" axis="Model" value="IRX">
<OPTION axes="group1" axis="ComOS">3.7.1
<OPTION axes="group1 group2" axis="ComOS">3.7
<OPTION axes="group1 group2" axis="ComOS">3.5
<OPTION axes="group3" axis="ComOS">3.7R
<OPTION axes="group3" axis="ComOS">3.5R
</SELECT>

I view the use of 'name' on OPTGROUP as misleading.  Authors will expect
that to be returned from the form because of convention, and it will not
be for all existing clients.

I'm questioning the use of 'value' for the text as in my proposal - I was
thinking 'title' might be better.  But I'm concerned that title may be
used for something else - though I don't see what personally.  Opinions?

This is similar to my old 'nest' proposal and suffers the same problem - 
what do you do when a selection is viable under multiple subgroups?  It
will appear multiple times in the collapsed list on older UAs.  And what
does it mean to select it in one place but not in another?

As in my example, where the OS revision 3.7 can be applied to multiple
classes of HW.

>A name attribute o the OPTGROUP can be used to label the

I do not believe it should be.  Primarily for compatibility.

My thoughts exactly.

>since even if the option caption is the same, you can use
>the value attribute to distinguish them.

But what about when they are truly the same thing?  This can be 
accounted for programmatically in the CGI.  But having it appear multiple
times in the SELECT is undesireable.
