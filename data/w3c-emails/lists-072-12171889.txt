I think there is a need to use a container to create hierarchies of SELECT
elements. This structure can not be captured if the grouping elements
(OPTGROUP, LH or whatever one chooses to call them) can not be nested.
Authors would, of course, be required to ensure that all of the SELECT
elements in each category are contained within the relevant grouping
element.
