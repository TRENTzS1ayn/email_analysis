I agree with Megazone (sorry I lost your real name) that his proposal
is superior as it allows for nesting and sharing of options.

What I don't really get in Dave's or Al's proposal is if the focus is
just simplicity so that the browser can implement it more easily, or
because browser can ignore it altogether ?

It looks to me that even Dave's proposal of 
<!ELEMENT optgroup O O (option+)>
woudl require visual browser to do something.
