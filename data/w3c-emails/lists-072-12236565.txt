If arbitrary nesting is needed (this isn't clear) its a simple
matter to make the end tag for OPTGROUP required. You can then nest
OPTGROUPs as needed. This does need a decision now, though, since it
has to be part of the DTD.

Perhaps, but then again, at some point we may want to return it in a
revision to the form spec. Using 'label' as suggested by Al Gilman
would be ok.

This can be easily handled in the server script, and indeed it may
be useful to know in which context the selection was made.
