This is an interesting approach for this example.  But I think I see some
problems.   And we would need to find out how to do this with specification.
We can't have specification by example. 

 

I don't think this one actually is a sensory experience.   It is the
presentation of specific information.   The "big blue marble" picture of the
earth may be-but not these.   They just fall in the category of hard to
describe in a reasonable number of words.   (someone want to poke their head
up into live fire and suggest what 'reasonable number of words" would be?)
Hence the problem.

 

This also doesn't deal with the issue of aggregated content in general. 

 

But we need to figure out a way to describe this or people could claim that
other images are just sensory experiences too.   It is  a slippery slope

Actually, I think the approach Yvette suggested yesterday would work better
than just declaring such pages to be beyond the scope of conformance.

 

Yvette suggested that such images-- real-time feeds of satellite imagery--
could be treated *as if* they were content whose purpose is to create a
specific sensory experience (i.e., like music or painting): the requirement
would be to provide a brief text label or description.

 

That text label or description could be built automatically by a script,
using the identifying information that accompanies the image in the
satellite feed.  The text label could be coded as an alt attribute, or the
alt attribute could be null (alt="") and the identifying text could be
written to the screen of an HTML page which would be used to display the
image.  (It would be necessary to place the image on a page in order to
provide the text label; this would have the added benefit of allowing a
meaningful <title> element for the page as well).

 

We may want to consider adding a phrase about real-time feeds to 1.1, or we
may just want to handle this through examples.  (This one might make a good
example because it involves several technologies and their techniques: XHTML
and scripting at the very least, with no room for direct human intervention
to write alt text, etc.)

 

Or maybe this one really belongs under 1.2?

 

 

-- On a more theoretical (or at least more abstract) note, isn't there a
sense in which most Web content is aggregated content?  It's been true for
years now that Web pages may include content that resides at multiple URIs
on multiple machines.  It's the magic of the rendering agent that makes it
all appear to be on the same page.  (I'm thinking even of very simple pages
where text from one file is combined with images in other files on other
servers that may be halfway around the world.)

 

This has been part of the concept of hypertext from the very beginning: Ted
Nelson called it "transclusion" back in the '80s, and I believe there was a
similar notion in Engelbart's NLS/Augment system back in the '70s.

I think the answer comes from our 'scoping' approach which allows you to
specify which parts of your site conform at what levels. (see decision from
about 3 weeks ago).

 

Regulators may want to specify that specific parts of a site or specific
types of content conform to level but our current approach is that our
guidelines do not.    

 

We may later have a doc which makes suggestions on issues like this - but we
do not currently have this as part of our guidelines per recent discussions
and decisions.

This is similar to the problem I face at AOL.  How does a content aggregator
conform to these standards?

I received the following inquiry from someone who works at a state agency
here in Texas.  It presents an interesting challenge, and it seems like
something that might furnish a good example for us. I'm also curious to know
what solutions members of WCAG WG would propose in order to meet WCAG 2.0.

 

<begin query>

Our agency receives satellite photographs of Texas that are automatically
formatted into jpegs and loaded to our Web site. These images are real-time,
from one-hour to about 12-hours old. These are continually and automatically
updated on the site.

I have an opportunity to review these Web pages now because they are being
revised to add additional types of satellite photos. It's my job to make
recommendations regarding the content's usability and whether it meets state
Web site accessibility standards. 

On these pages, the user selects up to four different parameters (using drop
down lists) and then clicks a "display image" button. A jpeg is returned to
them in their browser. 

Since these images are automatically updated, alt text specific to each
photo can not be added. And I'm not really sure how they could be
descriptive enough, anyway. Besides, the photos are not presented inside Web
pages, they are just the jpeg files.

The state rule says we should provide an alternative format for pages that
are not accessible. I don't think that is possible in this case. Would you
suggest some disclaimer text on the page stating that these images are not
accessible?

</end query>

 

Thanks!

John
