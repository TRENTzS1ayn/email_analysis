To support arbitrarily nested menus, you can change the OPTGROUP
element to act as a container, e.g.

<!EMPTY select - - (optgroup|option)+>
<!ELEMENT optgroup - - (optgroup|option)+>
<!ELEMENT option - O EMPTY>

This change means that authors are required to supply the end tag
for OPTGROUP.

I don't understand Daniel's last comment. Existing visual browsers
happily ignore the OPTGROUP elements. New versions of these browsers
could continue with the same treatment, but we would recommend that
they showed the menu structure.

NOTE not all user interfaces support slide-right nested menus. 
This may cause sufficient problems to make it unwise to recommend
hierarchically nested select menus.
