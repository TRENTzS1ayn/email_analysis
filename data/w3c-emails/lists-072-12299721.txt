I concur.  While it might be nice to think authors will always use TH for
header info and TD for real data, this is not the case.  Since browsers
generally center and bold the TH content, many authors use TD when this
is not desirable.  And many sites use TH for data when they want to call
it out - say a table of data on competing products.  Using TH for your own
products makes them stand out.

Is this proper usage?  Not really.  But it is what people do.  I do not 
believe we can really draw semantic lines between TH and TD - and that
they should share all attributes.

They do at this time, yes.

I too have not clearly understood Al's objections to axes and axis.  I don't
see applications where these - with the addition of SCOPE and hopefully a
way to link in metadata - are insufficient.
