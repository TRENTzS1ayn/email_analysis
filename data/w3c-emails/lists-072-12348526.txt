Is there consensus in this working group that, aside from the need to
reserve CLASS values for indicating whether a table should be read across
the rows or down the columns, the reading order issue would best be
addressed by style sheets? In particular, tree transformation properties,
and possibly other mechanisms if necessary, should be added to CSS so as
to enable the reading order of a document to be modified according to the
nature of the output medium. The existing CLASS and ID attributes offer a
sufficient means of identifying structural components of the document for
this purpose.
