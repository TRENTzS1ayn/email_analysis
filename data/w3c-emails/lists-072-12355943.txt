>Jason asking for consensus
 the reading order issue would best be
addressed by style sheets? In particular, tree transformation
properties,
and possibly other mechanisms if necessary, should be added to CSS so as
to enable the reading order of a document to be modified according to
the
nature of the output medium. 


Wholeheartedly.
'The way it is read' is a presentation issue. Hence rightly belongs in
CSS.
