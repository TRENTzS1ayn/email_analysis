I've pointed this out before and I'll reiterate:

1) Tree transformation and the like --especially in rearranging content in an
   aural presentation where the ordering is different from that in the visual
   presentation are too heavy weight an operation for today's CSS
   mechanism. These are better and more cleanly dealth with using DOM
   (Document Object Model) and perhaps XSL or a future revision of CSS.
   Simply throwing in a bunch of attributes into today's CSS will simply not
   work and prove costly in the long run

I would advocate taking the design Dave Ragget proposed a few days ago on this
list as an intermediate solution for improving (even if not completely solving)
the table navigation and presentation problem which today poses a major
accessibility roadblock on the WWW.
