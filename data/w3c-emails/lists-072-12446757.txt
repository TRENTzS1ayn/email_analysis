Dave,

I think this is working.

Can you take a whack at folding the two TABLE drafts together?

I would like to ask that you upgrade "there is interest" to
"the W3C should ensure" as regards the link to external data
dictionary (or eq.).  We can question the level of interest
during the week with the IG.

I have some stuff from Daniel and Jason and will merge that
with what you sent on "LONGDESC and friends."

How many of the others are you planning to draft?

-- Al
