This is indeed the kind of scenario which I had principally in mind,
except that it should not be restricted to the use of SPAN and DIV
elements, but must extend to any container which can be selected on the
basis of a CLASS or ID value. CSS properties can then be defined that will
enable such units of text to be moved into other locations within the
document's structure.

I agree. However, with the increasing availability of CSS, authors are
likely to turn toward style sheets and away from abuse of table constructs
as their principal formatting mechanism. Thus, one can expect this problem
to diminish in importance as style sheets achieve greater acceptance. We
should be careful not to entrench the abuse of tables by acknowledging it
in markup development, thereby running counter to the aims of the entire
HTML standardisation process.
