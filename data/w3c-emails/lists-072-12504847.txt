Judy,

To keep the Interest Group from being inundated with messages,
why don't you just include the following fragment in your
introduction on process?  Then we can fire off the four surviving
discussion-starters and we are on our way.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
You will shortly be receiving messages setting the stage for
discussion in four areas where we have questions and know that
the conclusions reached by the HC group should be reviewed.
These have symbolic names to help keep the discussion threads
straight.

These areas are:

OPTION    Making SELECT structures with lots of OPTIONs comprehensible

TABLE     Making TABLEs comprehensible

DESC      Text associated with images

REF       Associating HTML contents with external documents
          (and similar LINK and META extensions)

There are background readings for all the HC group's recommendations 
indexed in the web page with URL

  http://www.w3.org/WAI/group/HC/guide.html

In addition to the four major areas listed above, this guide
contains a summary of the conclusions on a few other issues where
the results are less likely to stimulate discussion.  Feel free
to discuss any issue you feel needs to be clarified.  We are
priming the pump only in the above four areas.

Issues written up in the guide but not represented in the four
topic areas above are:

     Preserving the logical reading order of text
     Images used as list bullets
     Range of MEDIA values
     Controlling dynamic features

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
