One issue I'd like to raise - and maybe it shouldn't emane from the
WAI but as a direct input to the HTML-WG - is the issue of overloaded
HTML attributes, 'class' in particular. 

For instance, if one wants to declare a TABLE as being both of
class=record and class=cost, it's impossible, since SGML only allows
for one attribute setting (someone told me that someday, correct and
ignore this message if this isn't true).

As a result, CSS cannot specify different presentation properties for
both 'record' and 'cost' classes of table.

My suggestion would be to extend the class syntax to allow for a
comma-separated list of values: class="record, cost" and have the user
agent parse it accordingly. 

The wording in CSS would beed to be extended to understand this list
of values of course.

Comments.
