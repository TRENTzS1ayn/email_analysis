CLASS takes a list already:

                           The global structure of an HTML document (p27 of 39
   class = [180]cdata-list
          This attribute assigns a class or set of classes to a specific
          instance of an element. Any number of elements may be assigned
          the same class name or names. They must be separated by white
          space characters.

Now, the fact that AXIS doesn't do the same _is_ a bug.
