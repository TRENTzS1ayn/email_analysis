I think it's ready to go.

I'd like to make clear that we are hoping that RDF will be the
answer to all our problem, but if not, this is the kind of
functionality we want.

Maybe moving up the "I keep hearing that RDF.." sentence in the
PROPOSAL section is enough.

In any case, we need to change the I in We in the above sentence.
