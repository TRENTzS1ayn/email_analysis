Al, 

I still think we need an umbrella message to the list, to provide context
for the discussion-starters.  It could very simply be an un-linked version
of the HC guide page, which maps the different issues which have been under
consideration.  Not everyone is going to go to the web site when they get
their mail, and those who don't may be puzzling on how the whole thing fits
together.  After the amount of very good work that the HC team has done,
I'd prefer to deliver it directly into people's hands.  

My one concern with the guide page is what happens when one follows the
link to WAI/group/HC, where the first two links are to confidential
consortium pages (HTML, and CSS, and BTW the HTML 4.0 link is broken right
now.)  For IG members who are not W3C members, this may cause frustration
and questions about blocked access; for IG members who happen to also be
W3C members and can therefore get directly to these sites, it may appear as
though the IPO/WAI is breaking a cardinal rule of member access,
particularly to those who've stored their passwords so they're not
re-prompted if they move in and out of the links.      

This is a sensitive area of coordination between IPO/WAI and the other W3C
activities.  Perhaps the best way to fix it would be to just remove the
reference to the source materials on that page.  I looked through the other
links and did not find other internal links.  I'm also assuming that the HC
archives which are now public access do not have confidential material in
them; let me know if you think otherwise.

I'll give a separate reply to this message with my draft "preamble."

Thank you to all on the HC team for the hard work; I expect the
discussion-starter pieces in particular will be very helpful as IG members
start to look over the materials.

Regards,

Judy
