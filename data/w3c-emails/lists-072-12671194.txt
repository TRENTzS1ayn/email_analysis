I guess we could extend AXES to support this. The question then is
what syntax?  Space separated lists are conventional in SGML, but
this presupposes the list items are single words. I would prefer to
use a comma as the delimiter in this case to give authors more
flexibility in choosing axis names, the motivation being the ability
to use the axis name in "explanations" of the table structure.
