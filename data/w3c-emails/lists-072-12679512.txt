We could stick to the space-separated list of lexical atoms and if
we want to put in long equivalents we use Jason's XML dictionary
format (e.g.) in foreign-language fragments like the STYLE
definitions in the HEAD of a page.  Or maybe this is even legal
CSS to apply optional expansions in some CSS2 utilities that
higher-level stylesheets can exploit.
