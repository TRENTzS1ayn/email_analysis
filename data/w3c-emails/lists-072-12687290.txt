If the truth be known, what I really think about AXIS is that
it is just CLASS under another name and can be dropped.

I don't see enforceable semantics above and beyond CLASS that
goes with calling a name or string an AXIS.  If you had an AXIS
one-word term, it would be a legal and appropriate use of CLASS.
I think that our best deal is to go forward with a free-for-all
of one-word class designators and when we hit a collision we
disambiguate the term by a LINK tying the element holding an
ambiguous CLASS term to a lexicon resource in which the correct
definition of that CLASS term is given.

And, as I said before, the CLASS attribute should be just short
keys to the classes and long forms are dictionary business.
