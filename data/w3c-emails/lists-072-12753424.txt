AXIS and CLASS should be kept distinct. The possibility of a conflict
between a category name and a class used by a style sheet, is significant
enough to justify a separate AXIS attribute as proposed in the HTML 4.0
draft. The table markup should be as simple as possible, whilst providing
the flexibility that is needed for effective audio rendering. I would
therefore discourage excessive dependence on dictionaries or other
external data formats. Such supplements to the markup are useful
extensions, but should not be essential to the representation of the
table's structure.
