Interesting issue.

I would suggest that that issue is a prime example of what we
want the Interest Group to discuss.  Why don't you raise these
considerations on the IG list.

I am not willing to say that we should 100% stop talking here in
private, but we should be mingling with the broader group and
trying to stimulate thought and discussion in the plenary
setting.  A bias in favor of public (i.e. on the IG list)
discussion should be maintained.
