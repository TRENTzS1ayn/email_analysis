I took the "Community Courses -- Bath Autumn 1997" example and
rewrote a parallel version with AXES as if there were no SCOPE
attribute in the language.

It might be worth mentioning the pair to the Interest Group.

These are presently in

  http://www.access.digex.net/%7Easgilman/web-access/TABLE/

and their file names are, using scope: 

  crsbath.htm 

and using AXES to connect all the relationships that the SCOPE markup
covers: 

  crsax.htm

I took the liberty to add an ABBR to the de-facto row head, and to
change the summary slightly to avoid a possibly misleading
connotation.

Did I get the parallel right?
