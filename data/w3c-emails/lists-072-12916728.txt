I must admit that I do not understand why the proposed attributes are
named AXIS and AXES. It is a geometrical metaphor which is not obvious to
the uninitiated. I am inclined to agree with Al that the names could be
changed, but would like to know what the original motivations for the
names AXIS and AXES were.
