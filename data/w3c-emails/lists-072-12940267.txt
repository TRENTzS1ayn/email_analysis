The intent of the scope/axes attributes is to allow authors
to provide the associations between headers and the cells
to which they apply. It turns out that the distinction between
header and data isn't quite so clean. Some cells act as both.
What matters is the ability to describe a cell's content in
terms of what other cells relate to it.

Yes - but this is only a matter of convenience, and a consequence
of the way many tables just happen to be layed out. Scope and
axes give the exactly the same information -- the associations
between header and data cells.

I don't see why. All you get is a means to associate headers with
other cells, including the means to define hierarchies of headers.
