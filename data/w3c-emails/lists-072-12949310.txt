The distinctions among a) data values that are not key b) data
values that are key and c) data descriptions for sets of data
values -- are all clear from best current practice in data
engineering and Object Oriented Analysis.

The usage of TH/TD has not been consistently aligned with the
actual semantics of the table contents.  That is HTML's problem,
not a problem with the concepts.

That is what you get.  That is not what you promise by the "axes"
name and discussion of the multidimensional space analogy.  Axes
are scales, are datatype definitions.  Not all the "headers" you
want to link to are axes.  The name promises stronger semantics
than the attribute provides.  It's a misnomer.
