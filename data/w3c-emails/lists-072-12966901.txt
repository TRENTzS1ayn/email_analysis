Its quite simple. The data cells are considered to hold values
at locations in a n-dimensional space determined by the values
of the headers that apply to each such cell.

The headers often form groups and correspond to marks along
a conceptual axis in this n-dimensional space. The axes attribute
for a cell then gives you the location for this cell in terms of
its location on each of the axes. The axis attribute on headers
is used to name which axis a given header belongs to.

A final consideration was that "axis" and "axes" are short,
something that is important for those of us that still use text
editors for HTML, a reasonable choice considering that current
wysiwyg HTML editors produce questionable markup as their output.


p.s. I fix up any typo's and tidy up the handwritten HTML
afterwards using a utility I hope to make available free from
early next year.
