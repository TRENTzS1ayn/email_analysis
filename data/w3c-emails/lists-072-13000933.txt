Not to mince words...

I started out thinking we could do full diff-equivalent
proposals.

Daniel wisely steered us toward a more design-level description.

The invividual proposals vary in how definitive or how motivated
they are in the written record.

We have assessed these as to need/benefit.  We expect y'all to
apply two grains of salt yet on implementation impact.

Please ask questions where anything is unclear.
