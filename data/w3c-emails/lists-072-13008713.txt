Firstly, I would like to reiterate Al's comment, that it is important for
the user to have ultimate control over the presentation of a document. Any
proposal which would limit the user's ability to suppress the audio
rendering of a particular part of the document is therefore completely
unacceptable.

I also agree that speech input is a function of the user agent and, for
the most part, need not be accommodated by the HTML markup. It is
important to note in this regard that the author of the document does not
know which language is being used for speech input. Some users, for
example, may be acquainted with several languages, but would configure
their speech recognition software to accept input in their preferred
language, which may not be the language of the document.

The idea of associating a voice file with a document may be useful, and it
adds further support to Al's linking proposal. However, such a capability
is of course open to abuse: if the audio file serves to add content,
rather than to replicate information that is already given in the HTML
document, then users with hearing impairments are seriously disadvantaged.
