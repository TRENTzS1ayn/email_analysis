Al, I agree with Dan that we need to send unambiguous recommendations to
the HTML WG.  Is it possible to summarize the HC WG results & IG review in
a more definitive way?

I realize after revisiting the status of the "Guide" that the first & last
paragraphs of my suggestions to Al & Daniel regarding transmission of the
report were contradictory (see first message below).

Dan, given our awareness of the HTML WG AC deliverable deadline of Oct 31,
I think our pointer to a timeline running through Nov 10 is in error.  

Dan, Dave, Daniel, & Al, are you available by any chance at 10 a.m. Boston
time tomorrow/Thursday, if I can get the MIT bridge, so we can resolve the
coordination issues on this quickly?

- Judy
