Very nice Jonathan.

We need an exception for spacers and perhaps some pure decorative -- but
maybe it is better to have a little decorative described than risk lots of
content that is counted as decorative.  Also may make testing easier.

Perhaps something from a note Mike Barta sent could be used to cover this
last point

I will post it right behind this.

Hi all
Here is a refined suggestion:

For non-text content, provide an equivalent text alternative.
If the text alternative cannot serve the same fuction or convey the same
information, provide a text label or a description.

Yvette's latest draft:
<suggestion>
For non-text content, provide text alternatives. Whenever possible the text
alternative should be equivalent to the non-text content, meaning it serves
the same function or conveys the same information as the non-text content.
If a text equivalent is not possible due to the nature of the non-text
content (for example: music and visual art), provide a text label or a
description.
