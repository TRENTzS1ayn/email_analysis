I think I'm the last champion of the more complex OPTION proposal -the
AXIS/AXES one.  I had started with a container proposal which evolved into
a non-container from feedback on the www-html list and others.  But now
it looks like the container proposal we're back to is a better choice.
Less complex for authors and implementors, and provides most of the 
functionality.

As editor on this proposal, unless someone raises an objection, I'm
ready to reduce it to the one final proposal.
