There is one thing about the HC position on MEDIA types that
may or may not be adequately stated in the report.

This is that we anticipate stylesheets will be developed which
are appropriate to the same base type but with different
parametric characteristics such as screen size and language.

We expect browsers to use the text in a media type indication
which follows the base type but comes before the
list-element-delimiting comma to resolve stylesheet selection
ambiguities in this case.  How they do that is not defined
in what we propose to be the provisions of the HTML 4.0 
specification.  [We are developing browser guidelines that
refine the browser behavior provisions of the language spec.]

At one point the HTML spec had language saying that browsers
"should ignore" all marks in the media type indication except
the base type.  This is too strong for what we see as the
right stylesheet-selection rules.

and the thread around it.
