... some history of HTML WG/WAI WG

WAI HC WG 22 Oct deliverable: Proposed HTML 4 changes:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/group/HC/report.html

Dave Summarizes:

1. TABLES
http://www.w3.org/WAI/group/HC/guide.html#TABLE
scope attribute new in 17 Oct draft
AXES attr renamed -> headers (not in 17 Oct draft)

2. OPTION
http://www.w3.org/WAI/group/HC/guide.html#OPTION
two proposals, neither is in 17 Oct draft
1: add OPTGROUP element in SELECT,
add LABEL attribute OPTION

2nd proposal: similar to AXES
2nd proposal is withdrawn. (Verified by Judy)

John: not sure about select MULTIPLE
ACTION John: details in email (don't forget to copy wai-hc,
as requested by http://www.w3.org/WAI/group/HC/report.html )


3. DESC
http://www.w3.org/WAI/group/HC/guide.html#DESC
LONGDESC is new in 17th Oct draft

4. MEDIA
http://www.w3.org/WAI/group/HC/guide.html#MEDIA
new value of MEDIA attribute "console" or "tty",
plus some changes to the prose explaining the
MEDIA attribute

Martin: defined by users or W3C?
Al gilman: in any case, not in HTML 4 spec.
Ed: future HTML 4 versions will be burdened with checking
for existing practice, unless we partition this
space of names
Martin: e.g. x-

other. REF
http://www.w3.org/WAI/group/HC/guide.html#REF
consensus in WAI HC WG around these is less clear
as of now, the are not going in HTML 4. Judy Brewer
(exclusively) is authorized to instruct the HTML 4 editors
of a change in the disposition of this issue
(and other WAI) issues.

Judy, Al leave...

Ed for Scott:
RESOLVED: yes, add DEFER per Scott's proposal

45: Steve, John against
ACTION Ed: follow up with scott

51: Add "type" (mimetype) attribute to LINK and A?
RESOLVED: yes, proposal carries

>    * 52: Chris, Martin, Misha.

Misha: yes,
Ed: no, keep it lower

RESOLVED: no
(as it is editorial, possibly re-raise during PR review)

>    * 53: Dave, Arnaud, John, Vendors

Current (971017) spec: caption at beginning and end
Proposed: only at the beginning

Steve P: no; beginning and end
John/MITRE: yes; only at the beginning
Ed: yes; only at the beginning
EDF: beginning and end.
Dave ragget: yes, only at the beginning
Benjamin/NS: no, beginning and end

... much discussion, no consensus emerging
chair asks if it's OK to just decide on behalf of the group
... seems OK

chair is unconvinced of the value of allowing caption at
the end, takes the minimalist position:

RESOLVED: only at the beginning (proposal carries)

Issue: LI content model is restricted to %block;
chair: this seems like a silent change
Ed: what about DIV and BODY? Is raw text allowed to begin
their content?
chair: no, but I believe that change was made
consciously by the group

... some discussion of history; chair regrets that the history
is not documented sufficiently clearly, and we
have to revisit this anew.
... more discussion...

RESOLVED: <li> and <td>, INS DEL have to be %flow;
(i.e. (%inline;|%block)*)

some question about <DIV>; for now, stays %block;.

Add a note to the spec: prose describes strict DTD,
except for explicit exceptions


>    * 69: Chris

currently the spec suggests that a UA might the display
of the " characters in:
<span lang="fr">abc "def" ghi</span>
as french quotes.

RESOLVED: the spec should not suggest this possibility

RESOLVED: Q element behaves as per 2070, i.e. a UA should
display language-sensitive quote characters where
<q> and </q> appear. e.g.
<span lang="en-us">He said, <q>I'll be Back.</q></span>
should appear as
He said, "I'll be Back."

[post-hoc note from DSR: the 971017 spec already says this]

............

For remaining issue, the chair is empowered to decide
them.

ACTION Dan: announce a decision on all issues remaining
on the issues list today

WG members can argue to change the chair's decision, but for
the period from now until 31 Oct (or 27 Oct, really) open
issues are to be decided by the chair.


Our next meeting is face-to-face. See:
http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Group/9711/ftf

Note the 28 Oct 97 deadline for drafts to be discussed at
the meeting.
