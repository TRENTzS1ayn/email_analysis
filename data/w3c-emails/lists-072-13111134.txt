I realise that I am making this suggestion far too late in the WAI HTML
review process, but in any case it is not of major importance by
comparison with the other problems that have been occupying our attention
recently.

The PRE element in HTML is somewhat anomalous, in that it is intended to
preserve the line breaks and spacing of the enclosed text. Such a
rendering can not be supported by braille devices, unless a code for
computer notation is used which provides a specific means of representing
line endings and space characters. Such a code is intended to represent
the text of computer programmes.

Similarly, audio user agents are
 not likely to inform the user of the spacing and line breaks which are
presented in a PRE element. Braille translation software needs to
determine whether the preformatted material is meant to be treated as
programme code or as ordinary text (in a natural language). This
requirement can be met by setting aside a CLASS value: 

<pre class="code">
program pascal_sample;
begin
writeln ("This is a programme written in the Pascal language");
[...]
end.
</pre>

A braille translator, recognising the reserved class name, would process
this text as computer notation.

However, in the HTML 4.0 draft, there is an example of a poem which has
been formatted using the PRE element. In such cases, the braille software
should treat the text as natural language, and would need to ignore the
spacing and line breaks.

These considerations lead to the following question: should a comment be
included in the description of PRE, which explains that non-visual user
agents may ignore the spacing and line breaks in this element's content?

As I have explained, a braille formatter will not always ignore the
spacing of preformatted text, which can be represented, if necessary,
using the braille code for computer notation. However, as the poetry
example indicates, this is not always appropriate; and of course, audio
devices are likely to ignore the spacing in any case.
