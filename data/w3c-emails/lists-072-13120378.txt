In the minutes of the recent HTML WG audio call, there was said to be a
need to "partition the name space" of media types. As I understand it, the
intention is to reserve a media type called "other" (or an equivalent
name), and then to limit HTML user agents to the list of base types which
has thereby been established.

I do not understand the rationale behind this proposal, and nor is it
necessary. User agents should simply ignore any base type that (1) is not
one of the predefined base types in the HTML specification; and (2) has
not been defined by the style language which is currently in effect.

A minimally conforming HTML user agent would ignore any media type that is
not exactly one of the predefined types mentioned in the specification.

If any parameters are added to the base type which the user agent can not
interpret, then the resource to which the media type relates (E.G. a style
sheet) should not be accessed.
