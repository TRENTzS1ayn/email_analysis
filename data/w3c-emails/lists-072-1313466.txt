Personally, I do not think the either-or is explicit enough in Jonathan's
suggestion. It doesn't say the text label or description comes _instead_ of
the equivalent if the text alternative cannot serve the same function. I
know that it's implied, but I think we have to be explicit.

Gregg: I don't think we need an exception for spacers, that could go in the
gateway techniques. Jonathan's suggestion tells you to provide an equivalent
text alternative. We can tell people in gateway techniques that for spacers,
"" is the best equivalent text alternative.
