I think we are OK, here.

This was a comment from a participant.

The action taken was that this is on the list of topics where the
next step is for the editors to put our recommendations into the
document.  HTML Working Group members can challenge this on the
basis of what they read in our report, and other can challenge them
once they go public in the Proposed Recommendation.  But the
HTML WG policy is that what we said goes in unless someone takes
the initiative and can prove that there is a good reason not to.

The requirement of record that the editors are working from
states that we recommend that HTML user agents are _not_ limited
to the list of base types published in the HTML spec.

Almost.  

Replace "exactly" with "in its base type, extracted as per the
algorithm in the spec," and you are OK.

It is probably better that the user agent ignore the unknown
parameters, not the stylesheet, if it is for a known base type.
This is more in line with Internet and HTML tradition.

I believe that is the way what is headed for the editors' output
would work.

We get a cut at clarifying this in the Browser Guidelines.
