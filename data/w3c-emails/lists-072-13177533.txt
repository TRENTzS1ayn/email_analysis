Following yesterday's HTML WG meeting in which Judy, Al Gilman
and I presented the WAI proposals for HTML 4.0 I have drafted
the following text for the media attribute:

This bit is new:

  tty: intended for media using a fixed pitch character grid, such
  as teletypes, terminals, or portable devices with limited display
  capabilities. 

This bit has a one word change:

  3.  A case-sensitive match is then made with the set of media
      types defined above. Entries that don't match may be ignored.

Note the change from "should" to "may" in the last sentence.
