Thanks, Dave.

HC team: So far as I can see, this document chage meets the
requirements on which we had reached a rough consensus by the
22nd.

If you want to clarify the "Oct 22 consensus" please post to
w3c-wai-hc until Daniel and I are convinced that the consensus
needs to be clarified.

If we want to improve on what we had figured out by the 22nd,
we have to elevate the issue to Judy.

This is so the HTML editors can get on with their job, which
is non-small.
