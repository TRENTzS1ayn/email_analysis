I have finally had the time to review parts of your mail archive so
as to better understand the rationale behind your proposals.  I also
have read the 22-October version of the "Report" document
(http://www.w3.org/WAI/group/HC/guide.html) and its associated linked
documents.  I think I still only have part of the picture, but I hope
this answer will help fill in more of the details.

RDF will do two things that are of particular use here.  The first will
accomplish what the proposed TARGET attribute on LINK/META is intended
to do and the second will address a need that will become apparent as
the accessibility work continues, namely how to manage the LINK REL
namespace and the META NAME namespace.

An RDF 'assertions' element includes an HREF to specify the target
resource to which the metadata applies.  The value can be a URL
fragment, thereby assuming the proposed role of LINK TARGET.  At
present there is no shorthand syntax for indicating that the
target is the immediately enclosing element, nor is there currently
anything directly corresponding to the proposed TGTCLASS.

The TARGET/HREF idea relies on the use of ID to label the element
being described.  In the future, XLL (XML-link) should allow RDF
statements to be scoped even to portions of a read-only document
that were not given IDs by the document author.  The RDF annotations
in this case would be carried in a separate document.

The second important aspect of RDF in this context will allow
the WAI metadata specification to evolve independently of the
schedule for other specifications.  RDF allows you to declare,
for example, a "WAI metadata property namespace" wherein you
might start with a set of properties that associate data
dictionaries and pronunciation dictionaries and then later add
language variants of pronunciation dictionaries, abbreviation
dictionaries, and alternate descriptions without fear of
colliding with property names being used elsewhere.
