This is indeed what I had in mind, since the user agent can not in such a
case determine whether the output medium satisfies the requirements of the
style sheet. The problem can be exemplified as follows:

media="braille displayed 80" (a style sheet for an 80-cell braille
display).

Suppose that the user agent does not recognise the parameters, and
truncates the media type to:
media="braille"
and the output device is a braille embosser with a maximum of 40
characters per line. The style sheet includes properties that require text
to be positioned horizontally in columns 41-80.

Another solution, which might perhaps be better, would be to access the
style sheet, ignore the extra media type parameters, and then activate
error checking to ensure that none of the style properties results in
output that would exceed the capabilities of the hardware.

I do not recall reading any discussion of such error checking in the CSS
specification, but I may have overlooked it.
