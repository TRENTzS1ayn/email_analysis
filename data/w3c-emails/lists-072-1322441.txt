I don't know that it is implied. I think a text alternative needs to be
available always, although as Gregg notes below sometimes the most
appropriate is null text. But there is no reason not to have a description as
well for almost all text, although in some cases it is extremely low priority
and low value. In cases where the text alternative doesn't really achieve the
function of what it replaces, it is more important.
