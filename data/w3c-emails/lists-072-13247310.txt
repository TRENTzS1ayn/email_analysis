A related question is whether RDF can express the internal relations
within an HTML document so as to overcome the reading order issues
associated with fragmentation of the linear progression of the text (for
example, the abuse of table markup to indicate visual layout).

Clearly, there is substantial support within the interest group for this
capability, and it needs to be taken into account.

I am still of the opinion that the abuse of tables will disappear as style
sheets take hold, and their advantages in visual media are recognised.
HTML 4.0 is an important step in that direction, along with CSS 2, of
course. I would be willing to provide no support in the HTML for
alleviating the effects of present bad practices (the use of tables to
indicate visual formatting) in the expectation that those practices will
gradually cease over the next few years. This is one case in which short
term gain can perhaps be sacrificed for the benefit of a consistent design
in which presentation and markup are properly distinguished.
