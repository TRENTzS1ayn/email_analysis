Folks, I didn't render decisions on all the outstanding issues
on Thu like I said I would, so I'm extending the deadline
for comments from the WG to the editors to
Tuesday, 28 Oct 1997 23:59 EST

Until that time, please reserve w3c-html-wg@w3.org exclusively
for precise change requests to the HTML 4 draft (or
the WAI HC proposal) or precise arguments about precise
change requests.

In other words: if your message doesn't include:
1. A precice pointer to the section of
the document you want changed
(such as a full URL including date and #section-fragment,
and an excerpt of the current text)

2. Very clear instructions to the editors
regarding a proposal for change
(such as replacement text)

3. Supporting evidence such as pointers
to minutes, cost/benefit rationale, etc.

either from you or quoted in reply (such as
to say "no, don't make that change" or "please
refine that change as follows...), please don't
send it.

Feel free to send editorial suggestions (i.e.
items that you don't consider critical for the
31Oct PR milestone and that
you don't think affects the technical specification
to the point where it needs WG consideration) directly
to www-html-editor.

I still need to rule on quite a few issues both from the
issues list and raised in email in the last 2 to 6 weeks.
