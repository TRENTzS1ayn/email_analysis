Perhaps it should be worded slightly differently to say

non-visual user
agents may NEED TO ignore the spacing and line breaks in this element's 
content IN ORDER TO RENDER THE INFORMATION IN AUDITORY OR TACTILE (BRAILLE) 
MEDIA

or something like that

OK, as this is unlikely to be a controversial addition, I have added
the following text in to the spec:

  Non-visual user agents may ignore the spacing and line breaks in
  this element's content.

The spec previously left this unstated -- it only gave guidelines
for visual user agents.
