"workable" is relevant, but "interesting," "long-term,"
and "real-world" are not criteria upon which the HTML WG
is to review the WAI HC report.

Just to be clear, I repeat:

From: Dan Connolly <connolly@w3.org>

if you don't want the OPTION proposal as
stated to go in HTML4, please supply an alternative to address
the stated accessability requirement:

==========
Some HTML documents include forms with very long selection menus.
The large number of options on these menus makes them hard to browse
when using speech-based browsers or browsers that show a few words
at a time in a very large print.
==========

or argue in the WAI HC WG that this is not a requirement
for HTML4.
----------------

I've prepared full details about the WAI HC WG/HTML WG relationship
in another message.
