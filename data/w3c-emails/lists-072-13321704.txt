Actually, "long-term" is relevant. I spoke too soon.

But it doesn't override the accessability requirement.
To resolve the issue within HTML WG, you
have to provide an alternative. If you want to say
no to the proposal altogether, you have to talk
the WAI HC WG out of their stated requirement.

(And for the purposes of this discussion,
"wait until after 4.0" is the same as "no.")
