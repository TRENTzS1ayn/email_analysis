Er.. was there any particular reason not to meet by phone
in two weeks (6Nov97)? In light of recent developments, I'm inclined
to hold a meeting.

Let me know if you're interested in meeting by phone or not.
(don't copy w3c-html-wg).

If they ayes outnumber the nays by 2 to 1 and there are
at least 4 ayes (and there's no logistical reason
not to hold the meeting), I'll hold a teleconference.
