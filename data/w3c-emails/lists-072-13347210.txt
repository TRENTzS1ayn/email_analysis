Dear HC WG members,

The HTML WG is considering a change in Q-TAG, which could have an impact on
accessibility if the change is made, and so we have asked for review of
this if it goes in.  

Please watch your e-mail over the next day for this item, if it comes in,
Al will guide a quick turn-around for comment on this.  If you don't see
it, we're all set.

Thanks,

Judy
