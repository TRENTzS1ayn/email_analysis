Then why does this proposal define a rendering semantic that looks very
hierarchical to me?  If there needs to be a very simple grouping
mechanism, support a GROUP attribute (or something similar) on each
OPTION and not use a structural construct - everything with a shared
group can be logically grouped together and this is purely considered a
hint with  no suggested rendering semantic. The spec should define that
this grouping mechanism is to allow "chunking" of data, and we should
stay away from the hierarchical list concept and hierarchical grouping.
This leaves the door open to define a proper hierarchical list. Any
structural construct is going to limit any future proposal because we
will have created more compatibility issues. 

eg.

<SELECT>
  <OPTION GROUP="dark colors">Black
  <OPTION GROUP="dark colors">Navy
  <OPTION GROUP="light colors">White
</SELECT>

I thought my example serves as evidence that the proposal is under
specified and can't be implemented. Every time I reread the spec, I find
more issues and I have given many examples where the spec is missing
clear requirements. How much more evidence do I need?

I must be missing something about postponing this to another working
draft - what is the rush to put this in HTML 4.0 and what is the
objection to having another working draft post HTML 4.0 that addresses
this?
