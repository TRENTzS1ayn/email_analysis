Because that is the solution that most appealed to the
folks in the WAI HC WG that proposed it, I suppose.

Thank you for providing a counterproposal.

Dave? Al? Megazone? Comments?

Strictly speaking, all the rendering information in the
HTML spec is hints/suggestions; i.e. SHOULD, not MUST.
(I need to verify that, but that's my understanding.)

Adherence to "suggested rendering" stuff in the HTML spec
is a quality of implementation issue, not a conformance
issue.

So I expect that any solution to the long options list
problem will carry a "suggested rendering" but no
absolute requirements on user agents other than
treating the new syntax as conforming HTML, i.e. not
barfing.

Thanks for the details.

Sorry; I misunderstood. I took your SIZE=4 example as evidence
that the proposal was unclear, rather than evidence that it could
not be implemented.

While it may seem that this week is rushed, the process of
integrating WAI issues into HTML 4 has been going on since
the May meeting in Sophia.

The objection to moving WAI items post 4.0 is that HTML 4.0 is
the only scheduled deliverable of this working group. Anything
pushed past HTML 4.0 is at-risk.

Again, the history and "rules of engagement" are detailed at:
