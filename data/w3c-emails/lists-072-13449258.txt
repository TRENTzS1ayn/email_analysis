Scott,

I've been following the dialog on the OPTION issue and would like to update
the IPO/WAI Interest Group on the OPTION discussion, since they had
reviewed the HC WG recommendations before sending these to the HTML WG.

Is there a brief summary of your counter-proposal which I could excerpt for
the IPO/WAI Interest Group list-serve, which is public, so they could
consider this as well as the OPTION proposals they have already reviewed?

Regards,

Judy Brewer
