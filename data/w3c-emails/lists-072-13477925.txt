A point I'd like to make.  I tried to be careful in my wording to use
'may' or 'might' and not 'will' or 'should'.  The examples given are
just examples of possibilities.  Without them we found people had a harder
time understanding the grouping being done.  

There are a variety of ways the grouping could be handled - from ignoring
it and displaying as always, to inserting non-selectable elements as
labels, to doing a true tabbed index or expanding list.  We've tried to
avoid telling UAs how to render it.  But we want to provide structure so
that UAs that DO want to do something special have a standard, valid means
to do so.

This seems to be a slightly simplified version of the AXIS/AXES proposal.
Eliminating the OPTGROUP element.  It is actually something I'd though of
along the way.

But I think all of the objections to AXIS/AXES, which eventually caused us
to withdraw that proposal and go with a container element, would still hold.
It isn't as clear to users what is being grouped.  With a container it
is obvious how things are grouped.

And what about subgroups?  How would you run multiple Group elements?  This
appears to provide only one level of organization.

That is my understanding also.  And I have tried to word things carefully.

That's been our anticipation.
