Dan Connolly, chair of the HTML working group has ruled
that the 4.0 spec should strictly adhere to RFC2070
for the required treatment of the Q element which is
used for excerpts that are inlined as part of a paragraph.

My concern is that requiring browsers to insert quotation
marks around the contents of each <Q>...</Q> element will
strongly discourage authors from using this element.since
as most browsers don't yet do this, they will have to include
the quotatation marks in the content directly. Following Dan's
ruling would then lead to doubled up quotation marks. Which
in my opinion will put authors off.

The following messages were sent to the HTML-WG:
