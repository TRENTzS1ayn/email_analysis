Thank you for reminding me of this possibility. Unfortunately, most HTML
authors and style sheet creators would probably not think of it either,
unless of course it were documented in WAI markup guidelines. In any case,
I still prefer the Q element, which is specifically intended to represent
quotations and is included as part of HTML itself. It would be best for
accessibility if Q were used widely.
