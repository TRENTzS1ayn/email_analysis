I guess I am trying to avoid hierarchy and therefore sub-groups. I want
hierarchy, but the current proposal fails to address many of the issues with
hierarchy. 

I also disagree with the suggested rendering as it only addresses single
select lists (unless I missed something).  I still do not know how to handle
multi-select hierarchical lists, or lists with an undefined size. 

I mentioned the following in a mail that was not CC:ed to the WAI group:

Instead of recommending syntax changes to listboxes, why not add text to
HTML 4.0 with guidelines on how to properly use lists to make them more
accessible. This recommendation can also apply to radio button groups and
check box groups (they are no different than a list box in providing a list
of options to the user).
