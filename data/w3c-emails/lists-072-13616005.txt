Proposal:

<!ELEMENT OPTGROUP - - (OPTGROUP|OPTION)+ -- grouping for OPTION -->
<!ATTLIST OPTGROUP
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  disabled  (disabled)   #IMPLIED  -- control is unavailable in this context --
  label       CDATA      #REQUIRED -- for user in hierarchical menus --
  >

Draft:

<!ELEMENT OPTGROUP - - (OPTGROUP|OPTION)+ -- option group -->
<!ATTLIST OPTGROUP
  %attrs;                          -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  disabled  (disabled)   #IMPLIED  -- control is unavailable in this context --
  label       CDATA      #IMPLIED  -- for use in hierarchical menus --
  >


The WAI HC has label #REQUIRED on OPTGROUP, the draft has it IMPLIED.

Remember, OPTGROUP doesn't have any normal text associated with it.  The
context/grouping is provided by the label.  At least as we'd envisioned it.

Label is #IMPLIED on OPTION - it falls back to element content as it
always has.  But OPTGROUP doesn't have this fall back.

Is there value in grouping for the sake of grouping with no label?  What
is the implied value?
