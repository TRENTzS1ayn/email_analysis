Ugh.  My proposed rewording *shouldI have said:

Provide text alternatives for non-text content. The text alternative
should be equivalent to the non-text content, meaning that it serves the
same function or conveys the same information as the non-text content.  

A text label may be used to satisfy this guideline if one or more of the
following conditions is true:
1. The purpose of the non-text content is to create a specific sensory
experience (as in music or visual art)
2. The non-text content is generated, transmitted, and displayed in
real-time by automated means (as when spacecraft transmit images from
extraterrestrial locations)

(the difference is in the line about how a text label satisfies the
requirement-- I changed it from "A text label satisfies this requirement
when ..." to "A text label may be used to satisfy this requirement when
..."
  The earlier version seemed to describe conditions for the text label
itself, rather than specifying when it would be appropriate to use one.)

Another alternative proposal for rewording 1.1.  It still doesn't say
anything about spacers or "purely" decorative images (curlicues, etc.),
and I don't think the item about real-time content is quite right yet,
but maybe this will help.

I don't know that it is implied. I think a text alternative needs to be
available always, although as Gregg notes below sometimes the most
appropriate is null text. But there is no reason not to have a
description as well for almost all text, although in some cases it is
extremely low priority and low value. In cases where the text
alternative doesn't really achieve the function of what it replaces, it
is more important.
