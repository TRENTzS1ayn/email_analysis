I believe you are referring to rendering issues only. Can you
confirm this?  I would very much appreciate any evidence as to
how the proposal is inadequate on grounds unrelated to rendering.

I don't feel its appropriate for the HTML spec to make detailed
proposals for rendering. The example in the latest draft was only
intended to show the hierarchy and not intended as a suggested
rendering. In any case the HTML working group resolved not to add
new rendering attributes. There are many ways to present multiple
selection hierarchies, for instance with a hierarchical menu where
the currently selected choices are indicated by check marks, or by
a tree-view control that allows levels of detail to be expanded and
collapsed. If we want to give authors control over this I suggest
we start discussing extensions to CSS.

I will do my best to make the spec clearer on the accessibility
issues arising from long lists.
