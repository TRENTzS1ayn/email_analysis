I agree completely with Al's proposed response to the quotation issue. He
is also correct in his summary of its likely impact on braille and audio
user agents.

If this response is to be submitted to the HTML WG, it would also be
desirable to include a reference to the HC message thread on the subject,
so that interested parties can become acquainted with this problem from
the perspective of braille and audio representations.

I agree with Al's general sentiment that we are here concerned with a
relatively minor issue, but it ought nevertheless to be addressed in the
manner which he has proposed.
