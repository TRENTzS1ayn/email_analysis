Yes. In other words, currently we only define media which are single
words, but browsers are hereby warned not to fall over if they come
across something more complicated. This is in an attempt to avoid
repeating the mess that happended with charsets in MIME (eg,
text/html;charset=iso-8859-1 being treated as an unknown type
since the parser wasn't expecting parameters).
