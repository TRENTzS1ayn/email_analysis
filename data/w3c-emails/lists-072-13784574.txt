The new CSS2 draft is now avalilable, here:

http://www.w3.org/Style/Group/9710/css2-971030/Overview

with links to a multi-file HTML version and a PDF version. The PDF is
missing a couple of diagrams compared to the HTML (tool problem).

Most comments have been addressed in this version. It still doesn't have
the 139 color names added, though. And tty media type is not added in
this version.
