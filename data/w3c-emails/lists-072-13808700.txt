This may at first seem unrelated to the issue at hand, but I thought that
it deserved to be mentioned.

Long descriptions should be written for all of the significant diagrams in
the CSS 2 specification. This would make it easier for people who can not
view the graphics to understand the concepts, especially those which
relate to visual formatting. Obviously, the long descriptions should be
written by an appropriately qualified individual who understands the
specification itself.
