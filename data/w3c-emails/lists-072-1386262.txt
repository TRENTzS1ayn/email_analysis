Good question, David.  I'm not certain-- there are facilities for
text-labeling in SVG, for example, and in Flash too for that matter.
And presumably an XML schema could be developed that included a
<textlabel> element...

When I think "Text Label" I think of technology specific. Are we at risk
of making people think HTML, which would go against our principle of
technology independence in this DOC?
