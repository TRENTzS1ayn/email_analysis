Please Martin and whoever is going to follow-up, include both
w3c-html-wg and w3c-wai-hc in the thread.

Thanks.

This is rather on the edge. RFC 2070 clearly says that the Q
element does not include quotation marks.

RFC 2070 uses the term quotation mark, but is explicitly designed
so that the quotation mark can take all kinds of forms. If this
is the form of some prosodic change, I think that would easily
qualify as "adding quotation marks" in the intent of RFC 2070.

Ok.

There is a specific note on page 11 of RFC 2070 that makes it
clear that there was no intet to have this problem being solved
with heuristics, but with a very quick but easy bottom-line
implementation of Q.

It is probably good for the HTML spec to remain silent on this
issue because:
- - Removing some punctuation may lead to removing too much;
the document author might have relied on RFC 2070
and might have intended to have two kinds of punctuation
combined.
- - Requesting any kind of behaviour in this direction would
lead to the question of "what exactly", which would
mean that we have to go into the really nasty details.
- - Officially suggesting such behaviour may lead to the situation
where all browser have to use complicated heuristics.
This is definitely not in the intent of RFC 2070.

I agree. But it doesn't get more attractive if different kinds of
browsers start to use different heuristics for quote removal and
authors start to rely on them.

Please don't put language in your document that may result in
the removal of what is seen by some authors as relevant content.

If you want to say: On audio media, "quotation marks" can mean
so-and-so, that's fine. If you want to say "in case of display
for pepople with limited eyesight, please make sure the quotation
marks are large and thick enough", that's again fine.

The best thing is to have Q implemented everywhere as quickly as
possible, at least in the base version (one single kind of quotes).
As RFC 2070 or its drafts are around for quite some time, that
should already have happened.

Okay for minor stuff, but not if complex heuristics should be
introduced.
