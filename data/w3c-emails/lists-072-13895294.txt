I think that the basis of this importance is a point worth
developing in more detail.  I could use some help understanding
your vision of the universal-technology web and how CSS delivers
it (understanding better).

I suspect that we want to pursue two strategies in parallel.  One
is to provide coverage for basic operability needs without
relying on stylsheets.  That should be covered in the markup
guidelines and browser guidelines.

The second is to provide alternate-media content that is styled
as artfully as the dominant screen medium.  To do this we can
exploit CSS to the fullest, and want to make sure the fullest
supports the alternate media this well.  That's the piece we are
dealing with here.

I will try to be liberal in finding accessibility connections as
an excuse to cross-post, or post 'announce' mentions of issues that
went straight to CSS WG.
