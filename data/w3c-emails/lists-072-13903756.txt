Is there any attributes in the current proposal for adding text to
selectors when they are rendered in a browser.  For example in the
following style sheet excerpt is an example of how text could be added
automatically to provide a text label to selectors for people using screen
readers, or other forms of speech output or enlarged text using an
attribute named "preamble" (may not be the best name, but usefull to
illustrate the concept).

** style sheet **
H1 {  preamble: "Header Level 1"
        font-family: times-roman
        font-size: 12 }

** HTML **
<H1>Introduction to CSS</H1>

** Screen Display ***

Header Level 1 Introduction to CSS

The speech system would identify the text as a header since it would be
rendered on the screen, yet the user could select what they wanted (if at
all) the message to say.   This is similar to a concept proposed in the
Auditory Style Sheets.  

The attribute would allow users to search for these text elements to be
able to more efficiently navigate documents using standard search commends
built-in to current browsers.  Things like table could be announced to
users, so they can be aeare of them.
