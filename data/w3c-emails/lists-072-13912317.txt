The motivation for the current rules is to avoid causing old
browsers problems when new media types are introduced or
elaborated with parameters. The idea is called "Future Proofing".
The truncation procedure is a fallback when the user agent doesn't
understand the parameters.

Is that a problem?  You would need to ensure the "screen enlarged" 
style sheet comes after such default screen style sheets, e.g. to
make sure the font-sizes and white space settings come out right.

By placing the "screen enlarged" style sheet before the "screen" 
default, new browsers that recognize the former would be happy while
older browsers would show the regular screen style sheet. The rules
in the latter would then override the rules in the former. Isn't
this the right thing to do?
