At one point there was a proposal for inserting text before or after
an element. Sadly this was rejected by the CSS and FP working group.

I think there is a good case to be made for the more specific
proposal for speak-before and speak-after, defined in a similar
manner to cue-before and cue-after. For example:

Property name:
                     'speak-before' (or 'speak-after')
             Value:
                     "quoted text" | none
             Initial:
                     none
         Applies to:
                     all elements
          Inherited:
                     no
 Percentage values:
                     N/A


where the "quoted text" is a quoted text string to be spoken
before (or after) the rendering of the given element.

cue-before and cue-after are limited to auditory icons specified via
a URL. speak-before and speak-after would provide a means to insert
text directly from the style sheet.
