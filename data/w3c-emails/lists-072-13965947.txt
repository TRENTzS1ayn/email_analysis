IMHO the right thing to do in the old browsers is for them to
detect that they have an unresolved conflict between two "screen"
styles [can't tell "screen" from "screen enlarged"] and pop up to
ask the user which the user wants.  At this point the full text
of the media indication ["screen" vs. "screen enlarged"] is copied
into the select list in the popup dialog.  The user can make the
right decision based on the natural-language interpretation of
the formally-undefined text.

Of course, we are talking old browsers that do whatever they do.
Do they ever stop to ask?  If they don't we need "User
Guidelines" that teach tricks like how to get to the
stylesheet-suppression functions in "preferences."  Since these
are browser-specific, we need to fold that Help/Learn capability
in under the Browser Guidelines.
