Great!  I am glad this is space for it in CSS 2.0.  I am not sure what
"generatred text" means.  But I would like to propose the use of a new
style attribute to add text labels to selectors.  Using styles would give
persons with disabilities the capability to customize the labels to their
own needs.  

What can I do to help foster this proposal?

Jon
