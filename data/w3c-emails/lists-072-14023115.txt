Would you give us references to the failed proposals (too
complex, too limited) so we have an idea of the range a solution
would fall in?

This next one is tough, but would be enormously helpful.  For the

used in that proposal, and how would _you_ rank these in order of
increasing difficulty of selling them to implementors?
