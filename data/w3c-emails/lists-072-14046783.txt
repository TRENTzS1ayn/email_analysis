We now have Chris Lilley (Chair of the CSS WG) and Hakon Lie (Original
author of CSS) on HC with us.

Chris will be attending the WAI meeting too, but he's leaving thursday
so he might not be able to track the activity as he would have liked.

As per my discussion with Chris, one of the pressing item is to write
a up clear articulation of need for generated text and for headers and
footers.
