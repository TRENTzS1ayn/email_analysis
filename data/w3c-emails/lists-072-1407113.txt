To The Group -

First off, sorry to have broken the thread with regard to this topic.  In my
recent reading of various posts to the list (all the various categories of
comments) it seems that the term web page or "just" page is used at a very
high rate.  With this as an example, it seems clear that "we" know what page
means or we'd be using some other term. I still think a page is a document
with all of its possible components but page seems clear and simple.

I think readers will know what the word page refers to.  I'd personally like
to see us leave this one alone.
