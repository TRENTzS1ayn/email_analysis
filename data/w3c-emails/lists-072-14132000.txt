I seem to remember two functions from Jason's discussion of Braille
formatting traditions that are not covered in what you just said:

Inclusion of print page number in running headers.
The flip side of this point is that it is not obvious why headers
should be limited to the contents of Hn elements.  

Include running header only on Braille pages where the print page
changes.  This raises questions on event definition for selectors.

I will try to dig up the references to where this information is.
