Hello everyone,

In issue 693 [1], Greg Lowney suggested the following formulation of a
benefit for guideline 2.5 (minimize errors) [2]:
"Individuals with disabilities affecting their speech or manual dexterity
will often have a higher error rate when communicating with speech or
handwriting recognition, or typing, and therefore benefit proportionately
more from features that assist in recognizing and correcting input errors."

Although I totally agree with the content of this, I think the formulation
is too complex. I propose the following reformulation:

"Certain disabilities make it more difficult to operate input devices,
resulting in more input errors. For example, individuals with limited motor
functions are more likely to make errors when they operate a mouse or a
keyboard. Individuals with speech disabilities are more difficult to
understand by speech recognition. Features that assist in recognizing and
correcting errors benefit individuals with these types of disabilities. "
