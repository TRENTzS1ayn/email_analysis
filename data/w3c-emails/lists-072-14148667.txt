Right. My simple example in the last message didn't show all features.
For the complete text, see [1]. Here's how you would do page numbers:

  @page :header {
    content: none, "Page " decimal(pageno), none;
 } 

The example would insert the string "Page 4" centered on the fourth
page. The 'none' keywords indicate that there should be no running
header on the left side of the page, nor the right side.

That would be too prohibitive. In the current propsal, you can use a
normal CSS selector to "mark" the elements which should serve as
headers:

  H1        { running-head: chapter }
  P.caption { running-head: section }

The marked elements can then be referred to from the header
definition:

  @page :header {
    content: first(chapter), none, first(section);
  }

The "first" function refers to the first occurence of a marked element
on that page. Other fuctions are "last" and "previous". The names
"chapter" and "section" are predefined.

Feedback on the usefulness of this proposal is most welcome. So is
suggestions for changing the syntax.
