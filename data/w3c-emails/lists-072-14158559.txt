I believe that would only get me the page number of the current
Braille page.  The person reading a text in Braille also wants to
know what page the same text is on in the print version.  The idea
is that this will be back-annotated into the HTML, but how you
know what value is the print-page-number is not standardized in
the HTML spec.  It will be a convention between the writer of the
HTML and the writer of the braille-medium stylesheet.  

A mechanism very much like the one you described in which one can
anoint "effective headers" through selector-driven rules should
be capable of handling this one.
