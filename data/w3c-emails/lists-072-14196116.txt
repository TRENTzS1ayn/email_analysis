I agree with Meg that there are things (not related to access) one can
worry about in this spec, backward compatibility and lack of security
coverage for instance.

In the sense that it provides ways to implement simpler UI (less
typing in this particular case, possibly combined with richer linking
mechanism), yes, it helps access.

The meta question is whether or not any proposal that is an
improvement of the UI in general (at the price of some other
functionality - like security or compatibility) is something we should
fight for, given that in the area of accessibility, the UI problem is
always worsen (e.g. long option navigation).

It's a question of priority really and I personally don't mind having
the WAI putting pressure on the UI issues, and let the others worry
about the other issues.
