Re running headers.

As a sighted user, I prefer the URL + page number
in any headers, as a reminder of where the page came from.

Braille page numbers require recalculating anyway,
but print page numbers do provide some reference.
(Perhaps only when they are dropped on the floor!)

Suggest as a minimum the URL.
The top H1 as a very poor second.
