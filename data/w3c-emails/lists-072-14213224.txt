 In the current propsal, you can use a
normal CSS selector to "mark" the elements which should serve as
headers:

  H1        { running-head: chapter }
  P.caption { running-head: section }

The marked elements can then be referred to from the header
definition:

  @page :header {
    content: first(chapter), none, first(section);
  }


For my two cents:

Would suggest a reversal would make more sense.
Instead of saying
'This element should go into the header' when I meet the element,

How about
'for the running header include ....' then specify what
is to go in?

Similar model as in xcel spreadsheet, pick from a list?
Candidates then could include 
First H1,
Date,
pageNum
URL
etc.

Syntax down to those who know.
