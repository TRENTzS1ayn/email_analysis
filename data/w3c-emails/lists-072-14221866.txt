Correct.

This is very hard and conflicts with other accessibility concerns.
True to its tradition, HTML doesn't know about pages. CSS2 has the
notion of pages [1]. For example, an element can request or refuse a
page break before, after or inside it. But, since HTML documents
should scale onto the widest range of output media possible (e.g. US
letter paper and A4 paper), CSS cannot guarantee that a certain
element ends up on a certain page. Also, unavailability of fonts,
different hyphenation rules, a users's request for large font sizes
etc. make this impossible.

If the visible printout and the braille printout are produced at the
same time, one could see the possibility of a "feedback channel" which
would report page numbers. The CSS&FP WG has not considered this
option.
