Navigation yes - by page reference no (IMHO). Why make the
backwards step? The on-line navigational capabilities of html
are far superior to page based systems. Equally the index, table
of 
contents, cross references can all be done in far better ways.
Notes
(side, boxed, foot etc) are all possible without copying the 
print based world. 
Let's move forwards and make best use of them.

Surely these are attributes?
All managed very well by standard SGML techniques. Creating 
unique anchor namess from node references permits easy use of
cross references, but the overriding need is for document tree
traversal, something more in the realms of XML/DSSSL than
CSS.
