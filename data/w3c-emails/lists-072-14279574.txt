No.  But lots of languages.  It is an existing standard that we should
use but not limit ourselves to.  The phonologists (phoneticists?) will
always have a few more sounds that are used in Tlingit or 'Kung or
something like that.

My suspicion here is that because IPA is adequate for covering
most indo-european languages it will be easier to get dictionary
and synthesizer vendors to support it than some other phonetic
dictionary.  The average users will perhaps fill in pronunciation
by either a dialog box or an audio dialog.  The point is that the
system will code what it learns in some phonetic format, play it
back, and the user won't accept it until it is right.  IPA is the
cheap and easy phonetic markup.  There is a whole wing of the
Internet Internationalization community working on phonetic data
formats.  We just need to make sure that we don't assume just one
at this time.

But we should ask them.

For Japanese you don't need IPA because you already have a fully
phonetic script in the kana.  Japanese is unusual that way.

I know of no other language which is written as phonetically as
Japanese (outside the use of Kanji which of course are
ideographs).  Spanish is more phonetic than English but Japanese
is the tops in pronounceability off the page.

It can, but it takes help from markup in the document or attached
to the document to resolve these cases.  The LINK and META
extension proposal (REF topic) was to force HTML to provide the
capability directly, but in the end we decided on a leap of faith
and try to make it work with RDF, so we withdrew that request
from HTML.

Hey, you are doing great so far.

RDF is a moving target.  We have a "long-term" work item to
partner with the metadata group to make sure that when it stops
moving it can do what we need.

You are being clear about the function needed.  That is what RDF
needs us to help them with.  They can trade off options for how
to implement it if the need is clear.
