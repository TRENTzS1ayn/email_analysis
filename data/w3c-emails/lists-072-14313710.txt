Right. I agree that your proposal is more intuitive. However, it would
result in having selectors (or a similar contruct) on the right side.
E.g., one could imagine:

  @page :header {
    content: first(H1), decimal(pageno), first(H2);
    font-variant: small-caps}
  }

For simple selectors (as the type selector above) this looks fine, but
for more complex selecetor it starts to get messy:

  @page :header {
    content: first(BODY H1.chapter), decimal(pageno), first(H2[TITLE]);
    font-variant: small-caps}
  }
 
Or, perhaps it's not that bad? Certainly, this would rid us of the
"three-variable" limitation...
