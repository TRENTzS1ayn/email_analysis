That's very true for documents which are first produced for
online use and printed copies are a byproduct produced from
the electronically-distributed text.  That is not the only
important scenario in which Web media will be used.

Consider an etext scenario, where material is primarily published
in print but transcribed to online media for accessibility.  Here
the print page number is a valuable point of reference because
most people using the same text index it in that way.  This is
true not only of books but also periodicals.

Here, the printed version is not generated from the HTML and it's
not the job of CSS to get the numbers into the HTML.  That is an
authoring/transcribing tool job.  But in the etext scenario it is
still desirable to be able to support this information.  I am not
eager to ignore its value, if we can support it easily.
