I think Yvette's prposed reformulation is excellent.  I'd like to
propose one small editorial change

<begin proposed>
"Certain disabilities make it more difficult to operate input devices,
resulting in more input errors. For example, individuals with limited
motor functions are more likely to make errors when they operate a mouse
or a keyboard. Individuals with speech disabilities are more difficult
for speech recognition systems to understand . Features that assist in
recognizing and correcting errors benefit individuals with these types
of disabilities. " 
</end proposed>

I changted the setnence about speech disabilities.

Hello everyone,

In issue 693 [1], Greg Lowney suggested the following formulation of a
benefit for guideline 2.5 (minimize errors) [2]: "Individuals with
disabilities affecting their speech or manual dexterity will often have
a higher error rate when communicating with speech or handwriting
recognition, or typing, and therefore benefit proportionately more from
features that assist in recognizing and correcting input errors."

Although I totally agree with the content of this, I think the
formulation is too complex. I propose the following reformulation:

"Certain disabilities make it more difficult to operate input devices,
resulting in more input errors. For example, individuals with limited
motor functions are more likely to make errors when they operate a mouse
or a keyboard. Individuals with speech disabilities are more difficult
to understand by speech recognition. Features that assist in recognizing
and correcting errors benefit individuals with these types of
disabilities. "
