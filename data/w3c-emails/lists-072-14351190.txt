Right. When you refer to a fixed, rendered version of the document it
certainly makes sense to use page numbers as a reference. We then face
two problems:

 1 how are the page references encoded?
 2 how is the rendered version referred to?

The first problem can be solved e.g. with an INDEX attribute in HTML
(or XML, of course). One possible solution to the second problem is to
use the "ALTERNATE" value for the "REL" attibute on LINK [1]. It is
currently described as:

  Alternate: Designates substitute versions for the document in which
  the link occurs. When used together with the lang attribute, it
  implies a translated version of the document. When used together with
  the media attribute, it implies a version designed for a different
  medium (or media).

An example of use:

  <LINK REL=ALTERNATE MEDIA=print HREF="doc.ps">

As you note, CSS is not the main responsible. What CSS must offer is
a way to insert values from attributes into the presentation of the
document. This is currently no in CSS2, but we hope it will be there
soon.

One question: In braille printouts, is it customary to put these page
references into into a running header or into the text flow? Is there
other conventions in braille printing we should be aware of?
