I believe they are often used in headers.  Sometimes the running headers
are only included in the Braille page when the print page changes.

Some of the resources that I think provide an orientation to Braille
usage that helps with what we need to do with the Web formats are
listed below.  We don't have a definitive requirements statement.
But I think these materials give a good idea of the shape of the
problem.
