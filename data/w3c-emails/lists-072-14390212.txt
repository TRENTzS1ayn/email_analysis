The attached HTML document is an annotated table of contents for
the CSS2 draft.

It is in TOC order, not priority order.  The comments range in
importance from tiny to major.

I will have a more organized prioritized list including the prior
established issues from the Oct 22 report for consideration at
the meeting Monday afternoon (HC meeting).

If anyone from the CSS WG has a chance to look at these before
Thursday morning, it may make us more productive then, but by
Thursday we will have HC team-based priorities and a better
organized message.
