That makes sense. JasonW supports this in the reference you gave below.

Thanks, these references were very helpful. The difference between
printed braille and dynamic braille seems important enough to warrant
two different media types. This is noted along with the description of
"BRAILLE" in the CSS2 WD [1], but no name pair. How about

  BRAILLE           (dynamic braille)
  BRAILLE-PRINT     (static braille)

Alternative suggestions welcome.
