My suggestion all along has been:

media="braille embossed" (for braille embossed on paper)
and
media="braille displayed" for dynamic braille.

I would object to media="braille print", since it could easily be
construed as referring to "simulated braille", that is, a situation in
which braille dot patterns are printed using an ordinary printer, so that
they can be read visually by a print reader who is learning braille.

I would be willing to substitute "braille dynamic" for "braille
displayed", but the other type should be "braille embossed".
