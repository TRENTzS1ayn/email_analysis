The name "braille embossed" is fine.  But in terms of the
processing model we need to make it clear that the "braille
embossed" subtype of the braille base type shares the basic page
reference model with the print type.

This can be formally described by heredity from a common ancestor
class.  The braille embossed page and the print page share a
common ancestor which defines the common structures of a page
context.
