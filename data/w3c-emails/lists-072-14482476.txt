Indeed, this was one of the key motivations for starting the work
on CSS.

There are several XML style languages, including CSS and DSSSL. You're
probably referring to XSL, the "eXtensible Style Language", which has
proposed to W3C [1].

This has been true in the past; CSS is intended for documents where
tree transformations are not required. However, another recent
submission to W3C builds on CSS to provide "Simple Tree Transformation
