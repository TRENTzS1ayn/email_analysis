One question: In braille printouts, is it customary to put these
page
references into into a running header or into the text flow? Is
there
other conventions in braille printing we should be aware of?



The (UK) convention is as follows

On line 1 (header)
Left sideRight side
print page numberbraille page no.

(nb, braille output is split into volumes, hence 
always less that (about) 120



Within the braille page the print page indicator
is entered (using UK braille codes)

"3 #cfi

Which translates as
"3 print page indicator
# numeric indicator
cfi   369 - page number

In summary, header contains both
print page number (from source)
and braille page number in this volume

Also print page 'turn' is indicated within
the body of text.

Real summary - its a pig to generate
unless done by the author!
