Smaller point, a question really.

Since each nation uses 'local' variants
on braille, is a valid consideration to
annotate the source nationality or
'Braille' group. Or is this targetted at
the output transform only?

I know that the UK and Australia 
can share braille coding, but
the US and UK are quite different
from, say Spain.

Any other opinions?
