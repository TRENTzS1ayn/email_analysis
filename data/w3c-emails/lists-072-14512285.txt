FWIW

XSL (the style sheet side of XML) is available in draft,
and one team in Edinburgh, have put an implemenation
onto the web. This translates from XSL into DSSSL
then uses an uplifted Jade to output in RTF.

ps. Copies of XLL - linking mechanism
        SMML - multi-media language
are in about to hit the streets for public comment.
