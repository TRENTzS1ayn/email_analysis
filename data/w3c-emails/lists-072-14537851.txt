Thanks Jason.
Braille page sizes are ... varied in the UK.

There are (lines per page / cells per line)
25 by 38

From documents to hand!

Assuming other parts of the world are similarly afflicted,
suggest a generalisation of rows cols would be best 
coverage, rather than absolute page sizes, even if
we could agree units to be used.

This would permit coverage on both embossed braille and
line devices (electronic braille, perhaps 1 by 80)
