> Those two areas are the only substatial changes.

Agreed.
We also discussed to some length the LONGDESC on FRAME feature.

No change here, but the point was made that:
   - the LONGDESC really should give a long description of the
    function of the FRAME, rather than its image content. This is
    because the later would only apply to the initial frame content,
    and not to the subsequent image that could be put it in, using A
    and TARGET.
   - the Markup guidelines should recommend that direct inclusion of
    image in a frame is bad, and that it should go thru a wrapper
    page, and use the IMG LONGDESC instead.
