I'll try to expose my view. 

This is an important topic of discussion and we should have a clear
and common model of understanding.

Correct.

The important word in your sentence above is "author".

If we think a feature is indeed important for authors, then yes, CSS
or XSL is the place, but if it can be argued that a feature is mostly
to be used by user agents when rendering the info to the end users,
then doing it thru DOM local to the browser is a valid option.

The issue is really about interoperability: we want the authors and
the browsers to use the same language when bits of this language are
exchanged. If the language is only used on one side (say, like CGI on
the server side, or plug-in API on the browser side, to give two
examples), then, it's less important.

There is a price in extending CSS, delaying it, or making it more
complex and we should not ignore it while caring about accessibility,
since on the overall, it might cost us more than what it brings us.
