ASG: Agreed that there is not enough information in the markup
for a fully automatic readout to match the grace of an
author-composed pattern.  This does not automatically mean
we have to use CSS to write it.

Most of the time the pattern will not be reusable for other
tables.  It would seem that many of these macros are only good
for one table, and this would suggest that they belong in the
document and not in a separate stylesheet.

The macro could be a fragment of CSS2 inlined in the HTML, or
some other markup with the necessary capability.  In addition to
a CSS style inline in the document, a script could appear in the
document, or some script macro string could be added as a
supplemental attribute of a table structure using inline RDL.
Which of these is used is still up for grabs at this point as
far as I can tell.
