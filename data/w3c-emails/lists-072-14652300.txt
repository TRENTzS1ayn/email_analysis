DP: XSL is available in print. A team in Scotland (part funded
by Microsoft) 
have implemented a rather roundabout route to an implemenation
which 
takes in XML and outputs RTF, using a modified Jade from James
Clark to
first convert the XSL into DSSSL. It is real, it is a subset of
DSSSL with
all its power.

me.

DP: Don't know about that. CSS is definately the little brother
here IMHO.

DP: My experience is that the earlier you can influence a design
the less costly
the changes. Surely this applies here too. Last weeks experience
seems to
have bumped up against the 'too late to change' response which
perhaps 
backs up Jasons position.

I like the idea of building into a requirements specification
for future standards,
surely the best time to get in?
