Sorry--no --just as for aural access we never want the
author to stick any presentation specific stuff in the
markup
the same applies to not sticking aural presentation specific
stuff in the content.

A design where the author sticks in some kind of aural
presentation rule in the document is a kluge and what's more
authors wont do it --so the point is moot.

This said, there is a place for document-specific and
collection-specific presentation rules-- it's place however
is *not* inside the document.
