ASG: We have been told that there will be ways to point very
finely into documents with XLL and to include RDF fragments
inline in documents.  The details of how this is going to work
are not clear to me.  But markup with capability parallel to the
spell-it-out ability in ABBR should be possible.

ASG: 
I have learned of one typeable transcription of IPA.  It is known
as SAMPA and more information can be found starting at

  http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/sampa/home.htm

Note that the "English" application at this site works only for
British English.  I can get you an American English equivalent
if we need it.

Clearly, more Japanese will be able to type kana right than
English speakers will be able to type SAMPA right!

These phonetic scripts will be a little like HTML in that regard.
It is possible to write it with any text terminal.  It takes some
skill and most people won't bother.  But it is important that you
can access the source in text and fix it because the automatic
methods won't get it right always, either.  At first there will
be a lot of cut-and-try but that works as soon as browsers and
access agents can vocalize from the script.
