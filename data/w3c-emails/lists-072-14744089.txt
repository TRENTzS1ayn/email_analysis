The main limitation of the "phonetic dictionary" approach is that it is
unable to accommodate homographs, which occur sometimes in English and
perhaps in other languages as well. Modern speech synthesis software, such
as recent versions of DECTALK, attempt to analyse sentences containing
homographs and to choose the correct pronunciation, but this is one area
in which phonetic markup could be useful. Would RDF make it possible to
control the pronunciation of a specific word within a particular sentence,
without affecting it in other contexts?
