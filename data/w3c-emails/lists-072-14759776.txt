This doesn't necessitate changes to HTML though, if the
pronunciation is expressible as a CSS property, since these
can already be expressed in HTML via the style attribute.

In my talk I raised the issue of where the pronunciation depends on
the grammatical context, and also where it depends on the knowing
the topic at a deeper level. There is some value to being able to
represent grammatical constraints on which pronunciation to use, but
when it comes to understanding the deeper meaning of the text, this
is way beyond what is practical.
