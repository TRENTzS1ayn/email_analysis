Is XSL likely to include any of the tree transformation capabilities
offered by DSSSL? There is a need for a widely deployed mechanism that
will allow documents conforming to XML DTD's to be transformed, in
accordance with rules provided by the developer of the DTD, into HTML 4.0
for purposes of accessibility.

I realise that the above question falls outside the topic of the HC list,
so it may be better to continue the discussion of this topic by private
e-mail until the PF list is formed.
