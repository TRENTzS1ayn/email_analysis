JW: In that case, the selection of an applicable braille standard will be
a function of configuration parameters internal to the browser, and this
is no different from a situation in which the braille translation and
formatting are carried out by an external access agent. For example, the
user might choose British braille, in which event, any French text
(lang="fr") found in the document will be translated according to British
rules for the transcription of French, rather than in conformity with
French braille standards as used in France.

JW: I agree. If an external access agent is used, then the application of
braille style sheets would be its responsibility. The browser need only
expose the braille style sheet parameters via DOM or a comparable
mechanism, together with the markup. The access agent would then apply
this information in the generation of a properly coded and formatted
document.
