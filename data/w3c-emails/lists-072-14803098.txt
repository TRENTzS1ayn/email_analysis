What to do about EMBED is a very interesting question.
The question is where you should post the idea.

Groups that might be involved in doing something about EMBED
include at least GL UI RC and EO [and not HC].

This leaves you with the choice of posting to the IG list to say
"What do people think of this?" or to the coordination group list
<w3c-wai-cg@w3.org> to say "Which group(s) should do what about
this?"
