I would be interested to see evidence of this definite statement. The
XSL submission appears to omit all mention of the tree transformation
capabilities of DSSSL, and uses only rhe flow object construction
(stylesheet) stage.

Yes, there is. It appears that XSLwill not provide this capability, however.

Transformation from one DTD to another turns out to be hard, if there is
a requirement to generate conforming document instances and to retain
semantics. If the requirement is only to generate a document that is
well formed (in the XML sense) as opposed to conformant to a particular
DTD, the job becomes somewhat easier.

Do either of these implement the tree transformation capabilities of DSSSL?
