DP: Or being pragmatic? Perhaps Jason has a point in
terms of _today_. Once XML tools are available I will support
your position. Assuming a time lag, a simple transform into
html for quick (and dirty) access seems to waste very little
if a static dtd is being used.
The real difficulty comes when authors throw away the dtd
and start using tag names without any structural considerations,
the dtdless document instance. Then I need to write a transform
script for each document I receive. If that happens then forget
the easy route to html or anything else, and look for the 
XSL toolset.


Fully support the rest of TV's message and hope that the
structural capabilities of XML are supported, as well 
as the richness of the tagset!
