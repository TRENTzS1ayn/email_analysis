In my experience attempting short-term hacks typically
results in the short-term hack hanging around far longer
than the perpetrator intended -- and the XML to HTML4.0
projection if done in the name of accessibility will haunt
us for a long time.

Here are a few kluges that would emerge and hang around:

Today's accessibility mechanisms in HTML4.0 and CSS1.x
are not necessarily the best solutions and one needs to bend
over backwards in providing access to certain kinds of
structured information --the best example is tables.

I shudder to think of the kind of hacks people would come up
with in order to take a richly structured data record in XML
to a "accessible HTML table".
