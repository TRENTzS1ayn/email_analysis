Right. In particular, an XML document instance might use tags from two
or more different DTDs, using namespaces to keep the semantics separate.

So, this is specifically a CSS issue? Other stylesheet languages do not
support the notion of a client-side (reader) stylesheet (since they don't
support cascading).

Or more generaly, without knowledge of the tag names (given in the DTD or
other schema) and their semantics (not given in the DTD).

It is not the case. Many XML documents will neither have reference to
a DTD nor will they conform to any one in particular.
