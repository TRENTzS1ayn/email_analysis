The connection must be available to the client.  It could be
provided outside the individual XML file in site-wide metadata
that says 'In the absense of an explicit indication, you may
assume that pages [in this realm] conform at least to DTD="URI".'

It is quite likely that semantic completeness such as we need
will not be the law of the XML land unless we explain it to
somebody.
