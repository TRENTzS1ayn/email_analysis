Hi All

 

After talking with Wendy and some others on the TECH committee, and looking
at Gregg's suggestion that the user should have clear access to the
checklists from the Guidelines document I've reworked USE CASE 2 from the
example posted earlier.

 

USE CASE 2: Now there are two links after each guideline. One to enter the
checklist items (for evaluation) and one to enter the techniques
documents(to learn how to do it). 

 

If the user selects the checklist they are brought to a page where they can
select the desired checklist. If they select the techniques, they are
brought to a page where they will select the technologies they want to
fulfill the success criterion. 

 

These ideas are simply exploring concepts and not intended as final designs.
The wording for the text links would probably have to change, but at least
the idea is there.

 

The Use cases are at www.eramp.com/david 

 

Cheers

David MacDonald
