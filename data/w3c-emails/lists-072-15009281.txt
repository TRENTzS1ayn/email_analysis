I don't think this is a really good idea.  Some tables are VERY simple,
only a couple of cells which are self-explanatory.  I think authors would
resent being forced to summarize something obvious.

Summary is useful for large and/or complex tables - any table where
purpose or context is not clear.  But I don't feel it is appropriate for
ALL tables.

And tables WILL continue to be used for layout for quite some time -
especially in form layout.
