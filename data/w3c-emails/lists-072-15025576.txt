Subject: Make summary attribute on TABLE requried?

Hi Daniel,

David Abrahamson (ISO) has asked the HTML WG to make
the "summary" attribute on TABLE required, rather than
option, obviously in the interest of accessibility.
(see
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-html-wg/1997OctDec/0511.html)

Do you have any thoughts on this? 

The rest of the WG has not manifested any
interest.

Thanks for a quick reply,

ASG:: FWIW you can track this starting at

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-hc/1997OctDec/thread.html#start

So far of the three HC participants we have heard from there are three
'no' indications on the required? question.  Makes consensus the other
way unlikely...

On the other hand it would be good to implement his other suggestion
and put in a non-trivial 'summary' value in the example tables.
