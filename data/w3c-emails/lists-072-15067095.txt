As chair of the UI group I agree with Jason White of the capabilities that
browsers should be able to discard author style sheets and substitute their
own.  I would argue this probably the biggest value of style sheets and
probably the only way users can consistantly get the information formatted
the way they need it due to sub classing issues and override hierachies.
That reccommendation is in the UI guidelines.
