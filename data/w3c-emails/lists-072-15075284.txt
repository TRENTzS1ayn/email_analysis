That's correct. This is a controversial issue, but as explaned below,
I don't think it's much of a problem in practice.

I have never seen an author style sheet with !important in it. I have,
however, talked to many authors who are hesitant to start using style
sheets if it gives them less "control" than their current tools (i.e.
images).

This, I believe, is a real issue and you're among the few who have
spotted it. Today, writing a "large font" style sheet requires that
the other style sheets are written with cascading in mind, e.g. that
all font sizes are specified relative to the font size of the BODY
element. Changing the font size of the BODY element would then
propagate magnifications throughout the document.

To ease this problem, inheritance must be strengthend on the expense
of cascading. One proposal is to add the keyword "inherit" on all
properties, e.g.:

  BODY { font-size: 12pt }
  P { font-size: inherit }
  H1 { font-size: 140% }

This proposal has not yet been discussed in the CSS WG, but I think it
should.

If we want to address the first issue, I believe we should do so
without adding any new syntax (a la adding "absolute" in addition to
"imporatant") since this would not work in older browsers. Instead, I
think CSS2 could say that "important" declararations in author style
sheets should be regarded as having normal weight.
