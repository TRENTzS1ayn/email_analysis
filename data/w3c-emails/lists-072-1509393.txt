Actually,  you appear to have missed both the problem and suggested
solution.  I think you are referring to older discussions.

The problem was ambiguous words.   Where, by leaving out vowels and marks
you ended up with written contractions that could stand for any of several
different words. (not words that have different  but unique ways of being
written). 

The solution under discussion was just to ensure that there was some means
for disambiguating.  It did not specify how.   If this can be done
automatically, then there may be no requirement that this be done at all by
the author.  Thus there would be no requirement to write in "Kiddie"
language - or even to provide any markup.   But we are still exploring this
- hence the conversations. 

By the way - this is also a problem with Chinese and some Japanese writing
systems.   Thus it is one that we were asked to consider and think of ways
to address.

What will end up in the final guidelines -- we do not know yet.  But we are
not taking problems off the table.  Nor making any judgments about what the
solutions strategies will be -- and what we would leave in as suggestions
for the various levels.  

If you have ideas for addressing things or observations that are not already
in Bugzilla (and therefore open issues  - not forgotten issues or comments)
please contribute.  But please don't tell people to be quiet. 

(and do give some latitude for people to make mistakes or plow old ground.
It happens.   But we try to pick up the old issues and comments when we do
reviews -- and it works out in our discussions where we remind people of
past discussions and input. )

Please join us for the discussions.

The intent in this patently ridiculous guideline is to force authors to
write kiddie Hebrew and Arabic (and Urdu, Pashto, Dari, and the like,
possibly even Yiddish, a more unusual case) with vowels always in place.  
That isn't how we write the adult forms of those languages.

Can we drop this now?
