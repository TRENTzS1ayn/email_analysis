This morning, W3C releases HTML4 as W3C recommendation 

Check http://www.w3.org/ for details
(the final spec is at www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/)

It includes the following:

  "Many thanks to the Web Accessibility Initiative task force (WAI HC
  group) for their work on improving the accessibility of HTML and to
  T.V. Raman (Adobe) for his early work on developing accessible forms."

Even thought we're not done with H, or C, and PF is about to start
(we're circulating the final charter within W3C Management this week)
I want to take this moment in time as an opportunity to thanks all the
people that got involved in this group.

Particularly: 
  Al Gilman, for all the effort and good work he puts in
    the final days of the HC review back in mid-October (while I was in
    Japan fighting with a telephone plug my latop modem didn't like)
  Jason White, for all the invaluable insight he gave us even though
    his main activity was getting prepared for his university exam on
    law and philosophy
  Dave Raggett, for his continuous commitment, participation and
    education effort to the group. Without his expertise, we couldn't
    possibly have completed our task within our schedule.

Happy Holiday and be 1998 as rewarding as 1997 for all of you.
