Please read the new draft available at

  http://www.w3.org/Style/Group/9712/WD-css2-971211/

Remember that we are responsible to protect what we read there
(that is different from the public draft) from public disclosure.
I'm probably the biggest sinner in this department, but I 
wanted to remind folks anyway on this point.  

If you want to copy draft text in your comment or otherwise are
disclosing what is in the internal draft, just send your comment
to w3c-css-wg@w3.org and post a brief "announce" message to
w3c-wai-hc@w3.org saying that you have done so.
