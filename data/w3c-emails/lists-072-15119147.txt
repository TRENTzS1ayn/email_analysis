One could, but ... Um, IE 4.0 is not a "real system"? It lets you
give the location on your disk of the reader stylesheet, which is
in CSS. For example, I made a simple 'large print' reader stylesheet :

body { font-size: 48pt }

Dou you mean, in addition to what CSS1 and CSS2 say about the ability
to turn off stylesheets individually or collectively?

I think that should certainly go into usage guidelines: authors should
not put !important in their stylesheets. Then again, so far I haven't
seen any author stylesheets with !important.

That's another option, and more compatible with CSS1 rules than
ignoring author !important.
