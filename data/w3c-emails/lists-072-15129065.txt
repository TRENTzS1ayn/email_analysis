Up on http://microsoft.com/enable/products/ie4.htm
<http://microsoft.com/enable/products/ie4.htm>  we have a couple of High
Contrast style sheets that can be downloaded.

A word of warning:  The initial version of IE 4.0 had a serious bug in the
CSS support - namely it faulted if there was bad CSS syntax.  That's not a
bad problem is you run "browser only."  But if you have the Active Desktop
enabled, it prevents the shell from booting.

This is corrected in the latest version, 4.01.

One could, but ... Um, IE 4.0 is not a "real system"? It lets you
give the location on your disk of the reader stylesheet, which is
in CSS. For example, I made a simple 'large print' reader stylesheet
:

body { font-size: 48pt }
