Jason,
It was my impression that the "author can always win" scenario was put in
the achieve acceptance of CSS1 by authoring groups.  To change that, I see
three possible paths:

1)Additional syntax changes to allow for more attributes (your option
#2)
2)Change the definition of CSS to say that a reader attribute "wins"
when faced with the same level author attribute (your option #1)
3)Recommend that browsers do what IE4 does - provide absolute
overrides in the user interface.

If we add more attributes, what's to prevent someone from always using the
"!SUPER-DUPER_INCREDIBLY_IMPORTANT_ULTIMATE" attribute on their site simply
because it's a guarantee of appearance.

Option #3 I feel is best because it's the easiest to implement:  Millions of
web authors, verses hundreds of thousands of folks needing their user styles
verses a handful of browsers (minus the one that already does it).

I have visited the Microsoft site and found the style sheets, which
demonstrate the problem and show that it is not merely hypothetical.
Any
of these style sheets would be overridden by contrary provisions in
an
author's style sheet.

The fact that a user agent may include controls in its user
interface
permitting the user to disable the application of certain style
sheets is
helpful, but not sufficient. Rather, the user should be able to
determine
which of the provisions in his or her default style sheet will apply
regardless of the author's style sheet, and which can be overridden.

For this reason I would reiterate the importance of either (1)
changing
the definition of !important; so that an author's styles always
carry
normal weight; or (2) adding an !absolute; directive to achieve the
same
effect. The "specificity" problem as outlined in one of my earlier
contributions to this discussion also requires attention.

The fact that Microsoft have implemented "readers' style sheets" has
changed my thinking somewhat with regard to the importance of this
issue.
The fact that it is not a major practical problem today is merely a
consequence of there being so few "authors' style sheets" available
on the
web. This will change in the future, perhaps quite rapidly,
particularly
if and when CSS 2 becomes a recommendation and is widely supported
by
authoring tools and web browsers.
