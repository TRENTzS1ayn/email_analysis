Lots of people to thank on this round, actually.  Thanks as well to Greg
Lowney of Microsoft Corp. for his contributions on tables.

I'm sending out a general & brief summary of the new access supports in
HTML 4.0 and I'll copy that to this list, although all the HC WG
participants should be on this list as well.  We will be doing more focused
publicity of the HTML 4.0 accessibility improvements later in January, and
so if you have suggestions of things to highlight at that time, please let
me know.

Thanks,

Judy
