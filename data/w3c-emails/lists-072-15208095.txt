Option 1 I take to be that which changes the definition of !important; so
that it only has effect when used within a reader's style sheet (any use
of !important; in an author's style sheet would thus be ignored, and the
author's rules would all have normal weight, thereby giving precedence to
the reader's explicitly important rules). This is the option which I
prefe. The only counter-argument is one of backward compatibility. If the
use of !important; in authors' style sheets is ignored, then it can still
be said that all valid CSS 1 style sheets are likewise valid in CSS 2, but
the definition of importance changes. Given that the !important; directive
is a little-used feature at present, I think this change could be made
without resulting in major backward compatibility problems.
