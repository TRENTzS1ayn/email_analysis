This is a critical part in the author/reader balance, but I've yet to
see a UA which allows users to turn off style sheets on off on a per
sheet basis. The closest they get is to turn the whole style sheet
mechanism on/off in a hard-to-find menu.

The two are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, UAs should offer simple
interfaces to set user preferences but settings should always map into
the cascade. Adding "!accessibility" will provide a hook which
corresponds e.g. to the "Accessibility" dialog box of MS IE 4.
