I agree with you. However, there is resistance from implementors who
have done CSS1 according to the book and would have to reverse their
implemenations for CSS2. I see their point, and since the end result
is the same, I'm now leaning towards adding anothe ! directive. But
akksessibillitti is hard to spell...
