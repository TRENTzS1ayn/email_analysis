The problem is not something the author of *Web content* can solve. If it 
is any kind of accessibility issue whatsoever, it is one of user agents, 
viz. screen readers.

Don't put a requirement in place that could later be held against an
author even if that is not the intent at origination. It isn't the
author's problem that the language in which he or she writes has
homographs and polysemy.

It isn't a problem.

How this came to be discussed at all is that an Approved Person mentioned 
it, and, true to form, the Working Group simply reacted with "Great idea! 
Let's tweak a few details and rush it right through!"

It never should have been raised, let alone discussed.

> But please don't tell people to be quiet.

I intend to continue to tell people to drop patently ridiculous, 
erroneous, and irrelevant suggestions.

> (and do give some latitude for people to make mistakes or plow old ground.

Approved Persons have such latitude in unlimited quantity. The Working
Group will endlessly debate one asinine proposition after another even
after being told it's asinine. Merely as an example, five years after WCAG
1.0, you're still obsessing about acronyms and abbreviations (of which the
original discussion in this context is merely a variant). Do we not have
more important things to do for WCAG 2.0?

So no, if the Working Group keeps barking up the wrong tree, I won't 
refrain from pointing the dog at another tree.
