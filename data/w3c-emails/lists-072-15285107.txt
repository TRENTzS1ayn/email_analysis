A point of clarification: the proposed changes need only apply to CSS 2. I
would not expect CSS 1 implementations to be modified at all. The move
from CSS 1 to CSS 2 would involve a significant amount of software
development; and the improvements with respect to cascading could be made
as part of the migration.
