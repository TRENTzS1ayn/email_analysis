Yes. A slight variation:

     user accessibility
     author important
     user important
     browser important
     author normal | author accessibility
     user normal
     browser default

There are three changes:

  - the browser can also have important declarations.
  - author's "accessibility" declarations are treated as normal, not
    important
  - "accessibility" has replaced "required"

The last change was done since the UA can never guarantee any
renedering and "required" therefore gives the wrong associations.
Consider this example:

  BODY { font-family: helvetica !required }

Helvetica may not be available, but the content should still be
displayed.
