Good, would Microsoft be able to publish a wrapper application?

I see the difference between the two statements, but I still believe
you can use CSS to express all semantics. When the user declares that
colors in the incoming document is to be ignored, the UA increases the
weight of the color declarations in the browser and user style sheets
from normal to "accessibility", and voila!
