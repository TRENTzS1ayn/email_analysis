For the sake of clarity, I shall illustrate my proposal with an example.
Given the following user style:

li { color: red ! required }

and an author's style which provides as follows:

ol li.abc { color: blue ! important }

then if there is an ordered list in the document such as:

<ol> <li class="abc"> This is the first and only item in an ordered list.
</ol>

the above item will be coloured red, despite the author's declaration.
This is a result of the stipulation, set forth in my previous message,
that the "required" key word should give the user's rule priority over all
of the author's rules, regardless of the specificity of the latter.
Furthermore, as this example makes clear, "required" rules have priority
over the author's "important" rules.
