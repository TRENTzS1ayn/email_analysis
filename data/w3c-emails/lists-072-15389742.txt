I agree that a new keyword is the best solution.

Specificity is not a probelem. Consider the cascading rules in [1].
The rules are sorted w.r.t. "explicit weight" (i.e. "important" or
not) before origin and then specificity. A new keyword which is placed
over "important" will therefore automatically win over other rules
regardless of their specificity. Also, we will need a rule which
reservers the new keyword for users only.

No, in many cases the UA will have to approximate values specified in
CSS declarations. The word "required" implies that if the demand can't
be met, something drastic will happen -- e.g. the page will not be
shown. This, in my mind, is incompatible with improving access to
information.

I think "accessibility" is a little better, but not much. How about
"x-important" in the good tradition of T-shirts?
