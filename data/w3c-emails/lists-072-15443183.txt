No. In CSS1, the inherited value is only used if no declarations apply
to the element/property combination -- i.e. only as a last resort.
However, the proposed CSS2 "inherit" value on all properties will make
it possible to strengthen the inherited value:

  BODY { color: red }
  H1 { color: inherit ! accessibility }  

The last rule will ensure the color of the H1 element is the same as
its parent.
