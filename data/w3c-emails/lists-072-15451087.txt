Yes.

Seems hard to explain. Also, remember, there are three parts in the
cascade: browser, user and author.

I think we can find a wording which will allow proxies to be
considered as a user -- after all they're proxies on behalf of the
user.

Personally I hate when dialog boxes pop up, and I'd certainly not want
to acknowledge that the browser substitues Univers with Helvetica for
every page I hit. The negotiation should happen seamlessly on my
behalf and I, as a user, should be given a vocabulary which leaves
room for negotiation. Is there a diplomat among us?

That's correct. CSS can only express constructive rules based on the
markup, not reactive rules based on the presentation. I don't see how
the two can gracefully be combined.

I think all participants in this discussion would agree with you.
However, it's politically easier to fight this battle with
accessibilty as the official motive.
