In discussions on our last call "usability" came up since it was a question
from one of our reviewers

 

How do we separate

"Accessibility / Usability problems that are specific to disabilities" 

From

"usability issues that are faced by all users"

 

 

One test I have sometimes found useful in examining this question is 

   "Does it multiply the time and effort for people with disabilities by the
same amount as people without disabilities?"

If the multiplier is the same - then it may be a general usability issue.

 

For example

Good page    2 min  for  no disability

Good page    4 min for screen reader user

 

Bad page      3 min for no disability

Bad page       6 min for screen reader user

 

This bad page appears to be 50% harder for both groups.   This looks more
like a general usability problem rather than accessibility since it slows
everyone down by the same factor

 

 

Another example

 

Good page   2 min for no disability 

Good page   4 min with screen reader

 

Page 2  -    3 min for no disability

Page 2  -    10 min   with screen reader. 

 

Page 3  -    3 min for no disability

Page 3  -     cannot get at some of the information with screen reader. 

 

These look like accessibility problems 

Page 2 is much more than proportionately harder (250% vs 50%)

Page 3 is inaccessible 

 

 

Just passing along in case it is of use to others in thinking about the
problem
