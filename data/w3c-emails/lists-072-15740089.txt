I assume this cleans up some of the descriptive difficulties.

It has a nifty little "contents in a box" thing, with nice tiny font 
which makes life not much more difficult.

But it doesn't fix the basic author/user power struggle. As a user, the 
only right I can preserve for ever is to vote with my feet (and my $)

I won't use Word 97 because I want control over my HTML. I won't use CSS 
if it won't allow me control - I'll simply stick with a non-CSS browser 
that gives me more brutal and uglier, but more effective control.

Progress just means we are going somewhere. When we go backwards, it's 
still quicker to walk. But I guess that's why this discussion is carried 
by email and not by a really clever web-based technology.
