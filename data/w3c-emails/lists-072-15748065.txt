Hi, I just joined.

For those who don't know me, I'm Liam Quinn from the Web Design Group [1]. 
 I'm the co-author of the WDG's Guide to Cascading Style Sheets [2] and am 
currently working on an HTML 4.0 reference.  I've also written a short 
Accessibility Guide [3].

I look forward to contributing to the discussion and helping in any way 
that I can.  If you'd like to know more about me, you can visit my 
personal home page at <http://www.htmlhelp.com/%7Eliam/>.
