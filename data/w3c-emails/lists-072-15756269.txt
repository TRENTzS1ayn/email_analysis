There are some issues about CSS2 which require discussion of details
that are in members-only drafts and management plans that are not
for public view.

Because we have members-only facilities for WAI-PF already, may I
request that further discussion of the CSS2 draft (from here to
PR, other than what we take for public comment to the WAI-IG list)
be conducted on the w3c-wai-pf mailing list.

Anyone on HC that is not subscribed to WAI-PF and wants to follow
the CSS2 discussions, please contact Daniel and me promptly.

This will be a burden on some of the people that are only on WAI-PF
for the SMIL review that is happening at the same time.

Until this double threading is over, please start your subject
line with CSS2 or SMIL if that is what you are talking about, to
help people wade through the mail.
