Hello all, 

first welcome to these two lists.

(they are both archived off http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public)

- WG (Working Group) is for active participation in design, coding, and
writing specification. 

- IG (Interest Group) is for following the activity in terms of
meeting agenda, presentations being made, results, but also exchange
ideas, and give input to the working group.

I'll post a more detailed charter for both groups later on.

The purpose of this message is to give you the agenda for the first WG
meeting in Sophia-Antipolis, May 22.


After some thinking, I decided to remove the sessions on guidelines
from this first meeting, partly because Gregg Vanderheiden is not
going to be there and also because we're short in time as is and
lastly because it's logical: first things first, let's put the effort
in the technology and then we can work out the msg about the
technology (but since Mike Paciello is going to be there, we will take
the opportunity to talk a little about education/awareness process
over lunch).
 
It's at
