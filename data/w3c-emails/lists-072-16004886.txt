Agreed. When we get to work user-agent guidelines, this will show
up. I was only referring to our work on format/protocol for now.

I haven't yet thought about how to, or if we want to, separate the
user-agent/browser guidelines from the more generic GUI access
guidelines. Browsers are fastly becoming THE interface of choice on
the desktop (see Win98) and an issue of scope will need to be raised
when we get to work on that.
