Daniel

Both you and Al raise the question as to whether we should have separate 
guidelines or not.

In the other list I just mentioned (as you did) that the two will converge 
and that (with applets and all) you will download you viewer from your 
source as often as not in the future.

I think we should work on some general comprehensive guidelines that start 
functional and then show how the requirements need to be implemented at all 
levels.    We should also show how the requirements are not specific to 
disability and relate to   low bandwidth connections,    audio access 
 (e.g. driving car etc),  and agent access.

A lot of work but we an borrow it wherever possible.
