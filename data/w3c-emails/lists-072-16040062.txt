Jim,
Thank you for your mail. I appreciate your interest in web access
for the vision impaired user. 
The reason I have not responded to your mail in the past was that
your signature file made it unclear to me what your association with the
WAI was. When I see a company website referenced in a signature file I
become concerned about commercial interests being involved and potential
conflicts of interest. However, you are clearly on the WAI mailing list
because the mail you quote below was not intentionally sent to you. 
(However, I have no issue with your receiving it.) 
With respect to getting the technology into the hands of the users
who need it: there are many, many reasons for the motor impaired to access
the web now. As more and more commerce goes on line- Seattle Sidewalk,
Peapod, Amazon, etc- life will become much easier for people with severe
motor disabilities. The current work being done by the WAI is not a pre-
requisite to access for this population. 
This isn't to say that the work for the vision and hearing
impaired isn't worth while. My point is that different groups of disabled
people have different web access needs. To suggest that work for the
vision impaired is a prerequisite to, or directly portable to, work
for other groups of disabled is inaccurate.
Thank you for your input.
