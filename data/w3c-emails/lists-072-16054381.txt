For many of the problems associated with WWW access many of the problems
can be solved and probably can only solved on the browser side.  I think a
key area for the W3C is to develop browser guidelines and
demonstrate/verify what types of browser based solutions work for people
with disabilities.  I think the guidelines need to be based on universal
design (UD) principles, which extend the capabilities of current browser
technologies.  Additional controls and views need to be a part of current
browsers.

For information on some of the features of a browser based on UD principles
see the page at:

Here at UIUC we are working on developing a prototype accessible browser
and a demo version should be available in July to handle HTML 3.2:

Does the W3C have influence with major browser developers like Netscape or
Microsoft over user interface design issues?
