Hello all,

In Spain we say "el que mucho abarca poco aprieta", that is to say that  we may
up not reaching any of our goals if we try to tell software vendors how to do
their work, hardware companies how they should design their products and W3C
how protocols should be done.

Consequently I think that this group should concentrate efforts on
the protocol side. This does not mean that work should not be done on the other
subject, I just don't think this is the right place. I assume that Gregg's
conversations with Microsoft on how to make software accesible would be far
more
productive than our writing new guidelines.

Let me state too, that IMHO when all software will be accesible
(including Java Applets, browsers, etc...) there will not be problems for motor
impaired to surf the net. But cognitive computer acces issues seem rather
difficult to even state, and that's the reason why there's very few literature
concerning this subject.

Brief, I think this group should stick to protocols and Internet standards,

Regards,
