absolutely.   People with all disabilities have access issues at the 
browser / viewer end.

Couple of additional thoughts.

- Source documents used to only be a problem for people with sensory and 
cognitive disabilities.

- Now that we are including user interface issues in source materials (e.g. 
Java applets et al) we are making source materials a problem for people 
with all disabilities.

- Moreover, solutions in the browser (e.g. if we have an accessible 
browser) are not enough if the source materials (including the applets) are 
not accessible as well.

- This is just more evidence for not treating them as separate entities in 
discussion accessibility.
