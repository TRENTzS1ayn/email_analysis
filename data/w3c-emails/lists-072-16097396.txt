I guess we're boiling down to saying that Source and User-agent side
are equally important. We plan to adress both in the WAI.

My personal take on that is that Source is the *enabling*
part while the user-agent work is the *delivering* part. Whatever that
means :-)

It's on our agenda for the Boston meeting (Tuesday August 5th) which
is going to be focused on guidelines (all kind).

Thanks for the pointer, I'll attach them to the agenda.
(I already knew your work Jon, and I hope you are going to be able to
participate in the WAI).

We hope to think so!
They are both members.
