Did I miss the minutes from the 22 May conclave?

I am treading water a bit until I have a better sense of that
meeting.

For my needs, a simple list of action items and of attendees is
most of what I want.  More extensive reporting of the discussion
is interesting, but not necessarily worth delaying the basics.
