     The U.S. Access Board has recently developed guidelines for 
     implementation of Section 255 of the Telecommunications Act.  The U.S. 
     Department of Ed has just developed software guidelines for those 
     interested in contracting with the Department.  In the near future, 
     the Department will complete a draft of guidelines for Section 508 of 
     the Rehabilitation Act which requires electronic accessibility in the 
     Federal workplace. 
     
If you want copies of these documents, I will be glad to get them to you.

I guess we're boiling down to saying that Source and User-agent side 
are equally important. We plan to adress both in the WAI.
     
My personal take on that is that Source is the *enabling*
part while the user-agent work is the *delivering* part. Whatever that 
means :-)

It's on our agenda for the Boston meeting (Tuesday August 5th) which 
is going to be focused on guidelines (all kind).

Thanks for the pointer, I'll attach them to the agenda.
(I already knew your work Jon, and I hope you are going to be able to 
participate in the WAI).

We hope to think so!
They are both members.
