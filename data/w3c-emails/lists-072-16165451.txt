After discussing with my management what can be said in this forum, I
believe I can report the following:

- We have made an offer and are negotiating with a particular candidate
- We are waiting for the checks from industry to arrive
- We are waiting for firm start dates from the NSF and the EC funding
- We will need to raise additional money, both from industry and governments
- There will be a small steering committee consisting of individuals chosen
  by industrial supporters and government funding agencies to advise the IPO
  director.
