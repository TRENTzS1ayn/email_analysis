In your memo, you indicate that the funding is from NSF and EC.  Actually, the 
funding is from NIDRR, NSF and EC.  Perhaps you would correct it?  Thanks.

After discussing with my management what can be said in this forum, I 
believe I can report the following:
     
- We have made an offer and are negotiating with a particular candidate 
- We are waiting for the checks from industry to arrive
- We are waiting for firm start dates from the NSF and the EC funding
- We will need to raise additional money, both from industry and governments 
- There will be a small steering committee consisting of individuals chosen
  by industrial supporters and government funding agencies to advise the IPO 
  director.
