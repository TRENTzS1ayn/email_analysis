Of course, sorry for the oversight.

To be exact, I should probably give the meaning of these acronyms,
which might be well known in the US but not everywhere.

NIDRR = US National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research
NFS = US National Science Foundation
EC= European Commission (in our case the TIDE office - Telematics for
