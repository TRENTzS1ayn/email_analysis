People and offices who recognizes themselves as stakeholders with
regard to the Web Accessibility Initiative should step forward
and do what they can to advance the process.  Now.  This does not
require a functioning IPO.  The W3C has already contributed a
valuable resource to this end by setting up the Interest Group
mailing list.

The highest and best form of the Interest Group is a self-managed
team, accepting services but not direction from the WAI and its
IPO.  The "Stakeholders Board" for the U.S. Army Research Lab is
a comparable institution.

Interested parties should be joining the w3c-wai-ig@w3.org
mailing list and organizing themselves.  The technologists need
help setting goals and priorities.  This is critical now.  There
is plenty to be done that can be done by voluntary initiatives
taken by interested parties.  It will help if these activities
stay in touch with one another and with the technologists of the
Working Group via the email list that has been established.
