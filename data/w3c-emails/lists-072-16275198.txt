I activated the Registration form for the August 5th meeting on
Guidelines.

It's pointed off the agenda page at:
  http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/WAI/group/970805/agenda.html

The location (MIT/LCS) is not 100% firm yet but it shouldn't be far in
any case and I'll circulate the exact address as soon as I can.
