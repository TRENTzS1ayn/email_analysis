Dear Mike,

Included in this message is a copy of Texas Senate Bill 294 which was 
signed into law by Governor George W. Bush on June 20, 1997.  It adds 
Section 32.037 to the Texas Education Code.

Note subparagraph (d) concerning accessibility of electronic 
textbooks for students with disabilities.  In a way we have already 
fulfilled this requirement with our earlier report to the Texas 
legislature.  However, we have not addressed the issue of 
cost-effectiveness.

We were planning to do two pilot projects on accessibility even without
legislation.
This law tells us to establish a subcommittee under the main advisory
committee on
computer networks.  We will do both.

I see one pilot project on CD-ROM textbooks and the other on educational 
materials residing on the Internet/World Wide Web and intranets.

This is public information and may be distributed worldwide. Thanks for your 
help!!

Best regards, 

Chuck Mayo 


                                       AN ACT
 1-1     relating to a study project involving the use of computer networks
 1-2     in public schools.
 1-3           BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:
 1-4           SECTION 1.  Subchapter B, Chapter 32, Education Code, is
 1-5     amended by adding Section 32.037 to read as follows:
 1-6           Sec. 32.037.  COMPUTER NETWORK STUDY PROJECT.  (a)  The
 1-7     agency shall develop a study project to determine the costs and
 1-8     benefits of using computer networks, including the Internet, in
 1-9     public schools.  The commissioner shall determine the issues to be
1-10     studied in the project, but the issues must include the possibility
1-11     of delivering, through a computer network, updated supplements to
1-12     textbooks under Chapter 31.
1-13           (b)  An advisory committee shall be appointed to assist the
1-14     agency in the study project.  The commissioner shall appoint to the
1-15     advisory committee agency personnel, textbook publishers,
1-16     educators, students, and technology experts.  The presiding
1-17     officers of the senate and the house of representatives shall each
1-18     appoint two members of the legislature to serve on the advisory
1-19     committee.
1-20           (c)  The study must be:
1-21                 (1)  conducted using a group of school districts
1-22     selected by the agency to provide a geographically,
1-23     demographically, and economically balanced sample;
 2-1                 (2)  designed to yield results with statewide
 2-2     applications; and
 2-3                 (3)  coordinated with the State Board of Education's
 2-4     long-range technology plan adopted under Section 32.001, including
 2-5     standards for computer literacy adopted under Section 32.001(a)(3).
 2-6           (d)  The commissioner shall appoint a subcommittee to
 2-7     investigate the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of developing
 2-8     electronic textbooks that may be used by students who are blind or
 2-9     have other disabilities.
2-10           (e)  The agency shall report the results of the study project
2-11     to the 76th Legislature not later than February 1, 1999.
2-12           (f)  This section expires September 1, 1999.
2-13           SECTION 2.  The importance of this legislation and the
2-14     crowded condition of the calendars in both houses create an
2-15     emergency and an imperative public necessity that the
2-16     constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several
2-17     days in each house be suspended, and this rule is hereby suspended,
2-18     and that this Act take effect and be in force from and after its
2-19     passage, and it is so enacted.
