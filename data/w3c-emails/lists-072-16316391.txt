I just agreed to a contract with Web Techniques magazine that will provide
an excellent forum for WAI WG activities (as well as W3C and industry
supported standards/protocol development). Starting with the October '97
issue, I'll be writing the WebEnabled column for Web Techniques. 

Over the course of the next several months I'll write articles that examine
HTML accessibility guidelines, content design, user interface design, style
sheets, browsers, certification tools and accessible authoring tools. We'll
also  introduce users to speech interfaces, shortcuts, freeware and shareware.

As you'll see in my first column, "The Web Accessibility Initiative ? Good
Business or Good Deed?", I have no problem (and neither does Web
Techniques) dropping certain names, promoting products that support
accessibilty, highlighting web pages and doing just about anything that
will help us to raise awareness (and additional WAI and YRIF funding). 

I hope that everyone on this list (and the IG list) will support this work.
It's a first step in our educational activities. As a writer, I may need to
interview you or ask for technical information, including examples. We all
have an obligation to this information out and build upon the foundation
that the W3C and our sponsors have already layed for us.

Looking forward to working with you.

Regards,

Mike Paciello
