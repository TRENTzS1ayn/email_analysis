I have had some feedback on the AUS Accessibility Standards
for Web Design (guidelines for accessibility for Australian 
Govt websites), in regards to fine-tuning some of the Standards.

However, I am not certain as to the accuracy of some of these 
recommendations, therefore, I was hopeful for some expert feedback.

(1) Do the Height and Width attributes in image tags alter page load time, 
or do they simply load text first?

(2) Is it the case that the vast majority of web clients wrap ALT text? 

(3) Is it fair to describe the latest version of Lynx as frames capable?

(4) Finally, does validation also serve the purpose of making a site
accessible? 

Your views would be most welcome

Regards

Robert Savellis
