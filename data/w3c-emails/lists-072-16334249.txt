The issue is with formatting.

You have to load some text first, in order to get the IMG SRC that are
included. But since you don't want to relayout the text after each
images, it's better to know the size of the image in advance (so you
reserve the space and move forward in the text stream).

So yes, putting image size is valuable.

Note that this can also be done using CSS.
  <IMG SRC=foo.gif STYLE="width:3cm;height:4cm">

I don't really know for sure. Netscape 3.0 doesn't.

Don't know.

What kind of validation ? just HTML ?
