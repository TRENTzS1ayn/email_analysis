Internet Explorer 3.0 will automatically expand a image box to include
all the ALT text, wrapping it around if it would be wider than the
screen width.  This is regardless of the HEIGHT=/WIDTH= parameters.  It
is done in response to the SPI_SCREENREADER flag that Windows supports.
So, if a screen reader is present, we make sure all the ALT text is
visible on the screen.
