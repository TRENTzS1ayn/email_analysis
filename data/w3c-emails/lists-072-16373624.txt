How about users who don't have screen readers but want the alt text??  

Can it be set to do this without a screen reader?  
Is there a way to set the flag without a screen reader?

I thought I remembered something about this from an earlier conversation but I remember it as indefinite.  Current status?

Thanks

Gregg

Internet Explorer 3.0 will automatically expand a image box to include
all the ALT text, wrapping it around if it would be wider than the
screen width.  This is regardless of the HEIGHT=/WIDTH= parameters.  It
is done in response to the SPI_SCREENREADER flag that Windows supports.
So, if a screen reader is present, we make sure all the ALT text is
visible on the screen.
