The ALT is displayed normally if the screen reader flag is not set.  The
only difference when the flag is set is that the HEIGHT and WIDTH
attributes are ignored.

This allows ALT that are contained within small images to display the
entire ALT text.  This forces a reformatting of page, usually not what
the author intended.

The screen reader flag is the only get to get IE to ignore the author
specified formatting of the page.  At present, there is no user
interface to set the screen reader flag, but it would be trivial to
write a applet that did.
