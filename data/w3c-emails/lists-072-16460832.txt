My girlfriend recently moved here from Australia after a 10 year career with
the Office of Disability in Brisbane, Queensland.  We live in Toronto and she
is interested in doing some volunteer work in
 policy/services/Internet/information areas.  Could you please let me know
where to send her.  Also, feel free to send this message out.

thanks!

JAMES STEWART
