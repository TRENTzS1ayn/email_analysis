Since the "User Interface '97 Conference" is being held in Cambridge, MA I
thought that someone might be able to represent the W3C WAI and spread the word
about accessibility to this group. I am not personally involved in the
conference.

I've copied the conference chair so that he is aware of our activities
http://www.w3.org/WAI/ and the basic accessibility principiles of keyboard
access, and alternative text for images, sound, and video.

Subject: User Interface '97 Conference

I thought the members of this list would be interested in a
conference called User Interface 97. It will be held November 3, 4 &
5 in Cambridge, MA. We've gotten eight of the most talented people in
the field of user interface design to give full-day seminars and
short presentations on the state of the art in software and web-site
design.

User Interface 97 is a 3-day conference for people who have hands-on
involvement in product development. You'll come away with practical
knowledge that you can begin using immediately in your work. Topics
include:

  * Designing Useful Websites
  * Interviewing Customers
  * Visual Design for Information Products
  * Effective Web Site Design
  * Design for Emerging Web Technologies
  * Model-Driven User Interface Design
  * Designing with the Mind in Mind
  * Adventures in Avatar Cyberspace

We've lined up some world-renowned experts as speakers including
Jakob Nielsen, Ellen Isaacs, Bruce Damer, Mary Mooney, Wayne Neale,
Marc Rettig, Eric Lunt, Tom Hewett, Larry Constantine, and Lucy
Lockwood.

If you register by October 13, you'll receive a 16% early
registration discount. From October 14 to October 31, regular rates
apply.

I would be happy to e-mail you more information about the User
Interface 97 conference. Send mailto:UI97INFO@UIE.COM with the words
