I suggested to them that a significant gap in their program was absence of
any accessibility awareness. I offered to provide some accessibility input 
to them. They asserted that it might show up in some of the sessions, though 
it was not a focus of any. Part of their rationale was that that was a small 
conference and they were uncertain if attendees would see any revenue 
potential from accessibility. A pity.
