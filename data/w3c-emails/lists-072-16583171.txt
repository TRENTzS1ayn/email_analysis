Hello Group,
In a previous post I mentioned that I would be looking into the
web kiosks offered at the 7-Eleven franchise in Seattle. Here are some
preliminary observations from a recent visit I made to one of their local
outlets. ( I am sighted and took photos of the unit. When I get them
developed I'll post them to my web site.)

The Kiosk:
The kiosk itself is rectangular in shape with a narrow base
(24in). The design is very much Buck Rogers, with a large art deco grill
piece emblazoned with the words "USWEST" on top. The height of the unit
exceeded my pocket tape measure but I would estimate it to be about 84in.
The depth from keyboard to monitor was 11in.  The keyboard itself sits
42in high, while the credit card reader is perched at a lofty 62in. 
Clearly, this unit is meant to be used in the standing postion. 
Instructions on operation are provided by way of two small metal
signs located just below the monitor. The are painted crome metal and are
difficult to read due to glare.  There are what appear to be two speaker
ports mounted above the monitor. I could find no brail on the unit. (I
looked for, but could not locate a placard identifying the manufacturer .
There was however an 800 number to call for problems: 1-800-234-4041)

The Hardware:

Monitor: 13in diagonal mounted flat (no angle). There is a
plexiglass pane mounted in front of the monitor itself. The large art deco
grill piece mentioned previously overhangs the top of the monitor and
managed to minimize glare. 

Keboard: QWERTY made by Datalux and mounted at a slight (10
degree) angle. The function keys are clustered at the top. There is an
ALPS Glide Point mousepad mounted in front of the keyboard. The keyboard
requires significant pressure to activate and feels "mushy".

The Software:

The on screen advertising suggests that the software interface was
designed by a company called !NTERACT. Operation instructions are provided
in visual mode only and the user is instructed to initiate the process by
touching the mousepad.  From that point forward you are presented with a
series of graphics laden pages and required to move the cursor over
various images and perform mouse clicks in order to make selections. Some
of the options provided include: WWW, AOL, E-Mail, Surf the USWest
Website, Marketplace, Games, and Telnet. On the third screen of
instructions I selected the graphic entitled surf the WWW and was prompted
to slide my credit card through. About fifteen seconds later Internet
Explorer appeared with Yahoo as the home page. There was no sound output
whatsoever for the 15 minutes I spent on the system.

The Cost:

Five minutes free, 2.95 for the next ten, 1.95 for each ten there
after. I spent $2.95. 

Accessability:

Obviously, there are some pretty glaring design flaws described
here. The unit I tested would be inaccessable to either a person in a
wheelchair (too high), or a blind user (no brail or sound output). 
However, given the complexity of the on screen instructions many young,
elderly, and cognitively impaired would likely find it unusable also.
I am not certain that this is only kiosk model that 7-Eleven is
testing. I will call to inquire and take a look at any other offerings
they may have.
7-Eleven has 850 franchises in Northern California and the Pacific
Northwest region, and more than 16,000 world wide. The stakes of bad
design are high here.
