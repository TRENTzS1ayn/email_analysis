Dear IPO/WAI Interest Group Participant:

This message announces the next Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)
meetings which will be held in Austin, Texas, USA, at IBM, on November 10
and 11, 1997 just prior to the HTML and CSS meetings in the same location.

A preliminary agenda with venue and hotel information is available at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/group/971110/agenda.html.  More complete venue
information will be available early next week.

This is a combined 2-day meeting of the International Program Office
(IPO)/WAI Interest group, and of the WAI technical, guidelines, and rating
and certification working groups, some of which are already underway and
some in formation.

There will be parallel break-out sessions during both days and people
will be free to attend the IPO/WAI sessions they prefer.

A registration form for the event is available off the agenda page.
Registration is required in order to attend.  Registration is due by
Monday, October 27, 5:00 pm EDT.

If you have questions or concerns about attending the event, please
contact either Judy Brewer or Daniel Dardailler.

Regards,

Judy Brewer
