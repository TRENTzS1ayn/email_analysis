Yes. All I wanted was to point out that this is true both in 
accessibility and in usability. So, to say "usability issues that are 
faced by all users" is a little... uhm... odd. It's not what it is or 
what it should be. I agree that we need grouping. Even set up a scenario 
is a way of grouping, in a sense.

Even to talk of general accessibility, after all, is not really correct, 
because blind users have different problems from color-blind user. So 
the problems is in talking in general. Grouping is needed as a 
satisfying method that can drive the design and the evaluation.

Another point is that time measures need good sampling and statistical 
constraints, of course, so, if we have small groups, timing is not 
really a good way to distinguish group differences. So, if we have small 
group, we need another way to compare problems and UI. Perhaps we need 
some GOMS-like method (1) translation to different category of users. 
Goms can be used to compare the efficiency of GUI in certain tasks. It 
refer to not-disable individual. We could use some similar method to 
compare the efficiency of the same interface between different groups of 
users. In that way we can compare the before-after interfaces for 
different targets of user.

It's just an idea. Needs research contribution, I guess.

Ok, I'll take the time to make a simple table to express myself in a 
screen-readable mode.. ;-)
