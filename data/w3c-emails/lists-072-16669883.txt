Dear IPO/WAI Interest Group Members:

This is a reminder that within the next week you will be receiving proposed
recommendations from the WAI HC (HTML and CSS) Working Group to review
prior to submission to the W3C HTML and CSS Working Groups.  

These recommendations were developed under a tight timeline to ensure
that specific recommendations related to accessibility can be incorporated
into the HTML 4.0 and CSS 2 specifications, which are
currently being finalized by the W3C.

When you receive these draft recommendations, there will be a one-week
period to review and comment.  After that, and providing consensus is
reached among the HC and the IG forum that these are our official
recommendations by decision of the chair of the IG and the HC group based
on feedback from IG to HC, the documents will be communicated to the
HTML/CSS groups.  Although additional IG comments will still be accepted,
it will become less practical to incorporate them in our recommendations.
The final deadline for receiving your input will be the IPO/WAI
face-to-face meeting in November in Austin; however, proposed changes
brought up at that time will be much more difficult to integrate into the
final HTML and CSS documents.

Your comments on the recommendations should to be sent to the
w3c-wai-hc@w3.org alias. An update on the status of the review will be
given regularly on the IG list.

If you have any questions on this process, please contact Daniel Dardailler
(danield@w3.org) or Judy Brewer (jbrewer@w3.org).

Regards,

Judy Brewer
