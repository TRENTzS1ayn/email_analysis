Looks good.

 

I think you can drop the "in the future" part and just say   "transcoding
servers and intelligent user agents"  since transcoding servers already
exist and, with good content,  I think their use will increase. Also
intelligent user agents.

As per the request in Bug 704,
http://tech.trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=704 I've added a
paragraph to the benefits section of 3.2. I'm a little shy about phrases
like "in the future" cause it reminds me of the "until user agents." So
we'll have to evaluate if the benefits of the addition outweigh the
reminiscences of WCAG 1.0.

Who Benefits from Guideline 3.2 (Informative) 

Providing consistent and predictable responses to user actions is important
feedback for users. This lets them know that your site is working properly
and encourages them to continue interacting with the content. When users
receive an unexpected response, they might conclude that something is wrong
or broken. Some people might become so confused they will not be able to use
your site.

 

Individuals who are unable to detect extreme changes in context or may not
realize that the context has changed are less likely to become disoriented
while navigating a site. This applies to people in the following ways: 

 

Individuals who are blind or have low vision may have difficulty knowing
when a visual context change, such as a new window popping up, has occurred.
In this case, warning users of context changes in advance minimizes
confusion when the user discovers that the back button no longer behaves as
expected.

 

Using captions to note changes in speaker is beneficial for individuals who
are deaf or hard of hearing and who may be unable to discern changes in
speaker for audio-only presentations.

 

Some individuals with low vision, with dyslexia and who have difficulty
interpreting visual cues may benefit from additional cues in order to detect
extreme changes in context.

In the future this may allow user agents to be more flexible in their
presentation of content. Benefits could include such things as letting the
user adjust whether they want to allow, block, or be asked how to handle
pop-ups; notifying the user when a page transition makes significant changes
to the page layout; identifying links that will pop up a new window or go to
a different site; etc.
