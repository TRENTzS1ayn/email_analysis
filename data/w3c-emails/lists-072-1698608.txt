1 - tables are listed as non-hierarchical which is not really best.  Would
suggest tables be moved out from the 'non-hierarchical" category and put by
themselves in the same sentence.
 
 2 - the picture example may imply that we are requiring that all pictures
be
done in SVG and be fully marked up in hierarchical fashion.   I think that
example might be better in techniques where it can be explained better and
looked at as where we want to go someday - not what is required for level 1
conformance - which is implied by making part of the definition of the term
used in level 1

These two examples were part of the "definition of Structure" before my
action item. I just added a sentence to the end of the definition. But since
I'm here already, here is a repost of my action item with the above
recommendations. The mention of tables and headers might be a bit HTML
specific but since it's in the appendix of definition perhaps its
forgivable.
 
 
structure 
 
Structure includes both hierarchical structure of the content and
non-hierarchical relationships such as cross-references. <new>It also refers
to the
correspondence between header and data cells in a table.</new> The
hierarchical
structure of content represents changes in context. For example,
 
1.      A book is divided into chapters, paragraphs, lists, etc. Chapter
titles help the reader anticipate the meaning of the following paragraphs.
Lists clearly indicate separate, yet related ideas. All of these divisions
help the reader anticipate changes in context.
 
<new> [deleted the bicycle image example]</new>
 
<new>We refer to structure as it is perceived by a User Agent such as a
browser on the client side. </new>
