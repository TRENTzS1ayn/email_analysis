Here is how I did my "end to ends"

 

1)       I went to the guideline document and copied the specific Guideline
into a separate document (HTML table). I included the Success Criteria and
benefits. (MS word but HTML)

2)        Then I went to the technology independent techniques and looked
for anything that that would address this guideline and copied that into the
document directly following the paste I did from the Guidelines

3)       Then I went to each of the techniques documents and did the same.

 

Eventually, I had one document that had a 

 

a) Guideline, Success Criteria, and benefits from the Guidelines, 

b) a technique for the Gateway 

c) techniques from the HTML or CSS documents.

 

Then I just printed it out and read through the whole thing to look for
overhand and gaps between the documents. And made comments.

 

Then I copied them in copied them in the side be side HTML table template
that I had made and submitted it.

Feel free to use this table for other "end to ends" if it is useful
