Dear Chris,

I have posted some thoughts about this already in:
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2004JanMar/0234.html>

I insist that you review once more the HTML spec. WCAG cannot force people to 
use TH in data tables, because simply it is against the spec:

<http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/tables.html#edef-TD>

data cells (TD) can also be headers. It states:
"<!-- TH is for headers, TD for data, but for cells acting as both use TD -->"
That is what attributes @headers and @scope were created for.

regards,
carlos
