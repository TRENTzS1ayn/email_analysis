Using TH elements for data tables is within the HTML specification. It's
perfectly OK and is the intended purpose of the TH element.

Navigating data tables using assistive technologies is very difficult but
adding TH elements to the table can help make the navigation easier. This is
the reason behind the TH rule. It's not required as part of the HTML spec
but can be required by accessibility guidelines. I believe that this simple
rule can make a large difference in creating more accessible tables.

This is a comment within the specification. It's not a requirement for
compliance. Below is another comment from the HTML spec that states your ALT
text should be a description of the image. Our accessibility guidelines run
contrary to that comment and require that spacer and decorative images do
not have a description and should be null. Yes, we must follow the HTML
specification but we don't have to abide with editor comments.

<!-- To avoid problems with text-only UAs as well as
   to make image content understandable and navigable
   to users of non-visual UAs, you need to provide
   a description with ALT, and avoid server-side image maps -->

Kind Regards,
Chris
