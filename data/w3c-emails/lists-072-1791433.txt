Well I'll say  make table caption  too necessary for data tables. They will certainly  help make a distinction and be very useful for accessibility and enhance usability.
Captions make sense for  data tables and I have yet to see one used on a layout table like table summaries are.
Again,  when tables are nested, only the  nested table can be a data table. The  outer table must always be regarded as a layout table.

Chris, by the way, JAWS and HPR handle scope  for simple tables but WinEyes4.5  does not handle scope at all. HTML specs also say use scope on simple tables only. JAWS reads first row cells and left column cells as col and row headers regardless of markup (th or td) Thois is JAWS 4.51 to 5.0.
