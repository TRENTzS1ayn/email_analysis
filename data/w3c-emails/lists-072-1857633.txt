Hi Jason,

  I think this is close.  Only difference  in my understanding are

 The checklists are attached to the guidelines not the techniques -- though
they draw from the techniques.   There is more in the techniques than would
be in the checklists.  They are the minimum (with options where they exist)
needed to conform to the guideline's success criteria.

It appears from this discussion that we are arriving at a structure
very similar to that of WCAG 1.0 documents, but with a more
sophisticated "techniques gateway". Perhaps call it a "WCAG gateway"
or something similar.

1. WCAG 2.0 document.

2. WCAG gateway.

3. Core techniques (separate from gateway).

4. Techniques for each technology.

5. Checklists for core techniques and for each technology or
   combination of technologies from which content may be composed.

as I remember, we laid it down as a principle that each checklist
should cover the entire guidelines, so that anybody who completes a
checklist by "checking off" all level 1 items, for example, can claim
level 1 conformance on that basis, and likewise for the other
level(s).

I may have missed part of the discussion, so the above may not be an
accurate statement of where we are headed. It is at best an attempt to
capture some of the central points which have emerged.
