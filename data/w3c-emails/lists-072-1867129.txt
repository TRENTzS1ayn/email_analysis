What I am saying Chris, is that TH is *not* the only way to specify a header, as 
it says the spec, not only the comment extracted. I am not saying that TH shall 
not be used.

In my view, an empty "alt" attribute is a value. As you know, in many 
programming languages, a "null" string is not the same as an "empty" string. I 
do not see any contradiction here between the guidelines and the spec.
