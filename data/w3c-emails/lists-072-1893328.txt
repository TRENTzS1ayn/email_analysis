When this came up in a recent call, I was puzzled and confused by the term
"rule." I agree with Chris that the guidelines could go beyond the HTML spec
to "require" the use of TH if and only if the table is a data table. That
may be a good idea, because, as we argue so often, you can always visually
style your TH's any way you want.

But the reason Chris gives doesn't work for me. Screen readers can read
tables cell by cell whether or not they are data tables. They don't need to
know the difference between layout and data. 

When there is no table markup, Home Page Reader, JAWS and Window-Eyes all
assume that row 1 and column 1 are headings for columns and rows
respectively. And they will read those "headings" as you navigate with the
table navigation keys.

When there is data-table markup (TH, scope, headers/id's), HPR is different
from the screen readers. Once there is any data-table markup, HPR reads ONLY
what the author has marked up as heading information. I think that is the
way it should be. 

If I were to "require" a data table indication, a "rule," I would use the
requirement of a summary or (not and) a caption. As far as headings
information, if you mark up data tables, then be sure to indicate all
headings through that markup. If you don't mark up data table headings then
row 1 and column 1 will be assumed to be headings.

Because screen reader developers are very pragmatic, the use of row 1 and
column 1 comes through even there is markup for headings (see [1]).

Example 5 in [1] does not have scope and Jaws reads those headings. These
comparisons live on very slippery slope. I would not be the slightest bit
surprised if I have errors in my assertions in [1] about what the AT does.
Except for HPR, the usual deference to row 1 and column 1 is confusing in
trying to figure out screen reader behavior.

Summary I can see, but because of the visibility of the caption, it seems
that the "rule" might be, as I suggested above, "Always use summary or
caption on data tables. Don't use summary or caption on layout tables
(please)."
