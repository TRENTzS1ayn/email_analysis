The current proposal is:
"Transcoding servers and intelligent user agents can be more flexible in
their presentation of content to the user. Benefits include such things as 
letting
the user adjust whether they want to allow, block, or be asked how to handle
pop-ups; notifying the user when a page transition makes significant changes
to the page layout; identifying links that will pop up a new window or go to
a different site; etc."

How about "web services and user agents" or "web services and clients"  or 
"web services and browsers" instead of "Transcoding servers and intelligent 
user agents."
