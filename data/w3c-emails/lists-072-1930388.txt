The current proposal is:
"Transcoding servers and intelligent user agents can be more flexible in
their presentation of content to the user. Benefits include such things
as
letting
the user adjust whether they want to allow, block, or be asked how to
handle
pop-ups; notifying the user when a page transition makes significant
changes
to the page layout; identifying links that will pop up a new window or
go to
a different site; etc."

How about "web services and user agents" or "web services and clients"
or
"web services and browsers" instead of "Transcoding servers and
intelligent
user agents."

Roberto Scano:
I suggest to mantain transcoding servers and also "user agents". For
"user agents" there is a definition (also from UAAG 1.0) and we can add
a definition for "Transcoding servers" like this one
(http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/gDefinition/0,294236,sid26_gci5
15589,00.html)

"Transcoding is a technology used to adapt computer application displays
and Web content so that they can be viewed on any of the increasing
number of diverse devices on the market. Transcoding servers and
services reformat material that would otherwise have to be developed
separately for display on different platforms. Working like an
interpreter, the technology translates content to suitable formats for
various platforms, regardless of protocol, application, screen size, and
language used."
