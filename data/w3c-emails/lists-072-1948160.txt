I really have to concur with Wendy, we should use terms that don't feel dated 
(but aren't fashions), and as she says transcoding is a very small part of 
the almost unlimited potential of web services.

It is important that we don't limit ourselves too specifically. Unless there 
is a good reason to limit something we should give it as wide a scope as 
possible.
