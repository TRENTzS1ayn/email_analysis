Hello,
 
Yvette and I have been working on the statement about human testability.
What we've come up with isn't so much a definition as a statement of
what we think the group believes-- or is at least a statement that we
would like to be able to make by the time WCAG 2.0 reaches Candidate
Recommendation.  This statement would appear in the Conformance section
along with the explanation of how we sorted success criteria into the
various levels.
 
<begin proposed>
The Working Group believes that tests can show whether Web content
passes or fails each success criterion. Tests can be done by computer
programs or by people who understand these guidelines. We believe that
different people who understand the guidelines will usually get the same
or very similar results
when they test the same success criterion.
</end proposed>
