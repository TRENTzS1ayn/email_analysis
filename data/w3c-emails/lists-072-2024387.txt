As by copying it and pasting it into a text editor? Any site that doesn't 
use pictures of text meets that criterion already.

Or as by loading the text in a pop-up window?

The Working Group realizes, I trust, that, for media types like screen,
projection, and print, all text is presented over a background by
definition? (How else *would* you read it?)

Aren't you just trying to say "If you think someone may have trouble 
reading your text, let them change the foreground and/or background"?
