I agree. More broadly, I think WCAG should, where appropriate, make use of
terminology derived from discussion of "device independence". In this
context I am referring to terms such as "delivery context", "adaptation
mechanism" and so on. One of the advantages of the "device independence"
documents is that a relatively small list of technical terms, used
precisely, suffices to express most of the ideas in the field.
