you mean "when they test the same content against the same success
criteria"?
Are you being deliberately vague about what "usually" and "very similar"
mean? For an explanation of what the working group believes has been
achieved this is probably sufficient. In practice we will have to arrive
at a clearer understanding of the conditions under which "usually" and
"very similar" are satisfied. That can probably await detailed discussions
of success criteria, though, and perhaps doesn't have to be, indeed
perhaps cannot be, solved now.

In general I think the proposed wording is clear and expresses what is
intended.
