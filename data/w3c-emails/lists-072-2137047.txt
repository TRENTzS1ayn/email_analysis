Hi Doyle, hi group 


Doyle:
However, there can be usability issues that make it more difficult for
certain individuals, especially individuals with disabilities. Sometimes,
these same issues make it more challenging for individuals without
disabilities. Hence, if it is an equal burden on everyone, even if it takes
a person with a disability longer, there is not likely an accessibility
issue.

When a usability issue potentially becomes an accessibility barrier is when
the person with a disability (or anyone for that matter) has to take more
time and energy beyond what would have been their norm to complete a given
task.  

For example, if a person without a disability were able to navigate a
particular web resource, interact with content and complete the intended
goal in a given period of time, it might be expected that a person with a
disability could do the same task but it may take longer.  When the typical
take longer time period or energy level is unduly increased for the person
with a disability (beyond what would have been their typical) the issue now
becomes one of accessibility.


Roberto C:
I can agree with tha basic concept within this first draft, but I'm having
some doubt; the real difficult thing is to quantify the maximun amount
(absolute or %) of time or effort that is required for each site (or kind
of) to remain into usability domain; how can we set a range of time periods?
How can we transform the word "typical" into a really testable concept? And,
above all, does this effort to measure in numbers the difference between
usability and accessibility really make sense?

My best regards,

Roberto Castaldo
