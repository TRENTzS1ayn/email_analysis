Sailesh points out that JAWS behaves inconsistently when it encounters
<caption style="display: none">-- it speaks the caption in table-jump
mode (pressing t to go from table to table), but ignores it when reading
line by line or in say-all mode.  This isn't something we should count
on-- it's a bug.

Yes but when one uses the T command to jump from table to table with JFW
or WinEyes, it announces the caption. But not  if you scroll through
using arrow keys.
 
Yes, Thanks about the  th in the corner cell. That was an error.
