    I'm concerned that we're defining "structure" in a way that's still
very HTML-specific.  In the proposal below, I've tried to begin finding
ways of talking about structure for other languages/technologies such as
MathML and SVG.  I very much doubt that I've got it right, but I'm
hoping this will help expand the discussion.  I'll begin with a
proposal, and follow that with a dictionary definition of "structure"
from the online Merriam-Webster dictionary.
 
I've taken a look at the way the SVG spec [1] defines "document
structure," and also at the way the MathML spec [2] talks about what
presentation elements present.
 
<proposed>

structure


Structure refers to the set of elements and relationships that make up a
Web resource.  Elements may contain text, graphics, mathematical
equations, etc. Some elements may contain other elements, and may also
define relationships between two or more elements.   We User agents,
including Web browsers and some assistive technologies, make the
structure of Web resources evident to the user.

 

Some relationships are hierarchical.  For example, an HTML document may
contain multiple sections.  Each section begins with an HTML heading
element (<h1>...<h6>) that contains the title of the section or
sub-section.  The heading element may also show the logical relationship
of one section or sub-section to the sections and sub-sections before
and after it.  

 

In MathML, certain elements are used to show the syntactic structure of
mathematical notation-for example, to make it clear that calculations
have to be performed in a specific order.  In SVG, certain elements
(such as the <g> element) are used to define groups of related graphical
objects and to provide information about the document's structure.

 

Some relationships are non-hierarchical.  For example, non-hierarchical
relationships may be created by links between one part of the document
and another part, or between the document and another resource.

Hi David,

 

Yes - I know that you didn't edit that part - but when you reposted them
- the other bugs showed up.   So I thought we should clean them up as we
do this.  

 

I think a table is hierarchical (though it is also two (or more)
dimensional).  

What if we just drop the "table" sentence since I don't think we need it
- and no use getting into a bunch of discussion about whether it is
hierarchical or not.  

 

That would leave:

 

 
structure 
 
Structure includes both hierarchical structure of the content and
non-hierarchical relationships such as cross-references.   The
hierarchical
structure of content represents changes in context. For example, a book
is divided into chapters, paragraphs, lists, etc. Chapter titles help
the reader anticipate the meaning of the following paragraphs. Lists
clearly indicate separate, yet related ideas. All of these divisions
help the reader anticipate changes in context.
 
We refer to structure as it is perceived by a User Agent such as a
browser on the client side.

Gregg says:
 
<gregg>
 
1 - tables are listed as non-hierarchical which is not really best.
Would
suggest tables be moved out from the 'non-hierarchical" category and put
by
themselves in the same sentence.
 
 2 - the picture example may imply that we are requiring that all
pictures be
done in SVG and be fully marked up in hierarchical fashion.   I think
that
example might be better in techniques where it can be explained better
and
looked at as where we want to go someday - not what is required for
level 1
conformance - which is implied by making part of the definition of the
term
used in level 1  
</gregg>
 
 
These two examples were part of the "definition of Structure" before my
action item. I just added a sentence to the end of the definition. But
since I'm here already, here is a repost of my action item with the
above recommendations. The mention of tables and headers might be a bit
HTML specific but since it's in the appendix of definition perhaps its
forgivable.
 
 
structure 
 
Structure includes both hierarchical structure of the content and
non-hierarchical relationships such as cross-references. <new>It also
refers to the
correspondence between header and data cells in a table.</new> The
hierarchical
structure of content represents changes in context. For example,
 
1.      A book is divided into chapters, paragraphs, lists, etc. Chapter
titles help the reader anticipate the meaning of the following
paragraphs.
Lists clearly indicate separate, yet related ideas. All of these
