Thanks, Jason.

Yes, we mean "... When they test the same content against the same
success criteria."  Thanks.

And yes, I at least (I won't speak for Yvette here) was being
deliberately vague about "usually" and "very similar."  But see
Michael's response on this same point, calling for us to define a
threshhold and use it to test this very statement (or whatever version
of it we agree to).

you mean "when they test the same content against the same success
criteria"? Are you being deliberately vague about what "usually" and
"very similar" mean? For an explanation of what the working group
believes has been achieved this is probably sufficient. In practice we
will have to arrive at a clearer understanding of the conditions under
which "usually" and "very similar" are satisfied. That can probably
await detailed discussions of success criteria, though, and perhaps
doesn't have to be, indeed perhaps cannot be, solved now.

In general I think the proposed wording is clear and expresses what is
intended.
