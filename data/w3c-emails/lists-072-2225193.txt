Hi Roberto -

I think we are saying the same thing or close to the same.

Addressing your comment above, I had written:

"When a usability issue potentially becomes an accessibility barrier is when
the person with a disability (or anyone for that matter) has to take more
time and energy beyond what would have been their norm to complete a given
Task".  

I was trying to say, when a person with a disability or anyone goes well
beyond their typical norm to navigate and use a web resource, it is likely
an accessibility issue.  Let's say, it takes me (generally speaking) ten
minutes to fill out a form (a well formulated and easy to navigate form).
If I go to a different web resource where the same information is being
required and it takes me 20 minutes, I now have an increase in time and
energy.  If a person without a disability has no time differences between
the two web resources as described above, in terms of filling out the forms,
there is an accessibility issue.  This is somewhat difficult to put this
into words.  Hope this makes sense.

We could set a percentage factor but where those numbers would lie, I have
no idea.  Do you have any ideas on numbers?
