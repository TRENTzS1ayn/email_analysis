During the 4 May teleconference, I took an action item to work on some
new examples for Guideline 3.1.  They're listed below.  The proposed
examples for Level 3 were originally presented as part of the "plain
langauge" version of what used to be guideline 3.3.
 
==proposed examples==

Examples for Guideline 3.1 Level 1 SC 1


<proposed>

Example 1. A document that exists in English, French, and German
versions.

 

A corporate Web server identifies the country where a user's IP address
is located. It displays the site in the appropriate language.  A user's
screen reader automatically uses the appropriate pronunciation rules,
based on the presence of a language-identifier in the document.

</proposed>

 

<proposed>

*        Example 2: an acronym.

 

The characters "W3C" are marked as an acronym the first time they appear
on a Web page. A person using a screen reader would hear, "World Wide
Web Consortium.";  Later in the document, the user hears the characters
"W 3 C" spoken one at a time, because they are not marked as an acronym.

</proposed>

 

<proposed>

*        Example 3. Abbreviated names for days of the week.  

The meeting time for a university course is shown in the schedule as
"TTh 11." The letters "TTh" are tagged as an abbreviation.  A student
using a screen reader hears "Tuesday and Thursday 11 AM."

</proposed>

 


Examples for Guideline 3.1, Level 2


<proposed>

*        Example 1. A page title includes a phrase that appears in link
text in the navigation bar.

The phrase "Compliance checking" appears as a link in a navigation bar.
The same phrase is included in the <title> element of the linked page,
so users can be certain that the link has worked correctly.

Example 2: A screen reader correctly pronounces a phrase in a language
the screen reader does not support.

An English-language document includes short passages in Arabic, Hebrew,
and Chinese. The phrases are marked up so that screen readers which do
not contain pronunciation rules for these languages correctly identify
the languages and pronounce the phrases. (The lang attribute would
identify the natural language of each phrase; the SSML <phoneme> and/or
<lexicon> elements could be used to tell the screen reader how to
pronounce them.)

*        Example 3. Defining an unusual technical term.

A user encounters an unfamiliar technical term and requests a
definition. The user agent locates the term in a technical dictionary
that has been identified in metadata and presents the definition to the
user.

Example 4: Idiomatic expressions in an audio clip.

An oral history archive includes recorded interviews with people who use
phrases spoken only in a particular region. The text transcript is
linked to a dictionary of regional idioms.

</proposed>


Examples for Guideline 3.1, Level 3


<proposed>

* Example 1: a description of a process.

 

A page describes how to learn to make a corner kick in soccer. Each step
in learning the fundamentals of the corner kick is illustrated with a
photograph of a player doing what is described in the text.

 

*        Example 2: A committee report with an executive summary

 

A government task force publishes its final report on the Web. The
report is very long and includes many tables, charts, and illustrations
as well as detailed recommendations. The home page for the task force
contains a 100-word summary of the report written in plain language.
Following the summary is a link to a Table of Contents where readers can
choose individual sections of the report.  There is also a link to the
full report.

 

* Example 3: a description of a complex natural event

 

A Web page discusses Mt. Pinatubo in the Phillipines. The page includes
a description of the 1991 eruption as well as photos of the eruption and
its aftermath. The page also includes a brief explanation of why
volcanoes erupt.  To clarify this explanation, , the page links to site
that contains video and another site that contains a 3D simulation of
what happened underneath the crust and within the volcano during the
eruption.

 

[js note: I propose deleting the examples about the kid's school report
and the stock market graph.  The one about the school report isn't
substantively different in kind from Example 2-it just shows that doing
this kind of work can be child's play<grin>. The stock market data
example is almost identical to the bar graph example we use in 1.1 but
not nearly as fully developed.]

 

* Example 4: history of music.

 

A musicologist creates a Web site that includes examples of many
different types of music and musical instruments.  Descriptions of the
instruments are accompanied by photographs, drawings, or details from
paintings in which the instruments appear. When describing specific
types of music, the musicologist links to short audio clips that show
the music's characteristic sound.

 

 

*        Example 5: An explanation of a molecular process

 

A Web page for a university Chemistry course explains a molecular
process. The explanation uses symbols familiar to chemists. The
explanation is accompanied by an animation that shows a model of how the
process works. The page also includes a written narrative that describes
the process shown in the animation.  There is also a link to a
compressed audio file containing a recording of the narrative read by a
speech synthesizer.

<current>
As they appear in the 11 March 2004 Working draft [1]
Examples of Guideline 3.1 (Informative)
List of 7 items
* Example 1: an acronym in a page title.
 
In the following heading, "People of the W3C." the acronym "W3C" is
marked as an acronym. Because it has been marked appropriately, the user
agent would
be able to speak the letters of the acronym one at a time rather than
attempting to pronounce it as though it were a word.
* Example 2: a French phrase in an English sentence.
 
In the following sentence, "And with a certain je ne sais quoi, she
entered both the room, and his life, forever." the French phrase "je ne
sais quoi" is
marked as French. Depending on the markup language, English may either
be marked as the language for the entire document except where
specified, or marked
at the paragraph level.
* Example 3: a description of a process.
 
A page describes how to learn to play soccer. Each step in learning the
fundamentals of the game is illustrated with a photograph of a player
doing what
is described in the text.
* Example 4: a concrete concept.
 
The primary concept on a page is concrete. It is discussing Mt.
Pinatubo. It includes both a description of the 1991 eruption as well as
photos of the eruption
and the aftermath. It links to another site that contains video and
another site that contains a 3D simulation of what happened underneath
the crust and
within the volcano during the eruption.
* Example 5: child's report of school trip.
 
A child went with her school on a trip to a bicycle manufacturing plant.
She wrote a report for her family and friends to post to the Web. In the
report,
she includes the company logo as well as a picture of a bicycle on the
assembly line. She links to the company Web site for more information.
She includes
photos she took of the plant.
* Example 6: stock trading data.
 
A news site is comparing the performance of the economy from 3rd quarter
of this year with 3rd quarter from the last 3 years. They compare prices
of the
most popular stocks. They present the data in a bar graph with a link to
the raw data they used to create the bar graph.
* Example 7: history of music.
 
A grandfather's hobby is listening to and playing music. He creates a
Web site that includes examples of many different types of music and
musical instruments.
When describing specific types of music, he links to a short sound clip.
