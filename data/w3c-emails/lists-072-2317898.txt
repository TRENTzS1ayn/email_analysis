Hello everyone,
 
During the last telecon, I took an action item to evaluate the use of the
word 'page' throughout our current working draft. I have limited this
discussion to occurrences of the word 'page' in guideline text and success
criteria. I have reviewed the occurrence of the word 'page' in the examples,
notes and definitions and have not found any problems since a web page is a
good example in most cases and doesn't need to be generalized for other
techniques. For several of the examples, we could do with some examples from
other technologies than HTML but that's a general problem that's not related
to the use of the word 'page'. 
 
I have been able to come up with formulations that don't use the word 'page'
for every instance of the word 'page' in guideline text or success criteria.
Some of them may have lost something in clarity though.

Guideline 2.4 level 2, SC 2


Current wording

In documents greater than 50,000 words or sites larger than 50 perceived
pages, at least one of the following is provided:
A. hierarchical structure,
B. table of contents (for pages) or site map (for sites),
C. alternate display order (for pages) or alternate site navigation
mechanisms (for sites)

Discussion

This whole success criteria presupposes a traditional website. I think we
should abstract from the distinction between pages and websites and
reformulate this SC in more general terms that are applicable to both. This
would make the SC applicable to other types of web content like voice XML or
SVG. The techniques documents would work out the specifics of how to apply
this SC to each technology. I think the whole succes criterion needs
reformulating with the broader context in mind, it's not just a matter of
substituting the word 'page'.

Proposed wording

In #large resources#, at least one of the following is provided:
A. hierarchical structure
B. table of contents, for example a site map
C. alternate site navigation mechanisms that allow the user to determine the
order in which to navigate the resource.
 
Definition:
large resource:
Web resources can either be perceived as a single document or as a document
collection. A resource is considered large when it contains more than 50,000
words for a single document or over 50 documents for a document collection. 
 
site navigation mechanism:
A site navigation mechanism is a mechanism for easily orienting and moving
about within the site. Site navigation mechanisms include but are not
limited to:

*A home page with hyperlinks on it and subsequent pages that link to
the other pages at the site 

*site map(s) 

*search engine(s) 

*expanding outline(s) 

*alternate display order(s) of the content 

*dynamic fisheye views showing all linked pages or topics related to
any page. 

*3-D virtual representations of site content


Guideline 2.4, level 2, SC 3


Current wording

Large blocks of material that are repeated on multiple pages, such as
navigation menus with more than 8 or more links, can be bypassed by people
who use screen readers or who navigate via keyboard or keyboard interface.

Discussion

The word 'page' can be easily avoided here by substituting it for 'place
within the resource'. As a side effect, this guideline now becomes
applicable to repeated links on the same page as well which I think is good.
Aditionally, I have edited the 'more than 8 or more' error.

Proposed wording

Large blocks of material that are repeated in multiple places within the
resource, such as navigation menus with 8 or more links, can be bypassed by
people who use screen readers or who navigate via keyboard or keyboard
interface.

Guideline 2.4, level 3, SC 4c


Current wording

Supplying an informative title for each page or resource that can be
accessed independently (for example, from a search results page)

Discussion

Since a page is a resource that can be accessed independently, we can just
delete 'page' here. 'page' can remain in the for example part because it's
just an example and not the guideline itself. BTW, I prefer if we use a more
direct formulation, for example "Supply a title" instead of "supplying a
title" but that's for another editor.

Proposed wording

Supplying an informative title for each resource that can be accessed
independently (for example, from a search results page)

Guideline 2.4, level 3, SC 4d


Current wording

Supplying a unique title for each page or resource that can be accessed
independently (for example, from a search results page)

Discussion

Same as above, SC 4c.

Proposed wording

Supplying a unique title for each resource that can be accessed
independently (for example, from a search results page)

Guideline 3.1, level 1, SC 1


Current wording

Page titles are informative.

Discussion

What's the difference with Guideline 2.4, level 3, SC 4c mentioned above? Or
do we mean, "if you use a page title, make sure it is informative". Unless I
understand what is meant, I doubt I will come up with a good new wording.

Proposed wording

Titles of resources are informative. 

Guideline 3.1, level 3, SC 4, strategy alternative representations bullet 2


Current wording

Adding non-text content to the site for key pages or sections specifically
to make the site more understandable by users who cannot understand the text
only version of the site. 


Discussion

If we reformulate using 'parts of the resource' we don't need the
distinction between pages and sections anymore. I dislike the word 'key' in
the sense of 'important' because of the association with the typing
thingies. I had to read the sentence twice because at first I didn't know
where 'specifically' was associated with. My proposed wording suggests a
solution for these problems as well.

Proposed wording

Adding non-text content to the site for important parts of the resource to
make the site more understandable by users who cannot understand the text
only version of the site.  

Guideline 3.1, level 3, SC 4, strategy alternative representations bullet 3


Current wording

Using page design, graphics, color, fonts, animations, video, or audio to
clarify complex text.


Discussion

"page design" includes graphics, color, fonts, etc. The term sounds broader
than we mean. I suggest using 'layout' instead. 

Proposed wording

Using layout, graphics, color, fonts, animations, video, or audio to clarify
complex text.
 

Guideline 3.1, level 3, SC 4, strategy alternative representations bullet 4


Current wording

Including non-text content to supplement text for key pages or sections of
the site.

Discussion

See above, bullet 2.

Proposed wording

Including non-text content to supplement text for important parts of the
resource.

Guideline 3.2, guideline text


Current wording

Organize content consistently from "page to page" and make interactive
components behave in predictable ways.

Discussion

I have explained my preference for the wording for 3.2 in the thread
'Suggestion for this editorial note' in my e-mail from May 2, 2004. [1]

Proposed wording

Organize content consistently throughout the resource and make interactive
components behave in predictable ways.

Guideline 3.2, level 2, SC 1


Current wording

Components that are repeated on multiple "pages" within a resource or a
section of a resource occur in the same sequence each time they are
repeated, for at least one presentation format. 

Proposed wording

Components that are repeated in different places within the resource occur
in the same sequence each time they are repeated, for at least one
presentation format.


Guideline 3.2, level 2, SC 3


Current wording

Changing the setting of any input field should not automatically cause an
#extreme change in context# such as leaving the "page." 

Proposed wording

Changing the setting of any input field should not automatically cause an
#extreme change in context# such as changing the current location within the
resource. 



Guideline 3.2, level 2, SC 4


Current wording

Interactive elements that appear on multiple "pages," including graphical
elements, are associated with the same functionality wherever they appear.

Proposed wording

Interactive elements that appear in different places within the resource,
including graphical elements, are associated with the same functionality
wherever they appear.

Guideline 3.2, level 3, SC 2


Current wording

Graphical components that appear on multiple pages, including graphical
links, are associated with the same text equivalents wherever they appear.

Proposed wording

Graphical components that appear in different places within the resource,
including graphical links, are associated with the same text equivalents
wherever they appear.

Guideline 3.2, level 3, SC 3


Current wording

Components that appear visually on multiple pages, such as navigation bars,
search forms, and sections within the main content, are displayed in the
same location relative to other content on every page or screen where they
appear. 

Proposed wording

Components that appear visually in different places within the resource,
such as navigation bars, search forms, and sections within the main content,
are displayed in the same location relative to other content each time they
appear. 

Guideline 3.2, level 3, SC 4


Current wording

When components such as navigation menus and search forms appear on multiple
pages, users can choose to have those elements presented in a different
visual position or reading-order. 

Proposed wording

When components such as navigation menus and search forms appear in
different places within the resource, users can choose to have those
elements presented in a different visual position or reading-order.
