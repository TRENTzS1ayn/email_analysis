Subject: Bug 774 - Alternatives for word 'page'


In documents greater than 50,000 words or sites larger than 50 perceived
pages, at least one of the following is provided:
A. hierarchical structure,
B. table of contents (for pages) or site map (for sites),
C. alternate display order (for pages) or alternate site navigation
mechanisms (for sites)

Roberto Scano:
Hum... 50,000 words is a big document... Think that in the "normal
paper", a page is done by 60 charset per line per 30 lines (a "folder"),
so it is 1800 charset... 50,000 words is like a full article... what
about people with cognitive disabilities? I think that a document larger
than 1800-2000 charset must be formatted at least for the point A.
