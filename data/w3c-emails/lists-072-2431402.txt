This could be at level 2, but not at level 1 because it would constrain
the user interface, contrary to the definition of level 1.

Level 1 could say something like: It must be possible for all input data
to be cleared by the user agent, prior to the activation of an application
function that processes the data. This isn't good wording.

How to do better than arbitrary numbers while making the requirement
precise? There will almost certainly be exceptions to whatever we specify
here. > <snip>

What does "accessible manner" mean? Which other guidelines/success
criteria apply here? Can we state it in terms of satisfying other
guidelines/success criteria? >
