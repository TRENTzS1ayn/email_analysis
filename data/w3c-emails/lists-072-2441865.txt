The example below is for Guideline 3.1, Level 3 SC 3

<proposed>

Example 6: Links to a video clip of a press conference.

A Web page includes links to two versions of a video clip from the
governor's press conference. The link text reads, "Video of Governor's
press conference (for high-speed connections)" and "Video of Governor's
press conference (for dial-up connections)."

          system-bitrate="40000">
   <video dur="0:00:45.67" region="videoregion"
         src="medium_spacetime.avi"
