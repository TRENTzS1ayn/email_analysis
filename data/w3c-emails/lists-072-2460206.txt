Doyle:
We could set a percentage factor but where those numbers would lie, I have
no idea.  Do you have any ideas on numbers?

Roberto C:
That's my real concern; setting a percentage factor, or another kind of
number, would lead us to generalize too much this important issue. 
The whole Web has so many kind of web sites, and so many kind of users, each
of them surfs the web in many different ways in different situations: how
can we try and catalogue this world in numbers? 
The only situation I can manage is about those cases where the user with
disabilities cannot complete a task, while a "normal" user can.
For all other situations, I've no idea too, any other suggestion?

My best regards,

Roberto Castaldo
