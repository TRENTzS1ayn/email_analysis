Hi all

 

I won't be on the call today. On the agenda are my submissions for bug 506
and 704. I'm not attached to the wording for the Definition of Structure Bug
704 nor the wording of the inline elements benefits (#506) that was
assigned. They are simply starting points to help eradicate the bugs from
Bugzilla. Feel free to twist and tweak the paragraphs as needed during the
call.

 

Cheers

David MacDonald
