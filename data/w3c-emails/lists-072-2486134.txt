Very cool! That's two things you've taught me in the same day<grin>!

However, I think the example is appropriate to current practice-- there
are many sites that provide separate links to high- and low-bandwidth
versions of multimedia objects, and the link text often fails to
identify the target clearly.

For example, at http://utopia.utexas.edu, JAWS reports the following:


Graphic Nerve Cell Image

Using lasers to guide
nerve cell growth keeps
The Raizen Group on the
cutting edge of science.

Table with 3 columns and 2 rows
Graphic Quick Time
Link graphic play low bandwidth version of this video
Link graphic play high bandwidth version of this video
Graphic Real Media
Link graphic play low bandwidth version of this video
Link graphic play high bandwidth version of this video
Table end

This is on the home page of a major University Web site, specifically
intended to make University resources available to all citizens of the
state of Texas.

The example below is for Guideline 3.1, Level 3 SC 3

<proposed>

Example 6: Links to a video clip of a press conference.

A Web page includes links to two versions of a video clip from the
governor's press conference. The link text reads, "Video of Governor's
press conference (for high-speed connections)" and "Video of Governor's
press conference (for dial-up connections)."

Hi, With SMIL, is possible to set this...

<switch>
   <video dur="0:00:45.67" region="videoregion"
          src="high_spacetime.avi (high rate)"
          alt="Video: Big Bang"
          system-bitrate="40000">
   <video dur="0:00:45.67" region="videoregion"
         src="medium_spacetime.avi"
         alt="Video: Big Bang (medium rate)"
         system-bitrate="24000">
   <video dur="0:00:45.67" region="videoregion"
          src="low_spacetime.avi"
          alt="Video: Big Bang (low rate)"
