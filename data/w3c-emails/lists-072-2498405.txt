To use the guidelines you must interpret their meaning. In the absence of
checklists, everyone is free to interpret them differently. This is the
current situation where many people claim conformance but no one is sure
which interpretation is correct.

Normative checklists are the WAI's description of the what the guidelines
mean for each technology. They will ensure that people can effectively
implement the guidelines.

The WCAG1's lack of clear specification has been a hindrance of its
implementation. This has been detailed in several recent papers and has led
to the development of other accessibility standards, like 508, that aim for
clearer definition.

My feeling is that the checklists should be updated periodically to keep up
with current trends on the web. The guidelines can be stable while the
checklists change.

The WAI will accept/reject what goes into the checklists so they should
never be out of line with the guidelines.

The WAI can still make up checklists in consultation with the technology
vendors. If the WAI doesn't do this who will?

Yes. The checklists would be clear and simple, easy to understand and
implement. The guidelines are more difficult to understand and apply because
they must be interpreted.
