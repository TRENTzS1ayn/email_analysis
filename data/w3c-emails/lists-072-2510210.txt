It seems to me that writing good checklists goes hand in hand with
meeting our requirement that all success criteria be testable.

It's true that the checklists could fall behind as technologies continue
to evolve.  But this could be addressed (not "solved") by chartering the
WG to review and update the checklists according to a specific
timetable.  Such a review wouldn't *require* that the checklists change;
the review might result in a finding that no changes were necessary at
that time.

I suspect that the checklists would be *more* likely to fall out of date
if they were not normative-- there would be less pressure to stay on top
of them if they were "merely" informative.

To use the guidelines you must interpret their meaning. In the absence
of checklists, everyone is free to interpret them differently. This is
the current situation where many people claim conformance but no one is
sure which interpretation is correct.

Normative checklists are the WAI's description of the what the
guidelines mean for each technology. They will ensure that people can
effectively implement the guidelines.

The WCAG1's lack of clear specification has been a hindrance of its
implementation. This has been detailed in several recent papers and has
led to the development of other accessibility standards, like 508, that
aim for clearer definition.

My feeling is that the checklists should be updated periodically to keep
up with current trends on the web. The guidelines can be stable while
the checklists change.

The WAI will accept/reject what goes into the checklists so they should
never be out of line with the guidelines.

The WAI can still make up checklists in consultation with the technology
vendors. If the WAI doesn't do this who will?

Yes. The checklists would be clear and simple, easy to understand and
implement. The guidelines are more difficult to understand and apply
because they must be interpreted.
