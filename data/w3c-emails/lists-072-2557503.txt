Consensus was achieved on today's call to change the text that is in the
guidelines to the following.  This is not necessarily the final text but is
basically reflects the working groups thinking at this time.


----
Guidelines are divided into three categories of success criteria:

LEVEL 1 SUCCESS CRITERIA
 
    1. Achieve a minimum level of accessibility through markup, scripting, 
        or other technologies that interact with user agents, including
assistive
        technologies;

    2.  Could be reasonably be applied to all Web resources;


LEVEL 2 SUCCESS CRITERIA

   1. Increases accessibility either through either or both of the following
         a) additional facilitation of user agent based accessibility 
         b) content and/or presentation that provides direct accessibility
without
             requiring the user or their user agent to do anything different
from 
             users without disabilities  
  
   2. Could be reasonably be applied to all Web resources;

 
LEVEL 3 SUCCESS CRITERIA

      1. Go beyond Level 1 and 2 to increase direct and user agent enhanced
          accessibility


The Working Group believes that all success criteria should be testable.
Tests can be done by computer programs or by people who understand these
guidelines. Tests done by people who understand the guidelines should get
the same results testing the same content for the same success criteria. 


=====================

 We also agreed to meet in Face to Face either the week of July 12th or July
19th.   Venue to be determined.  Currently planned for West Coast of US.

Next meeting ( Fall )  being scheduled in Europe.


============

Progress made on 1.3 but did not finish.

Did point out the CSS 3 allows content to be included in style sheets --
which gives a new interpretation to "separate content from presentation".
