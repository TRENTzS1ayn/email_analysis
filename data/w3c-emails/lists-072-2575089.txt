I agree, but a more representative list of examples would be useful:
the hierarchy of options in a user interface, the spatial organization
and structure of a vector graphic (this wording is intended to address
the complaint that such an example might imply that raster-based
images can't be used), etc.

yes.

I agree with this analysis. The HTML portions of the list archive do
meet structural requirements, but the aggregated content does not,
leaving aside HTML e-mail attachments and similar exceptions.

In fact, the issue extends far beyond guideline 1.3, which is why I do
not think 1.3 should be changed in response to such examples. I can
for instance attach image files, without any text equivalents, to my
e-mail message and post it to a mailing list, whereupon the images
will be archived and guideline 1.1 violated.
