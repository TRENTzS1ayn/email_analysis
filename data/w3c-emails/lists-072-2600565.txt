Coud you clarify this a bit? CSS 2 allows for the inclusion of content (still
in CSS 2.1) and also allowed for audio content to be included in an audio
presentation.

I don't think it gives a new interpretation, but it does mean that defining
things in terms of whether they are in CSS or HTML isn't enough - we have to
talk about why something belongs in one or the other.
