What I meant was that we used to talk about separating presentation from
content -- and used CSS as the poster child.    Remove the style sheet and
the page would become linear etc.  but XML changed all that.  Now we are
also putting content in the style sheet.  So the style sheet becomes part of
the 'core content' and not a style sheet (as its name implies).

Coud you clarify this a bit? CSS 2 allows for the inclusion of content
(still
in CSS 2.1) and also allowed for audio content to be included in an audio
presentation.

I don't think it gives a new interpretation, but it does mean that defining
things in terms of whether they are in CSS or HTML isn't enough - we have to
talk about why something belongs in one or the other.
