<Definition of Level 2  agreed upon yesterday>
LEVEL 2 SUCCESS CRITERIA

   1. Increases accessibility either through either or both of the following
         a) additional facilitation of user agent based accessibility
         b) content and/or presentation that provides direct accessibility without              requiring the user or their user agent to do  anything different from              users without disabilities
</Definition of Level 2  agreed upon yesterday>
Now read:
<Level 2 SC 1 for Guideline 1.3>
Information presented using color is also available without color and without having to interpret markup (for example through context or text coding).
</Level 2 SC 1 for Guideline 1.3>
My question:
The   Level 2 SC 1 for Guideline 1.3 explicitly excludes mark-up as a method of achieving accessibility. So this violates the definition of level 2 as it permits (a) or (b) or both. Right?
