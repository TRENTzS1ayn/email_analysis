No

We are saying that L2 items would do one or the other or both. 

 

So an SC that only does one (either one) would fit. - as would one that does
both

<Definition of Level 2  agreed upon yesterday>

LEVEL 2 SUCCESS CRITERIA

 

   1. Increases accessibility either through either or both of the following
         a) additional facilitation of user agent based accessibility
         b) content and/or presentation that provides direct accessibility
without              requiring the user or their user agent to do  anything
different from              users without disabilities

</Definition of Level 2  agreed upon yesterday>

Now read:

<Level 2 SC 1 for Guideline 1.3>

Information presented using color is also available without color and
without having to interpret markup (for example through context or text
coding).

</Level 2 SC 1 for Guideline 1.3>

My question:

The   Level 2 SC 1 for Guideline 1.3 explicitly excludes mark-up as a method
of achieving accessibility. So this violates the definition of level 2 as it
permits (a) or (b) or both. Right?
