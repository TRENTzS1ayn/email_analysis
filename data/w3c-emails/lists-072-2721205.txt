Sailesh, I think you're right if we interpret the definition of Level 2
agreed upon at yeasterday's call as saying that all Level 2 success
criteria must support *both* (a) or (b).  But I think a case could be
made that this particular criterion (1.3 Level 2 SC 1) meets the
definition of Level 2 because it satisfies (b).
 
In other words, it depends on the force of that either/or.  I take it as
meaning that it's OK to do one *or* the other; it's also OK to do both,
but not necessary.

Subject: Testing definition of levels


<Definition of Level 2  agreed upon yesterday>
LEVEL 2 SUCCESS CRITERIA
 
   1. Increases accessibility either through either or both of the
following
         a) additional facilitation of user agent based accessibility
         b) content and/or presentation that provides direct
accessibility without              requiring the user or their user
agent to do  anything different from              users without
disabilities
</Definition of Level 2  agreed upon yesterday>
Now read:
<Level 2 SC 1 for Guideline 1.3>
Information presented using color is also available without color and
without having to interpret markup (for example through context or text
coding).
</Level 2 SC 1 for Guideline 1.3>
My question:
The   Level 2 SC 1 for Guideline 1.3 explicitly excludes mark-up as a
method of achieving accessibility. So this violates the definition of
level 2 as it permits (a) or (b) or both. Right?
