OK-- how does this sound as a practical suggestion for What to Do Today?

- Provide the full meaning of each acronym or abbreviation, in context
or in markup, the first time the acronym or abbreviation appears in any
form that users experience as a "page."

Sounds like a draw anyway, doesn't it? What should we do and recommend
now, is there the need to update the corresponding GL items? -- I really
challenge this issue since I just had this discussion occupationally
(again), and there are of course benefits as well as problems linked
with it, as also pointed out by both of you.
