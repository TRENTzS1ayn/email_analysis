Hello,

Notes are available at: 
<http://www.w3.org/2004/05/14-wai-wcag-irc.html#T18-09-34>
There are many references to Mark Pilgrim's blog entry, "Gmail accessibility"
at: <http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/04/10/gmail-accessibility>

Thanks to those who attended.  More discussion to occur in the future. 
Future steps include a discussion between the Authoring Tool Accessibility 
Guidelines Working Group (AUWG), User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 
Working Group (UAWG), Protocols and Formats Working Group (PFWG), and WCAG 
WG as well as ongoing discussion in each of these groups and coordination 
(via PFWG) with other W3C working groups.

Best,
--wendy
