I think that is good.   And I think you expand an abbreviation when you
spell it all out.  So I think that works too.

I do wonder what the difference between users with and without
disabilities
is on this one.   Is there?  We should spell it out in the examples.  Or
else this is just a general usability issue.


Roberto Scano:
Why not expand the first time and put also definition/expansion inside a
glossary ?
