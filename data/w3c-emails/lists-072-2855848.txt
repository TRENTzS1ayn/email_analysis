I like Jim's suggestion but was trying to avoid the word "expansion" (or
the verb "expand") since I'm not sure that everyone who uses the
guidelines would know what it means to "expand an acronym" (or
abbreviation).  How about "give the meaning" (instead of "give the full
meaning"?.

Modifying John's suggestion slightly, how about

- Provide the expansion of each acronym or abbreviation, in context or
in markup, the first time the acronym or abbreviation appears in any
form that users experience as a "page."

Substituting "expansion" for "full meaning;" the latter being way too
much. But "expansion" not usually applied to an abbreviation, is it?

OK-- how does this sound as a practical suggestion for What to Do Today?

- Provide the full meaning of each acronym or abbreviation, in context
or in markup, the first time the acronym or abbreviation appears in any
form that users experience as a "page."

Sounds like a draw anyway, doesn't it? What should we do and recommend
now, is there the need to update the corresponding GL items? -- I really
challenge this issue since I just had this discussion occupationally
(again), and there are of course benefits as well as problems linked
with it, as also pointed out by both of you.
