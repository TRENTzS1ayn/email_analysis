In general I like this definition. It should however be clarified that
here the word "element" is not being used in its precise technical
sense and there is no implication that a Web resource conforming to
these guidelines must be in XML.

You could also substitute terms such as "Web content" or "the content"
for "a Web resource" if desired. My larger point is that we need to
agree on exactly which technical terms we plan to use throughout the
guidelines, supply appropriate definitions, then use the terms
consistently.
