I agree. More general I think we should clarify somewhere that
examples given in a definition or in the guidelines are meant to be
informative, not normative, and we could say by way of illustration
that the example of vector-based graphics under guideline 1.3 should
not be interpreted as precluding the use of raster-based images in
appropriate circumstances.

I would also raise the question of whether we need a section entitled
"how to interpret these guidelines".
