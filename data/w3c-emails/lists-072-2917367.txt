Using something in the informative section as an example is one thing.  But
if we put an example in a definition, -- and the definition is of a term
that is in level 1, - then by definition, that is an example of what is
required in level 1.

So we should not put examples in definitions that are not level 1 examples
unless the term only appears in lower level items.

I agree. More general I think we should clarify somewhere that
examples given in a definition or in the guidelines are meant to be
informative, not normative, and we could say by way of illustration
that the example of vector-based graphics under guideline 1.3 should
not be interpreted as precluding the use of raster-based images in
appropriate circumstances.

I would also raise the question of whether we need a section entitled
"how to interpret these guidelines".
