What is important hear is that the AT's (assistive technologies) know
how to handle them

refer to XAG (XML accessibility guidelines) 
Having title one , title to is problematic because how do the  At's know
what that is?

The same is true for classes or formats.

The aim, as always is to hold on, and transfer to the user and AT the
meaning and concepts contained in the page. 
Structure is one of them

And yes, RDF is a good way to go .

All the best
