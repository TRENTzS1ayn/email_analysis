One problem for dyslexic and people with impaired short term memory will
be remembering what acronym stands for what.

Note that expanding the acronym at the first usage, is less useful then,
expanding it in every case.

Also not that in long documents, the expansion will be hard to find, and
in documents with lots of similar acronyms, looking for the expansion
will not be doable by people with impaired visual memory

For example, a document using acronyms like ATM and UTM  , (were you may
also have to scroll to find the expansion) would not be understandable
to me - unless I coped and pasted all the expansions into a notepad, and
compared letter for letter....


All the best
Lisa
