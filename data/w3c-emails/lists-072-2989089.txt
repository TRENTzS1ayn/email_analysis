Subject: RE: [SEC508] Multimedia material

 

The Key question as to whether captioning or audio description kicks-in is
the answer to the following: "Is the visual or audio information essential
for comprehension"?   There is no need to audio describe a person's head
that is perfectly still throughout a business meeting since that is not
information essential for comprehension.

 

However, words spoken on that video should be captioned, regardless of
whether they seem relevant or interesting.  An exception might be background
chatter (such as background music lyrics) which is not the focus of the
dialogue or speech in the multimedia video.  Common sense applies here.  The
issue in plain English, is whether someone with a disability is going to
miss out on some important information.

Section 508 is clear that multimedia material must have synchronized
captions and descriptive audio.  However, what if the video track is just of
a man's head talking.   What if the video track is irrelevant to what is
being said?
