Hello List,
My action item was to  attempt  a short descriptor for the guidelines and success criteria. The first pass is at 
www.deque.com/test/short-desc-for-WCAG2.htm
I have tried to be consistent and  limit a descriptor to  as few words as possible. They are generally not over five words although a few are 6-7 words.
I realize that the text of guidelines and criteria are being worked on and not yet frozen.   

Thanks,
Sailesh Panchang
