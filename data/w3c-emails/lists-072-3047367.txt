Agreed. The issue I was trying to get at was the case where conditional content
is rendered in place of the original. I believe that this approach presents a
significant barrier to the ability for an author to use conditional content at
all.

In the case of the title attribute, making it possible for a screenreader to
turn off or customize the way in which notifications about the existence of
conditional content are rendered isn't really any different than a sighted user
who chooses not to (or, for that matter, doesn't realize it is possible to)
hover their mouse pointer over the link, image, acronym, etc. elements. 

Perhaps it would have been better to say that we need to be thinking about a
solution where user agents provide an option to make the user aware that
conditional content is present. Does that help?

I totally agree that this kind of information overload can be problematic. I
know some audio browsers and screenreaders make these announcements less
obtrusive through the use of voice changes and or the insertion of customized
sounds. Perhaps another approach would be for the user agent to announce that
conditional content elements or attributes are used at the page level, letting
users know that they exist without repeating it over and over again.
