Some  material for thought from 
http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9612.html

Part of the genius of Tim Berners-Lee's original design of the Web was a total unification of several concepts in a single idea, the page:
List of 4 items
. the user's view of the information on the screen
. the unit of navigation (what you get when you click a link or activate a navigation action like a bookmark)
. a textual address used to retrieve information over the net (the URL)
. the storage of the information on the server and the author's editing unit (except if using embedded objects like image files which do require the author
to manage multiple files for a page)
list end
The fundamental design of the Web is based on having the page as the atomic unit of information, and the notion of the page permeates all aspects of the
Web. The simplicity of the original Web contributed to its ease of use and its rapid uptake.
