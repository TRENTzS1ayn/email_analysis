Tom says:

In the success criteria, yes.

Tom says:

There are a few issues here. As much as people need to be able to  
understand the relevence of the guidelines and success criteria to the  
technology at a glance it is more important for the success criteria to be  
normative and hence the guideline be normatively implmentable. To achieve  
this both some appropriate level of brevity and and accuracy. For the  
purposes of fulfilling the guidelines there is no need of the disctintion  
between heirarchical and non-heirarchical structures since both are  
required, ie all relationships. This means that this success criteria  
needs to be supported by John and David's work on definitions. The fact  
that specific HTML elements are also semantic attributes makes adding  
examples confusing to other technologies and potentialy lends people to  
conclude that some of the same issues from WCAG 1.0 have reoccured.

Sounds great.

Tom says:

Right, I guess this applies more generally. If people use plain text with  
spacing to denote paragraphs and "-" to denote list items they will fail  
this checkpoint. I personally have no problem with this at all. I consider  
much of the authoring issues in ATAG's domain, or at the least scopable.

Tom says:

The problem is the overlap between html elements and semantic elements,  
which isn't as immediately apparent (or not available) in other  
technologies. So when we talk about the semantic elements of paragraphs,  
lists and headers it is easy to think of HTML. However these elements (as  
in a unit of information not a <tag>) are independant of technology and  
appropriate to them all. This needs to be made really clear. I do think  
that your definition is definately going in the right direction.

Tom says:

I think we should steer clear of this altogether. In a complex and  
spanning topic such as this a few loose examples in the guideline are more  
likely to cause widespread misinterpretation than a clear and informative  
definition somewhere else. This of course means that our definition has to  
be a normative part of the document and testible too.
