Yvette:

Question:  are the contractions you bring up here actually in the 
written version of Dutch, and used as acceptable contractions in written 
Dutch.  Or is this more a spoken issue, as with Charles' example of 
"most any" instead of "almost any."  I would posit that Charles' example 
is simply poor grammar, and if found on sites would be hard to 
regulate.  Do grammar checkers catch such a thing? 

was not
wasn't

are both grammatical contractions.  It just seems like we will need to 
differentiate between grammatical contractions and colloquialisms (which 
I would argue are not regulatable).
