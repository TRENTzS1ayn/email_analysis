Consensus was achieved on the following items

 

1.3

 

Level 1 

1."Structures and relationships within the content can be derived
programmatically.  

     Editor note:  the concepts of 'reliable' and 'standard' need to be
incorporated into the definition of 'programmaticall'

-        this would remain a Level 1 item

-        scoping would be used to remove its application from aspects where
it should not be (such as text only email archives).

 

2.Emphasis can be derived programmatically.
