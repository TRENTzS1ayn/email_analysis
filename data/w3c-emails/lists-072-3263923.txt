Thanks very much to David for wading through my use cases and creating the 
drawings!  I think his diagram in the posting from 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2004AprJun/0333.html 
captures  everything that these use cases require - I just needed to 
create a "real world" scenario to wrap my head around them better!   I 
also don't fully understand the checklists and how they will be organized. 
 I liked his example at http://www.eramp.com/david/benshtmlchecklist.htm. 
I also envision one page that is able to encapsulate the entire checklist 
for a specific technology but that may be too complicated. 

I agree that it is probably too complicated to add all the checklist links 
to the traffic cop but it would be a good idea to add a link to the 
checklist gateway from there.  I would like to see a link to the checklist 
gateway in the cell/row  for each guideline.  It seems like overkill since 
it will be the same link in each cell but a person may enter the traffic 
cop in the middle and not find a checklist gateway link at the top or 
bottom of the page.     Also, do you think it makes sense to add a link to 
the checklist from the success criteria page?  This will allow direct 
access to a checklist with just one hop from the traffic cop.   That may 
be too complicated to maintain, though, but I think it would be helpful. 

In the Jessica example you have:
1) The first link she sends is here:
http://www.eramp.com/david/traffic_cop_from_guidelines_checklists.htm 

This actually takes you to a checklist gateway for a particularly 
guideline.  I was envisioning a Checklist Gateway that is not guideline 
specific and allows you to select a technology.  I then assumed that Andy 
would pick the HTML or CSS set of checklists.  But, this gets back to how 
the checklists are organized - is it possible to have all of the checklist 
for one technology in the same document?  One other minor nit in the 
diagram is that I expected Andy to print an HTML checklist.  You have the 
printing from the techniques (which is also a good idea) branch.  I just 
wanted to include printing so we would think about it when we designed the 
checklist page. 

thanks,
-becky

[TECH] use cases diagrammed






 
My action item was to make drawings and comments on Becky?s use cases.  My 
drawings are simple box diagrams so that ?lay people? can easily 
understand them. They are based on UML principles but not strict UML (to 
avoid visual jargon that might not be understood by all and inaccessible). 
I?ve posted these use cases to www.eramp.com/david/becky_use_cases.htm. 
 
The models for the Traffic Cop and navigation through the documents is at 
www.eramp.com/david/default.htm 
 
Wendy has asked me to send these links to the list for review by anyone 
who wishes.
 
Cheers 
David MacDonald
