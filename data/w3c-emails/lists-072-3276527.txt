Hi Becky

 

I made the adjustment for Use Case persona Andy's printing from the
Checklist (not the Techniques). 

I've posted these use cases to
<http://www.eramp.com/david/becky_use_cases.htm>
www.eramp.com/david/becky_use_cases.htm     <http://
<http://www.eramp.com/david/becky_use_cases.htm>
www.eramp.com/david/becky_use_cases.htm>
  
The models for the Traffic Cop and navigation paths through the documents
are at www.eramp.com/david/    <http:// www.eramp.com/david/>

 

I also made a temporary Checklist gateway that will serve as a placeholder
until I understand all the checklists and how the will look and work
together. It is here. Use Case persona Jessica would have sent this URL
.http://www.eramp.com/david/checklist_window.htm 


Cheers

David MacDonald

Thanks very much to David for wading through my use cases and creating the
drawings!  I think his diagram in the posting from
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2004AprJun/0333.html>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2004AprJun/0333.html captures
everything that these use cases require - I just needed to create a "real
world" scenario to wrap my head around them better!   I also don't fully
understand the checklists and how they will be organized.  I liked his
example at  <http://www.eramp.com/david/benshtmlchecklist.htm>
http://www.eramp.com/david/benshtmlchecklist.htm.  I also envision one page
that is able to encapsulate the entire checklist for a specific technology
but that may be too complicated.     

I agree that it is probably too complicated to add all the checklist links
to the traffic cop but it would be a good idea to add a link to the
checklist gateway from there.  I would like to see a link to the checklist
gateway in the cell/row  for each guideline.  It seems like overkill since
it will be the same link in each cell but a person may enter the traffic cop
in the middle and not find a checklist gateway link at the top or bottom of
the page.     Also, do you think it makes sense to add a link to the
checklist from the success criteria page?  This will allow direct access to
a checklist with just one hop from the traffic cop.   That may be too
complicated to maintain, though, but I think it would be helpful.   

In the Jessica example you have: 
1) The first link she sends is here: 
 <http://www.eramp.com/david/traffic_cop_from_guidelines_checklists.htm>
http://www.eramp.com/david/traffic_cop_from_guidelines_checklists.htm 

This actually takes you to a checklist gateway for a particularly guideline.
I was envisioning a Checklist Gateway that is not guideline specific and
allows you to select a technology.  I then assumed that Andy would pick the
HTML or CSS set of checklists.  But, this gets back to how the checklists
are organized - is it possible to have all of the checklist for one
technology in the same document?  One other minor nit in the diagram is that
I expected Andy to print an HTML checklist.  You have the printing from the
techniques (which is also a good idea) branch.  I just wanted to include
printing so we would think about it when we designed the checklist page.   

thanks, 
-becky

[TECH] use cases diagrammed

 


 

 




  
My action item was to make drawings and comments on Becky's use cases.  My
drawings are simple box diagrams so that "lay people" can easily understand
them. They are based on UML principles but not strict UML (to avoid visual
jargon that might not be understood by all and inaccessible). I've posted
these use cases to  <http://www.eramp.com/david/becky_use_cases.htm>
www.eramp.com/david/becky_use_cases.htm. 
  
The models for the Traffic Cop and navigation through the documents is at
<http://www.eramp.com/david/default.htm> www.eramp.com/david/default.htm 
  
Wendy has asked me to send these links to the list for review by anyone who
wishes. 
  
Cheers
