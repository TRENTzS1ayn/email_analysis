Our current thinking is that the "traffic cop" is a new independent
document. The document currently called Gateway to Techniques is tentatively
renamed "Technology-Independent Techniques". Instead of being between the
Success Criteria and the technology-dependent techniques documents (as a
"Gateway" between guidelines and techniques), it would exist at the same
level as the other techniques documents, but heavily referenced from those
documents. The "traffic cop" is a central place to tie things together so we
don't have to deal with everything linking to everything, and it expands and
replaces that part of the role that we previously thought the Gateway to
Techniques to could fill. The discussion has been taking place with a
context coming out of the Wednesday calls and not yet clearly explained on
the list. I hope my explanation helps to clarify, not muddy, things for
those who haven't been on the Wednesday calls. Michael

The question wasn't 'why do we need the cop/locator'  but rather - how does
this change the role of the techniques gateway?
