If this weeks agenda looks familiar -- it is.  It is last weeks agenda
shifted by one item. 
As per comments at the end of last weeks call - we need to move more quickly
through the topics.  So please
- read the materials ahead
- post comments to the list
- come prepared with concise comments or issues 
- come prepared with wording that can address issues
- when suggesting changes - try to create wording that addresses all of the
known issues or comments.

Thanks much
Gregg
