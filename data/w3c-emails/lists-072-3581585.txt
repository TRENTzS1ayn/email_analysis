Would this be a good time to start organizing and sending over to Wendy et 
al. my rather extensive collection of mind-bendingly-complex tables?

Cf. 
<http://fawny.org/webstandards/bookmarks/bookmarks-040526.html#ex26_vIl6B3>, 
but I've got tons more, in links, PDFs, and (gasp) print.

As ever, I emphasize examining real-world usage rather than anything else.
