I'm glad to see even more real-world usability testing (in the form of 
interviews) on the topic of WAI documentation. Keep it up!

This is the sort of thing that a good plain-English (for example) rewrite 
and a really smashing information architect could easily make work.

For example:

Guideline 1.1

[text]

Who's it for?
How does it improve accessibility?
How do I do it?
Techniques for specific technologies
[list]
Techniques for any technology

(Just off the top of my head there.)

"Locator" is halfway to the right word here. "Traffic cop" is pretty 
awful, and reminds me of mid-'80s magazine articles trying to explain what 
DOS was.

If you do that, some WCAG 1.0 fundamentalist is gonna come after you 
complaining that you made two links (or four, or 20) with the same link 
text, not that it matters to anyone but the fundies.

Also, I count three top-posted messages in the one I'm replying to now.  
Please cut it out.
