> 2.      Emphasis can be derived programmatically.

Emphasis:

a. is barely worth talking about
b. is prominent only because HTML gives us the b, cite, em, i, and strong 
elements
c. will be provided when using valid, semantic code, as with those 
elements above
d. can, in any event, be inferred by any intelligent user agent even from 
plain text (or *plain text*, or _plain text_, or PLAIN TEXT, or /plain 
text/)
