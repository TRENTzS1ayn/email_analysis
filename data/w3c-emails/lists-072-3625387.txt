Other suggestions and my own thoughts on them:

Usher - might be too unknown a word
Agent - Too technical? 
Director - Sounds too much in charge
Guide - Sounds like a pile of paper instead of an avatar-like function
Tourguide - Sounds cool enough to make it work. Doesn't have the association
with discipline and the law that 'traffic cop' has. 

How do you call someone who works in the information kiosk in a theme park
that you go to to ask for directions or for information about available
attractions? That's the sort of word I'm thinking about.
