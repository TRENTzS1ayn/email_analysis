CSS2.1 and CSS3 allow the stylesheet to include its own content.

<http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/selector.html#before-and-after>
<http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#gen-content>

Eventually, CSS3 will supplant all the current attempts to make image 
replacement work. And yes, we need to include such usages when discussing 
content-- though that doesn't mean we necessarily put CSS-generated 
content on a par with (X)HTML.

And interestingly, some JavaScript implementations (like Nice Titles
<http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/nicetitle/>) and even the simple
title attribute could be considered generated content.
