Well, if the only reason Level 3 exists is a puny "increase" in
accessibilty, that's so general as to be meaningless, which in fact Level
3 of WCAG 2.0 will surely be. I think everyone on this list can come up
with methods that "increase" accessibility that are nonetheless not on the
WCAG 1.0 list. Why pretend to have an exhaustive catalogue of such
"increases" in accessibility?

Level 3 is just not gonna work. Nobody meets Level 3 of WCAG 1.0 and 
there's no need for this orphan.
