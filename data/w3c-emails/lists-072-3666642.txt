And it isn't good coding, either! It's already possible and it's already a 
bad idea. Reset buttons are simple to add via HTML, but can have annoying 
or severe consequences if you hit one by accident (as I have actually 
done).

I can, however, see a use for a reset button for a dyslexic person or
similar. However, it really needs to be backed up by a very clear error
message saying "Are you really sure you want to destroy your
laboriously-crafted data?"
