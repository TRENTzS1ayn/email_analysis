Well, which features are "special"? Ones you have to order as an 
accessory?

Aren't all features simply features?

If IE for Windows (and indeed Mac) gives you no access to long 
descriptions but Mozilla does, is Mozilla offering you a "special" 
feature?

Tooltips aren't visible either-- until you mouse over them. Doesn't that 
qualify?

You could say that about viewing source, too.

Alt text is a replacement by spec.

> anything markup based,

Lots of markup results in something "visible in the default presentation 
of most browsers." <h1> is gonna be pretty big in every graphical browser 
from Mosaic to Shiira (which?).

> closed captions

Anything closed is opt-in by definition.

Some open captions are dependent on special features of user agents, as 
with forced subtitles under the DVD spec or simple open captions using 
QuickTime's built-in features.

Oh? Where's that requirement listed? UAAG?

It doesn't matter much of both techniques are supported by the spec 
(classic example: <img> vs. <object>).
