We *really* don't want to encourage people to use IP lookup to guess at a 
user's country of origin. (For more than a decade, every CompuServe user 
appeared to be living in Columbus, Ohio. How accurate is that?)

A notorious and maddening example is of course Showtime <http://SHO.com/>, 
which tells you "We at Showtime Online express our apologies; however, 
these pages are intended for access only from within the United States," 
whatever the hell that means. (Won't they be surprised to learn that my 
Lynx install runs out of the United States, letting me read it just fine?)

Country lookups break the universality of the Web.

The *correct* example to use here is HTTP content negotiation using the 
browser's default language. Yes, I know Jukka reminds us that most people 
set this up wrong, but that's not our problem.
