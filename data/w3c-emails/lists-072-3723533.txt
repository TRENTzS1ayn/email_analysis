I don't know any professional Web designer who would use anything that 
verbose, nor is that the sort of thing we find on actual sites. A more 
likely and preferable markup is:

Governor's press conference (Windows Media)
<ul>
<li><a>High-speed</a></li>
<li><a>Dial-up</a></li>
</ul>

(or just Hi and Lo)


And then of course that invites fundamentalists to bitch that somebody 
committed the cardinal sin of reusing link text on a page. And aren't we 
suddenly concerned about link length?
