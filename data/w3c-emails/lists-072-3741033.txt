What in the world is this all about? Suddenly we have to duplicate <title>
in an <a> somewhere? This is not the way to enable "users [to] be certain
that the link has worked correctly." I mean, check your URL or something,
why don'tcha?

We can use whatever title we want for a document and whatever text we want 
in a link. It's author's choice, and the author will do what he or she 
feels right. There are better and worse practices, but it is ridiculous 
to think that authors must be *forced* to use the <title> of whatever 
they're linking to. What if the destination of the link is a crappy page, 
possibly with *no* <title>?

We also have the title *attribute* for the <a> element which, along with
link text, can add much more richness and usable meaning than this
pie-in-the-sky hypothesis.
