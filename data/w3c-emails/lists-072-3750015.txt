Right, Joe, I don't know many professional Web designers who'd use such
verbose link text either; but I'm not sure that's a good thing.  I *do*
know professional Web developers who use the same link text for multiple
video clips on the same page-- asin the example I cited, where the page
includes two different videos and where the link text for each reads
simply "high" and "Low."  If one uses a links list-- in JAWS, Home Page
Reader, John Gunderson's Accessibility extensions, or some other agent--
one won't be able to tell where these links point, let alone that they
point to different places.  "Windows Media" is a meaningful phrase for
tech-savvy users; it may not be meaningful, though, to many people who
might want to see or hear what the governor had to say.  (High
bandwitdth might not be so great in that connection, either.)

I don't know any professional Web designer who would use anything that 
verbose, nor is that the sort of thing we find on actual sites. A more 
likely and preferable markup is:

Governor's press conference (Windows Media)
<ul>
<li><a>High-speed</a></li>
<li><a>Dial-up</a></li>
</ul>

(or just Hi and Lo)


And then of course that invites fundamentalists to bitch that somebody 
committed the cardinal sin of reusing link text on a page. And aren't we

suddenly concerned about link length?
