Gotcha, Joe-- a number  of other peole pointed out the same naivete on
my part, and someone (Yvette, I think) suggested a fix that would make
this an example of good practice rather than bad...

We *really* don't want to encourage people to use IP lookup to guess at
a 
user's country of origin. (For more than a decade, every CompuServe user

appeared to be living in Columbus, Ohio. How accurate is that?)

A notorious and maddening example is of course Showtime
<http://SHO.com/>, 
which tells you "We at Showtime Online express our apologies; however, 
these pages are intended for access only from within the United States,"

whatever the hell that means. (Won't they be surprised to learn that my 
Lynx install runs out of the United States, letting me read it just
fine?)

Country lookups break the universality of the Web.

The *correct* example to use here is HTTP content negotiation using the 
browser's default language. Yes, I know Jukka reminds us that most
people 
set this up wrong, but that's not our problem.
