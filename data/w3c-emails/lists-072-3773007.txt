The few usability studies of people with disabilities show conclusively
that nearly everything takes longer for nearly everyone. If delays were
truly the criterion, no site would meet WCAG.

Moreover, the DRC study showed that inaccessible sites took longer to use 
for *nondisabled* people, too. So in fact, we may suppose that a 
standards-compliant site that meets guidelines will be quicker to use than 
other kinds. It may still be possible to improve usability (an 
oft-suggested method is to cut down on repetitive navbars), but the 
Web will be a slower place most of the time for a lot of disabled 
people, if not most of them.
