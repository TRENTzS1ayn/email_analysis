Indeed. display: none; should expunge itself.

En tout cas, there are times when <caption> works for a table, other times 
when you simply don't need it, and still other times when an ordinary 
heading element makes more sense.

An interesting technique we could suggest is to style <caption> like the 
heading level immediately above the table, viz.

h2, caption.h2 { font-size: 120%; text-indent: -2em; }

(and so on down the line)

Thus, an author who was interested in simplicity could standardize on 
<caption> for every table and have the captions look like all the other 
headings in the document.

Just an idea.
