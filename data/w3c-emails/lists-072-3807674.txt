Well, if you want to do that, view source.

Oh, dear. What if the content you wanted to provide is a photograph?

In any event, a picture of text with an alt attribute (possibly even

picture backed up by text. And the reality is that people use pictures of 
text *sparingly*. I don't see a problem.
