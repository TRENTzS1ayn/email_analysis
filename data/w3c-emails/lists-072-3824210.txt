It turned out that many members of the working group were not familiar
with the term "inter-rater reliability," so we tried to find a
paraphrase.   But maybe we could solve the problem by using the
"inter-rater reliability" and linking it to a definition, as we do with
other specialized language (doing so would even be consistent with our
guidelines<grin>).


Thanks, Joe.

I believe the term you're looking for is "inter-rater reliability,"
which 
is reasonably well known in subjective testing. It's not necessarily a 
problem or anything.
