Having suggested that we use the term "inter-rater reliability" and link
to a definition, I thought I'd better go hunt for some definitions.
Here's one that may complicate the issue a little:

Although some researchers use the terms "agreement" and "reliability" as
though they were interchangeable, there are some important differences
between the two terms:  "Interrater agreement is the extent of a match
between the raters as they assign scores to performance, behaviors, or
essays-whereas interrater reliability is the extent to which the raters
order the participants' performances, behaviors, or essays in the same
way" (Goodwin, 2001, p. 16).  
</blockquote>
Goodwin, L.D. (2001).  Interrater agreement and reliability.
Measurement in Physical Education and Exercise Science, 5, 13-34.
 
This difference was illustrated in a class I taught the other day on
writing for accessibility (before I had read the material quoted above).
I asked twenty students to read and rate three short texts on a scale
from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent).  I did not provide criteria, part of my
point being that these folks, like other Web users, already *have*
criteria and apply them quickly and without much thought.  The twenty
particpants were divided into five groups.  There wasn't much
inter-rater "agreement" from group to group-- a given piece of text
received scores from 2-4, for example.  But there was substantial
inter-rater "reliability" according to the definition cited above: four
of the five groups *ranked* the three texts in the same order.
 
Hardly scientific, of course.
