Simple writing has been moved down to level 3

I can not see why this is not level one. 
 
But you all probably know that.
 
why can't every site at least consider writing clearly? And the
existence of a  statement (possibly in meta data) seem to me to be
testable
 
I think someone needs to explain it to me over a beer or something.  I
just don't get  it 
 
All the best
