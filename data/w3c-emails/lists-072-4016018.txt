General comment folks
Because of the time of the calls it is very hard for me to attend
 
I check the list regally, and try to attend calls where I think it is
the most important to attend. however I seem to always miss the ones on
writing simply, and hierarchal structure (either that or the new changes
did not get an agenda item for the call)
 
perhaps a  structure to the agenda email would help 
 
suggestion:
 a summary of the  topics or at least the  guideline could be given in
words -not a  number with a link. 
 
Reason - the numbers keep on changing (see 3.1's history) so for thoughs
of us with memory impairment, keeping track is out the question, and
loading each link  can take a long long time. (especially when I at my
home  - old computer...slow modem..dial up account )
 
 

All the best
