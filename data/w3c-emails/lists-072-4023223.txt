Re: Making it possible to convert text into symbolic languages such as
those used by Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices. 

I noticed the following editorial note
Editorial Note: js: say how-through metadata? And we need an example for
this one, under examples. Clearly a Level 3

Please note we have concrete example in the RDF (resource description
framework) techniques document.

With 3.1 being meta data and RDF intensive, do we need the RDF
techniques on the critical list for WCAG 2.0 release?

If so I should probably start working on it again...


All the best
