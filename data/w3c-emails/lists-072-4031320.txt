I'm with Lisa on this one & agree with your comments about simple language.
My understanding of why its not higher up the priority ladder is the
automatic testability requirement (and the target readership of the actual
site), though I may be wrong.

Lisa, if you need help on the rdf techniques document then give us a shout,
as you know this is right up our street.

There was an a thread on the wai-ig list not long ago about the use of
symbols, incase u missed it:
