Correcting typo and using "irregular" instead of "complex":

* Irregular tables have cells for which header cells are not in the same row
or same column as the cell.

* Layered tables have more than one column of row headers and/or more than
one row of column headers and header cells are in the same row and/or column
as the data cell.

* Simple tables have at most one row and at most one column of headings and
header cells are in the same row and/or column as the data cell.
