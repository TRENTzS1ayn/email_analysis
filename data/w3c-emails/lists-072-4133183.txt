I find these definitions all but impossible to understand:

> * Complex tables have cells for which header cells are not in the same row
> or same column as the cell.
> 
> * Layered tables have more than one row of row headers and/or more than one
> row of column headers and header cells are in the same row and/or column as
> the data cell.
> 
> * Simple tables have at most one row and at most one column of headings and
> header cells are in the same row and/or column as the data cell.

I tried to rewrite them so they made more sense. I'm not sure they do. I'm 
not sure we're anywhere near a clear definition.

Complex tables
have cells whose headers are not in the same row or same column as the 
cell

Layered tables
have headers that occupy more than one row or column. They also have 
header cells in the same row and/or column as the data cell

Simple tables
have at most one row and/or one column of headings. Header cells are in 
the same row and/or column as the data cell


I really think you're all looking at this too abstractly. You need to 
examine table examples (perhaps many dozens) and classify them. From 
there, you may be able to boil down some categories.

Nonetheless, I don't see how these _n_ categories of tables are really 
helpful, save for HTML or PDF techniques. The accessibility advice remains 
the same-- use valid code and use headers where possible. Right?
