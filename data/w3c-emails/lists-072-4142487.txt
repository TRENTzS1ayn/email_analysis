I've been working on some XSLT that may help us with the process of
mapping techniques to success criteria as we work on evolving the
techniques drafts. At this point in time, this view is likely to be most
useful for the techniques task force as we work through the end to end
process of mapping of success criteria to techniques.

Basically, it takes data from the source documents for the guidelines and
the techniques drafts and generates a table where each row includes a
success criteria and all of the techniques (HTML, CSS and Gateway) that
relate to it. 

At this point in time, there is very little mapping information in the
techniques documents, but as new techniques drafts begin to include this
information, this view should help us to more easily see how the pieces
fit together, where we need to create new techniques and where there are
other issues with mapping from the technology specifics to the general
guidelines.

A draft of the results is available at

<http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2004/06/02-sc-techniques-mapping.html> 

Please let me know if you have suggestions for improvement or questions
about how this might be used.\
