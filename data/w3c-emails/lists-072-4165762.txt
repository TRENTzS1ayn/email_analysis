Hi guys,

Posting an agenda for this afternoon on Gregg's behalf while he works to
recover from a hard drive crash.

Here's the agenda for this afternoon:

Time: 2100 UTC (4 PM US Eastern)
Number: ?+1-617-761-6200, passcode 9224 
irc.w3.org 6665, channel #wai-wcag

1. Issue 785 - Delete SC about contracted words? [1]

2. Walkthrough of the guidelines to identify places where our decisions
about scoping might allow us to simplify the guidelines. (e.g. 1.2)

3. If there is time remaining, begin a walkthrough of the guidelines to
determine whether the success criteria provide information as to what is
both a) necessary and b) sufficient to conform (without reliance on
additional technology-specific information or checklists).
