  Hi guys,

  Posting an agenda for this afternoon on Gregg's behalf while he works to
  recover from a hard drive crash.

  Here's the agenda for this afternoon:

  Time: 2100 UTC (4 PM US Eastern)
  Number: +1-617-761-6200, passcode 9224 
  irc.w3.org 6665, channel #wai-wcag

  1. Issue 785 - Delete SC about contracted words? [1]

  2. Walkthrough of the guidelines to identify places where our decisions
  about scoping might allow us to simplify the guidelines. (e.g. 1.2)

  3. If there is time remaining, begin a walkthrough of the guidelines to
  determine whether the success criteria provide information as to what is
  both a) necessary and b) sufficient to conform (without reliance on
  additional technology-specific information or checklists).
