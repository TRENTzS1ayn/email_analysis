This would apply to a passing bus. Which would be a short sound - but would
not be impulsive. 

Hmmmmmm

I think "short sound" may mean so many things... 

maybe we could try and explain what we're thinking about: do we mean
"impulsive sounds"? If so we'd better use the word "impulsive", as it is
quite self-explaining.

My best regards,

Oggetto: the the word "short" measurable


Level 3 Success Criteria for Guideline 1.5 


1.Audio content does not contain background sounds OR the background
sounds are at least 20 decibels lower than the foreground audio content with
the exception of occasional short sounds. [V] 
 

Do we need to give a definition of ?short? in Guideline 1.5 Level 3?
