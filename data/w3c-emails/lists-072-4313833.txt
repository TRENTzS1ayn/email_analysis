I would further like to add that over the years there have been a=many
suggestions of simple writing success criteria That no one has argued is
not testable and would not restrict freedom of expression.
 
these include:
 (note: this is _not_ all of them)
 
 A meta data simple language policy statement, where the author sets, in
a machine readable form,   boundaries for use on the page, and then
conformance is testable to that meta data statement.
 
This would include the author/policy maker setting such as: 

*A public/metadata statement as to maximum words per sentence
and sentences per paragraph
*A public/metadata statement as to tenses and number of
conjunctions in a paragraph

 It would also help people find sites that are useful to them, and
search engines for rankings etc... More to the point, it will make
policy maker actively decide who they are leaving out and why. We can
have example recommended metadata statements for a typical ecommerce
site, a government site, etc... But that would be non normative.
Another testable idea was using words from a simple language lexicon and
putting any extra words in a glossary (so you can , in fact, use any
word -so long as it is in a glossary)
 
all the best

Subject: 3.1 - simple writing...


Simple writing has been moved down to level 3

I can not see why this is not level one. 
 
But you all probably know that.
 
why can't every site at least consider writing clearly? And the
existence of a  statement (possibly in meta data) seem to me to be
testable
 
I think someone needs to explain it to me over a beer or something.  I
just don't get  it
