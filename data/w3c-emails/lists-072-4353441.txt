  My understanding is that presentational and styling elements  or markup  are not embedded or built-into markup that 
  - convey structure of different parts of the resource, or 
  - do things (functionality).

  An example from another context might help clarify my thought. When designing say, employee ID# for an org., one normally prefers not to build intelligence into the ID#. If the ID# were to convey employee's department and be the employee's unique identifier, he/she would have to be assigned a new ID# everytime  the individual's department changed.   Likewise "intelligence"or in our context, code that conveys presentational effects should be independent of code that conveys structure / functionality.
  Perhaps the last sentence  is the wording for the guideline 1.3...?
