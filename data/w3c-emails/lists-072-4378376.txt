The "new proposed wording for Guideline 1.1" below attempts to address the problems Gregg pointed out. 

  It moves the null alt item into a separate criterion, and makes the others subconditions/cases under the requirement to associate text alternatives with non-text content.  It tries to clarify what I meant for the Level 2 criterion (I'm not wedded to it!). And it tries to fix Level 3 SC 1-- for what it's worth, the strange wording about a text doc that contains "all important sounds" (now fixed) was taken directly from the 02 June working draft).  

<new proposed wording for Guideline 1.1>
Guideline 1.1
Provide text alternatives for all non-text content.

Level 1 success criteria for Guideline 1.1
1.Text alternatives are explicitly associated with non-text content through markup or contex, and one of the following is true:.
a.For non-text content that is functional, such as graphical links or buttons, text alternatives identify the purpose or function of the non-text content; or,
b.for non-text content that is used to convey information, there are text alternatives that convey the same information; or,  
c.for non-text content that is intended to create a specific sensory experience, such as music or visual art, text alternatives identify and describe the non-text content.
2.Non-text content that does not provide information or functionality  can be bypassed by assistive technology.

Level 2 success criteria for Guideline 1.1
1.Text alternatives can be accessed without an extreme  change of context.

Level 3 success criteria for Guideline 1.1
1.For multimedia content, a text document is provided that includes descriptions of all important visual information as well as  transcripts of dialogue and other important sounds.

Some comments

Regarding LEVEL 1 suggestion

I don't think this construct works for Level 1.  If you don't have any exceptions - then all of the success criteria must be met.  
In your formulation below - the first success criteria is that all non-text
content have a text alternative.   Since this says 'all' it means all
non-text content including spacers, decorations etc.   other checkpoints are
in addition to this - not instead of.

In Mike's formulation - all the clauses were within a single success criteria.  So it was possible to have the different treatments for the
different content types.   Kind of like a case statement. 
You might want to look at that.


Regarding LEVEL 2 for guideline 3.1

1 - do you mean 1.3?

2 - I don't know what this means.
"Text alternatives do not require a change of context."


Regarding LEVEL 3 for guideline 1.3

Level 3 success criteria for Guideline 3.1
1.    For multimedia content, a text document is provided that includes all
important visual information, dialogue, and other important sounds.
GV:  I don't know how you have sounds in a text doc.  Perhaps it should read "includes all important information that was presented visually or via dialog or important sounds."  

2.    For time based resources a synchronized transcript is provided.
?GV: what is a synchronized transcript?   What is it synchronized with?

GV: I think the existing wording which refers to a 'script or screenplay' is better at expressing this.

Thanks 

Gregg

Subject: RE: 1.1 suggestion

Thanks to Mike for proposing a rewrite for Guideline 1.1.  I really like the idea of removing the exception from the guideline itself and handling it in the success criteria.  In the proposed wording that follows, I've taken this basic idea as the starting point and then tried to re-state the success criteria for consistency with the way they're written throughout the document and in keeping with our plain language goals; I've also incorporated my own ideas about what the requirements should be. (My specific concerns about some of the ideas in Mike's proposal are listed under "Further discussion" below).

So here's my proposal:

<proposed wording for Guideline 1.1>
Guideline 1.1
Provide text alternatives for all non-text content.

Level 1 success criteria for Guideline 1.1
1.??? Text alternatives are explicitly associated with non-text content through markup or context. 2.??? Non-text content that does not provide information or functionality can be bypassed by assistive technology. 3.??? For non-text content that is functional, such as graphical links or buttons, text alternatives identify the purpose or function of the non-text content. 4.??? For non-text content that is used to convey information, there are text alternatives that convey the same information. 5.??? For non-text content that is intended to create a specific sensory experience, such as music or visual art, text alternatives identify and describe the non-text content.

Level 2 success criteria for Guideline 3.1
1.??? Text alternatives do not require a change of context.

Level 3 success criteria for Guideline 3.1
1.??? For multimedia content, a text document is provided that includes all important visual information, dialogue, and other important sounds. 2.??? For time based resources a synchronized transcript is provided. 3.??? 

</proposed wording for Guideline 1.1>

Further discussion
1.??? I strongly disagree with Mike's proposal to shift the requirement for synchronized transcripts from Guideline 1.2 to a level 3 requirement under 1.1. I can see an argument for moving it to 1.1, but it should be a level 1 criterion.  And I would prefer to let it stand as a guideline in its own right, wihth its own success criteria.  So I have omitted it from the list of success criteria below. 2.??? I think we need a different approach to the problem of syndicated content.  First, the needs of users with disabilities don't change when content is syndicated: syndicated non-text content is still non-text content.  Second, the specific bullet items listed in Mike's proposal don't fall under 1.1 (they have to do with popup windows, blinking text, screen refresh, etc. I would be in favor of an approach in which content aggregators require their content providers to provide conformance information in metadata.  Commercial sites that aggregate content could write the requirement for conformance information into their contracts with their suppliers; the aggreagation scripts could presumably be written to look for the conformance information in metadata.  In a sense, this is actually a techniques issue-it has to do with how you can meet the requirements under specific circumstances.

Subject: RE: 1.1 suggestion
?this summarizes several open 1.1 issues and, imho, addresses some of the ambiguity in the current 1.1 statement.? Personally I would prefer to not have the difference made between syndicated content and native content, but this is a summary of many issues and the 'ad content' issue was one of them. The syndicated content SC is derived from those issues.
?
?
?
Guideline 1.1:
?All non-text content should have a textual alternative explicitly associated with it.
?
Level1 Success Criteria for Guideline 1.1:
1. For content that is not syndicated from an outside source, e.g. ads, four conditions must be met:
?*?For non-text 'resources' that have no direct bearing on the content being conveyed a text alternative must be provided with a null value.? This will inform AT that this resource should be ignored.
?*?For non-text 'resources' that have iconic or functional use a text alternative must be provided which details the function of the element.? 
?*?For non-text 'resources' that encode specific information in a non-verbal form a text alternative must be provided which presents the encoded information verbally.
?*?For non-text 'resources' which encode no specific information, but are intended to create a sensory experience, a text alternative must be provided.? This text should convey what the resource is, and what relevance the resource has to the rest of the content if any.
?
2. Syndicated content must not:
?*?Flash screen reader readable text or otherwise altering text stream
?*?Spawn pop up windows
?*?Steal or keep keyboard focus
?*?Refresh content
?
Level2 Success Criteria for Guideline 1.1:
1. All content including syndicated content must conform to level one conditions.
?
Level3 Success Criteria for Guideline 1.1:
1. A text document is provided that includes all important visual information, dialogue, and other important sounds. 2. Textual alternatives should not require use of a particular sense to be understandable.? If specific sensory data is referenced in the text, e.g. 'red' or 'alto', such a reference should not be essential to understanding the text. 
3. For time based resources a synchronized transcript is provided.
