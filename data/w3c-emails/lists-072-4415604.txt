This is excellent work; minor comments are included below.

This raises the old question of the best generic term to use in place
of "markup", where we do not want to restrict the application of the
criterion to markup languages. Markup or data model is used in 1.3,
perhaps "markup, a data model, or context". Whatever we choose, it
should be consistent with 1.3.

Also, why "text alternatives" rather than the well established WCAG
1.0 term "text equivalents?" If we mean the same thing, perhaps we
should use the same terminology for consistency. If the meaning is
different then I think a new term is desirable to avoid confusions, in
which case "text alternative" is as good as any.

perhaps "the text alternatives convey the same information"; the
existence requirement is already specified above, I think. If it isn't
sufficiently clear, perhaps the first success criterion should read
"text alternatives are provided, and are explicitly associated..."

Fair enough. Maybe this justifies dropping the term "equivalent", as
they aren't genuinely equivalent to the non-text content (or perhaps
they are, given a suitably defined equivalence relation). I think this
is where dissatisfaction with "text equivalent" arose and I am not
persuaded that it is a strong argument.

In the examples section, be sure to provide an example of this one. In
what conceivable circumstances is it not trivially satisfied?
