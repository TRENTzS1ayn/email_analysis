The central questions seem to be:
1. Do general success criteria provide enough information to determine 
conformance?
2. If not, is it possible to make them testable enough to determine 
conformance?
3. If not, should we conclude that checklists must be normative?
4. How would putting checklists on the Recommendation track effect our 
timeline?
5. Can we satisfy the Requirements for WCAG 2.0 with informative checklists?

"WCAG 2.0: Normative checklists?" [1]  attempts to frame issues for WCAG WG 
discussion. <http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2004/06/normative-checklist-issues.html>

It includes issues raised in previous summaries and discussions.
