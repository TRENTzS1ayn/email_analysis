1. Announcements

2. Checklists and whether they should be normative or informative. 

The purpose of the meeting is not necessarily to answer the question, but
rather to gather the different issues, questions and aspects


Wendy has pulled together a page summarizing postings and posing questions
and ideas to stimulate thought and discussion.  PLEASE READ THIS AND THINK
ABOUT IT BEFORE THE MEETING.

Wendy also wrote:
The central questions seem to be:
1. Do general success criteria provide enough information to determine
conformance?
2. If not, is it possible to make them testable enough to determine
conformance?
3. If not, should we conclude that checklists must be normative?
4. How would putting checklists on the Recommendation track effect our
timeline?
5. Can we satisfy the Requirements for WCAG 2.0 with informative checklists?


See you tomorrow.   Again, please read above post and think about this
before meeting.   This is a very tough and very important issue.


Gregg
