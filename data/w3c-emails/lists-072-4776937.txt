Even suggesting this will, in my opinion, result in gems like the va.gov
site used to be (http://jimthatcher.com/whatnot.htm) and the way
http://archives.gov is today. Long long descriptions attached to invisible
gifs that you must listen to; maybe they should attach skip links at the top
of each description so you can skip to the next long descripiton (kidding).

True John, but sighted users can and usually do ignore the images without
doing anything. If descriptions are added inline they cannot be ignored with
speech and I am surprsed you don't find that hugely important.
