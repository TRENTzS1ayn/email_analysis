We are going to need tighter phrasing than that. "Explicitly associated" 
could be interpreted to mean the addition of actual text on the page 
saying something like "Look at the bottom of the page for the description 
of this image," without a link. Sort of like people "marking" the language 
of text by writing "The following text is in Spanish."

I've never been wild about the presumed synonym "programmatically," but it 
could work here.
