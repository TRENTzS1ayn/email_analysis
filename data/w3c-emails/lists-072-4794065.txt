It's true that sighted users can ignore images that don't interest them,
and that it's harder to ignore unwanted text.  Hence skipnav links, etc.
But good information and page design and good markup can help-- using a
header tag to identify the description, for example. And screen readers
provide tools that help users skip over some things-- keystorkes that
let you jump to another element, for example.

I don't think it's a perfect solution, and I wouldn't want to say it's
appropriate in every place.  But there are times when it would help. As
I said previously, I'm not wedded to this idea.

John

Even suggesting this will, in my opinion, result in gems like the va.gov
site used to be (http://jimthatcher.com/whatnot.htm) and the way
http://archives.gov is today. Long long descriptions attached to
invisible gifs that you must listen to; maybe they should attach skip
links at the top of each description so you can skip to the next long
descripiton (kidding).

And then John said,

True John, but sighted users can and usually do ignore the images
without doing anything. If descriptions are added inline they cannot be
ignored with speech and I am surprsed you don't find that hugely
important.
