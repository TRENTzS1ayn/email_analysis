Hello all,

Registration is open until 7 July for the 12-15 July WCAG WG F2F hosted by 
Oracle in Palo Alto, CA USA.  A block of hotel rooms at a discounted rate 
will be available until 29 June.

More information available at:
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2004/07/f2f-agenda.html>

Thank you, Kerstin, for arranging the meeting logistics and thanks to 
Oracle for hosting the meeting.

Critical dates:
1. 29 June - deadline to make room reservation and receive discounted rate
2. 7 July - deadline for registration
3. 12-15 July - face-to-face meetings

There are a few transportation, teleconferencing and agenda details that we 
are resolving, but that should not prevent you from registering and 
reserving a hotel room. If you plan to attend via teleconference, please 
register that you are not attending the meeting and provide the appropriate 
information in response to "Calling into the meeting."  Please contact me 
with any questions.

Best,
--wendy
