CMIIW, but since the UCS (Universal Character Set, often referred to as
Unicode) is the document character set for HTML/XML, they (foreign words) ain't
written in a different character set.

Again referring to to John (see my last post [1]) I claim this is an issue
where unimpaired users are affected as well. Also, I don't see any need for
ruling language use by the WAI WG (there already was such a discussion a few
months ago [2] ;).


All the best,
 Jens.
