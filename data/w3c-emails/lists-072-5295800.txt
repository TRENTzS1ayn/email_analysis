The default character set for HTML is undefined, and the HTML spec says "user
agents must not assume any default" --
http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/charset.html#h-5.2.2

HTTP claims that the default is iso-8859-1 - which is a pain, because for XML
the default is Unicode. This sets up a conflict :(

This is a slightly messy issue, but it is possible to determine that
characters outside the range of a particular language are being used. HTML
allows user agents to guess that character set, without specifying any set of
reasonable guesses. Unfortunately most people get it wrong, asserting for
example that American english can be written in ASCII (which is false), and
the tools are still not that great either.

I hope Richard Ishida or someone very versed in these issues can help
clarify.

Cheers
