According to Richard Ishida [1]:

'For XML and HTML (from version 4.0 onwards) the document character set is
defined to be the Universal Character Set (UCS) as defined by both ISO/IEC
10646 and Unicode standards. (For simplicity and in line with common practice,
we will refer to the UCS here simply as Unicode.)'


Best regards,
 Jens.
