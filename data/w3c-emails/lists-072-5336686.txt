It's in fact confusing when reconsidering 'charset' naming e.g. in
attributes and at-rules (per se), but I explicitly referred to UCS, not to any Unicode
encoding :) AFAIR Charles and Lisa didn't refer to encodings, either, but to
'real' character sets (Lisa) in case of Hebrew, for example.


Best regards,
 Jens.
