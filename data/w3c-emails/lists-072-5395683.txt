Quite possibly that should be a warning sign.

Then fix the screen readers, Lisa. Perhaps you'd like to take on that
project rather than advancing the preposterous idea that Web authors be
forced to write kiddie Hebrew and Arabic rather than the true forms
naturally used by adults.

But they may be the correct adaptive technology. Suddenly difficulty and
that perennial bugbear, expense, are insurmountable problems for this
group but not, say, for the totally blind or people with severe dyslexia?

Oh. So we're including them after all.

That *sentence* doesn't.

This continues to be an argument for better screen readers and will hold
true for any language containing homographs, including English.

It isn't anywhere near resolved. The proposal is unsound if not asinine,
as it ignores the reality of written Hebrew and Arabic. It will be laughed
at and ignored by authors if passed by Working Group members, who tend to
simply take orders from you without engaging their rational faculties.
Plus they don't know anything about writing systems, Richard Ishida
excepted.
