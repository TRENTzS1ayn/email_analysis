Please volunteer to write the summary for one of these guidelines:  1.2, 
1.3, 1.7, 2.5

Goals (as outlined in 11 December minutes [1]):
to get more discussion on list, to get through comments, to be more 
prepared for telecons.

Task:  Summarize the issues related to a particular guideline. Collect the 
issues from Bugzilla using the information from Ben [2].  Summary template: 
Issues, Current wording, Past proposals, New proposals

You may also want to list:
dependencies between guidelines, assumptions (what assumption do you make 
when thinking about this guideline?), and rationale (why this guideline is 
important).

Example summaries:
1. [4.1] Overview and summary of guideline 4.1 - Yvette [3]
2. Summary of Bugzilla comments on checkpoint/guideline 3.3 - John [4]
3. Action Item on Checkpoint 2.2 - Andi [5]

Please send me an email if you wish to volunteer.
