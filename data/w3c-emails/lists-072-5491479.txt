XML 1.1 and Namespaces in XML 1.1 Are W3C Recommendations

   The World Wide Web Consortium released "Extensible Markup Language
   (XML) 1.1" and "Namespaces in XML 1.1" as W3C Recommendations. XML 1.1
   addresses Unicode, control character, and line ending issues.
   Namespaces 1.1 incorporates errata corrections and provides a mechanism
   to undeclare prefixes.

XML 1.0 Third Edition Is a W3C Recommendation

   The World Wide Web Consortium released the "Extensible Markup Language
   (XML) 1.0 Third Edition" as a W3C Recommendation. The third edition is
   not a new version of XML. It brings the XML 1.0 Recommendation up to
   date with second edition errata, and clarifies its use of RFC 2119 key
   words like "must," "should" and "may." Visit the XML home page.

   of certain kinds of invalidity, and corrects typographical errors. The
   Infoset defines a set of eleven types of information items in XML
   documents.
