Hello Joe Clark,
I am a father of a blind child and I was part of the developers of the first
text to speech in Hebrew.
The problem with Hebrew is that with regular Hebrew there are no vowels in
the words. When you look at each word there are in average are 2.3
possibilities to say it. When you look at a sentence and use regular grammar
rules you can get to 80% accuracy. If we will ignore minor accuracy problems
we can get to 95% but this is it.
To make a better Hebrew text to speech you need to start using artificial
intelligence which means big money and the result will need a long
processing time which is not good for our goal.

So, we need to use shortcuts around the problem to fix the 5% by giving the
text to speech "hints" regarding the right pronunciation. In Hebrew we call
these hints diacritic marks and they are used in books and should be used
when using Internet as well. The only question arises is how many words
should have these marks and which words? The answer for this question was
passed by ISOC to the Hebrew Language Academy.

However, there are dyslectic people who get too much information through
text and they should not see the diacritic marks. So there should always be
a way to hide them.

Regards,
Reuven Nisser
