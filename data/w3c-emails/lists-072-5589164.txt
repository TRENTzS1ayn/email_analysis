To keep it short: This was the 'magic point', I wasn't really aware of this
tension, and this issue of course changes my thinking of this topic (although
I'd only relativize some issues I mentioned before). Thank you, Al, the
entire feedback was very valuable to me...

BTW -- Personally, I rather prefer the first approach, but I also like the
aspects the latter assertion implies. There are of course barriers unimpaired
users suffer, and one of them is the kind of language used in documents, but
I question if you can (and should) rule any language use, which is a natural
and growing thing, permanently implying hurdles. That *is* in her nature.


Best regards,
 Jens.
