No, although in practice there are a restricted number of possiblities. One
difficulty is that japanese doesn't use word breaks, so you don't get to look
at a single word very often.

True, but the lookup table for "kiddy japanese" is extremely large. If
Moore's law continues to apply we could expect it to work in computers at
some point, but like doing grammar analysis by brute force, it isn't
currently feasible as I understand it.

It would be nice to have some people more versed in japanese than I am in
this discussion. But the culture of this list can be intimidatory by american
standards. From other perspectives it is considered bullying and abusive.
This explains some of the reluctance of people to participate even when they
have important contributions to make. There are other things like limited
time, a generic fear of being ridiculed or ignored for incorrect language
which is exacerbated by the fact that it happens uncheced here, or not
actually being able to keep up with the pace of the discussion, which have an
impact too.
