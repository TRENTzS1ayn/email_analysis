Hello,

In Germany the parliament member Hubert H?ppe has a site and claims that
this is WCAG-AA-compliant.
Ironically under the  WCAG-AA-logo is stated that the site is accessible
for people with visual impairment.(http://www.huberthueppe.de )

Realizing that using WCAG-logos is also always more a commercial reason
for impressing clients or competitors, I think it is better that in the
page with the download conformance logos
http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG1-Conformance.html explicitely is stated
something like:

showing the conformancelogos on a page means that the page has been made
as accessible as possible  for all visitors, corresponding to the
claimed conformance-level.
And that claiming accessible for one or more specified groups of
visitors violates the meaning and prohibits the use of these
conformance-logos.

Why is the text "Responsibility for accuracy of claims" in the bottom of
this page? Only few peole will scroll the page more than seeing the
conformance-logos and read it. Is not it better to move this text just
above the text "how to use the logos"?

Perhaps WCAG can ask the parliament member to remove the
conformance-logo from mentioned page?

Is any authority existing that can remove logos from pages when the
logos are very clearly misused ( e.g. no valid code and claiming level
aa or aaa) and people are not prepared to remove the logo?  I mean
things that can be tested by every online accessibility  (like Bobby or
WAVE) or (x)html-validation tool?.

Cheers
