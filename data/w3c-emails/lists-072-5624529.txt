Hello,

In Germany the parliament member Hubert H?ppe has a site and claims that
this is WCAG-AA-compliant.
Ironically under the  WCAG-AA-logo is stated that the site is accessible
for people with visual impairment.(http://www.huberthueppe.de )


Roberto:
The problem is that there are not a lot of localization.
In the document (i've done the italian version so i know) is clear that
it isn't a certification and the only responsable is the person that put
in the web site.
If the logo is a trade-mark (but i don't think so), W3C can legally act
versus wrong use of it.
