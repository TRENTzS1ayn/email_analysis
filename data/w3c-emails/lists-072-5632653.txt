Over the last months, in response to the fact that most WCAG WG 
members don't really surf the Web even though they write guidelines 
for it, I have added to my bookmarks many pages of interest in a few 
"suspect categories" that the Working Group tends to get completely 
wrong though lack of exposure. The idea was to provide examples the 
Working Group could look at, limiting the WG's habit of speculation.

Those categories, somewhat abbreviated, include:

AV(-only)
Bad Sites
Blink/marquee/strobe
Bullets & icons
CC-DX
"Click here"
Colour
Backgrounds
Confusable pairs
Protan, deutan, tritan
About colour deficiency
Colour tools
Failed redesigns
Forms
Horizontal scrolling
iframes
Illustrations
Image-handling
alt text Hixie test cases
Misc
Photos
Rather the wrong idea
Sitemaps
Text-only, text as images
Tables
Typ(ography)
Valid (sites)

For everyone's benefit, and to indicate to the WAI politburo that I 
might actually provide interesting and unique resources from time to 
time, I did an export from Mozilla and a massive cleanup to make the 
links valid HTML. Character encoding is correct even though some 
non-ASCII characters were incorrectly saved in the bookmarks. 
(Mozilla uses nonstandard encoding.) That annoyance is livable, and 
not worth fixing.

There are, by my count, 332 bookmarks there. This should be 
sufficient grist for the mill for a while, though I will occasionally 
update the results. Note that I have a file of other examples of 
tables waiting in the wings.

Some links will have died; not all are in English; some are 
duplicates; most are bad examples of the topic under discussion, but 
some are good examples; the links are unannotated; and some "content" 
may cause offense to sensitive readers. Welcome to the Web; hope you 
like it here.
