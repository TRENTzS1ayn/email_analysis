I volunteer to summarize guideline 1.3 (Information, functionality, and
structure are separable from presentation). This happens to be one of my
favorite guidelines since it is so fundamental which makes it widely
applicable to different types of accessibility problems.

Since this is such a broad guideline, I will need some time to write the
summary. I expect I can send the summary to the list in the last week of
February. If you need it sooner perhaps someone else can take this one.
