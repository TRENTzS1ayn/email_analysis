Small point, but critical

I was not suggesting not using foreign words, merely that one provides a
translation. This can be done through markup

Also, in Guideline 3.1 success criteria 1 we have

<q>Foreign words or phrases that are found in standard unabridged
dictionaries for the natural language of the content do not need to be
marked. </q>

So as you are doing that anyway, all that remains (in html) is to use
the title tag of the span to provide a translation at the same time...

It is just a question of technology, and does not affect or limit the
way people write or the page content


All the best
