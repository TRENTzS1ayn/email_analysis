Thinking about  Charles and Jens emails..

In principal yes, I would love to see the whole thing with learning
disabilities/ simple Language set up with a good  road map, working up
from user cases up.

On the other hand this one is simple. Someone with a learning disability
such as many forms of dyslexia are extremely challenged when learning
new alphabet/ languages. The challenge is not comparable to the barriers
faced by non disabled people.

For example I took French lessons an hour a day for two years, I really
wanted to learn French and worked harder at it then in any other
subject. After two years and a lot of hard work I scored 12% in the
exam. I was quite please with that, but then my French teacher suggested
that I spend my French periods in the library doing homework for other
subjects.....So now, quite a few years late I was reading The Professor
by Charlotte Bronte over the weekend, but I missed out the bits in
French.

The situation is much worse when a new alphabet is required. In Israel
the only children over age 8 who do not have to study English are
learning disabled. So the vast majority of people who can not understand
or recognize the splattering of English words on Hebrew sites are
disabled. On the other hand I challenge you to find many sites (not
specializing in word games) that should not consider me in their target
audience.

However when a designer is thinking about their target audience they
tend to forget people with disabilities. So a Hebrew web designer will
assume that their audience completed school and can read English.  They
may also assume their audience is using are using a monitor - both
assumptions are basically true _except_ for the disabled populations in
their target audience. That is why we have these guidelines. 

This is clearly a disability issue. The fact that it helps other people
does not change that.

Adding a title (containing a translation) to the span (that is already
required by 3.1) is not restricting free speech and will help people
with disabilities access the material on the web.

I fail to see why this is controversial. It is a simple case of using
markup in such a way as to help people with disabilities access web
content.

Other issues, such as defining when is a word in a different language,
are the same as checkpoint 3.1 (marking up different languages in web
content).


All the best
