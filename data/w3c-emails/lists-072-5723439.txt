Hello Ineke,

Using the A, AA or AAA logo means more than just being accessible to
people with visual disabilities. It is also more accessible to everybody
else and to people with other disabilities. The EOWG group has made a
good overview of disabilities on the page about how people with
disabilities use the web: http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/PWD-Use-Web/

Also accessibility is a businesscase. The businesscase is also described
on the EO pages but is being revised now:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/benefits.html

Kindest regards,

Eric Velleman

Hallo Yvette,

Thanks for your mail.

http://www.huberthueppe.de I tested the site in Bobby, but it fails
WCAG-AA, though the WCAG-AA-logo is in the site..

My concern is that accessibility logos will get an emty meaning (and
perhaps accessibility) when showed on pages that does not pass automatic
tests like Bobby or WAVE.

And writing a statement under a logo as: accessible for people with
visual impairments gives a certain explanation of the logo to people who
don't understand what the logos really mean. And that is still always
more than 85% of the visitors.

I even have seen a site of a web design company that claim their CMS
produces accessible site and you can chooce a site with A, AA or AAA
logo. Nowhere in the site is stated what this really means.

The company site is not valid and accessible at all, but who cares for
that? The WCAG? Even member-sites are not valid  (X)html and at least
WCAG-AA conform.

Greetings
Ineke van der Maat
