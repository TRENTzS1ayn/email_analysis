It's *forced speech*, Lisa. Now, so is an alt text, but in that case we
are not talking about translation, which is a very large bridge to cross.

Essentially, once we start requiring translations, *there is no
theoretical limit*. A Ukrainian-speaker could demand Ukrainian
translations of your Hebrew pages, Lisa, lest they otherwise be
"inaccessible."

Unilingualism is not a disability. A particular detail of unilingualism--
that the unilingual person, disabled or not, cannot read another script--
is not so important that it overpowers the issue of required translation.

Further: And aren't you *assuming* the author knows the translation? And
that the adaptive technology can even render a title attribute in what you
consider to be the base character set?

If that were the only criterion, every draconian or cockamamie idea anyone
ever came up with would become part of WCAG 2.0. Though I still hold out
hope that will not actually have been true of WCAG 2.0.

Wilfully so, I suspect.

Top-posting is an accessibility issue, Lisa.
