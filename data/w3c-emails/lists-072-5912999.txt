I meant this:

<table>
<tr><td><h1>Reasons to do this</h1></td><td>We should do this
because...</td></tr>
<tr><td><h1>Reaons against doing this</h2></td><td>We should avoid this
because.... </td></tr>
</table>

I think we can all agree headings in layout tables should still be marked as
headings. Since this is in my opinion a layout table, I don't think TH
should be used.

This doesn't achieve same visual effect. The headings now appear above the
text, not to the left. If I want them to the left without using CSS, I can
use tables to achieve this. (The consensus was that we were not going to ban
layout tables.) This makes the above an example of a layout table where the
meaning of the cells change when you move the cells. That's still in the
grey area according to me :-)

I totally agree with you, see above.

Yep, that's the basic example.

But label doesn't always cover it. See the Genlias example in my original
post which has two columns of inputs where the meaning of an input is
derived from both the 'label' and the column title.
