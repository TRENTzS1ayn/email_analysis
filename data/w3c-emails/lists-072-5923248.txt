A small addendum to the example of a table used to lay out a form:

Recent versions of the JAWS screen reader don't appear to recognize the
table markup once the user has entered forms mode: JAWS reports the
label elements but not the row or column headers as such.

-- Having said that, I hear Joe Clark reminding us not to confuse what a
particular screen reader implementation does with what *should* happen,
and I would agree-- it would be good to be able to find out both the
specific label for a specific control and the larger category to which
it belongs.  Fieldset and legend can do this in some cases, but I think
not all-- especially not in layout tables, where a fieldset has to be
entirely contained within a single table cell in order to work (I think:
again this may be JAWS specific, and I'd be glad if it turns out not to
be generally true!)

I agree that there will be grey areas but let's see if we can clarify
most of them.

Here's the table I think you're describing:

<table>
<tr><th>Heading 1</th><td>Some text.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Heading 2</th><td>More text.</td></tr>
</table>

I believe that this could be a layout table with improper use of the TH
element. Remove the first column of TH elements. Place the heading text
within the TD elements and mark it as such (i.e. H2).

TH elements are semantic markup and should not be used in your example
table.

Here's what I think you're describing:

<form>
<table>
<tr><td><label for="id1">label 1</label></td><td><input type="text"
id="id1"/></td></tr> <tr><td><label for="id2">label
2</label></td><td><input type="text" id="id2"/></td></tr> </table>
</form>

Yes, grey area. Technique 14.4 already says to label form controls so
the use of TH may be optional here.
