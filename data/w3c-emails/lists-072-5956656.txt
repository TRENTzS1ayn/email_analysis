  Hello All,
  My thoughts / observations:
  1. A data table must be at least 2 X 2 in size and  in order to understand the content of any  td cell it must be necessary to relate it to its column header and row header (identifier). And conversely, all td cell contents in a row or column should bear a relation  to the row or column header respectively. 
   If the  td contents  makes sense on its own, then the table may be regarded as a layout table. 
  2. Should be possible to listHTML elements that   are out of place in a real data-table. For instance it does not make sense  to embed a data table within a td of a data table. (One does see them but it is  not good design in my opinion because a zoomed-in view of that cell is outside the structure of the main table). 
  3. JAWS  is the only screen reader that allows table navigation  in forms mode and that is real good. WinEyes4.5  and HPR 3.02 do not.

  This behavior  is dependent on  the technique used to code a form embedded in a table. First one needs to identify whether  the table is a data table or is used only for layout purpose. If it is the latter, then the label method must be used to associate them to controls. This  is the route one must take when  there is a one to 
  one relation with a label and control.  
   In this situation, it does not make sense to navigate the form in table navigation mode and quite logically,  JAWS table navigation fails in forms mode.
  A two column table with left column containing  labels for form controls in the right column  is essentially a layout table as  the contents of the first row are not really column headers for the table. The label method is proper in this case.
  But when more than one control can be associated with a label, then one must adopt the data table approach for coding a form. The label element must not be used but the title attribute should be used on every form control to identify its row and column. This form is navigable in table mode whether in or out of forms mode with JAWS. Of course, th must be used for column and row headers (first row and left most column).
  Example 1: Travel Expense reporting form:
  Columns are: Serial#, Date, Place, Meals($), Hotel($),Transport($). The serial# is a row identifier.
  There can be more than one row of data and  there are  a series of controls associated with everyrow OR  column header. 
  Example 2: Inbox (or any e-mail) folder
  Column header: From, Date, Size,Checkbox.
  The "From" field in rows of data is a hyperlink to the message. Size and date are display fields and  checkbox can be activated to select/deselect the message.
  Selected messages can tbe  deleted or moved  to another folder by  activating a button at the start of the table. This table can be navigated in table mode (out of forms mode) and checkbox can be  checked/unchecked with spacebar.

  A small addendum to the example of a table used to lay out a form:


  -- Having said that, I hear Joe Clark reminding us not to confuse what a
  particular screen reader implementation does with what *should* happen,
  and I would agree-- it would be good to be able to find out both the
  specific label for a specific control and the larger category to which
  it belongs.  Fieldset and legend can do this in some cases, but I think
  not all-- especially not in layout tables, where a fieldset has to be
  entirely contained within a single table cell in order to work (I think:
  again this may be JAWS specific, and I'd be glad if it turns out not to
  be generally true!)

  I agree that there will be grey areas but let's see if we can clarify
  most of them.

  Here's the table I think you're describing:

  <table>
  <tr><th>Heading 1</th><td>Some text.</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Heading 2</th><td>More text.</td></tr>
  </table>

  I believe that this could be a layout table with improper use of the TH
  element. Remove the first column of TH elements. Place the heading text
  within the TD elements and mark it as such (i.e. H2).

  TH elements are semantic markup and should not be used in your example
  table.

  Here's what I think you're describing:

  <form>
  <table>
  <tr><td><label for="id1">label 1</label></td><td><input type="text"
  id="id1"/></td></tr> <tr><td><label for="id2">label
  2</label></td><td><input type="text" id="id2"/></td></tr> </table>
  </form>

  Yes, grey area. Technique 14.4 already says to label form controls so
  the use of TH may be optional here.
