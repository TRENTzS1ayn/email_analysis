This isn't an accessibility issue in the first place. You simply have to
declare your character encoding (either in HTTP headers or the <meta>
element or both). Unicode, while desirable, is not the only encoding that
works, and for some languages (like Vietnames, Thai, Chinese), the
"legacy" encodings work better in real-world browsers.

Could proponents of the current wording please point to people with
disabilities alive and using the Web today who experience barriers or
inaccessibility because some encoding other than Unicode was used?
