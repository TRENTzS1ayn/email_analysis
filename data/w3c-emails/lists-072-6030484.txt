Here's an example: this checkpoint applies to PDF files that use fonts without 
ToUnicode tables, so there is no way to determine which character is 
represented by a glyph.

I don't think the checkpoint is trying to outlaw other encodings; only to make 
sure that the identity of the characters is unambiguous. Is there a better way 
to phrase this to make the distinction clearer?
