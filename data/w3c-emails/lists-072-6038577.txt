On the one hand, the clarification suggested by Richard, to wit

would make it clearer (it's already true with the existing language) that duly
annotated use of Big5 etc. conforms.

On the other hand, what we should really do concerning Unicode, encodings,
etc. is, as Joe hints, defer to the Character Model; with a note-in-draft to
confirm it gets to Rec before we do.  We can remind people to observe it,
but should not abridge it in text that comes across as free-standing
requirements imposed by *this* document.

This requirement is important for access by PWDs but it's not our problem
alone and there is a document chartered elsewhere (i18n) to address exactly
this topic.

So if we want to claim credit for "plays well with others" we had better
avoid re-inventing their wheel.
