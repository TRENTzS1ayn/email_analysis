The way the W3C typically handles this is through test suites. Nice to
have, hard to produce, and often somewhat artificial. We can reduce the
sting of the middle of those three by relying on existing test cases out
on the Web. We can simply ask for permission to reuse people's code. I
have a couple of these in my bookmarks. Generally they're on very limited
topics (as alt text, for example), rather than the whole shebang.

As for browser support, these things change so often that this sort of
thing should be done by a Wiki or similar page that can be edited at
will-- indeed, edited by anyone. Successive versions of
Mozilla<slash>Firebird<slash>Firefox or Safari, or even successive builds
of Netscape 4 and IE/Win, all behave differently. Plus some people have
access to betas.

Keeping on top of these things would be much too much work for any single
person. But if you make it easy to add your own observations, the work
gets distributed.

An example would be title attribute support. Easy to test in a lot of
browsers, difficult to test in a lot of browsers *by one person*. Share
the load.
