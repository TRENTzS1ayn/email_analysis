RDF and OWL Are W3C Recommendations

   The World Wide Web Consortium released the Resource Description
   Framework (RDF) and the OWL Web Ontology Language (OWL) as W3C
   Recommendations. RDF is used to represent information and to exchange
   knowledge in the Web. OWL is used to publish and share sets of terms
   called ontologies, supporting advanced Web search, software agents
   and knowledge management. Read the press release and testimonials and
   visit the Semantic Web home page.

DOM Level 3 Core & Load and Save Are W3C Proposed Recommendations

   W3C is pleased to announce the advancement of two Document Object
   Model (DOM) specifications to Proposed Recommendations. Comments are
   welcome through 5 March. With "DOM Level 3 Core," software developers
   and script authors manipulate the content, structure and style of Web
   documents. "DOM Level 3 Load and Save" allows programs and scripts to
   load, serialize and filter document contents. Visit the DOM home page.

XML-Binary Packaging and SOAP Transmission Optimization Working Drafts
Published

   The XML Protocol Working Group has released the First Public Working
   Draft of "XML-binary Optimized Packaging" (XOP). XOP allows efficient
   serializing of certain types of XQuery and XPath 2.0 element content.
   Based on XOP, the group also published an updated Working Draft of
