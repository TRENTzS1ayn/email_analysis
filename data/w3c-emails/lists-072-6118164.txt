Subject: [TECH] CSS techniques mapping the 1.0 Techniques to the 2.0
Techniques

 

I had the action item to map the 1.0 techniques to 2.0 techniques to find
places where they conflict or where there may be omissions. Here's a basic
mapping of the CSS Techs 1.0 to 2.0 and vice versa

Differences:

*2.0 does not talk about overriding the style sheet as per 1.0 CSS #2

*2.0 does not talk about spacers about spacers as per 1.0 #11.1 
*2.0 does not talk about hide/show movement as per 1.0 #14 
*2.0 introduces some talk of XML in #1 (author benefits
*Neither of the documents have opened up "scripting and stylesheets"
(2.0#4.4)
*1.0 does not talk about "null" alt text as per 2.0#4.
*1.0 does not talk about text equivalents for content generated by
style sheets as per 2.0#3.1

I think given that they are almost identical in content (the lay out is
different) we can migrate the CSS Techniques 1.0 into the 2.0 document and
use it as the supporting TECH spec for both the current 1.0 WCAG guidelines
and the emerging 2.0 Guidelines.
