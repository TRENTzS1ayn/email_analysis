Hi all

 

I took an action item to look at the word "Appropriate" in the 2.0
guidelines to see if it interferes with our "testability" criteria. Just for
interest, I've included the informative part also after the success criteria
items.

Here are informative parts of the guidelines that use the word
"appropriate."


 Examples of Guideline 1.4 (Informative) 


*Example 1: an acronym in a page title. 

In the following heading, "People of the W3C." the acronym "W3C" is marked
as an acronym. Because it has been marked appropriately, the user agent
would be able to speak the letters of the acronym one at a time rather than
attempting to pronounce it as though it were a word.

 


Examples of Guideline 1.5 (Informative) 


*Example 1: documentation for a product. 

Identifying chapters in the structure of a book is appropriate ..

 


Benefits of Guideline 3.1 (Informative) 


*Phrases from various languages are often interspersed in writing.
When these phrases are identified, a speech synthesizer can voice text with
the appropriate accent and pronunciation

 


Benefits of Guideline 3.1 (Informative) 


*Phrases from various languages are often interspersed in writing.
When these phrases are identified, a speech synthesizer can voice text with
the appropriate accent and pronunciation. When they are not identified, the
speech synthesizer will use the default accent and pronunciation of the
language on the rest of the page, which can make the phrase unintelligible.
Identifying changes in language will also allow a tool to ask for automatic
translations of that content. When editing content, authoring tools can
switch between appropriate spelling dictionaries.

 


Benefits of Guideline 3.2 (Informative) 


*Defining key terms and specialized language will help people who are
not familiar with the topic.
*Providing the expansion of abbreviations and acronyms not only helps
people who are not familiar with the abbreviation or acronym but can clarify
which meaning of an abbreviation or acronym is appropriate to use.
