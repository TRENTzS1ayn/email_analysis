Kerstin, what kinds of results are you getting when you try to run this
table through accessibility checkers? (And which one(s) have you tried?)
I just tried it on the WAVE (wave.webaim.org) and it seemed not to know
what to do with the <tfoot>, though I believe JAWS read it in the
correct order-- i.e. at the bottom of the table.

Hi, folks.

What can be done with the following table that uses TFOOT to pass
accessibility checkers - what sort of association is required of TFOOT,
and how is it accomplished?  Any insight would be great.

Thanks.


<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">
<HTML lang="EN">
<HEAD><TITLE>TFOOT with no HEADERS</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY><A name=top></A>

<table border=1
       summary="table with IDs and HEADERS and TFOOT">
<THEAD>
<tr>

 <th id="t1head2">table 1 header 2</th>
 <th id="t1head3">table 1 header 3</th>

<TFOOT>

 <td headers="t1head2">table 1 data r3 c3</td>

</TBODY>
</table>
