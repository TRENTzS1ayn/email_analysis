MessageJohn,
Tfoot is optional and in that example as well as in the  current one,  it has been correctly used. So what violation did you expect  the eval tool to identify?
Please see attached file. It has a 
complex table   from HTML techniques page. I have  added headers and id to this table and it also has a footers section. I have added id to the footers section and referenced them in cells in tbody section. They work fine.
WinEyes 4.5: does the best job and announces table section  too as one navigates into it. Reads headers correctly. WinEyes reads all header values  for a cell.
HPR 3.02:  Does not announce table sections but reads headers correctly. Only reads header values as  row/column changes. But messes up reading headers for last line of footers.
JAWS 5.812: Does not announce table sections. If one reads table in linear fashion (without table keys) it reads footers at end. With table nav keys, it reads footers once before body and then at end. Does headers association correctly for cells in body section. But for first row of footers, it reads column headings at top of table. Only reads header values as  row/column changes which is ok.
If one uses headers and id, one must indicate all relevant header cells. HPR and WE do not read column headings that are not in the headers value which one expects them to read normally as one navigates sideways.  But JAWS reads them. For instance if header value does not include   id for meals / hotel/ transport, they are still read. e.g. first line of footers.
Will be useful if JFW and HPR announce change in table section.
Code follows
