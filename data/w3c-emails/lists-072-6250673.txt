Kerstin,
The HTML specs say that tfoot needs tr and td.  Scope can be used in simple tables and is mainly meant for use on td. WinEyes does not support scope.
Tfoot is optional. Your example and mine  I believe are coded correctly. So if your application is generating code along these lines I guess the code is correct. The Oracle eval tool needs to be fixed. Unless the table is a simple and regular table in which cells are associated with headers above or on left of data cells, the only method of robust association for auditory interface is by using headers and id.

  Hi, Sailesh,

  Thanks for a very thorough reply.  I guess the question that still remains is "do TFOOTs require association markup; and if so, is there some simple way to attribute SCOPE to them, without having to add all the ids and headers?"

  John, the tool we are using is our own internal concoction (Oracle Accessibility Checker), and it currently identifies the TFOOTs as being in a data table and lacking some kind of associative markup.  So, we are not only trying to figure out what the accessible HTML would look like for such a table, but also trying to incorporate that into our tool.

  Thanks,
  -Kerstin

    John,
    Tfoot is optional and in that example as well as in the  current one,  it has been correctly used. So what violation did you expect  the eval tool to identify?
    Please see attached file. It has a 
    complex table   from HTML techniques page. I have  added headers and id to this table and it also has a footers section. I have added id to the footers section and referenced them in cells in tbody section. They work fine.
    WinEyes 4.5: does the best job and announces table section  too as one navigates into it. Reads headers correctly. WinEyes reads all header values  for a cell.
    HPR 3.02:  Does not announce table sections but reads headers correctly. Only reads header values as  row/column changes. But messes up reading headers for last line of footers.
    JAWS 5.812: Does not announce table sections. If one reads table in linear fashion (without table keys) it reads footers at end. With table nav keys, it reads footers once before body and then at end. Does headers association correctly for cells in body section. But for first row of footers, it reads column headings at top of table. Only reads header values as  row/column changes which is ok.
    If one uses headers and id, one must indicate all relevant header cells. HPR and WE do not read column headings that are not in the headers value which one expects them to read normally as one navigates sideways.  But JAWS reads them. For instance if header value does not include   id for meals / hotel/ transport, they are still read. e.g. first line of footers.
    Will be useful if JFW and HPR announce change in table section.
    Code follows
