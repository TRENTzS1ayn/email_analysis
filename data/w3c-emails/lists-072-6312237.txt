(Okay...HTML 4.01 Title element specs)
Every HTML document must have a TITLE element in the HEAD section.
( <title>A web page</title> so far I'm using the element according to spec. But wait, there's more...)
Authors should use the TITLE element to identify the contents of a document. Since users often consult documents out of context, authors should provide context-rich titles. Thus, instead of a title such as "Introduction", which doesn't provide much contextual background, authors should supply a title such as "Introduction to Medieval Bee-Keeping" instead.
...
( Okay time to revise. <title>A new page on David's site.</title> Yes, HTML 4.01 spec compliant and being so, Guideline 4.1 met!) 
Might there be a need to expand on what the title element specs are in HTML 4.01 and Guideline 4.1's "use technologies according to spec." to improve access. 
Expanding on "Authors should use the TITLE element to identify the contents of a document" to perhaps identify that when you publish a report from hard copy to html, one success criteria might be to ask the question...Are the titles the same? If they are not, why not?
Also, "context-rich titles" is extremely subjective.

Cheers,
David Donovan

I disagree with "The title element: 2.4.1.x - need to create a success 
criterion"
Guideline 4.1 says, "use technologies according to spec."  "title" is a 
required element in HTML 4.01 [1], thus html:title must be used and is 
covered by success criterion/guideline 4.1.

Thank you,
