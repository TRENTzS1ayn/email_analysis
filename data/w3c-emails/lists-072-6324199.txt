(not related to David's question):
I should clarify that in my previous message I was disagreeing that we need 
to write a new success criterion and that I believe Guideline 4.1 is 
sufficient.

(responding to David)...

Could you explain why this should be a success criterion? I think this is 
too specific for a success criterion and propose that we generalize the 
idea and expand on it in Techniques.  In other words, we can provide 
examples and general guidance about writing good titles.  Publishing a 
report online could be one example.

Yes, "context-rich" is subjective.  We could provide guidance in the HTML 
Techniques document.
