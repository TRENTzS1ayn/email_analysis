Hi all,

Just published a new working draft that reflects issue resolutions and other
decisions made in recent months. Most of the changes made apply to
guidelines 1.6, 1.7, 2.1, 2.2 and the guidelines in principle 4. I've also
updated the change history and mapping documents (links below).

There's still lots to clean up before we'll be ready to go to TR in early
March, but this seems like a good start. Thanks to everyone who took the
time to review open issues and submit proposals related to these guidelines.


Also, in an effort to make it a bit easier to review open issues related to
each guideline in the future, I've included a link that follows the success
criteria for each guideline pointing to pages that list open issues for that
guideline. The complete list of available WCAG Bugzilla issue reports is
available at <http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/issuereports/>.
