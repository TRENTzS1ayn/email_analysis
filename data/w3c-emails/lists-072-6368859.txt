With Juicy Studio i've implemented a test for analyze CSS for:
- CSS Validator Conformance
- Colour Contrast Algorithm
- Validate against absolute units of measurement

Please test it at:
http://www.juicystudio.com/permarchive.asp?pageInfo=193

and if there are some suggestion we can implement them. The service is
free and could be a good support for validation.
