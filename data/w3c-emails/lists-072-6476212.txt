If you mix up togheter jpeg and gif images in a css layout sometimes you
need to use px in the layout in order to achieve an acceptable result. In
sec. 508, i.e., pixel are not considered harmful for layout. Furthermore, in
the wcag 1.0, px are relative units. So there's a potential ambiguity with
the techniques.
Are the techniques normative or only consultive? Are the technique right or
wrong? pixel for font cause only IE/win not to resize text. This is bad, but
it depends on user agent. In the past someone in the wcag-wg said that a
user agent problem should not be of our interest... ;-)
Pixel in the layout width are bad only if they prevent the text to be
resized in a good way.

Pixel in the margin and padding are no bad at all in most cases.

I think a better technique or a clarifying is needed...
