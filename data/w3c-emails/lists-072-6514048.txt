I think Yvette's right; as Joe Clark has pointed out (often) in the
past, the fact that IE won't allow users to enlarge fonts specified in
px is primarily a user agent  problem, though for the time being it has
implications for content.  So the Techniques documents should
acknowledge the problem and encourage use of relative sizes, while the
user agent issue should be addressed as well.

But is a resolution for which the page was not designed an accessibility
problem? I don't think so, it's just bad design with some usability
problems. If you want to ban bad design, you've got your work cut out
for you... 

Also, in your example, setting the width using relative units (for
example
15em) doesn't eliminate the problem as em is not relative to the
resolution. People with small resolutions will get a horizontal
scrollbar with a 15em width just as easily as if you specify a 750px
width.

I agree with Jens, only some absolute units cause accessibility
problems. The most important case being the font size. But even for
that, I think it's as much a user agent problem as it is a web content
problem. I think we should encourage content creators to use relative
units for font size, but WAI should also stimulate user agent creators
to favor the user preference over the font size specified by the page.
In other words, even on a page that says 10px for font size, my browser
should enlarge the text if I set my font size preferences to larger.
