I like the idea of including the browser-functionality information, but
as part of the goad to "realism" shall we also include figures on market
share? (Last time I checked, Opera had less than 1% of the browser
market; Netscape had just over 3%).

Perhaps this issue will be addressed in part by an approach we are
taking in the techniques, which is, for each technique, we log the user
agents for which there is a known problem the technique addresses. So we
could create a technique that says, in effect, "If your target browser
includes IE, the author must use relative font sizes. If your target
browser is only Opera, the author can use absolute sizes and still be
assured that the page will be WCAG-compliant for the user." It is of
course the author's responsibility to be realistic about the browsers
used by their audience and not try to use this browser profiling as a
way to wriggle out of the techniques, but a level of good faith in
implementors of our guidelines must be presumed at some point. It is
also of course probable that the set of browsers out there will be
larger than the set of browsers we have tested and aligned with our
techniques, but all we can do is our best at getting a good cross
section, and the techniques are easily updated if we become aware of a
browser with its own issues.
