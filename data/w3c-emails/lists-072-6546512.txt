I like the idea of including the browser-functionality information, but
as part of the goad to "realism" shall we also include figures on market
share? (Last time I checked, Opera had less than 1% of the browser
market; Netscape had just over 3%).

Roberto:
If we follow market, we need to suggest use of Flash (over 90%) instead
of SVG (less than 10%) :)
