Personally, I utterly dislike the idea of tuning your website to the
browsers you expect your audience uses. That's just one step away from only
supporting the market leader (read: Internet Explorer), a practice which can
be very bad for accessibility. If we encourage authors to write only for
browsers they expect, many of them will not take speech browsers and other
assistive technologies into consideration. 

To me, one of the key elements of web accessibility is that you acknowledge
you cannot know which user will visit your site, and you create your website
to be flexible and robust to meet the user's need.
