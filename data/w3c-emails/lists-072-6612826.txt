One point of clarification: if you have to use a screen reader and you
use Windows, then you pretty much have to use Internet Explorer.  This
is not because of any inherent superiority in IE, but because none of
the screen readers support Netscape Navigator, Mozilla, Opera, or even
Lynx.  At least this was true about a year ago when I queried Freedom
Scientific, GW-Micro, and Dolphin.  Whether or not that's as it *should*
be isn't the point-- there *should* be more  choice. But there isn't.

"Must"? *"Must"*?!

Just give us an alternate stylesheet and an accessible way to select it.
Or ask people to grow up and use a better browser. Newsflash: Even if
you must or simply wish to use Windows, you have a wide range of
improved browsers at your disposal.

There *is* no public Web page for which IE *on Windows* (always make
that
clarfication) is not a "target." This is a really genteel and
nicely-polished way of keeping the same broken WCAG 1.0 requirement.

Oh, now who the hell targets for *only* Opera? Some authors customize
for MOSe browsers (Mozilla/Opera/Safari Enhancement,
<http://www.mezzoblue.com/archives/2003/06/25/mose/>), but I have simply
never heard of anyone writing an entire site only for Opera. There are a
few features people put in that only Opera gets right, but people do
that with Safari, too. (Like me.)

WCAG WG continues to pretend that the concept of progressive enhancement
does not exist and is not already being followed by designers. I would
suggest Googling it; I have a large folder of bookmarks on that topic I
can wrangle later.

WCAG WG is telling authors to be realistic? We'll start when you start.

Easily updated? You people can't get past the issue of abbreviations and
acronyms.
