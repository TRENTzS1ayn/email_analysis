I don't know about assistive technologies, but there are practical
considerations regarding the use and position of the DOCTYPE in normal
browsers that distinguish between quirks and standards mode.  For
explanations, see a section in our draft tutorial at
http://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/tutorial-char-enc.html#serving

Note how Internet Explorer requires nothing to appear before the DOCTYPE for
standards mode to kick in.  This is a problem for people putting out XHTML
as text/html. (The following section describes some alternatives).
