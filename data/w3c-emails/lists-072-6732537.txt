I'd like to propose a change to my proposed wording for the guideline
itself.
 
3.4 Organize page content in a consistent manner and make interactive
components act
in predictable ways.
 
[This replaces the wording proposed in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2004JanMar/0302.html
3.4 Use layouts that are consistent and make interactive components act
in predictable ways.]
 
Rationale for the proposed change: I believe tehg uideline should
address page-level organization rather than visual layout.  Layout is a
way of making organization visible (as well as a way of imposing
organization), but the guideline should be capable of addressing the
challenge of making organization availble to auditory and tactile
experience.
