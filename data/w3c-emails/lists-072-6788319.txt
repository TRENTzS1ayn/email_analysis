  SP: - consistency is across pages and using  "Page content" may be confusing. Also it may not be consistent throughout a site but across specific sections  or applications.  This should be recognized.
  - "Predictable ways" too can be termed ambiguous. Predictable by whom? 
  - "layout" is an important term  here and is necessary to be mentioned in the context of organizing content.
  - consistency applies to use of interactive components also, right?
  So here is a proposal:
  Rewording for the guideline 3.4:
  How about
  - Use a consistent layout for organizing content across the site / its specific sections
    - Ensure that interactive components behave consistently and in a manner  defined for the component.

  Thanks,
