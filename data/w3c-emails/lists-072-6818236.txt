I already bought my ticket based on dates we've discussed.  But, my trip
cannot be approved by my employer until I receive a formal notification from
WAI - I assume that's coming based on prior information.  I will be out of
town until I see you all in LA as of this coming Monday.  If I have no
internet access (which may be the case) in the next few weeks, can someone
else from my office check my e-mail and sign up for me?
