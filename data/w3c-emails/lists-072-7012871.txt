In order to facilitate review as we prepare for TR I have put together a
proposed edit of 1.3 incorporating comments from Yvette's analysis and our
discussions. 

this one basically is an cleaned up form of the last working draft with the
following item regarding text over background images removed (since it
belongs in 1.6)

text is not presented over a background image or pattern, or if a background
image or pattern is present the the text is easily readable when the page is
viewed in black and white. [Issue #605] [Y] 

Note SC 1c has been expanded to make it clearer that "quotation' markup etc
would be covered there.

Some additional notes on 1.3 to follow.

Guideline 1.3  Ensure that information, functionality, and structure are
separable from presentation.


Level 1 Success Criteria for Guideline 1.3


1.the following can be derived programmatically (for example, through
a markup or data model) from the content without requiring user
interpretation of presentation. 

a.hierarchical elements and relationships, such as:,

*paragraphs
*lists 
*headings 
*associations between table cells and their headers 

b.non-hierarchical relationships between elements such as:

*cross-references and linkages,
*associations between labels and controls,

c.emphasis or special treatment of specific words, phrases, quotes,
etc.

2. any information presented through color is also available without
color (for example through context or markup or coding that does not depend
on color). [Issue #317
<http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=317> ] [X]


Level 2 Success Criteria for Guideline 1.3 


1.information presented using color is also available without color
and without having to interpret markup (for example through context or text
coding). [Issue #317
<http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=317> ] [Y] 


Level 3 Success Criteria for Guideline 1.3

Who Benefits from Guideline 1.3 (Informative) 


*Separating content and structure from presentation allows Web pages
to be presented differently to meet the needs and constraints of different
users without losing any of the information or structure. For example,
information can be presented via speech or braille (text) that was
originally intended to be presented visually.
*It can also facilitate automatic emphasis of structure or more
efficient navigation.
*All of these can benefit people with cognitive, physical, hearing,
and visual disabilities.


Examples of Guideline 1.3 (Informative) 


*Example 1: a multi-column document. 

A document is marked up with headings, paragraphs and other structural
features. It is presented visually in three columns. The markup that creates
the columns is separate from the markup that specifies the logical structure
of the document.

*Example 2: a scrolling list of stock prices. 

Current stock quotes are scrolled horizontally across the screen. The data
are separate from the methods used to scroll the text across the page.

*Example 3: a 3-dimensional site map. 

A custom user interface renders 3D visualizations of the pages on a site and
how they relate to one another from a data source. Any hierarchical
relationships, groupings, cross-references, etc. would originate in the data
source so that alternate interfaces could be rendered (from the same source)
that expose the structure of the site in an accessible form. (See also
guideline
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-20040214.html#technology-supports
-access#technology-supports-access>  4.3)

*Example 4: a list that allows users to sort information on a page
according to preference. 

A server side script allows a user to rearrange a categorical listing of
music files by date, artist, genre, or file size. The server side script
updates both the structure and the presentation accordingly when generating
alternate views.
