This isn't much better. WCAG WG needs to understand what it's trying to
accomplish here, apart from issuing a mishmash of contradictory
requirements. What *are* you trying to accomplish? What Web sites can you
point to that are presently available that would pass or fail the
criteria?

Black-and-white viewing is irrelevant except to achromats (0.03% of the
population). I have explained at length that stylesheet-switching is the
correct method of accommodation here, but it continues to be ignored. If
an approved person said it, would the Working Group take it seriously?

Paragraphs aren't a hierarchy. They are really the heart of any document.
You don't have paragraphs <p> and subparagraphs <subp> and superparagraphs
<supp>.

As ever, the Working Group's solution to a problem is to add more
syllables: audio description --> auditory description and link -->
linkage.

How are cross-references accomplished *except* through the <a> element,
that is, through *links*?

What is the exhaustive list of the manifestations of "special treatment"?

Delete. If you applied this elsewhere, you could say that Level 1 success
for language identification is to embed it in the HTML, while Level 2
success is simply to add the words "This page is written in English" to
any English-language page.

Could propoonents of this apparently-ill-thought-out clause point to five
sites in the real world that use it? Note: Sites at the domain w3.org
aren't eligible.

> Who Benefits from Guideline 1.3 (Informative)

I thought we were being technology-neutral. How about Web applications,
Flash presentations, PDFs?

Explain how a deaf person benefits from this. Or a mobility-impaired
person, for that matter.

Could Working Group members provide a working example of multicolumn
markup?

A scrolling list would be a violation of other WCAG provisions.

At least you didn't use the word "fisheye." Five examples of these from
the real world, please? (In this case it might be redundant to state that
w3.org-hosted sites are excluded.)

We're supposed to be deprecating server-side scripts.

You're not getting any better at these. And you're already talking about
moving toward TR. I rather think not.
