Hi all,


I want to emphasize the importance of an appropriate WAI statement related
to language definition again (although there already is a request by Ben
Caldwell [1]), since the WCAG still say

    'If you use a number of different languages on a page, make sure
    that any changes in language are clearly identified by using the
    lang attribute.' [2]

This makes it impossible to 'validate' a document against these guidelines
when it's XHTML 1.1 compliant, since XHTML 1.1 clearly imposes

    'On every element, the lang attribute has been removed in favor
    of the xml:lang attribute (as defined in [XHTMLMOD]).' [3]

consequently throwing an error if you use the 'lang' attribute. Due to the
increasing amount of XHTML 1.1 documents it seems absolutely necessary to
adapt the guidelines, not only to demonstrate the technical sensitiveness ;)


All the best,
 Jens.
