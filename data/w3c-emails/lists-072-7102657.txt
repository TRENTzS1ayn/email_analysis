Note that credit for this suggestion goes to Richard Ishida. I just happened

Agreed. We'll need to generalize the task, removing references to the use of
the lang attribute. One of the things on our to-do list for HTML Techniques
includes identifying the specification to which each example corresponds and
adding a number of additional examples. Current examples in this technique
would apply to HTML 4.01 and we'll need to add some additional examples for
XHTML 1.1 as you describe.

Would you be interested in taking an action item to write an XHTML example
for this technique and make some suggestions about how to update the text?

Thanks,

-Ben
