DISCUSSION

Discussion of the agenda for the Face to Face meeting 4-5 March 2004. We
identified a number of groups with whom we would like to coordinate, and
have also been invited by some groups to participate in their own meetings.
We need to work on various techniques documents, and need to work on
testing.

We discussed the WCAG 1.0 Errata. There are a number of things that need to
be tested. It seems best to start with a test matrix of what to test, in
what user agents, etc. We will discuss that more at the next meeting.

We reviewed Tim Boland's CSS proposals [1], [2], [3], [4]. We accepted #725
and #725, are still working on #727, and decided to take up Dave Shea's
offer of assistance [5] on #728.
