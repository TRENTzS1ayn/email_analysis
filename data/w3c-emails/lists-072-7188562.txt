Insulting, abusing, and bullying people isn't a useful contribution to
technical discussion. It is effective in ensuring that some people who are
not as expert as you in "pissing contests" (explanation of the term at the
end of the message) will withdraw from the discussion, thereby allowing the
bully to play big fish in the pond they are shrinking.

No, I don't think he advocates being nicey-nice. I read his suggestion as
avoiding gratuitous insults, because their effect is detrimental to good
technical discussion. I am not blameless in this respect, and nor is Kynn.
However, making an effort in this direction has been valuable in attracting
and maintaing input from a large number of technical experts, something which
I see happening less and less in this group where the need is in fact very
great because of the wide range of its scope.

just my 2 cents as a person.
