In looking at the guidelines, we have the first principle listed as "Content
must be perceivable".

 

However the second principle is:

 

1.Operable.  Ensure that the interface elements in the content are
operable by any user. 

 

Items 3 and 4 then also have long texts like this. 

 

I suggest that these be made consistent in form.  I suggest that we try the
following.

 

1.Content must be perceivable.
2.Interface elements in the content must be operable.
3.Content and controls must be understandable.
4.Content should be robust enough to work with current and future
technologies.

 

Within these sentences we might bold and/or italicize the words perceivable,
operable, understandable, and robust.  

 

Remember that these are no longer the guidelines; these are basic principles
for web being accessible and usable.  These principles apply to all users
and in these guidelines we go on to explain that these guidelines ensure
that these universal statements are true for people with disabilities (or at
least as many people with disabilities as possible). 

 

We need to make them consistent and I think it's better to make them short
and clear rather than using the longer version we currently have, which are
currently worded as directives rather than principles.
