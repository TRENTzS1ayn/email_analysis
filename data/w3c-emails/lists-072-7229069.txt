I suggest that for the next TR we put all the normative parts in a box and
leave the non-normative as plain floating text.    It makes it a lot easier
to see the 'testable' rules and keep them separate from the informative
text.   It also makes the document seem a lot smaller since one can more
easily jump over the non-normative information.
