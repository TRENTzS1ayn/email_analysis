In looking over the Web Content Guidelines I noticed a few things we should
probably touch up in the front end as we get ready for TR.  Three short
editorial ones are included in this email and another more major editorial
is suggested in a separate email.

 

1.UPDATE THE NUMBER OF GUIDELINES

In the introduction section we described the top layer.  Item 3 in the list
of 5 gives the number of guidelines.  We should make sure this agrees with
the number in the final document. 

 

2.ADDED NOTE REGARDING NORMATIVENESS OF CHECKLISTS

In the introduction that talks about technology specific checklists, there
is an editorial note which reads:

 

Editorial Note:  These checklists do not yet exist.  At the present time,
the checklists are expected to be non-normative though no formal decision
has been made.

 

I think we should change this sentence to:". 

 

Editorial Note:  These checklists do not yet exist.  At the present time, it
is not clear if the checklists will be normative or non-normative.  It would
be nice to be able to change them over time (non-normative) but that may
defeat their purpose and make testable conformance change over time.   It
may therefore be necessary for them to be normative in order for the
guidelines to be testable. 

 

Since this is a possibility I think it would be good to make it clear that
it is a possibility, although again we have not made any decision yet. 

 

3.DEFINITION OF TESTABLE IN CONFORMANCE SECTION

In the conformance section we describe the different levels and we say that
one of the criterion is that they "are testable (machine or reliably
human)".

 

Reliably human is not very clear.  I suggest we change this to

 "are testable (by machine or by humans with high consistency)".

 

I would like to say high inter-rater reliability, but that is probably too
technical for anyone to understand.
