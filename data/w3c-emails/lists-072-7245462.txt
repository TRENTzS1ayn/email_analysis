Jenae and I have been working on a test matrix - the list of platforms, 
user agents, and assistive technologies we want to collect test data for 
(she'll be sending a draft of the test matrix in the next day or two).  We 
also came up with a list of test cases for the WCAG 1.0 Checkpoints with 
"until user agents" clauses and mapped those to existing HTML Techniques 
for WCAG 2.0 as well as test cases in the UAAG 1.0 test suite and the HTML 
test suite.  Attached is a table of WCAG 1.0 Checkpoints with until user 
agents clauses and the matching HTML Techniques for WCAG 2.0, UAAG 1.0 test 
cases, and HTML test cases.  This is a draft and we offer it for discussion.
