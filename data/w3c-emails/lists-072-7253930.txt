In an attempt to get the guildelines cleaned up enough that we can publish
them to TR Ben and I have gone through all the guidelines that haven't been
cleaned up and took a pass at cleaning them up enough to post.  

 

These are NOT final - and need work.    Our cleanup suggestions are also not
final - but meant to get us far enough to have something by Friday.    So we
can have the whole group review it for a week before it gets sent to TR on
March 8th or 9th . 

 

Here is one of them. 

 

Give these a careful look so we can fix anything that should be fixed on
Thursday's call.

Guideline 1.2 Cleanup

 

This guideline still needs a lot of discussion, so we aren't going to be
able to close all of the points on it.  What we can do is to clean it up
enough that we can post it to TR along with a list of issues.

 

We propose the following as a cleanup.  We will start by first saying what
was done and then post a clean copy at the end. 

 

1.RE:  editorial note at the front.    We suggest  that we pull the
editorial note from level two success criteria and add it to the editorial
note at the front of 1.2    The text that would be added to the editorial
note at the front of the guideline is 

"This guideline is scheduled for major cleanup, but could not be completed
in time for this TR release.  There is also discussion about."

2.Success criteria number 2 had an editorial note calling for a
definition of the term "time dependent"  which we now have.  Editorial note
is therefore dropped. 
3.Success criteria number 2 and 3 both had a long exception which was
identical.  The exception on editorial on number 2 was dropped and the one
after 3 bears a note that the exception applies to success criteria 2 and 3.


1.The plain language version of the exception was adopted with a
slight edit to make it slightly easier to read. 

4.The plain language version of the text for success criteria 4, 5,
and 6 as well as their exceptions were adopted. 
5.In level 2 success criteria number 1, we introduced the term "live"
as in "live" broadcast.  This was changed to "real time" to be consistent
with the rest of the document. 
6.Success criteria number 1 in level 3 was removed and sent to the
Gateway document because it cannot be objectively measured.  The original
language read "the presentation does not require the user to read captions
and the visual presentation simultaneously in order to understand the
content. 

-         This is not testable because of the phrase "understand the
content".  

-         The plain language version removed that, but in the process ended
up saying that people should not have to see the picture and read the
captions at the same time.   That will sound like nonsense to someone who
doesn't understand what is being implied.   Thus, this item is better suited
as a warning or a problem in the gateway doc  than as a checkpoint.

7.Nothing was done to the informative sections. 

 

The resulting text for 1.2 is shown below. 

 

 


Guideline 1.2 Provide synchronized media equivalents for time-dependent
presentations.


Level 1 Success Criteria for Guideline 1.2


Editorial Note: This guideline is scheduled for major cleanup, but could not
be completed in time for this TR release. There is discussion about moving
some of the current success criteria from Level 1 to Level 2. The issue
stems from trying to apply the success criteria to every Webcam, newscast,
and home broadcast. Another approach is to allow a conformance claim to
state, for example, "All pages and applications on this site meet the Level
1 guidelines of WCAG 2.0 except the Web cam at http://example.org/webcam/."

1.an
<file:///C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\Caldwell\Local%20Settings\Temp\tmp003
4.html#audiodescdef#audiodescdef> audio description of visual events is
provided for audio-visual media. [I] 
2.
<file:///C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\Caldwell\Local%20Settings\Temp\tmp003
4.html#captionsdef#captionsdef> captions are provided for all significant
dialogue and sounds in
<file:///C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\Caldwell\Local%20Settings\Temp\tmp003
4.html#time-dep-presentdef#time-dep-presentdef> time-dependent material. [I]

3.descriptions and captions are synchronized with the events they
represent. [I] 

A text transcript or other non-audio equivalent does not need to be
synchronized with the multimedia presentation if all four of the following
statements are true:

a.the content is real-time and
b.the content is audio-only and
c.the content is not time-sensitive and
d.the content is not interactive

Note: 

This exception applies to both success criteria 2 and 3 above.

4.if the Web content is
<file:///C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\Caldwell\Local%20Settings\Temp\tmp003
4.html#real-time-eventsdef#real-time-eventsdef> real-time video with audio,
real-time captions are provided. [I] 

If the content is a music program that is primarily non-vocal, then captions
are not required.

5.if the Web content is real-time, non-interactive video (for example,
a Webcam view of surrounding conditions such as weather information), then
one of the following is provided: [I] 

*an equivalent that conforms to Guideline
<file:///C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\Caldwell\Local%20Settings\Temp\tmp003
4.html#text-equiv#text-equiv>  1.1 (for example, an ongoing text report of
weather conditions)
*a link to an equivalent that conforms to Guideline
<file:///C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\Caldwell\Local%20Settings\Temp\tmp003
4.html#text-equiv#text-equiv>  1.1 (for example, a link to a weather Web
site that conforms to Guideline 1.1)

5.if a presentation that contains only audio or only video requires
users to respond interactively at specific times during the presentation,
then a synchronized equivalent presentation (audio, visual or text) is
provided. [I] 

If content that is rebroadcast from another medium or resource meets
accessibility requirements for that medium, then the rebroadcast satisfies
this checkpoint if it complies with other applicable sections of WCAG 2.0


Level 2 Success Criteria for Guideline 1.2 


1.synchronized captions and audio descriptions are provided for all
real-time broadcasts. [I] 


Level 3 Success Criteria for Guideline 1.2 


1.No level 3 criteria for this guideline.

1.2 (media-equiv) Issues 


Who Benefits from Guideline 1.2 (Informative) 


*People who are deaf or have a hearing loss can access the auditory
information through captions.
*People who are blind or have low vision as well as those with
cognitive disabilities who have difficulty interpreting visually what is
happening benefit from audio descriptions of visual information.

People without disabilities also benefit from
<file:///C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\Caldwell\Local%20Settings\Temp\tmp003
4.html#media-equivdef#media-equivdef> media equivalents:

*People in noisy environments or with muted sound often rely on
captions.
*Captions help many people to develop language and reading skills.
*Audio descriptions provide visual information for people who are
temporarily looking away from the video presentation, for example, when
following an instructional video and looking at their hands.
*Captions and text descriptions make it possible to index and search
media files.

Note: 

 
<file:///C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\Caldwell\Local%20Settings\Temp\tmp003
4.html#time-dep-presentdef#time-dep-presentdef> Time-dependent presentations
that require people to use a single sense to follow two or more things at
the same time may present significant barriers to some users. Depending on
the nature of the presentation, it may be possible to avoid scenarios where,
for example, a deaf user would be required to watch an action on the screen
and read the captions at the same time. However, this may not be available
for live broadcasts (e.g. a football game). Where possible (especially for
education and training materials), provide content so that it does not
require tracking multiple simultaneous events with the same sense, or, give
the user the ability to freeze the video so that captions can be read
without missing the video.


Examples of Guideline 1.2 (Informative) 


*Example 1: a movie clip with audio description and captions. 

A clip from a movie is published on a Web site. In the clip, a child is
trying to attract a puppy to the child's bedroom by laying a trail of crumbs
since the soundtrack includes only the child's mumbling. The audio
description that is heard when the child stops mumbling says "Charlie puts a
crumb on each stair leading to his room." The caption that appears as he
mumbles reads, "[inaudible mumbling]."

*Example 2: a video clip of a news story. 

A video clip accompanies a news story about flooding in a major city. The
reporter gives a verbal description of the scene. No audio description is
necessary. The captions display what the reporter is saying.

*Example 3: a silent animation. 

An animation shows a pantomime with a white face and black costume climbing
an invisible ladder. There is no audio track for this animation. No captions
or audio description are required. Instead, a text label and description are
provided as required by guideline
