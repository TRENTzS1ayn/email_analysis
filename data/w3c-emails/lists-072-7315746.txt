Hi all

 

 We have a really big teleconf call coming up this week.   

 

Time: 2100 UTC (4 PM US Eastern, 10 PM France, 8 AM Friday Eastern
Australia) 

Number:  +1-617-761-6200, passcode 9224 

irc.w3.org 6665, channel #wai-wcag

 

 

If we want to have a TR draft out before CSUN  (and we NEED to)

And we want to be able to have a week to look at the draft ourselves before
we post it (which we also need to do)

Then we have to finish up all the edit approvals this Thursday.

 

And we have a lot of them to do - or we have to roll back all the
suggestions and rewordings etc till we have a clean doc - which is a ways
back.  

 

Fortunately we have had a lot of discussion and suggestions - and Ben and I
did clean up proposals on the last 3 that didn't get covered.  

 

In order for us to clear all this though - we are going to all have to read
through the proposals BEFORE THE MEETING.   Then we can just make edits and
notations at the meetings based on what people find - rather than walking
through the documents line by line on the call.  

 

So here is the agenda - immediately after the procedure we will be using
this week.  

 


PROCEDURE


      Since we have so much to do - here is the procedure we worked out to
tackle this this week. 

1)     Everyone read the proposals in advance of the meeting.  This is a lot
of work but much less than the people who put them all together.

2)     Send any comments, issues, and (PLEASE!) suggestions to the list

3)     At 3 pm EASTERN (one hour before the call) we will pull the items
from the list and compile them.

4)     At the meeting we will try to work as quickly as possible to identify
all the items that are all "good enough to out as a working draft" and get
them approved and off the table.

5)     Then we will tackle all the items that had postings against them that
require discussion.  The discussions will be time limited - based on how
many items we have and how much time there is.  

a.      The first goal will be to try to find wording to solve the problem.


b.      If this can be done quickly - then we will find words to express the
problem and put that in the document instead.  Then move on

6)     If we get stuck and cannot do a) or b) quickly - we will put the item
on a list (sometimes called a bone yard - don't know why) to come back to
later in meeting.  

7)     We WILL get through. We have to.  But we can only do this if people
READ and SEND COMMENTS in ADVANCE.  Issues raised at the meeting will be
noted and handled at end of meeting.

 

Please read everything in advance

Please send in your comments before 3 eastern on Thursday

Pease make suggestions for fixing issues you identify. 

 

Remember the goal is not to get this perfect.  The goal is to get a document
that is clean enough that we can send it out for public review to get their
input as well.   That means clean up what we can and make notations where we
know we have problems or things to work out.

 

We are behind schedule and we've pushed ourselves up against the wall. But
we can do it. 

 

The links for the items are below - as is the link for the Feb 14th draft -
that the comments proposals are applied against. 

 


AGENDA 


1)     Items that no one has concern about  (if any).  

a.      Find out what we have consensus on and get them off our plate

b.      {see list of items to cover - immediately below}

2)     What do we want the principles to be (they are now inconsistent)

        http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2004JanMar/0361.html 

3)     Are we happy with the combination of 1.4, 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3  into one
guideline
    (just yes - no question first)

 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2004JanMar/0340.html 

4)     If yes - then are there any changes to be made to 3.1 (that we didn't
get to last week)

[Same link as above]

5)     Next are discussions on those items that people sent in discussion
points on.  

a.      {see list of items to cover - immediately below}

b.      The items will be compiled from comments sent in up to 3pm eastern
Thursday

6)     Guideline 3.2  - handling last since we don't have a proposal yet -
and this one looks like a really tough one.

7)     Any other Questions - and items on the 'bone yard' list from today's
discussion.
