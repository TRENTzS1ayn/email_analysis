Well, a quite reasonable argumentation. Is this also recommended for other
media, e.g. when I print these documents? -- Another problem I see here is if
there are many abbrevations on a page, ain't it regarded rather irritating
for impaired users (since they might be confused by many expanded short forms)?
Wouldn't it be a 'discharge' for them to pass on redundant explanations?


Best regards,
 Jens.
