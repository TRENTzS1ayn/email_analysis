In my personal opinion, I would advise against using the techniques you
described in your original question (using CSS content-attributes to include
the title in parentheses after the abbreviation). To me this falls in the
same category as inserting the alt-text as content before an image in
auditory stylesheets. That is functionality for a user agent, not an author.


If you just specify the meaning of an abbreviation using the HTML
ABBR-syntax, different user agents can decide differently how to handle
them. Your method might actually cause annoying doubling of content, for
example if the user agent decides to read aloud the title, which is then
followed by the title in parentheses that you added through CSS. 

In the ideal world, future user agents can even have a user preference that
specifies how to handle abbreviations, or even how to handle repeated
abbreviations. If WCAG 2 will be around as long as WCAG 1, we might actually
see some of that before WCAG 3 exists.
