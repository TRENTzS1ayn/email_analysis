Aha! I apologize, I didn't realize you would only use this for certain
media. I can't see any objections to using this technique for print and
agree with you that for print it would be ok to just include one explanation
per document. But since WCAG advises to explain the meaning of every
abbreviation, this won't work because you can't select the first occurrence
of an abbreviation from CSS (yet).
