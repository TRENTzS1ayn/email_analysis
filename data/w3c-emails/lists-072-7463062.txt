of course, since it would be really annoying encountering hundred
explanations of the same abbreviation ;)

Yes, only with ugly wrenches, e.g. via

    abbr[title='World Wide Web Consortium']:first-child:after,
    abbr[title='Web Accessibility Initiative']:first-child:after { }

I think about bringing in a proposal to solve this problem, if there ain't
any.


Best regards,
 Jens.
