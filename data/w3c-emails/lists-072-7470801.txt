Mapping of "HTML Techniques for WCAG 1.0" to "HTML Techniques for WCAG 2.0"


Prepared by David MacDonald of E-Ramp Inc.


Preliminary summary of differences


*HTML techniques 2.0 introduces the subject of emoticons
*2.0 does not address color contrast as per version 1.0 paragraph 7.5
*2.0 does not address freezing moving images (GIFs) as per version
1.0 paragraph 7.6
*2.0 introduces the idea of providing long descriptions directly into
documents near the image (under some circumstances) (version 2.0 paragraph
10.7)
*2.0 doesn't have a specific paragraph that maps to version 1.0
paragraph 8.2 "directly accessible applets", but version 2.0 does address it
in general in paragraph 12
*Version 1.0 seems to have an orphan title 9.1 "Audio Info," nothing
in the document appears to address audio even though there is a title.
Version 2.0 doesn't have this heading.
*Version 2.0 doesn't have a heading called "Audio and Video" as per
version 1.0 paragraph 9
*Version 2.0 paragraph 13.2 "Describing frame relationships" is
deprecated dropping version 1.0 paragraph 10.2
*Version 1.0 paragraph 10.6.1 "Describing frames in relative units"
is not present in version 2.0
*D Links have been deprecated in version 2.0 (Paragraph 10.6) they
were in version 1.0 paragraph 7.2.1
*Accesskey has several editorial notes in 2.0 and is under
investigation
*Version 2.0 paragraph 6.2 has amended the use of images for bullets
(WCAG 1.0 paragraph 4.11 is deprecated). Now images for bullets are only
allowed if accessed via CSS (which allows fallbacks bulltet types).
*Version 2.0 introduces a "null summary" for layout tables (not
present in version 1.0 paragraph 5.2)
*Version 2.0 introduces tabindex as a future technique to skip over
groups (paragraph 9.5)
*Version 2.0 has a typo an empty bullet in paragraph 10.1
*Version 2.0 introduces paragraph 10.2 which says "Do not use the
title attribute on images."
*Version 2.0 paragraph 13.5 is appears a little ambiguous, but
appears to map to 10.2
*Version 2.0 does not deal with the issue of "ambiguous and/or
meaningless" links such as more <http://www.google.ca>  and click
<http://www.google.ca>  here. (they were moved to the gateway). These issues
are present in version1.0 in the paragraph 6.1 which reads as follows:


6.1 Link text


Checkpoints in this section:

o        13.1 <http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-TECHS/#tech-meaningful-links>
Clearly identify the target of each link. [Priority 2] 

Good link text should not be overly general; don't use "click here." Not
only is this phrase device-dependent (it implies a pointing device) it says
nothing about what is to be found if the link if followed. Instead of "click
here", link text should indicate the nature of the link target, as in "more
information about sea lions" or "text-only version of this page". Note that
for the latter case (and other format- or language-specific documents),
content developers are encouraged to use content
<http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-CORE-TECHS/#content-negotiation>  negotiation
instead, so that users who prefer text versions will have them served
automatically.

In addition to clear link text, content developers may specify a value of
the "title" attribute that clearly and accurately describes the target of
the link.

If more than one link on a page shares the same link text, all those links
should point to the same resource. Such consistency will help page design as
well as accessibility.

If two or more links refer to different targets but share the same link
text, distinguish the links by specifying a different value for the "title
