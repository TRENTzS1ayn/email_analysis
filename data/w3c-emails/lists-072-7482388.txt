For the rewrite of 3.2 (formerly 3.4), I'd like to know whether for all
"host" technologies that create Web resources, there is something that
corresponds to the source documents for static HTML pages.  Another way
to phrase this might be: is there any Web content for which there is
*not* a source document (or component of a source document)?
 
Thanks!
John
