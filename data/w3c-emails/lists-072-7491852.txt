There are some sites that do it from a database and generate pages on the
fly.  In that case there would be a source database..

Subject: Is there a source document for every Web resource?

 

For the rewrite of 3.2 (formerly 3.4), I'd like to know whether for all
"host" technologies that create Web resources, there is something that
corresponds to the source documents for static HTML pages.  Another way to
phrase this might be: is there any Web content for which there is *not* a
source document (or component of a source document)?

 

Thanks!

John
