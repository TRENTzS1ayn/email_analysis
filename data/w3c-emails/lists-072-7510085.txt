After looking at the agenda ? some of you might be getting provision shock.
?
But it isn?t as bad as it looks. ?
?
1) There were no significant edits done (that I know of ) to any of the
informative sections. ?Perhaps a cleanup or two where someone posted
something.?? All the cleanup was to the guidelines and success criteria. ??
?
2) Most of the guidelines only have a small number of success criteria.
????(1.2 is the exception ? but that is basically the same way it was and
has all the old problems. ?We have yet to work on that as a committee).
?
3) Most everything is stuff and proposals that were on the list for some
time ? even the last three guidelines to be posted. ?So you don't have to
grapple with whole new concepts.
?
4) Each one has all the changes listed at the top ? so you can read through
them quickly ? and all the final text at the bottom so you can read it and
see if you like it. ??
?
Give em a read.? You don't have to make extensive notes ? just a bulleted
list of issues and suggestions. ?We can talk on the phone.
?
Remember ? this is NOT a fully fixed draft.?? It is a draft that brings
together all the different wordings that have been proposed ? and the
suggested changes ? so that we have a clean copy of where we are to post to
TR.?? ??There are still a lot of issues and we have lots to do on these.
?
The primary goal here is to 
?
1)???? make sure there isn?t anything in here we don't want
2)???? make sure this give a good idea of where we are
3)???? add notes to let people know where we are not happy with what we have
or where we know we have a problem ? and seek any suggestions 
?
See you then.
