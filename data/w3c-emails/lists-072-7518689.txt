Source database, yes-- but don't the data then flow into a template (or
something) which the user agent then uses to render what the user
reads/interacts with?

There are some sites that do it from a database and generate pages on
the fly.  In that case there would be a source database....

Subject: Is there a source document for every Web resource?

 

For the rewrite of 3.2 (formerly 3.4), I'd like to know whether for all
"host" technologies that create Web resources, there is something that
corresponds to the source documents for static HTML pages.  Another way
to phrase this might be: is there any Web content for which there is
*not* a source document (or component of a source document)?

 

Thanks!

John
