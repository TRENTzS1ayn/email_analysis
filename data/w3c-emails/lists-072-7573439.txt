To:<w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>

Here is another revision of the Guideline now numbered 3.2 (formerly
3.4).  This replaces the proposed rewording sent to the list on 17
February
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2004JanMar/0302.html).
I've tried to take into account concerns raised in the February 19 call.
Those concerns had to do with (1) the HTML-centric concepts of "page"
and "source document," as well as the use of phrases such as "can be
identified by assistive technology" which assume that users of the
document know what AT can do and not do. For the wording of the
Guideline itself, I have again chosen "Organize content" rather than
"Use layout" in an attempt to avoid privileging the visual aspects of
the problem. I've replaced the phrase "can be identified by assistive
technology" with either "structural markup is used" or "can be
identified programmatically" (which also begs definition, as Gregg has
noted).


Begin proposed wording for Guideline 3.4


3.4 Organize content consistently from screen to screen and make
interactive components behave in predictable ways. 


Success criteria for Level 1


1.    Components that are repeated on multiple screens within a resource
or a section of a resource occur in the same sequence each time they are
repeated, for at least one presentation format.

2.    Structural markup is used to group related elements.

3.    Any extreme change of context such as an automatic redirect or a
link that opens a new browser window is implemented in a manner that can
be programmatically identified.

4.    Except for submit buttons, form controls, options within form
controls, and menu items that are part of page content can be selected
without causing submission of the form.


Success criteria for Level 2


1.    Components that appear visually on multiple screens, such as
navigation bars, search forms, and sections within the main content, are
displayed in the same location relative to other content on every screen
where they appear.

2.    Visual layout is used to group related components.

3.    The target of each link is clearly identified.

4.    Link text, including alt text for graphical links, includes words
or phrases that occur in the title element of the destination screen.
[js note: Do we need a criterion about informative page titles here? I
know we discussed one somewhere but I don't remember where.]

5.    Graphical components that appear on multiple screens, including
graphical links, are associated with the same text equivalents wherever
they appear.

6.    Interactive elements that appear on multiple screens, including
graphical elements, are associated with the same functionality wherever
they appear.

7.    Explicit notice is given in advance of any extreme change of
context such as an automatic redirect or a link that opens a new browser
window.

 


Success Criteria for Level 3


1.    When components such as navigation bars and search forms appear on
multiple pages, users can choose to have those elements presented in a
different visual position or reading-order.

2.    There are no extreme changes of context such as automatic
redirects or automatically appearing pop-up windows.


End proposed wording for Guideline 3.4 and Success Criteria for Levels
1-3.


 


Begin current wording and proposals from the February 14 Internal
WOrkign Draft


Guideline 3.4 Use consistent layout and make the behavior of interactive
elements predictable -- OR -- Make layout and behavior of content
consistent and/or

predictable [level 2 guideline]

[end proposed]

[begin current]

 

Layout and behavior of content is consistent or predictable, but not
identical.

[end current]

 

Level 1 Success Criteria for Guideline 3.4

List of 1 items

1. No level 1 success criteria for this guideline

list end

 

Level 2 Success Criteria for Guideline 3.4

List of 3 items (contains 1 nested list)

1. key orientation and navigational elements (such as navigation bars)
are generally found in one or two consistent locations or their
locations are otherwise

predictable. [Y]

 

Editorial Note: NRT (5 Nov 2003): "key", "generally", and "predictable"
are not testable. (

Untestable Success Criteria)

2. where inconsistent or unpredictable responses are essential to the
function of the content (e.g. mystery games, adventure games, tests,
etc.) the user

is warned in advance of encountering them. [Y]

 

Editorial Note: NRT (5 Nov 2003): "inconsistent" and "unpredictable" are
not testable. (

Untestable Success Criteria)

3. wherever there are

extreme changes in context,

one of the following is true: [Y]

List of 2 items nesting level 1

A. an easy to find setting, that persists for the site visit, is
provided for the user to deactivate processes or features that cause
extreme changes in

context or

B. extreme changes in context are identified before they occur so the
user can determine if they wish to proceed or so they can be prepared
for the change

list end nesting level 1

 

Editorial Note: NRT (5 Nov 2003): Might be able to make this testable if
we come up with a better definition of "extreme changes in context" (

Untestable Success Criteria)

list end

 

Level 3 Success Criteria for Guideline 3.4

List of 2 items

1. [begin proposed] user can select a different location for navigation
elements in the layout of the page.

[

Issue #352]

[Y] [end proposed]

2. the content has been reviewed, taking into account

common ideas for making content consistent and predictable,

applying them as appropriate. [Y]

 

Editorial Note: NRT (5 Nov 2003): "has been reviewed" is only testable
by someone internal to the development organization. (

Untestable Success Criteria)

list end
