Here are concepts for consideration as defined by the device independence 
working group:

1. user agent - a client within a device that performs rendering
2. rendering - the act of converting perceivable units into physical 
effects that can be perceivable by a user and with which the user may be 
able to interact
[1]

3. delivery context - a set of attributes that characterizes the 
capabilities of the access mechanism and the preferences of the user
4. delivery unit - a set of material transferred between two cooperating 
web programs as the response to a single HTTP request
5. adaptation - a process of selection, generation or modification that 
produces one or more perceivable units in response to a requested uniform 
resource identifier in a given delivery context
[2]

6.  user experience - a set of material rendered by a user agent which may 
be perceived by a user and with which interaction may be possible
7. access mechanism - a combination of hardware (including one or more 
devices and network connections) and software (including one or more user 
agents) that allows a user to perceive and interact with the Web using one 
or more modalities (sight, sound, keyboard, voice etc.)
8. perceivable unit  - a set of material which, when rendered by a user 
agent, may be perceived by a user and with which interaction may be possible
9. web page - a collection of information, consisting of one or more 
resources intended to be rendered simultaneously, and identified by a 
single Uniform Resource Identifier
