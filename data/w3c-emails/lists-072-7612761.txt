1. I vote "yes" on combining guidelines 1.4, 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 into one
"uber-3.1" guideline.
2. Under Level 3 Success Criteria, #3, change "desired meaning" to
"intended meaning" as per Sailesh's suggestion and Gregg's response
3. Under Level 3 Success Criteria, accept suggested additions 2 (link
text and section headings make sense when read by themselves and 3
(unique and informative page titles-- though I note Joe Clark's concern
about the *scope* of "unique"" my intention was that page titles should
be unique within the Web resource, not across the entire docuverse;
thanks for clarifying, Joe)
4. Reject prposed additional item 1 (paragraphs develop a signle idea):
it's a nice English-teacher notion (I am one), but surely we don't want
to be in the business of deciding where an idea begins and ends...
