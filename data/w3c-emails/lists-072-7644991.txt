1. I agree with the first edit (state the number of guidelines right in
the intro!).
2. I agree that we should clarify the editorial note re the
normative/non-normative character of the not-yet-existing checklists. I
prpose slightly different wording, as follows:
<Begin proposed wording of editorial note:
Editorial Note:  These checklists do not yet exist.  At the present
time, it is not clear if the checklists will be normative or
non-normative.  Making them non-normative would allow us to change them
over time, if necessary. but that may defeat their purpose by making the
definition of "conformance" change over time.   It may therefore be
necessary for them to be normative in order for the guidelines to be
testable. 

</end proposed wording of editorial note>

3. Conformance section:

    a. English-teacher nit: "Criterion" is a singular noun; the plural
is "criteria." So when we say "Level 1 Success Criterion are" we should
say "Level 1 Success Criteria are..."

b. Definition of testable. I propose the following rewording-- it's
longer, but I *think* it's clearer.

<begin proposed wording for definition of "testable" under Level 1
success criteria, in Conformance section>

... are testable. Some are machine-testable. Others require human
judgment. Success criteria that require human testing yield consistent
results among multiple testers.

</end>
