DISCUSSION

Test Matrix - we discussed the test matrix that Jenae and Wendy have been
working on and will be available next week. This will list platform,
browser, and assistive technology combinations, from which we will need to
prioritize which ones to check for our QA work. We will decide on priorities
at the Face to Face next week. Some related issues came up that need
discussion in the future, such as how do we ensure quality of test data,
what impact our test results will have on our recommendations to authors to
follow specific techniques, and granularity and multiple scenarios.

Errata for WCAG 1.0 - David M created a mapping of HTML Techniques for WCAG
1.0 to HTML Techniques for WCAG 2.0 [1] to help us understand where our
thoughts have changed over time. We also need to test issues. Some testing
resources may come available to us down the road but to be timely, we have
to pick up our action items from the 17 December 2003 teleconference
ourselves. Wendy identified a set of existing test cases [1] that we can use
to get started on this. We also need to expand the set of available test
cases.

Agenda for Technical Plenary - some of today's discussion refined thoughts
about the agenda but pretty much last week's thoughts stand. Michael will
send a proposed agenda soon.
