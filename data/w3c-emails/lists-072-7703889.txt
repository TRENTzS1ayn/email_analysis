Perhaps we could have a discussion (or a vote) on which of the following
people believe are least subjective:
* Inherent
* Intuitive
* Reliable
* Dependable
* Steady
* Constant
* Regular
* Coherent
* Uniform

Possible examples where "consistent" has been used:

"Use layouts that are '...' and make interactive components act in
predictable ways"

"Key orientation and navigational elements (such as navigation bars) are
generally found in one or two '...' locations or their locations are
otherwise predictable"

"Where non '...' or unpredictable responses are essential to the
function of the content (e.g. mystery games, adventure games, tests,
etc.) the user is warned in advance of encountering them."

My preference is for uniform.
