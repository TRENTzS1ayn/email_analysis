Ditto for "predictable"
* Expected
* Conventional
* Foreseeable
* Obvious
* Apparent
* Evident

Possible examples where "predictable" has been used:

"Use layouts that are consistent and make interactive components act in
'...' ways"

"Key orientation and navigational elements (such as navigation bars) are
generally found in one or two consistent locations or their locations
are otherwise '...'"

"Where inconsistent or non '...' responses are essential to the function
of the content (e.g. mystery games, adventure games, tests, etc.) the
user is warned in advance of encountering them."

My preference is for expected or obvious.
