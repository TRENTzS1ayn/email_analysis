I have incorporated most of Gregg's comments in [blue & square brackets]
in previous email (non-incorporated comments are still included). My
comments in {purple & funky brackets}. I will attempt to respond to
comments before the meeting - however that does require me being up
before the sun is : ( *very unhappy face*


Begin proposed wording for Guideline 3.4

3.4  Organize content {uniformly throughout the resource} and make
interactive components behave in {conventional} ways. 

Success criteria for Level 1

1.      Structural markup is used to group related elements {in at least
one presentation format}. 
2.      Any extreme change of context such as an automatic redirect or a
link that opens a new browser window is implemented in a manner that can
be {identified through the content of the resource and}
programmatically.
3.      {Form submission should only occur on selection of indicated
content and form controls} {WAS: Except for submit buttons, form
controls, options within form controls, and menu items that are part of
page content can be selected without causing submission of the form}

Success criteria for Level 2

1.Components that are repeated (in multiple areas} within a
resource or a section of a resource occur in the same sequence each time
they are repeated, for at least one presentation format. {Moved to L2}
2.Visual layout is used to group related components {so that
component behaviour is obvious}
3.The target of each link is clearly identified.   [how do we do
this?]  [ Level 3?]
4.Link text, including alt text for graphical links, includes
words or phrases that occur in the title element of the destination
screen. [js note: Do we need a criterion about informative page titles
here? I know we discussed one somewhere but I don't remember where.]
[L3?]
5.Graphical components that appear on multiple screens, including
graphical links, are associated with the same text equivalents wherever
they appear.   [these are ok guidelines - but strict adherence is pretty
restrictive since you don't know how they might be used.  L3?]
6.Interactive elements that appear on multiple screens, including
graphical elements, are associated with the same functionality wherever
they appear.
7.Explicit notice is given in advance of any extreme change of
context such as an automatic redirect or a link that opens a new browser
window.
 

Success Criteria for Level 3

1.      Components that appear visually on multiple screens, such as
navigation bars, search forms, and sections within the main content, are
displayed in the same location relative to other content on every screen
where they appear. {Moved to L3}
2.      When components such as navigation bars and search forms appear
on multiple pages, users can choose to have those elements presented in
a different visual position or reading-order.
3.      There are no extreme changes of context such as automatic
redirects or automatically appearing pop-up windows.
