Sorry to burst your bubble but to me, 'consistent' is by far the best
option. Why didn't you put that as an option? I will list my objections to
each below, using 'consistent layouts' as an example of the use of the word.

> * Inherent

I would associate this with plain HTML without any presentational markup.
The 1993 look of the web if you know what I mean.

> * Intuitive

Intuitive for whom? the author? the visitor?

> * Reliable
> * Dependable
> * Steady

Reliable, dependable and steady web content to me has technical
associations. A website where every page has a totally different moronic
layout can still be reliable in my LGF [1]. It would apply to the technical
aspects of this checkpoint but not the presentational ones.

> * Constant
> * Uniform

Uniform and constant sound more restrictive than necessary. If I have a
website with a different color scheme for each section, that would be
consistent but in my LGF [1] it would not be uniform.

> * Regular

Sounds like 'ordinary'. We don't want to encourage extraordinary websites.

> * Coherent

My #2, just behind "consistent". Between the two, I think more people would
understand consistent.
