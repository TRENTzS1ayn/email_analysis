For graphics this makes sense.

 

But for links that say "for more information" on various pages - I'm not
sure how you would apply this.  It doesn't by itself tell you what you will
get more information about.  And each page will take you to a different page
of 'more information' depending on the topic.   So would this pass? Or not.
Just don't understand is all.

Some responses to Gregg's comments:

 

1. Level 1 Success Criterion #1: "... at least one presentation format": The
"presentation format" I had in mind here was the screen reader's deafult
reading-order-- that is, the order in which content appears in the source
document (at least in HTML). The resource would meet this criterion even if
there were multiple visual layouts so long as the order remains the same in
the source document.  I don't know what happens to this one in scenarios
like the ones Yvette listed in which there isn't exactly a source document
as there is for static HTML.

 

Level 2 Success Criterion #3: Gregg asks how I'm proposing that the target
of each link be clearly identified: through link test (including alt text
for graphical links) and/or graphics (for example, an icon shows the image
of an envelope; the alt text says "Email").

 

Level 2 Success Criterion #5 (calls for graphical elements that appear on
multiple screens to have same text equivalents wherever they appear): Gregg
comments that this is "OK but strict adherence is difficult because it's
hard to know how [the graphical elements] will be used."  Response: Would it
solve this to change the wording as follows:

<begin proposed rewording for L2 SC5>

Graphical components that appear on multiple screens <insert>and serve the
same purpose on each screen,</insert> including graphical links, are
associated with the same text equivalents wherever they appear

</end proposed rewording>

Thanks John

 

This is great progress

 

Some comments 

 

-  Do we have a better or more generic word for screen?   Page?  Doc? 

- level 1 items cannot dictate format of presentation.  Moved two items down
to level 2

-  might want to move some things to level 3 that are hard to do for all
sites (to keep from preventing L2 conformance)

-  Some additional notes in brackets below.

 

 


Begin proposed wording for Guideline 3.4


3.4  Organize content consistently from  to screen and make interactive
components behave in predictable ways. 


Success criteria for Level 1


1.[L2?] Components that are repeated on multiple screens within a
resource or a section of a resource occur in the same sequence each time
they are repeated, for at least one presentation format. 
2.Structural markup is used to group related elements.   [what about
technologies that don't allow this?] 
3.Any extreme change of context such as an automatic redirect or a
link that opens a new browser window is implemented in a manner that can be
programmatically identified. 
4.[L2?] Except for submit buttons, form controls, options within form
controls, and menu items that are part of page content can be selected
without causing submission of the form.  [this dictates interface design] 


Success criteria for Level 2


1.[L3? - pretty specific. Put order at level 2 and  position L3?]
Components that appear visually on multiple screens, such as navigation
bars, search forms, and sections within the main content, are displayed in
the same location relative to other content on every screen where they
appear. 
2.Visual layout is used to group related components. [ so that
behavior is predictable. ] 
3.The target of each link is clearly identified.   [how do we do
this?]  [ Level 3?] 
4.Link text, including alt text for graphical links, includes words or
phrases that occur in the title element of the destination screen. [js note:
Do we need a criterion about informative page titles here? I know we
discussed one somewhere but I don't remember where.]   [L3?] 
5.Graphical components that appear on multiple screens, including
graphical links, are associated with the same text equivalents wherever they
appear.   [these are ok guidelines - but strict adherence is pretty
restrictive since you don't know how they might be used.  L3?] 
6.Interactive elements that appear on multiple screens, including
graphical elements, are associated with the same functionality wherever they
appear. 
7.Explicit notice is given in advance of any extreme change of context
such as an automatic redirect or a link that opens a new browser window. 

 


Success Criteria for Level 3


1.When components such as navigation bars and search forms appear on
multiple pages, users can choose to have those elements presented in a
different visual position or reading-order. 
2.There are no extreme changes of context such as automatic redirects
or automatically appearing pop-up windows.
