 Thanks Gian,

Hmmmmm

Some quick comments 

Perhaps we could have a discussion (or a vote) on which of the following
people believe are least subjective:
* Inherent   -- very subjective
* Intuitive  -- implies personal skill  
* Reliable  --  what our measure should be -- but needs quantification
* Dependable  -- ditto
* Steady   -- close to objective -- but too constraining
* Constant   -- very objective -- but too constraining for a required and
maybe even for L3 if it is really meant to be exact.  If not  then we lose
some objectivity
* Regular   --  same as steady
* Coherent  --   this is REALLY person by person.
* Uniform -- very objective -- Same comment as "constant'

Boy this is hard

Gregg






Possible examples where "consistent" has been used:

"Use layouts that are '...' and make interactive components act in
predictable ways"

"Key orientation and navigational elements (such as navigation bars) are
generally found in one or two '...' locations or their locations are
otherwise predictable"

"Where non '...' or unpredictable responses are essential to the
function of the content (e.g. mystery games, adventure games, tests,
etc.) the user is warned in advance of encountering them."

My preference is for uniform.
