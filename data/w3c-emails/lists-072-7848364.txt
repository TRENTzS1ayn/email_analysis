Thanks, Al. I wasn't sure I should include the exception for Submit
buttons, and I agree that it hsould be possible to tab to a select
button or other control without submitting it.  Is it meaningful to
distinguish here between receiving focus and selecting? Or is that
meaningful only in the MS Windows context?

[Note 1: This is not about what people usually think of as organization
of 
the content.  It is truly an organizational principle about the dialog 
flow: separation of selection from activation.  But it is about texture,

distinctions that must be observed in the flow of the interaction.  Not
how 
to assemble the micro scale into macro scale.  It's about
the required fineness of the micro scale.]

[Note 2: The exception for submit buttons is wrong.  A
select-review-fire 
protocol
should be available for these, too.  Yes, click can be a 'fire
immediate' for these, but some way of selecting them first must be
available.  This could be by tabbing to them or onMouseOver happening.
These should not submit the form.]

This is a guideline about user-safe interaction.  The generic rule is a 
precedence
relation between 'perceivable' 'comprehensible' and 'operable'  The user
should always be able to require a separation between select and
activate, to 
allow for
perception and comprehension *before* deciding to operate any control.

It also has to do with the object-oriented texture of web content.  The 
'browser
back' function is global to the current page, and so may be fired
without a 
prior
select phase.  Its context is always the whole URI-denoted context.  But
for actions which are scoped to some subset of the presentation, it must
be 
possible
to select a matching subset so that there is a perceivable scoping 
indication that
helps the user comprehend what it is that is likely to result from 
activation of
the control.

Since the outcomes of a UI event depend on the [e.g. focus] interaction 
state of
the document-in-browser, that state must be made perceivable without at
the 
same
time causing further operations (state changes).

Especially for control actions such as form submittal that are not known
not to generate unsafe operations across the network.

  http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-webarch-20031209/#safe-interaction

It is well laid out in the User Agent Guidelines.

But is applies also to interaction behavior controlled by scripts
provided 
by the
author and server.
