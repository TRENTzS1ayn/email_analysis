I present an alternative that solves this and the following problems
with the current formulation:
- screen reader pronunciation of A, AA and AAA as similar sounds
- mnemonic for B = Basic, A = Advanced, which translates at least into
Spanish (b?sico/avanzado) and French (base/avanc? or augment?), which
is as far as I go linguistically

Roberto:
Also in italian:

B = Base
A = Avanzato

But at least, why don't use the old 1, 2, 3 or I, II, III ?
