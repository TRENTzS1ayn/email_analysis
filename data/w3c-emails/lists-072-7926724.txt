Hi list,

Gregg suggests the following wording for the lvl 2 success criteria for 1.2
in his cleanup post [1]:

"synchronized captions and audio descriptions are provided for all real-time
broadcasts"

I think it is by definition impossible to do this without a reliable crystal
ball. If you have a real-time broadcast, you simply do not have captions and
audio descriptions available to transmit in parallel (synchronized) unless
you know in advance exactly what is going to happen and when. In all other
cases, it takes time to create captions and audio descriptions, for example
X minutes. But if you delay the broadcast X minutes, it's no longer
real-time and if you delay just the captions X minutes, it's no longer
synchronized. 

The best way to caption real-time broadcasts in my non-expert opinion, would
be to delay the broadcast X minutes and provide the captions in sync (Joe?
Any thoughts on this?). Of course, there will be instances where delaying
the broadcast this is not an option (live broadcasts of auctions, for
example).
