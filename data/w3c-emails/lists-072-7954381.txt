Hi everyone,

SC 5 of guideline 1.2 talks about providing equivalents for real-time,
non-interactive video. [1] I sincerely doubt that equivalents can be found
for most of the real-time, non-interactive video content on the web.

I think my main problem is with the word 'equivalent'. In guideline 1.1 we
try to convince the readers of the importance of adequate equivalents for
content that is unavailable to someone with a disability.

Then in 1.2, we suddenly seem to say that a link to a weather website is
equivalent to a live web cam of surrounding conditions. To me, this makes no
sense. That's like saying reading the TV guide is an equivalent alternative
to going to the movies.

Some examples of real-time, non-interactive video where I think equivalents
are hard to find:
* A live broadcast from the face-to-face techniques meeting in Cannes
* A live broadcast from a Mars explorer, where noone knows what to expect

I think we should either reformulate SC 5 or make real-time, non-interactive
videos an exception to 1.1 and move it to level 2.
