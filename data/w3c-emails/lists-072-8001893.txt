There are a lot of companies (such as Disability service providers) that
put a lot of effort into maintaining a Triple-A rating, and want to be
seen to be providing as much accessibility as possible. I believe that
allowing a Triple-A rating will give something to aim for.

I'm not against using numbers, per se, though I would still lean toward 
letters, since the version number would also have to be a part of the 
claim (is WCAG 2-B+  more usable than WCAG 2-1+?).

I still disagree with offering a level-3 conformance claim. To design 
any Web resource to conform to all level 3 guidelines is almost 
impossible for all but the most simple examples, and our experience 
with WCAG 1 seems to show that claims of triple-A conformance are 
bogus. I'd rather set a bar (A+) that people can achieve, and lower 
ones that are more reasonable, than set one that users can't put any 
faith in.
