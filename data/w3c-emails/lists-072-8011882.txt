Hi everyone,

Gregg Vanderheiden suggested the following edit for the definition of
testable: [1]
 
Reliably human is not very clear.  I suggest we change this to
 "are testable (by machine or by humans with high consistency)".

Personally, I don't know many men that have high consistency ;-) I know
that's not the way the sentence was meant to be read but I did find it funny
to read it this way. 

I think this should be rewritten and am glad John Slatin already proposed a
new wording [2].
