It makes sense to move the note to the beginning, however it is confusing 
to have "success criteria for level 1" "editorial note" followed by text of 
success criteria 1. At least in this text version, it was not clear to me 
where the editorial note ended and the success criterion began.  I expect 
people unable to see the visual formatting and navigating by headings could 
have similar problems. Thus, since the editorial note applies to the entire 
guideline, i propose moving it before the heading "level 1 success criteria."

"TR" is W3C jargon.  How about, "To meet our publication deadline, 
resolution of issues for this guideline are deferred to our next Working 
Draft. "

The primary question  is, "How do these success criteria apply to every 
Webcam, newscast, and home broadcast?"  Options we are considering include 
moving existing success criteria from Level 1 to Level 2 or allowing 
conformance claims to exclude portions of a site, such as, "All pages and 
applications on this site meet the Level 1 guidelines of WCAG 2.0 except 
the Web cam at http://example.org/webcam/."
