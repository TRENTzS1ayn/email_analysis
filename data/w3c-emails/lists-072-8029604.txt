I don't think that's reason enough to open it up to the abuse of 
triple-A, which is orders of magnitude more common. Disability-oriented 
sites have better reasons to implement everything they can than just to 
score a triple-A, and most of them aren't going to do any less just 
because there isn't a triple-A-like level. To put it another way, those 
who do care will do the best they can in any case -- even if we have no 
conformance levels at all. We have to be concerned with everybody else.
