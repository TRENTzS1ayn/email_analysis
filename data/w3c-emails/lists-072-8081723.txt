Great meeting today.  

 

We got through the agenda.   Have only 1.5 to clean up.  Somehow missed that
one in the prep.  Kerstin is working on a compilation and cleanup.  We will
post that in the next couple days.   By Tues we should have the cleaned up
TR draft ready to review.   It will be available for comment until Thursday
when we will clear points and add any editor notes where there are known
problems. 

 

Please look over the draft when it is posted.   It still needs a lot of work
- but is a big jump forward.  Lets find the big issues and mark them up.
Then send it out to TR.  Then off to CSUN to begin cleaning it up.

 

Lots got done this month.  Thanks everyone.  Thanks Ben for all massive
editing and bugs work.  Thanks Wendy for the coord work - and the editing
this weekend.  And special thanks to John for all his work on drafts.   Its
late, my head is fuzz and I'm sure I forgot to thank someone.  But thank you
all.

 

Rest up and give it a good last look next week.
