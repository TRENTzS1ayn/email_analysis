Hello John and list,

Pictures (jpg, gif, etc) do not have source documents in the regular sense
of the word. I don't know if that is a good example, because I do not quite
understand the context of the question. Could you explain some more what you
need counter-examples for?

Also, for PDF the source is the postscript file but authors seldom code
these by hand but have a program like Acrobat or PDF distiller that does it
for them. 

Another example might be MP3. You cannot say "view source" there anywhere.
The file format of MP3 is a mystery to almost everyone publishing MP3
content so almost no author ever does anything with the source.

This is stretching the concept of "host technologies" a bit, but it is
content found on the web that in my opinion does not have a source document
in any way the author has influence over.
 
Hope this helps,
