Hello Michael,

the conclusion I would draw from this is that you are not equipped to do
sufficient testing, unless WCAG is prepared to recommend that people use
Windows (with the implications about buying computers for which it is
available, ...). Your results are great, but I don't think they justify your
conclusion at this stage.

Cheers
