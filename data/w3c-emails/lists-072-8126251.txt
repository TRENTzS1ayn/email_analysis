I had an action item to test user agent support for WCAG 1.0 Checkpoints 7.4
(avoid auto refresh) and 7.5 (avoid auto redirect). I only tested <meta>
refresh, that is, I didn't test if user agents have options for
refresh/redirect in the HTTP header. 

IE6: has an option in Custom Security settings to disable META refresh. This
disables redirects (7.5) but not refreshes of the same page (7.4). Anyway,
it's a little weird to look in security settings for an accessibility
feature.

Mozilla 1.5: I couldn't find any option to disable refresh or redirect.

Lynx 2.8: Meta refreshes aren't followed automatically, but are presented as
a link at the top of the page (along with the timeout). At least this means
"auto refreshes" aren't automatic in Lynx, or the automatic nature is
disabled by default.

Opera 7.0: I couldn't find any option to disable refresh or redirect.

JAWS 4.51: There is an option to suppress page refreshes. However, in my
testing on IE6 that option had no effect, so I can't verify it.

WindowsEyes 4.2: I couldn't find any option to disable refresh or redirect.


Based on this testing I would recommend against deprecating these two
checkpoints yet.
