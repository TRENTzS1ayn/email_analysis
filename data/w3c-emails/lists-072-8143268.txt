Most _blind_ people. It is apparently becoming more common (this is, in my
not entirely representative experience) for people with dyslexia to use
screen readers. For these people it is not at all irrelevant.

There is also a trade-off to be made beteween functionality of the software
(advanced screen readers with Internet explorer certainly provide the most
features) and stability, since advanced screen readers are very complex
programs which mean even the relatively stable Windows XP can be expected to
crash several times a day. One way to reduce the impact of this is to live
with less powerful tools, gaining in stability.

Neither of these are, at the time of writing, the majority experience of
screen reader users. I just wanted to be sure that the working group doesn't
fall into the trap of designing for one aprt of the user community because
they forget that there are others out there.
