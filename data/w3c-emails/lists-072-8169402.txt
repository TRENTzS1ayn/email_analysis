The following is a proposal for cleaning up old 1.5

 

Thanks Kirsten for all your work on this.

and Wendy for putting it all together.

 

In looking this over - I would like to suggest that we merge these with  to
2.4 

Guideline 2.4 Facilitate the ability of users to orient themselves and move
within the content. 

 

All of the benefits look like they belong in 2.4

Guideline 1.6 Make structure perceivable through presentation. [level 2
guideline]


Level 1 Success Criteria for Guideline 1.6


1.No level 1 success criteria for this guideline 


Level 2 Success Criteria for Guideline 1.6


1.The structural elements present have a different visual appearance
or auditory characteristic from each other and from body text. [V] 

Editorial Note: We need to define "structural elements" in the above
criterion. 


Level 3 Success Criteria for Guideline 1.6 


1.Structural emphasis is evident on at least the following displays: 

a.black and white monitor, 
b.low resolution screens  (160 x 160 pixel) , 
c."mono" audio playback devices.

[V] 

Guideline
<http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/issuereports/structure-emphasis_issues.
php>  1.5 (structure-emphasis) Issues 


Who Benefits from Guideline 1.6 (Informative) 


Presentation that emphasizes structure:

*enables users with cognitive and visual disabilities to orient
themselves within the content,
*enables all users to move quickly through the content and notice
major content divisions
*enables all users, but particularly users with visual or cognitive
disabilities to focus on important content,
*enables all users, but particularly users with visual or cognitive
disabilities to distinguish the different types of content.


Examples of Guideline 1.6 (Informative) 


*Example 1: documentation for a product. 

Identifying chapters in the structure of a book is appropriate and accepted
use of labeling the structure. Within the chapters, headings identify
(label) changes in context and highlight ideas contained in the following
text. Subtle differences between the appearance of the chapter title and the
section headings helps the user understand the hierarchy and relationship
between the title and headings. The only difference might be font size and
margin indentation when presented visually, and spoken in a difference voice
or preceded by a sound when presented auditorily.

*Example 2: a data table. 

Groups of rows or columns are labeled with headers.

*Example 3: an audio presentation. 

An audio rendering of a document, generated according to a style sheet, uses
a different, more formal voice to read titles and headers so the listener
can easily identify the words as a title and not part of the running text.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 


Guideline 2.4 Facilitate the ability of users to orient themselves and move
within the content. [level 2 guideline]


Level 1 Success Criteria for Guideline 2.4


1.No level 1 success criteria for this guideline 


Level 2 Success Criteria for Guideline 2.4


1.In documents greater than 50,000 words or sites larger than 50
perceived pages, at least one of the following is provided. [V] 

Editorial Note: NRT (5 Nov 2003): What's a perceived page? What if it's a
voice XML application. How does it apply to web applications? Why 50 and
50,000? (`
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2003OctDec/0234.html>
Success Criteria)

a.hierarchical
<file:///C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\vander\Desktop\WD-WCAG20-20040301%5b2
%5d.html#structuredef#structuredef> structure,
b.table of contents (for pages) or site map (for sites), 
c.alternate display order (for pages) or alternate
<file:///C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\vander\Desktop\WD-WCAG20-20040301%5b2
%5d.html#site-nav-mechdef#site-nav-mechdef> site navigation mechanisms (for
sites).

1.Large blocks of material that are repeated on multiple pages, such
as navigation menus with more than 8 or more links, etc., can be bypassed by
people who use screen readers or who navigate via keyboard or keyboard
interface. [V] 


Level 3 Success Criteria for Guideline 2.4 


1.Information is provided that would indicate at least one logical
sequence in which to read a document. [I] 
2.Diagrams are constructed so that they have
<file:///C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\vander\Desktop\WD-WCAG20-20040301%5b2
%5d.html#structuredef#structuredef> structure that users can access. [I] 
3.Logical tab order has been created. [I] 

Editorial Note: NRT (5 Nov 2003): "logical tab order" may not be testable.

4.There is a statement associated with the content asserting that
items from the following list were considered: [V] 

a.Breaking up text into logical paragraphs,
b.Dividing documents, especially very long ones, into hierarchical
sections and subsections with clear and informative titles,
c.Supplying an informative title for each page or resource that can be
accessed independently (for example, from a search results page),

Editorial Note: If the requirement for informative titles is testable (in
Guideline
<file:///C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\vander\Desktop\WD-WCAG20-20040301%5b2
%5d.html#meaning#meaning>  3.1) and remains a Level 2 success criteria, then
consider dropping this criteria. 

d.Supplying a unique title for each page or resource that can be
accessed independently (for example, from a search results page),
e.Revealing important non-hierarchical relationships, such as
cross-references so that the relationships are represented unambiguously in
the markup or data model.

Editorial Note: Are there any others?
