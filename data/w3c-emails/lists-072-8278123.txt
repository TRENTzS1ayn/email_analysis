On Thursday we will be reviewing any comments on the proposed TR draft which
you can find on our website. 

The link to the latest compilation is at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-20040301.html 

Please read the whole document though and watch for anything that 
1) is an error
2) is an omission (blaring)
3) needs to have an Editors Note attached.

All of the changes in this draft have been posted to the list over the last
couple weeks.  

The only item that is really new is the clearing up of 1.6 which was posted
this week. 

So we will start with that 
1.6 review  (and consideration of Merging with 2.4) 
 
And then move on to comments etc on the rest of the document.  

Remember ? this document is not done.   But we need to get something out to
show where we are and what we have done lately.   It still needs work.  But
any significant flaws that we are aware of should be noted with editors
notes in the document if we can.

This is our last meeting before we go to TR.

See you thurs.  Please post comments to the list in prep.
