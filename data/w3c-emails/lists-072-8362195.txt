Please read the whole document though and watch for anything that
1) is an error
2) is an omission (blaring)
3) needs to have an Editors Note attached.

Yvette:

In guideline 2.4, the second lvl 2 success criterion says:
Large blocks of material that are repeated on multiple pages, such as
navigation menus with MORE THAN 8 OR MORE links, can be bypassed by people
who use screen readers or who navigate via keyboard or keyboard interface.
[V] 

More than 8 or more should be either "more than 8" or "8 or more" links.
There is a difference: "more than 8" excludes 8, "8 or more" includes 8. I
think we want to include 8, so it should either be "more than 7" or "8 or
more". I prefer "8 or more" since we do not require anything for 7 but do
for 8 links. Also, 7 seems to be the 'magic number' of items that people can
manage without further hierarchy so it would make sense to require further
navigation aids for 8 links or more.
