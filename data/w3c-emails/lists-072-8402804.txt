Hi everyone,

While rereading the current working draft, I noticed that the benefits of
2.3 (about seizures) are formulated in reverse compared to the other
guidelines. All the other guidelines formulate the benefits of the
guideline. In guideline 2.3, it lists in the "who benefits" section:

* Individuals with photosensitive epilepsy can have seizures triggered by
flickering or flashing in the 3 to 49 flashes per second (Hertz) range with
a peak sensitivity at 20 flashes per second.

* Individuals who are easily distracted may not be able to focus on content
with flicker occurring in the same visual field.

Of course, the benefits are that these effects are avoided. I think we
should formulate all the "who benefits" sections as benefits, not as
implicitely avoided negative effects.

Proposed reformulation:

* Individuals with photosensitive epilepsy can avoid content that causes
them to have seizures. These seizures are triggered by flickering or
flashing in the 3 to 49 flashes per second (Hertz) range with a peak
sensitivity at 20 flashes per second. 

* Individuals who are easily distracted find it easier to focus on content
without flicker occurring in the same visual field.
