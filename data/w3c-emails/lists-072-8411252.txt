Hello All -

I have been out of town but have been going over the draft as I travel.
Here are some areas that seem to be rough around the edges for me.

I know we talked a lot about the phrase below but it still is very confusing
to me.  I do not want authors to think that TEST questions should not be
"alt-tagged".  Pictures or diagrams in math tests need to be alt tagged!

Guideline 1.1

Exception: 

If the non-text content is part of a test (for example, a spelling test) and
providing a text-equivalent would defeat the purpose of the test, a
text-equivalent would not be required.

____________________________________

Guideline 3.2

For the following what about, "single document" as opposed to page?

Editorial Note:?We are looking for a word to replace "page" that applies
across technologies. For visual applications, "screen" would apply, but
would not apply for speech-based technologies such as VoiceXML.

In principle 4 below, the word enough seems vague (I do not have an
alternative idea)..

Principle 4
Content must be robust enough to work with current and future technologies.

Guideline 4.1 - Level One Success Criteria

Level 1 Success Criteria for Guideline 4.1

In a., below, do we mean an automated validity test?  What about pages
(documents) without declared DOCTYPE(s) - can they pass?

1.    Except where the site has documented that a specification was violated
for backward compatibility or compatibility with assistive technology, the
technology has: [I]
a.    passed validity tests for the version of the technology in use
(whether it be conforming to a schema, Document Type Definition (DTD), or
other tests described in the specification),
b.    structural elements and attributes are used as defined in the
specification.

There is a link on my printed page 38 that links to issues related to
guideline 3.4.  Given that there is not a guideline 3.4, will this be
confusing.  I was working off of a printed version so this may be something
we may want to look at down the road.

These are "just" some of my thoughts.

Take care -

Doyle
