Yvette's reformulation is close to the one I proposed some time back.
In fact hers may be clearer; I'll paste my proposed wording in below for
comparison.

<begin proposed wording>
Proposed wording for Who benefits from Checkpoint 2.3 (Informative)
*People with photosensitive epilepsy benefit from the absence of
flickering content.  For these individuals, seizures can be triggered by
flickering in the range between 3 and 49 times per second (3-49Hz), with
a peak sensitivity at 20 flashes per second.
*People who are easily distracted may be able to concentrate
better if they are not distracted by content flickering in the visual
field.
</end proposed wording>

Subject: [2.3] Benefits formulated as problems (low priority)



Hi everyone,

While rereading the current working draft, I noticed that the benefits
of 2.3 (about seizures) are formulated in reverse compared to the other
guidelines. All the other guidelines formulate the benefits of the
guideline. In guideline 2.3, it lists in the "who benefits" section:

* Individuals with photosensitive epilepsy can have seizures triggered
by flickering or flashing in the 3 to 49 flashes per second (Hertz)
range with a peak sensitivity at 20 flashes per second.

* Individuals who are easily distracted may not be able to focus on
content with flicker occurring in the same visual field.

Of course, the benefits are that these effects are avoided. I think we
should formulate all the "who benefits" sections as benefits, not as
implicitely avoided negative effects.

Proposed reformulation:

* Individuals with photosensitive epilepsy can avoid content that causes
them to have seizures. These seizures are triggered by flickering or
flashing in the 3 to 49 flashes per second (Hertz) range with a peak
sensitivity at 20 flashes per second. 

* Individuals who are easily distracted find it easier to focus on
content without flicker occurring in the same visual field.
