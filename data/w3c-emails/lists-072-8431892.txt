I had an action item to follow up on the tests I performed on WCAG 1.0
Guideline 1.5 and 10.5

My action was to check in the UAAG test suite to see if there were test
files for Alt text in areas of an image map and side by side links. There
were no tests designed specifically for these purposes. I built a test page
on my personal web site that conforms to the UAAG format. UAAG is welcome to
copy it to their test suite.

http://www.davidmacd.com/test/test_image_map.htm 

I have added WindowEYES to the list Jaws and Home Page Reader. Browsers
include (the most recent versions of) Opera 7, Mozilla, IE 6, Netscape 7.

 The trouble with the ALT Tags on the image map. I think we can retire WCAG
1.0 Guideline 1.5

WindowEYES joins Hope Page Reader and Jaws in not having trouble with side
by side links and ALT Tags in Explorer. However Charles recommended we not
retire 10.5 because low vision users may have trouble with side by side
links.

Jaws and WindowEYES had trouble in Opera, Netscape and Mozilla.

This is not surprising given that they are spec -ed for IE.

The dilemma is do we not retire this "Until User Agents Clause" given that
Opera, Netscape and Mozilla will likely have difficulty with screen readers
on this issue for the foreseeable future.

TEST 1

I was to test WCAG Version 1.0 Guideline 1.5 

"Until user agents render text equivalents for client-side image map links,
provide redundant text links for each active region of a client-side image
map."

1)       I tested an image map that had Alt-text for each region 

2)       An image map with Title attribute for each region.

The user agents I used were the latest versions of MS Explorer, Netscape,
Opera, Mozilla. I used JAWS and Home Page Reader screen readers.

Findings:

MS Internet Explorer works fine. Both JAWS and HPR had no problem with the
image map. When a title was present it superceded the Alt-Text.

Jaws had trouble in Opera, Netscape and Mozilla. 

However a "mouse over" would display the link destination address

So if we are going to support all leading browsers we can't retire this
item.

 

Test 2 

I was to test WCAG Version 1.0 Guideline 10.5

"Until use agents (including assistive technologies) render adjacent links
distinctly, include non-link, printable characters (surrounded by spaces)
between adjacent links."

3)       I set up a series of adjacent links 

The user agents I used were the latest versions of MS Explorer, Netscape,
Opera, Mozilla. I used JAWS and Home Page Reader screen readers.

It appears to me that we can retire this item
