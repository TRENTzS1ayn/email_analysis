Subject: TECH: WCAG version 1.0 guideline 1.5 image maps and 10.5
adjacent links,


I had an action item to follow up on the tests I performed on WCAG 1.0
Guideline 1.5 and 10.5

My action was to check in the UAAG test suite to see if there were test
files for Alt text in areas of an image map and side by side links.
There
were no tests designed specifically for these purposes. I built a test
page
on my personal web site that conforms to the UAAG format. UAAG is
welcome to
copy it to their test suite.

Roberto:
Good... only one point has not been considered.
There are problems Image Maps and XHTML 1.1 browser rendering.
All the example was done by HTML 4.01 but in XHTML 1.1 (that is a W3C
Reccomandation, and guidelines of WCAG 1.0 said to use the lastest W3C
approved guidelines) there is a "little" problem: XHTML 1.1 remove the
"name" attribute and the "usemap" attributeis used to be a URI in
previous reccomandation, but now in XHTML 1.1 it is an IDREF. This is an
old issue since august 2002 [1].
So, what can we do for involve the user agent producer to update web
browser to support XHTML 1.1, W3C Recommendation since 31 May 2001?
