All current user agents support text equivalents. On the AT side of things
we have JAWS, WindowEyes, and HPR. In the browser world we have of course
IE, NetScape, Opera, and Mozilla. 

All of these agents render text equivalents. However, the little snag is in
the combinations. WindowEyes and Jaws don't render text equivalents on Image
maps unless they are in IE, which makes sense to me given that they were
designed to work with IE. 

Roberto said >>There are problems Image Maps and XHTML 1.1 browser
rendering. All the example was done by HTML 4.01 but in XHTML 1.1">>

My action item was find a test application in the UAAG test suite or build a
test page according to their example and precedent. They did not have
relevant test page so I built one. They use HTML 4.01 Transitional, I upped
it to strict. The test in question is to find out whether we could remove
the "until user agents cause" in the (1999) WCAG 1.0. Guidelines 1.5. (I
think we should remove it.) 

If the group would like, I would be glad to rerun the test after converting
the page to XHTML 1.0 or 1.1. I think that would be addressing a different
issue. But I would be glad to do it. Thanks for the input on that Roberto.

Are there any current-generation user agents that don't support text
equivalents for client-side image maps? That's not a challenge-- it's a
question.

adjacent links,


I had an action item to follow up on the tests I performed on WCAG 1.0
Guideline 1.5 and 10.5

My action was to check in the UAAG test suite to see if there were test
files for Alt text in areas of an image map and side by side links.
There were no tests designed specifically for these purposes. I built a
test page on my personal web site that conforms to the UAAG format. UAAG
is welcome to copy it to their test suite.

Roberto:
Good... only one point has not been considered.
There are problems Image Maps and XHTML 1.1 browser rendering. All the
example was done by HTML 4.01 but in XHTML 1.1 (that is a W3C
Reccomandation, and guidelines of WCAG 1.0 said to use the lastest W3C
approved guidelines) there is a "little" problem: XHTML 1.1 remove the
"name" attribute and the "usemap" attributeis used to be a URI in
previous reccomandation, but now in XHTML 1.1 it is an IDREF. This is an
old issue since august 2002 [1]. So, what can we do for involve the user
agent producer to update web browser to support XHTML 1.1, W3C
Recommendation since 31 May 2001?
