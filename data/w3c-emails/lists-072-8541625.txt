With the permission of Roberto, I forward our off-list discussion about
whether "" is a text equivalent or not. Our conclusion:

The fact that two people who both know about accessibility can't agree on
whether alt="" is a text equivalent or not means we need to work on our
explanations!

Yes, we definitely do!

Yvette:
I know, I did mean alt="". I think we both agree that this is the correct
way to handle decorative images. We just disagree on whether you can call
that a text equivalent or not. I think an empty text equivalent still is a
text equivalent. It's like in math: the empty set is a set too.

Yvette: 
To me, that's the whole idea of alts for decorative images: that they
contain nothing :-)

The fact that two people who both know about accessibility can't agree on
whether alt="" is a text equivalent or not definitely means we need to work
on our explanations :-)
