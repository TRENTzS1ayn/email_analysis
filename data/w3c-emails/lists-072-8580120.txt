I agree with you but need to be clarify what is a "text equivalent". For
me, text equivalent is, for eg, an "alt" attribute, not an empty tag.
Remember that is different to have alt=" " and alt=""... second one is
empty, first one is a blank space...

Empty string is not a text equivalent... if it is "empty" it don't
contain nothing :)
