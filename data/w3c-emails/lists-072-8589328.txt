Hello everyone,

The 'who benefits' section of 2.5 is formulated as problems, not benefits.

Current wording:
* Individuals with writing disabilities and people with dyslexia often have
difficulty writing text in forms or other places that need text input.
* Individuals with speech disabilities might not be recognized properly in
voice input applications.

Proposed rewording:
* Identifying typing errors helps individuals with writing disabilities and
people with dyslexia who often have difficulty writing text in forms or
other places that need text input. 
* Allowing users to select an option from a list instead of having to enter
text directly helps individuals with speech disabilities because they might
not be recognized properly in voice input applications.
