Attached is a listing of the edits from todays Telecon.

The minutes are also attached.

We should be ready for TR once these edits are transferred to the master
copy.

Everyone -- great work
Keep the comments coming - since we will just continue from here. 
If you see any showstoppers on the doc now -- (after taking the attached
edits into consideration) then speak now.

thanks

Gregg
