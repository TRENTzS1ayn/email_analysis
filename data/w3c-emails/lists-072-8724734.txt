I like this change, but I also fear that it ain't market-oriented -- IMO the
least the WAI should legitimate *is* an alternative version of any site
(e.g., imagine marketing agencies who feel a natural force to always conjure
awesome Flash sites, though you and me don't like that).

If you worry about an effect where authoring tool vendors like e.g.
Macromedia now pass on implementing any kind of accessibility improvement, I
understand this quite well. But there should be a reasonable balance since we cannot
(or should not) ignore market needs completely (since this could easily turn
into the opposite).


Best regards,
 Jens.
