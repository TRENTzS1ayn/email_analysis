Hello All,
I think we need another approach for the guideline. My English might not be
good enough for exact suggestion but you can get the main idea:

3.1 Level 2 #4
Each phrase or passage should be identified with it's correct language tag
through markup or other means.

Explanation:
Each text should be contained inside a tag with LANG or XML:XLANG attribute
defining it's correct language.

Please bare with me, I am only starting here
