While reading Level 3 Success Criteria for Guideline 3.1, I'm having second
thoughts about the inclusion of a lesson on clear writing, grammar, and
sentence structure in the Guidelines document. It may be too late for this
TR but here is my thinking:

 

*This document will likely be translated into several languages. The
grammar and writing techniques in 3.1 Level 3 Success Criteria are very
specific to the English Language and they may not translate well.
*They introduce a lot of "bulk" to the document. This would be fine
if our final version was available in "views" (for instance, "Guidelines
only", "Guidelines and Success Criteria" ) where the document could be
truncated for those interested in an abbreviated version of the document.
However, my understanding is that W3C rules will not allow multiple views of
an official document.
*Our HTML and CSS techniques are in separate documents. 3.1 Level 3
Success Criteria are kind of an "English Language Techniques" document. Are
the guidelines the best place for them?

 

I know John put a lot of work into making them as concise as possible, and
they are great. I also realize that proper English writing skills are sorely
lacking in North America. However, I am thinking that this section may be
better in the Gateway, where we give non-technology specific techniques to
make documents more accessible. I would at least like to hear discussion on
this.

 

I know it is too late to discuss this before going to TR but perhaps it
would be good to add a note to the level 3 Success criteria in 3.1 about
this. This note may generate public comment about the whether the Level 3
Success Criteria belong in this document or in the Gateway. I would be glad
to hear others views on this.
