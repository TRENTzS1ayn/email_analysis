Jason suggest we speak with experts in foreign languages to see if 3.1
translates (see below)  Thanks for the feedback Jason

Maybe these could be reviewed by people with knowledge of appropriate
writing strategies in various languages to determine whether they are
overly specific to the English language, and whether and how they can
best be internationalized. If they can't be internationalized then we
might have to consider moving them to techniques and maintaining
different strategies for different languages.

Perhaps the note to reviewers should ask not whether these ought to be
moved, but whether they require internationalization and, if so, what
changes or additions are suggested.

One further question: is this necessary for the current TR draft, or,
if an appropriate note can't be inserted at this late stage, would it
be reasonable to postpone it until the next draft?
