DISCUSSION

Roadmap - Wendy presented an overview of the tasks needed to produce WCAG
2.0, including the techniques documents that need to be ready at the same
time, and a possible timeline. It was daunting indeed and helped us to
understand what work needs focus. HTML and Gateway techniques need to have
new drafts soon, and we need to produce CSS, Script, and Web Applications as
well. Other sets of techniques are desirable but not as critical.

Gateway techniques - in order to progress on Gateway techniques, we decided
to go through the Bugzilla issues list [], close as many old issues as
possible, and assign the rest (mostly to Tom). Closing the remaining issues
will be a large part of the task of preparing the next draft.

Test matrix - we reviewed the test matrix [] of operating systems, browsers,
and assistive technologies and came up with a lot of additions and
subtractions. This matrix identifies the priorities of tool combinations for
which we need test data of our techniques. There was some discussion about
how many versions back we need to test, but weren't able to come up with a
solid guideline for ourselves about how to make that decision. We also
discussed the priorities we want to assign, which ended up as:

p1 - we must obtain test data 
p2 - we should try to get decent test data if we can 
p3 - nice to have 

EO - The Education and Outreach Working Group joined us to talk about
materials they are developing [] and the impact of WCAG 2.0 on that work.
Some of the documents relate to ones we are working on but we were able to
tease out differences, or to note the differences between educationally and
technically oriented views of similar information. Documents that need the
most coordination include the Curriculum, Gallery of accessible sites
(especially since we need such implementations as well), quick tips. Other
documents need looser coordination. We decided it would be a good idea to
have a monthly 1/2 hour coordination call between the two groups to keep the
ball rolling.

WCAG 1.0 errata - the possibility of revising WCAG 1.0 to incorporate the
errata was of some concern to EO because of the need to produce support
materials, and do so again when WCAG 2.0 is release. Nevertheless, on the
whole most people present at the meeting favoured doing this. There are a
lot of concerns to be worked out, and a group of non-WCAG people offered to
do some preliminary work on this. We prepared a draft work plan for next
steps that this task force can follow.

Conformance - the question of whether checklists (derived from techniques)
need to be normative as a way of proving that the technology-independent
guidelines are testable (and therefore can be normative themselves) was
raised. The consensus of the group was that this should not happen -
techniques and checklists are designed for different functions, may be
incomplete, and must be able to change as technology changes. There was not,
however, consensus on alternative approaches to meet the guidelines need.
Tom and Michael will expand a proposal to the list to see how it falls with
the larger group.

HTML techniques - taking the same strategy as we did for Gateway, we used
Bugzilla to prioritize our work for the next draft. 

VoiceXML techniques - Katie and Janina presented work they have done on
techniques for VoiceXML, a technology which was not designed with
accessibility in mind but which has interesting possibilities. They found
their approach worked well with ours and have volunteered to do a more
formal set of techniques.

Test suite - members of the QA Working Group joined and we discussed the
process for making test suites, the definition (and threshold) for
testability.
