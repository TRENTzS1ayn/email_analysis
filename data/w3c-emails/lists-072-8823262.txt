I'm not sure whether there is a teleconference tomorrow or not. I thought
not because of the tech meeting in Cannes and the lack of agenda but the
working group website does announce a teleconference on March 11. Either way
I cannot attend because I have a meeting from which I will not be back
before our regular meeting time.
