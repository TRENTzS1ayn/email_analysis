fixed in the latest working draft:
http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-WCAG20-20040311/

would be great. but, we need to get our core set of techniques first (html, 
css, scripting).  then we're aiming for rdf, svg, voicexml.  the techniques 
submission form should be ready to use in the near future so if people have 
techniques for mobile devices, they can submit them.  then we need to find 
someone who can facilitate a draft (vet submitted techniques, incorporate 
them into a document).

>Also, are we going to include anything like PDF or Flash in this set.  (I

it is up to macromedia and adobe to provide these. refer to discussion from 
january:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2004JanMar/0113.html

I'll incorporate your issues and suggestions related to conformance into 
the summary i'm providing for the F2F.
