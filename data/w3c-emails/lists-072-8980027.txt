[Yvette asked what text-equivalents are required for illustrative images
that can be expressed in words]

I know that that would solve this case but it's just an example. I want to
know how we want authors to treat illustrations that don't have subscripts
since many designers may not want to add a subscript. Especially in level 1,
we don't want to tell authors how to present their content so we need to
decide what we want as text equivalents for illustrative images that can be
expressed in words.
