2.4 Facilitate the ability of users to orient themselves and move within
the content
 
 
I think we can be doing a lot more on this one with
 
Semantic interpretation
RDF
The work of the  Device independence working group...
 
You can also bare in mind the page maps we are doing at UB Access were
we are annotating types of page content and allowing people an
interactive review of page structure/ content.
 
We could copy it (I have a feeling UB won't mind :) 

All the best
