comment 1
re: 1.3 - The following can be derived programmatically (for example,
through a markup or data model) from the content without requiring user
interpretation of presentation

I think we need to add -
The following can be derived programmatically (for example, through a
markup or data model)  _By the user agent_
 
I.e.: having a data model that is not exposed and known will not help
most users -but structure can be programmatically determined -even
though we know that it is not practical. ( See the XTAG document for
further risks on this one)
 

comment  2
re: Information presented using color is also available without color
and without having to interpret markup (for example through context or
text coding). [V] 

hmm.. thinking this one over again. Does that mean that if I use
emphasized text in red as important warnings that I have to generate the
word warning too? - this could be a test case (Tom..)
 
comment 3
re:  the user is warned before time expires, allowed to extend the time
limit with a simple action (for example, "hit any key") and given at
least 10 seconds to respond or
 
 - not everyone can read the instruction with in ten seconds
 
if we allow this as  a level one -    it should not be OK at the level
two
 

comment  4
re: Level 2 Success Criteria for Guideline 3.1 
Page titles are informative. [V] 

 
Not strong enough -it can be informative but not helpful. To comply it
could simply say the authors height and weight. We need it to summarize
or act as a  title to the page content.
 
comment 5
overall  3.1 comments where in previous email. 
 
 
comment 6
re:  Level 2 Success Criteria for Guideline 4.2 
Accessibility conventions of the markup or programming language (API's
or specific markup) are used. [I] 

Well- if the site is accessible without this - then what benefit does it
bring
for example: if all pictures are described in text you do not need the
alt tag - the site is accessible without
what are you trying to achieve hear ? 
 
comment 7....
and of course my old comments on 4.2 still hold - the accessibility has
to be available to assistive technology and to the platform .  That is
missing but is pivotal.
 
 
all the best
