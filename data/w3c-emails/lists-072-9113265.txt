comment 3

re: the user is warned before time expires, allowed to extend the time limit
with a simple action (for example, "hit any key") and given at least 10
seconds to respond or

- not everyone can read the instruction with in ten seconds

if we allow this as a level one - it should not be OK at the level two


Roberto C.:
Agree: if we leave this point as it is now, the time will still be an
essential part of interaction.

In my opinion, it's the same problem as in the second point: "the user is
allowed to adjust the time limit over a wide range which is at least ten
times the length of the default setting or"; if the default setting is one
second, will ten second be enough? 

If we want to allow users to control time, and not to be controlled or
forced by time, we cannot give them a maximum (and variable from site to
site) time to read the page.

Best regards,

Roberto Castaldo
