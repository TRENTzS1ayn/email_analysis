>At our QAWG/IG face-to-face [1] during the Tech Plenary 2004, we have 
>decided on a complete remodeling of the QA Framework (QAF).  This follows 
>our trial implementation experiences during CR, as well as comments and 
>feedback from Working Groups and individuals.
>
>We have decided to go Lite and to redesign the whole QA Framework:
>
>* Ops Guidelines (combined with Introduction) will become a useful "QA 
>Handbook", to help chairs and staff contacts manage and organize their 
>WGs' quality practices.
>* Spec Guidelines will have a diet and become lighter: Spec GL Lite [2]
>* Test Guidelines will have a diet too and become lighter as well: Test GL 
>Lite [3]
>
>Our goals in this redesign are to:
>
>- reduce the size, complexity, and perceived burden on scarce resources of 
>the WGs;
>- make QAF more useful and usable by including lots more practical tools 
>and examples;
>- make the language simpler and clearer;
>- synchronize the (Lite) QAF components at a common stage of usability and 
>maturity.
>
>The QAF documents will go back at the WD stage.  For this next phase, we 
>will use the QA wiki [4] as a participation tool for other WGs or external 
>people to participate and suggest tools or needs.  We hope this will give 
>more ongoing review and feedback, between our publishing milestones.
>
>In retrospect, the theoretical work that we have developed around the QAF 
>in the past two years has nailed down a lot of important issues.   It 
>should provide a solid foundation for the new, lighter-weight QAF.  The 
>challenge now is to combine the best of that into "A Kinder, Gentler QA 
>Framework", as it was described [5] at Technical Plenary.
