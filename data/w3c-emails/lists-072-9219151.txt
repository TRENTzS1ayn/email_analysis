Yup, I think we need to spend more time referring  to user scenarios
that we are aiming to cater for.

I am drafting something  use cases on learning disabilities for another
group. I think the idea is for it to be an ongoing work. - not as chatty
as the MSN page (surprisingly?) but may be more useful.
Should I post the URL hear too?

Keeping a list of end user scenarios even informally - I think will be
invaluable

All the best
