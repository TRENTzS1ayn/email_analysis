Personae are great.   But you need a lot of them to cover the great variety
of disability type, degree, onset etc  that represent the variety of
abilities and skills of these different users. 

Too small a set can give one a false sense of the range of users that are on
the web. 

So collecting all the personae is a good idea.   And filling in the gaps is
needed too.
