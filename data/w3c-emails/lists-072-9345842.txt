No. By definition we're not trying for maximum inclusion; personae are
models. We merely need a reasonable cross-section of WCAG 2.0 target
groups. Personae are an adjunct to other methods of usability testing and
are not the sole such method. If you leave a certain category out of
personae, you can test for usability for that category elsewhere.

Merely as an example, it would probably be overkill to produce six persone
for colour deficiency (protan, anomalous protan, deutan, anomalous deutan,
tritan, and the one everybody fixates on that's almost impossible to find,
achromat). One would probably suffice in order to model issues of colour
deficiency.
