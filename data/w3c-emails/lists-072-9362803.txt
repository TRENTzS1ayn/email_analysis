Yup I'll agree with this - but that has implications for the statements
we make about testing checkpoints by testable techniques.

If techniques are examples for implementation of a checkpoint, and does
not include all scenarios -  then people can have fulfilled the
checkpoint without confirming to any documented technique.

And we need to acknowledge that.

All the best
