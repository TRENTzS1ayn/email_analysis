Just talked about this today.

Backoffice refers to interfaces that are in a place that is only visited by
maintenance personnel.  It was meant to keep from having servers in closets
be wheelchair accessible.   It was not meant to apply to web pages served
from servers in back offices (closets).

Subject: Backoffice: must conform to WCAG?


Hi,
in the italian mailing list about web accessibility we are discussing
about backoffice of web sites. I think that if the backoffice is
developed with web technologies and use web pages (with forms, links,
etc.) must conform to WCAG 1.0 like the "external" (public) pages.
A different application is needed for the "core" of the backoffice (if
there is a CMS), that is the XHTML/XHTML editor that should conform to
ATAG 1.0.
Is correct this?
