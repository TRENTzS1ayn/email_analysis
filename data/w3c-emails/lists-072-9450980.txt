Taking out the "policy question", and making a "technical question",
must be consider backoffice contents as "web content" or not? Personally
I don't notice "technical difference" between public web sites page
structure and backoffice page structure: guidelines require that forms
must be accessible but don't specify the difference between backoffice
and public pages...
