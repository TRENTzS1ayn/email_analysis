On the other hand, suppose there is a collection of XML data that is
transferred over the Web, but which is not designed or intended to be
presented in a user interface. This is the kind of example that is
usually treated as not being Web content, and to which the guidelines don't
apply.

Question: is there a more accurate way of defining or characterizing
content  which is not designed to appear in a user interface?
