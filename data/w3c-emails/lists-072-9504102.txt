Yes I agree but I'm thinking, for eg:
- access to a backoffice: you set login and password in an HTML page.
All the functionality are in HTML pages so the pages, for accessibility
may conform to WCAG
- access to webmail service: this is a service that is not public (you
need login and password) but the services are served by web contents, so
may conform to WCAG
- e-learning applications: this service is offered to people that are
registered to the course (not public, private area), but this may
conform to WCAG.
- CMS editor inside backoffice: this is an authoring tool, so this
eventually may conform to ATAG.
- backoffice of an e-learning service by web interface: must have menus
(like A-Tutor) that are web contents and that may conform to WCAG.

I think that the point where I want to focus is that the backoffice,
webmail, etc. that are "web contents" where people can access over
authentication, but are always web contents.
