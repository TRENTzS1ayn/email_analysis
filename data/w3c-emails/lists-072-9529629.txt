Sorry Gents,

That is usually the model for personae, but in this case I disagree. I  
think we should treat personae like use cases in this instance. A personae  
does not actually have to be an actual abstract person a generalised  
demongraphic can act as the personae. I think we just need to be aware of  
all the possible problems PwDs have, and we need to be checking that we  
are either fulfilling them or not and justifying both cases. This might be  
controversial. However I think it is the most honest way to address the QA  
issue. How can we be sure we have actually addressed PwDs' needs unless we  
have formally specified them for comparison with what the guidelines  
address?

Tom
