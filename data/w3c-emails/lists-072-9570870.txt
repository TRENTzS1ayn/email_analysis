IBM unveils Web captioning service

---
IBM Global Services announced a new service Monday to provide automatic
captioning of Web conferences and other online audio for the hearing
impaired. Web sites that subscribe to the service would include a button
that links to IBM's "Caption Me Now" feature for any audio content they
post. The service, which uses audio decoding algorithms developed by IBM
researchers, then provides live text translation of the audio.
