It doesn't just point you in a rough direction.  
It points you to the definition - like the definition in a dictionary.

It doesn't tell you which definition is the one to use - but it would be
more that pointing you in a rough direction. 

The reason we didn't specify that the individual definition be indicated is
that it would require that each word with multiple definitions be marked up.
That would be a mess.

That seems like a strange meaning of located. If the goal is really just to
be able to point someone in a rough direction that includes the answer, I
suggest that the wording reflect that distinction more carefully.
