Charles, thanks for highlighting the difficulty you experienced in
interpreting the success criteria under 3.1; I'll see if I can come up
with a statement that specifies the intent more clearly; then we can
argue about whether that *should* be what we intend or not...

We seem to have a disagreement of degree on what "the rough direction"
means. Anyway, I certainly misunderstood the success criteria despite
trying carefully to read them and test them. I still think that implies
that they are not clearly enough specifying what they mean.

Perhaps having examples in the techniques would help.

We almost certainly have a disagreement about whether pointing to the
correct definition is required. And I am not convinced that it would be
messy to make that happen - in the same way as it turns out that you
don't need to mark up each word to get to a dictionary entry for them.
It seems tht as a group our understanding of this technology is still
pretty basic, so we might be making unjustifiable assumptions about it,
and basing decisions on those.

cheers
