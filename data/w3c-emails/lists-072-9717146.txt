I think most of the data will end up to be presented to the humans in one 
way or the other even when it goes through some intermediate processing by 
the machines.

It is good to keep accessibility in mind when storing, retrieving and 
processing data. In that way we can make sure that when the data is 
presented for the users it has a better chance to be accessible.
