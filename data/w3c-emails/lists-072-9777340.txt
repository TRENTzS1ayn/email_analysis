Hi 

Here are the conformance issues we will be looking at today.  

1 - Two levels or Three for conformance

2 - Should there be intermediate between 1 and 2 and 3 
(Current requirements doc conformance statement says yes so if we come to
different consensus we need to change requirements doc)

3 - Should definitions of how we sorted into levels 1, 2 and 3 be updated? 
- do we want to stick with L1 is only invisible 

4 - Should checklists be normative?  What are the issues? 
 
5 - whether conformance should be based on technology status at time WCAG
becomes official or whether we should lean into the future. 

Other topics as they come up.  But this set will more than enough to fill
our day unless we are unbelievably productive and insightful. 

Ben is also cleaning up our bugzilla list and will be posting the link to
the summary as soon as it is cleaned up to reflect all the changes that have
been made to date.
