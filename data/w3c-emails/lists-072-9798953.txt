I agree in principle. (Although in my mind metadata may also be quite close 
to that final form. Especially if we define some style rules for presenting 
the metadata.)

Is it good practise if I have some metadata that includes properties for 
images but not properties for alternative equivalents for the images?
In this case I know that whatever style rules (hopefully we have style 
rules in the future) I choose to use for presenting that metadata for the 
user it will not be accessible. Of course we can merge information from 
different sources and maybe we finally get the equivalents, but I would 
prefer thinking about accessibility from the beginning.

These practices could be something that would go under XML accessibility 
guidelines? Or metadata accessibility guidelines?

In my mind authoring tools take care that the good practices are used e.g. 
when defining schemas and creating instances, but I think something else is 
needed to first define the practices.
