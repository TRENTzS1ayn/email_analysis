A view from a semi-outsider (i.e. I have edited two of these four specs, but
this is a personal interpretation, not something that any of the relevant
groups have agreed is how they see it, and I can't speak for WAI either
since I don't work there anymore)

XML Accessibility Guidelines talk about what information you need to have to
begin with.  (They don't actually define who should provide it, but if it
isn't there then there is a problem). Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines
talk about how to put it together. WCAG talks about what the resulting
content should be. And User Agent Accessibility Guidelines talk about how
browsers should be able to present it...

There are some dependencies. Authoring Tools are aiming to produce stuff that
conforms to relevant guidelines - mostly WCAG, for producing pages, but for
producing schemas (which is often done with authoring tools) XAG is the
important reference. XAG itself is based on what is needed in a language so
that you can implement ATAG- and UAAG-conformant tools, and produce
WCAG-conformant content. UAAG and WCAG have a more complex
interdependent relationship - a problem can generally be solved by the
content author, by the user agent, or by both. So these two guidelines need
to actually figure out some idea about how to divide responsibilities, where
it makes sense to have an overlap, etc.

my 2 cents worth
