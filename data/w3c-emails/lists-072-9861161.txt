MM:
But we can't determine accessibility in a piece of content until it's 
final form.

MM:
Systems that store, retrieve and process data are what we call 
authoring tools.
The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 draft defines 
"authoring tool" [1] as:
"Any software or service that authors may use to create or modify Web 
content for publication."

Note the subsection in that definition, titled "Indirect Authoring 
Functions":
"Authors have control of only high-level parameters related to the 
automated production of the resulting Web content. This may include 
interfaces that assist the author to create and organize Web content 
without the author having control over the markup or programming 
implementation." That sounds like a whole lot of Web applications out 
there, to me. Certainly anything that calls itself a content management 
system, at least.

It is ATAG's job to determine how to store, retrieve and process data 
in Web-based applications in a way that ensures WCAG-conformant 
content.
