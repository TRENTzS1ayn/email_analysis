DISCUSSION

Brief discussion of CSS techniques - Wendy talked with Dave Shea and
Christopher Schmidt who will submit techniques once we have the public
submission process ready. Ian Lloyd [1] and James Craig [2] have worked out
a lot of techniques on their sites as well.

The public submission process is close to ready. If successful, it may
generate a lot of techniques, so we discussed how we can reduce our workload
in vetting techniques. A public rating process could help but could also
discourage input if it turns negative. We'll see how things go and reopen
this discussion if the volume warrants it.

Testing - Chris has done a lot of work on creating test files, and has
created a set of test files grouped by guideline [3] and a list of all
checks [4]. Mapping to the guidelines is next but the current mapping (done
in January) has gone out of date with the release of the new WCAG draft.
We'll deal with this and then Chris will be able to determine the
completeness of his resource. Meanwhile, people should look at his tests and
comment.
