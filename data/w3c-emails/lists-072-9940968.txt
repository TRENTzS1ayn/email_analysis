MM: Yes.

MM: Yes. To what level depends on:
  1. the plugin's software accessibility required in Guideline 1 of ATAG 
2;
  2. the plugin's interface and evaluation abilities, required elsewhere 
in ATAG 2;
  3. the accessibility of the plugin's output, according to WCAG 1 
and/or 2; and
  4. the WCAG conformance of the rest of the HTML interface.

are welcome in either w3c-wai-au or wai-xtech.
