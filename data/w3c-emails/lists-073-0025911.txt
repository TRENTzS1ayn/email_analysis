This is not an approach I expect in this group.
At first I would like to stress the need for an alternate
descriptive text feature. For this the ALT-attribute can be used
unless other groups of users do not want to use it for other 
perposes. 
The reason I found out about it was in my own office where they use:
- small images as button (looks great)
- use the "tool tip" to describe the action, but have the reasonable
  rule NOT to use the tool tip if the text is the same
  as the button shows since this looks stupid to a gui-user.

The approach we need is that we have a solution that assures an
accessibility add-on in stead of other rules to fight against.

I feel free to express the opisite:
We already experience what GUI-users expect, want and use.
We do not have the time nor the means to do any research in this
field. You might well expect GUI-users will expect/need something
else than we do. 
We work here to find solutions for us not to find solutions for 
others.

Why is the ALT-atrribute used (ihn image)?

===== My proposal to the HTML groups is to add the "TOOL_TIP"-attribute
      to reach homogeenieous use for this useful thing and to 
      free other attributes (like ALT) for there origional use.

I heavily support this argument, but not if it costs accessibility.
In the current approach the ALT-attribute will most likely not serve
anymore.

I fully agree on the buckets philosophy.
If this problem is not solved in HTML 4.0 it is up to us to highlight this
if we are about to have negative spin offs.

In theory you are right, but 
A: Turning of pictures is only requested if line performance problems occur.
   This problem will disappear in the near future.
B: If GUI-users / designers use the ALT-attribute for alternate
   objectives GUI-specific rules will apply. This is the problem.
   So not a technical problem but a disign conflict.

I do hope my explanation is clear enough not to move this from the agenda.

Jaap
