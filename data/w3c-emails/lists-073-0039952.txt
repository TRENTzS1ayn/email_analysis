As an add-on to the discussion I would like to say waht we need
is the "tree-structure" with the "closed" and "expanded" behaviour
we know from windows.
This is (hidden) in the text (SCOPE-attribute), but if we want this 
why don't we say this more clearly to the HTML group?
This will be equivalent to what windows users are accustomed to.

The question was raised:

The first requirement is that the structure used by the designer is
clear. If so a standardized structure - like the tree- or tabsheet one -
helps especially the speech user to navigate faster.

Make sure the "jump on letter typed" option is always working !
 
Best regards,
