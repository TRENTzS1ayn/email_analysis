The question:

Browsing cell-to-cell only works if you are aware of the contents of
the table and if the table is not too complex.
When reading a table this way you must imagen very good what
the table is like. People who are not experienced "navigaters'
are normally not able to use this approach.
In many cases they are not able to use the table as presentation method
in braille or speech anyway since they miss the overview.
This does not concern the headers only, but also the size of the
table, rows and columns, and cells.

Best regards,
Jaap
