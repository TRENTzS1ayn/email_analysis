Follow up on earlier messages:

I would like to make following statements:
- Contraction and short hand writing is a personal wish.
  It can never be a generalized requirement.
- If contraction is of interest to someone be aware this is very
  language dependant.
- Be aware braille presentation is very much depending on local conditions
  like:
   - size of the braile display (number of cells)
   - Reading capabilities of the user (6-dot or 8-dot braille).
- Braille printing requires other layout rules than a braille display,
  but who prints these days?
   - Different page size
   - Different cell (many users prefer 6-dot braille on paper).

This implies local rules (CSS add-ons).

I leave the name of the media to psychologists.

Best regards,
Jaap
