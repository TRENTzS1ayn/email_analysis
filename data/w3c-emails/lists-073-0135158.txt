Jaap,
We put in the ALT ToolTip into IE3 to raise the "visibility" of the
importance of the attribute.  With IE4, we use the TITLE attribute if both
ALT and TITLE exist on the same element and ALT if TITLE is not present.

Using Active Accessibility, the same information is formatted into the Name
and Description properties of the MSAA interface.  Of course, the
information is also available through the Dynamic HTML object model.
-Chuck
