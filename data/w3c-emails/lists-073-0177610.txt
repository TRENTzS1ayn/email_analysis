Some of the suggested aural requirements in Or's draft appear to
be undesirable for universal access.

Consider:
         1. ProposeDefine user control over the rendering process
       When the browser renders tags it is important to define the level
       of control the user will have over the process.
       Users who frequently use the same WEB site normally know all that
       is going to be said in the beginning of the page. This information
       normally includes a welcome information and some instructions on
       how to use the site. Invariably, users will want at some point to
       skip those objects. The author of the application, on the other
       hand, may want to limit this capability and force the user to
       listen to anrecommend to the user to listen to the entire message.
       The need to do this is in case there are new instructions,
       promotions etc. We need a way for the author to specify whether to
       allow the user to go to a next tag.
       
It is better for accessibility if the author does not have the
last word.  The user should have ultimate control, with the
author indications acting as default in the absense of user overt
action.  This is discussed further in
