Dave answered this one yesterday:

The OBJECT element doesn't include an alt attribute since
the content of the OBJECT element is used as the fallback.
This allows for rich text descriptions to be given in place
including regular HTML elements such as paragraphs, lists
and hypertext links. The title attribute can be used for
a one-liner description of the OBJECT and would normally
be used on gui's as a tooltip for the object.
