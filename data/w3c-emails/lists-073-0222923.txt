Dear IPO/WAI participants:

Please remember that today, October 22, is the deadline for review comments
on the HW WG proposals of changes to HTML 4.0 and CSS2.  In particular
please note that we would appreciate further comments with regard to LINK
and META extensions.  Any comments past today we will have a decreasing
chance of integrating into the proposed HTML and CSS specifications.  

In addition, if you are planning on attending the November 10 and 11
Interest Group and Working Groups meeting for the IPO and WAI in Austin,
Texas, we would appreciate your registering by October 27.  

Thank you,

Judy
