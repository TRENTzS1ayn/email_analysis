not too terribly much...  navigation over cascading hierarchical menus is
slow and often frustrating--especially when backing up means closure of
child menus or putting one's screen access software into screen review...

there is still no substitute for the search-for-string, go-to-number and
other functions that all browsers _should_ provide to make navigating a 
flat list an expeditious experience...
