Gregory, your points are well taken and I advise that we do indeed have a
broad climate here, by broad I mean in this case down and up or
multiplatform rather than back or forward.  it is nice as you say to take
care of the forward because that perhaps in one way or annother is where
we are all headed eventually perhaps looking forward to the day when
streaming computers are the network and the device is not dependant on
cost or anyother inhibitting factor.  However.  as you well point out and
should be heeded today we face the challenge of what is and not
necessarily what ms wants to be the standard.  I propose that we take up
the challeng we've been handed in this model and attempt to develop a
parellel model.
