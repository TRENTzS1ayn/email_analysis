If we want to change the name from axes, I strongly
recommend using a name that immediately reflects the allowed
attribute values. As these are generally headers it follows
that the name should be "headers". In my opinion, keep-with
is just as obscure as axes and would confuse authors.

I therefore propose we rename axes to "headers"
