I'm with Dave on this one. I think it's also important in our proposals to
be sure that terminology proposed reflects standard syntax-like
descriptions. Remember, the majority of the people we are trying to "reach"
are *NOT* people with disabilities but rather the content
providers/publishers. So we need to produce proposals that reflect their
standard terminology. This is how we developed the ICADD standard. 

I have reviewed most of the current proposals; For the most part things
look okay, though I would appreciate a comment from Dave or Dan as to
whether these proposals are in proper format. Code examples look good, but
definitive terminology looks a little weak.

Having said that, I also know I should be more involved. I'm getting there
folks; just a little more time and the YRIF should be in great shape so I
contribute to the technical specs.

Regards,

Mike
