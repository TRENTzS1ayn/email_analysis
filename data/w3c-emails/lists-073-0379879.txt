I agree with Chuck and MZ on this as well, particularly when we make the
statement that ALT = Functional Description. Let's be clear even in our
examples. Likely technical writers will become more involved in the web
publishing process. As they do, the ALT attribute will parallel publishing
metaphors for table and figure descriptions. They'll be required to
implement short, meaningful and functional descriptions. Let's be sure to
reflect this in the code examples for V4.
