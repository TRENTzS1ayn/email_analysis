There is a proposal for a TSPAN which accomplishes a rectangular
select within a table in 

http://www.access.digex.net/%7Easgilman/web-access/TABLE/straw1.html

This element has to be in the tag-soup class, not the must-nest
class.  So to know what TSPAN you are closing, you need an ID.

This may break SGML parsers.

This is not part of the HC proposal -- even the small team never
got its hands around the idea.

Entifying a sub-rectangle in row and column coordinates is a very
useful thing to have.

But we can't rush it through and expect to do it right.

Sorry.
