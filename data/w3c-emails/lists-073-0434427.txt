Hi Chuck,
Thanks for your response on this subject.
A collegue of mine was so friendly to try something, but
the result was disappointing as far as IE4 is concerned.

I do hope the MSAA (with a MSAA-complient browser/screen reader
will do better).

Best regards,

---------------- HTML example:

The HTML example below refers to three GIFs.
1: has both a TITLE and an ALT attribute
2: only a TITLE
3: only an ALT attribute

1: If present the TITLE text is displayed as the TOOL TIP; OK
2: If no TITLE is present the ALT text is displayed as TOOL TIP;
   not perfect but ... a historical burden
3: The problems start when you do not ask for the GIFs:
   A: the GIF is not displayed; OK
   B: The ALT text is NOT displayed in place as usual; disappointing
   C: the TOOL TIP still works although the image is not there; 
      looks as a design bug as far as the UI is concerned.

All by all not promising.

Details:
IE4 version: 4.71.1712.6
