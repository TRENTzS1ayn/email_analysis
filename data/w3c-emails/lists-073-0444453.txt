All of those are the titles of the implicit DIV that follows.
You can do this with those titles on DIVs and the HR as the first
visible element in the DIV.

I do believe that we need a more general-purpose MARK element
(not just forcing A to do the job) for things like
print-page-number where the item clearly separates two things as
opposed to introducing something.  Actually, print-page-number
can be considered to enclose a SPAN of text.  But I think
consideration of a generic MARK can/should wait for a less
hurried review.

The other option you are up against is using DIV or SPAN to
separate things and assigning the HR or the verbal punctuation to
the DIV transition in a style.

As Gregg pointed out, we are in after-the-deadline time.  We had
a good telecon with HTML today.  Judy is the ultimate
authoritative source on where we stand re: HTML, but the general
tenor of the times is that they are marching ahead with our input
as requirements.  We have had our say as far as the "proposed
recommendation" baseline is concerned.  And the criteria for
changes get stiffer between "proposed recommendation" and
"recommendation."
