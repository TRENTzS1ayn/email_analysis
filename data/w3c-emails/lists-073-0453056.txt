aloha!

i too support a TITLE argument for horizontal rules, provided that the
explanation of how to use the TITLE appropriately is also included in
any discussion of using an ALT argument to signify a graphical line
break, so as to avoid meaningless ALT/TITLE texts such as:

horizontal rule
straight line
a line incorporating the olympic colors
squiggly decorative line

and the like...

when i have had occasion to use graphical dividers (i.e. red or green
bars), i have opted to either use the ALT tag either to mimic Lynx's
rendering of an HR

<p align=center><img src="redline.gif" height=4 width=600 
alt="_________________________________________________________________"></p>

if the division is a purely aesthetic one...  otherwise, i have used ALT
text in conjunction with a graphical rule/divider precisely because there 
currently is no TITLE argument for the HR which would enable me to indicate 
the purpose of the content that follows the divider, as in the following
example:

<p align=center><img src="redline.gif" height=4 width=600 
alt="The Fine Print: Please Read This Disclaimer at Least Once"></p>

or, when rendering an entire book, where it is often important to
communicate the actual pagination of the printed edition, i have resorted to 
using the ALT kludge:

<p align=center><img src="thinline.gif" height=1 width=600 
alt="Begin Printed Page 86"></p>

if the TITLE argument was adapted, it would then be possible to use the
less intrusive HR to indicate the printed edition's page breaks...
