ICADD had a series of Table enhancements that provided non-rendering
elements to HTML to help with "unrolling" or a programmatic interface to
the table.  I do not know the specifics, but maybe Mike Paciello would
give us an update on what ICADD had for HTML tables.

I do not think using ALT in a table would be a good idea.
