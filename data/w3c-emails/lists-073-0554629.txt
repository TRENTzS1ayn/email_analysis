In general I would agree  But I would think it would be better to say what 
the meaning of the pear-shaped bullet was.  If there were two bullet types 
and one meant "active" and one meant "archived"   then it would be better 
to just say the two words instead of describing the bullet shapes.  The 
exception might be if the two meanings took a long time to say and could 
not in any way be abbreviated..  then the bullet appearance might act as a 
short abbreviation....  But I would think you could always think of a short 
form or name for the two meanings.

to add a two bits worth:
if the bullets are different shapes or colors etc for different meanings,
that should be added such as "pearshaped bullet.".
does this make sense and there should be a short explanation for the
reader.  I've seen this on some web sites.  one thing means discontinued,
one means not available yet and annother ...
