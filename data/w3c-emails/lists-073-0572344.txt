Dear IPO/WAI Interest Group Participants:

Update on META and MEDIA:

META-

Opinion at this point after further discussion on META and RDF is that RDF
will be able to accommodate our needs, and to do so better than the META
proposal which would likely conflict with a planned META usage in the
upcoming XML; and that it will be available relatively soon.

The recommendation is therefore that we do not pursue META, but rather
within the FP WG which will pick up where the HC WG leaves off, that we
ensure that RDF fully addresses the accessibility needs.

MEDIA-

Editorial decision to go with TTY instead of console, due to lesser risk of
confusion.

Regards,

Judy
