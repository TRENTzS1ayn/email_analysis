To add to the educational aspect...
Jutta Treviranus and Jim Allan conducted a CSS workshop at Closing the Gap.
It was attended by more than 70 people. We had expected 20 to 30 people We
will probably be doing a preconference workshop on CSS and their utility
for persons with disabilities at CTG98. . All web based presentations were
extremely well attended. The need for information is great. Information
about the WAI was either given by the presenter or a participant in the
audience. The WAI's existance was news to almost all attendees.
