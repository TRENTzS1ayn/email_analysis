(I have combined some threads and renamed this "IPO Outreach.")

It is good to hear the positive response to the Web accessibility outreach,
and to see many different people involved in getting out the message on
accessibility.  I've also been presenting on the IPO and WAI to many
audiences since starting at the W3C in late September, and have received a
similarly positive response to these presentations.  As Mike is aware, I am
also presenting at FedWeb97 this week, so that audience will have no lack
of hearing about the WAI.

The official announcement by the U.S. National Science Foundation and the
World Wide Web Consortium last week of the IPO start-up received coverage
in a number of publications; I'll be compiling these on a link off the WAI
page (and the coming IPO page).  For now you can see the W3C press release
at http://www.w3.org/Press/IPO-announce & I will also send out in separate
mail to this list.  The PR efforts will help start the message again, and
we are planning additional PR to address different audiences.   

I'm not surprised that most audiences are still unfamiliar with the WAI; I
don't find it at all "ironic."  While the WAI was announced at WWW6 last
spring, I think most people are aware that pulling together the expected
government and industry funding takes time, and the key piece in terms of
outreach for the WAI has been having the IPO in place, which just happened
last month.  It is commendable that the W3C and the WAI WG participants
started the technical work in advance of receiving any funds, and that
different organizations have continued mentioning the WAI in press during
that time; however we can't have expected those efforts to get the message
out comprehensively.  That is what the IPO is now embarking on, and I look
forward to doing this as a joint effort.   

Regards,

Judy

I also agree with Mike that Web designers are, in general, very
enthusiastic about accessible design.
