The problem boils down to mathematics:

There is one HTML standard
There are 2 major browsers
There are several major HTML authoring tools
There are dozens of major accessibility aids
There are millions of web page designers

We try to twist the arms of the web page designers, but we will never
reach all of them.  Starting with IE, the browsers are becoming highly
accessible.  Let's work on the authoring tools and making sure that the
accessibility ISVs are using the features provided by the browsers.

Like Scott says, people think this is all cool, but when push comes to
shove, they will abandon "accessible design" in favor of cool graphics
and eye candy.

Hi,
I was wondering if anyone has been doing a long term follow-up
to
trainings on web accessibility.  A pattern I think I'm seeing
seems
to be:

1.  Attend workshop

2.  Be exposed to unexpected problems on web pages

3.  Be appreciative of the exposure

4.  Go back to work

5.  Realize the implications of the technology gap, i.e. extra
work,
    conflicts on whether to take advantage of modern
inaccessible technology

6.  Go into shock

7.  Do some easy stuff

8.  Put rest on "to do" list for when there's some free time


I ran into one attendee from the UC Berkeley workshop at a
coffee
shop who was fairly frustrated in trying to be accessible and be
current like her manager wants the site to be.  Her question was
who is responsible for making sure that accessibility is current
with the technology.  Is it her responsibility to compensate for
the failings of the technology world and/or the disabled world
in letting the technology gap develop?
