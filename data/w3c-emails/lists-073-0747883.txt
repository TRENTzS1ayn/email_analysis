Hi,
A question I keep running into is whether forms are accessible or not.
Some aspects to take in consideration are:

1.  If some blind computer users can access forms, are they accessible?

2.  If a person has a preferred screen reader which doesn't work with
    forms, are they accessible?

3.  If it takes blind computer users three times longer to use forms
    than sighted users, are forms accessible?

4.  If blind users make more errors using forms than sighted users,
    are forms accessible?


If forms are not considered accessible, what are the implications for
all those applications which let users interact with online databases?
Are all these applications inaccessible if forms are the only interface
provided?  Does this mean that for online systems, non-form based
interfaces must also be provided?

If forms are considered inaccessible, what are the implications
under 504, 508, ADA etc?

Scott
