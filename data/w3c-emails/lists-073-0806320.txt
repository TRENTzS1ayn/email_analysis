Since "bullet" essentially means "item" (or new item, or next item), and
"item" does not denote any hierarchical value (as does a numbered list),
then the use of ALT="Item: " to describe the function of a bullet seems
appropriate to me.  "Item" avoids the pain mentioned by Len in a product
list, telling people to order that strange "bullet, train" which is really
"Item: train".  Also, doesn't the colon-space give a slightly better pause
than a comma-space?
