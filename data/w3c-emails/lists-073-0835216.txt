Hi, I still want to know what the symbol is.  how do we find out if we
don't know to look at the source and such?
if you say item and I do agree that is what it means and it sure sounds
better and perhaps makes the text more meaningfull, but the question of
what symbol is being displayed is still there.  perhaps this goes into a
description catagory.
