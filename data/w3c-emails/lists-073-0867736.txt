I also agree with Chuck (and Mike)-- I think "item" is clearer than "bullet".  

For the record, I normally use outSPOKEN for the Mac, and it gives longer pauses for commas, not colons.  Thus, ALT="Item, " sounds better on my machine than ALT="Item: ".

I agree with Chuck. In fact, this is exactly what I stated in my last two
workshops. Everyone agreed and felt this provided a more accurate
description of the entity.
