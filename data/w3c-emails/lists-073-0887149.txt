Perfect.  Just the feedback we needed.

Unless I hear otherwise the guidelines will recommend

1)  that any graphics used as bullets have the alt text  "Item"   With a 
character to cause a pause after the word.

The two candidates are Comma and Semicolon.   Possibly with a space 
afterward to keep the word from running into the next word.

Couple of questions to close this one off

 - Is there a consensus that there should be "item"?  (I thought I got one 
but am not sure)
- Is comma the proper character for a pause.  It is longer but longer may 
not be better.  And Semicolon looks better visually and more natural so it 
might get included more.     Should we use Semicolon or comma?
- Is the space needed?  Can someone confirm?  Is it needed for comma?   Is 
it needed for Semicolon?


Thanks much.
