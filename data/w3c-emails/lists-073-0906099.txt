        Reply to:   RE>>ALT-attribute usage (fwd)

I vote for "Item."  Based on my experience with outSPOKEN, I also vote for the comma since it forces a decent (but not long) pause in the reading of the text.  To keep things as clear as possible, I think it's important to have a pause after the text tag.  I just ran several tests and found that outSPOKEN doesn't seem to care if there are spaces after the comma.  the pause is the same after no space, one space, two spaces or more.  But outSPOKEN does not pause at all after a semicolon, regardless of spaces.

To confuse the issue a bit further... when it encounters a period, outSPOKEN drops its pitch slightly.  Therefore, inserting a period after a text tag might make it clearer that the text tag has ended.  Maybe a period is a better seperator?

Perfect.  Just the feedback we needed.

Unless I hear otherwise the guidelines will recommend

1)  that any graphics used as bullets have the alt text  "Item"   With a 
character to cause a pause after the word.

The two candidates are Comma and Semicolon.   Possibly with a space 
afterward to keep the word from running into the next word.

Couple of questions to close this one off

 - Is there a consensus that there should be "item"?  (I thought I got one 
but am not sure)
- Is comma the proper character for a pause.  It is longer but longer may 
not be better.  And Semicolon looks better visually and more natural so it 
might get included more.     Should we use Semicolon or comma?
- Is the space needed?  Can someone confirm?  Is it needed for comma?   Is 
it needed for Semicolon?


Thanks much.

Gregg
