I would prefer a period or colon.  Remember that accessibility should
mean accessibility to the *sighted*, as well as the non-; "Item, Shoes
for sale" looks goofy and ungrammatical.  "Item. Shoes..." and "Item:
Shoes..." are both grammatically acceptable.  If they don't sound good
in a screen reader, I would venture that the screen reader has bugs,
since these are sensical uses of English punctuation.
