Hi, Al
What I originally brought up is whether forms could be considered accessible
to blind people.  Some aspects are:

1.  If some blind computer users can access forms, are they accessible?

2.  If a person has a preferred screen reader which doesn't work with
    forms, are they accessible?

3.  If it takes blind computer users three times longer to use forms
    than sighted users, are forms accessible?

4.  If blind users make more errors using forms than sighted users,
    are forms accessible?

Blind users have a wide range of success using buttons on forms depending
on the combination of screen reader and browser.

You mentioned Lynx as being accessible.  However, suppose that the form
uses Javascript.  I think that Lynx would have problems.


If a legal challenge was needed in the future, on what basis could it be
stated that web pages are (or are not) accessible?

Scott
