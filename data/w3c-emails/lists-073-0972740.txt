I disagree with this - so if I have a picture of a furry dog as my list
item graphic, I as an HTML author need to always use "Item" as the ALT
attribute?  Isn't this a misuse of the ALT attribute?  

Via the HTML object model and Active Accessibility, screen readers will
know they are talking to a list item already.  This guideline only helps
down level browsers and certain screen readers with the *visual*
presentation of the list item.

I fear that this kind of guideline only makes adoption less likely by
being confusing.

Perfect.  Just the feedback we needed.

Unless I hear otherwise the guidelines will recommend

1)  that any graphics used as bullets have the alt text  "Item"
With a 
character to cause a pause after the word.

The two candidates are Comma and Semicolon.   Possibly with a
space 
afterward to keep the word from running into the next word.

Couple of questions to close this one off

 - Is there a consensus that there should be "item"?  (I thought
I got one 
but am not sure)
- Is comma the proper character for a pause.  It is longer but
longer may 
not be better.  And Semicolon looks better visually and more
natural so it 
might get included more.     Should we use Semicolon or comma?
- Is the space needed?  Can someone confirm?  Is it needed for
comma?   Is 
it needed for Semicolon?


Thanks much.
