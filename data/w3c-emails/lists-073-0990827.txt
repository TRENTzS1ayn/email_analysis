Probably not, ipso facto, their inclusion or exclusion of forms.

That question is too broad to have a yes/no answer.  As you said,

We want to move that distribution until it is clustered at the
"high degree of success" end.  To do that maybe we should try to
learn what it is that does and doesn't work.  It's not so simple
as being a form or not being a form.  We probably need to take a
variety of cases and examine them in more detail.  Then maybe we
can learn how to discipline both the composition of the forms and
the behavior of the user equipment so that usability is the norm,
not pot luck.

I imagine that is what the groups working with Jon, Chuck and
Gregg are setting out to do.
