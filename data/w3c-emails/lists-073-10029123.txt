Len,

I did the same thing.. but I didn't ask for a donation, I just told him
about w3's internet site, and that he needed to improve his skills. I
figure a little education wouldn't hurt. <grin>

I haven't gotten a reply either.

I think his method of intimidation stinks, but the general idea of the
business is sound. I am trying to make accessibility conversions into a
viable business too.  Although I won't spam, I do send a suggestion for
improvement to inaccessible sites with the note that there is more that can
be done, and I can help them do it.

Hopefully he'll figure out that spam doesn't work as a marketing tool, it
just burns out the potential market.
