Hi-
I am looking forward to participating on the afternoon web accessibility
panel for Thursday, April 16 at 2:30 p.m. (Panel 5, M4.)  A lot has
transpired since my W6 presentation on the City of San Jose's web
accessibility efforts and so I look forward to sharing and learning about
implementation challenges.
