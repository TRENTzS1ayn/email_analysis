Chuck: "No one person at Microsoft signs off on software.  This will
(hopefully) never be the case.  We have implemented a series of
initiatives to help make sure Microsoft  follows best practices with
regard to accessibility.

"One of them is a accessible design checklist that each product group
will be held to by regular reviews conducted by Bill Gates and Paul
Martiz."

Before any software is released surely *someone* "signs off".  A product
cannot possibly be released until it is "ready" and that readiness must
be after somebody in a position of responsibility approves.

The question remains if the person (people, committee, whatever) who
attests to that "readiness" considers accessibility a factor before
giving approbation?

You seem to be giving the answer as to the question of "where does the
buck stop" and that answer seems to be "Bill Gates and Paul Martiz." 
Now perhaps one of them (or someone speaking for one of them) can answer
some of the perseverant questions raised in the email surrounding the
release of IE 4.whatever and subsequent concerns raised by the
disability community.

It is a great relief to hear that MS is going to be in the forefront of
providing accessible products.  If this promise is fulfilled it will
mark a new era in the field.  However, if this is not a genuine "good
faith effort" then a curse on both your houses!
