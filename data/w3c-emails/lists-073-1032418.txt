Hi, Al
Yes, I pretty much agree with you.  The combination of browser and access
technology is variable in providing successful access to different types of
forms.  This variability is frustrating for web site developers who want
to make their web sites accessible.

Unfortunately, the current murkiness of whether forms are or not accessible
probably means that it will be harder for an individual to prove that a web
site using forms provided by entities covered by ADA Title II or Title
is not in compliance.
