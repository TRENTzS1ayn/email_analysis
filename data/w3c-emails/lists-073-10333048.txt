An on-line data base devoted to web accessibility was launched last month
by the Australian government. The URL is http://accessability.noie.gov.au/
(note to screen reader users: the word "accessibility" in the above URL is
misspelled; apparently this was a deliberate policy decision which I
personally consider to be somewhat ill-informed, given that, for example,
the DECTALK synthesizer pronounces "accessibility" and "accessability"
almost identically).

The data base is quite comprehensive and includes a description of each
entry.
