well: this should be a good hammer to go hit the search
vendors with.

The gratuitous use of Javascript is really irritating, and
in general I've avoided Netscape's server products because
the configuration step is so inaccessible --in addition to
the products themselves being inconsiderate of someone who
is blind.

My personal favorite  search engine is Altavista.

The engine is powerful, and it is easy to customize and
configure its look and feel.
And it delivers powerful searching without doing a
javascript song and dance on your screen.
