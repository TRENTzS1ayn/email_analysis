PW WebSpeak 1.4.3 will read through to the bottom of the page regardless of 
the length on a graphical browser.  I am interested to hear the opinions of 
others about the placement of navigation bars at the top or the bottom.

Subject:  Placing generic navigation links

Is there any consensus on the following, or has anyone had experience or
done usability studies to determine which is better for accessible web
design:

For a site that has a standard set of links on every page (e.g. Home |
Products | Employment | Contacts), is it better for accessibility to
have those linkes at the top of every page or at the bottom?

Does the answer change if seeing/hearing the bottom of the page will
occasionally require scrolling the page? In other words, the user may
get used to browsing the site without needing to scroll and then
unknowingly come to a page where either the standard links or the
non-standard links are not visible/screen-readable without scrolling.

Thanks,
 -- Paul
