Hello!

I just asked that question to a visually impair co-workers. His opinion 
is that it's better in the bottom. His reason is that if you put it on the 
top you'll have to read them on braille terminal or hear them in 
systhesis before getting to the matter of the page. Some pages may 
have 5 or 10 of that links and thus it takes some time. In bottom, you 
could browse to it if needed and not be bothered when you don't 
want to!

Regards
