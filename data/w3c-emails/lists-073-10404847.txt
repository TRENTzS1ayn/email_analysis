I prefer the links at the bottom of the page for many reasons, not the
least of which is that I'm usually at the bottom of the page when I decide
I want to leave it and go somewhere else - after I've read what is there on
the page. Several screen readers read through a page whether or not it is
all on the screen, and I like the fact that in MSIE WinVision automatically
reads a full page on its own from top to bottom without keystrokes so that
I wouldn't have to do anything until the bottom of the screen if that was
where the menu was located.
