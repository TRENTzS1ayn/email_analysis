for screenreaders which allow for inflection, a period is deffinitely a
way to go, but I submit that screenreaders are highly configurable these
days and can be told to speak punctuation so in the event that there is
punctuation after or inside an alt tag, they can have it spoken or not.
different screenreaders behave differently and have different setting
capabilities so cannot be gaged as to the overall effectiveness as to one
punctuation mark or annother.  Perhaps thre's something in the dictionary
link spoken of on this list early such that when the browser encounters an
alt tag, it will say alt or description et al.
also hint, the screen can be explored one character at a time.
