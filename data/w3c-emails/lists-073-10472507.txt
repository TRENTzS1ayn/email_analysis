Hello,

Today, I created a forum at Deja News where we can discuss 
things online.  It's our own forum and is called:

dejanews.members.career.rbutters.access-disabilities

and I described it like this:

    To identify, access and report resources needed and found
valuable by  
individuals in the higher education community with disabilities.
Forum seeks  
to place emphasis on interaction with students, professors,
administrators     
and specialists and resources not found elsewhere.    
    
Major questions guiding discussions are:    
    
What references have participants found to be valuable that can
be shared     
with others? 
    
Relative to the expressed current informational needs of
participants, where  
can relevant resources be found?    
    
Identification and disclosure of immediate concerns and helpful
Internet     
resources are the highest priorities.
