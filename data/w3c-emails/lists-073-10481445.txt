I tried this and I had some problems registering using Lynx.
The form says that required fields are in "red", but I don't
see any red text on my screen.  For some reason I can't
specify anything for my occupation or industry.

Once I completed the entire form (since I had no way to know
what was required or not), I submitted it, but DejaNews
refused to accept my registration information, and kept
bouncing me back to the same form I'd just completed.

So I'm afraid I can't be joining you on the disability
access discussion group, since it seems to be inaccessible
to lynx users.
