Yes
A work in progress.
Does allow the page author to view his/her page from a different

Does not necessarily agree in all aspects with W3C's guidelines.
Program maintainers are responsive and willing to look at(and fix) any
problems found with the way they are checking the page.
An end-all validator? No
An excellent guideline? Yes
