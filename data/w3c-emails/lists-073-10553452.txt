KRISTOPHER:

One of the best tools for testing pages against the W3C's page authoring
guidelines for Accessibility is BOBBY, available at:

http://www.cast.org/bobby/bobby.html

Note that you can select which browser you are testing for (including
multiple versions), then get either graphically marked up or text-only
results with very detailed errors and suggestions for how to change the
page to both match standard markup and make the page more accessible.  

Also, there is an excellent tool for previewing in MS Internet Explorer or
Netscape Communicator what a page will look like in Lynx at:

Good luck, and let me know if you have any questions...
