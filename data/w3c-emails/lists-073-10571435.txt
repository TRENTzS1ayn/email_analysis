In my opinion, general navigational links at the top of each web page of
a site have become one of the most significant usability barriers to
browsing the web.  I have not found any reliable technique with a screen
reader to skip such links and get to the unique content of a page.  Thus
tedious and time-consuming navigation past those links is necessary to
determine whether a page is of particular interest to me.

I prefer that pages other than those intended as a table of contents do
not include general site-navigation links.  If enough sighted users
depend on such links for their usability, however, I prefer that the
links be placed either at the bottom of the page or in a separate frame.

The best compromise I've encountered, however, is on the web site of the
American Council of the Blind (http://www.acb.org).  Site navigation
links are at the top of each page, but the very first link allows one to
skip such links and go to the unique content of the page.  I suggest 
this approach as a W3C accessibility/usability guideline.

Regards,
Jamal

   NFor a site that has a standard set of links on every page (e.g.
   NHome | Products | Employment | Contacts), is it better for
   Naccessibility to have those linkes at the top of every page or at
   Nthe bottom?
   NDoes the answer change if seeing/hearing the bottom of the page will

   Nmay get used to browsing the site without needing to scroll and then
   Nunknowingly come to a page where either the standard links or the
   Nnon-standard links are not visible/screen-readable without
   Nscrolling.
