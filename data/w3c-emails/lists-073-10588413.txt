Just my 2 cents on this..... small sites may be able to live with this
kind of guideline, but, as a person working on several large sites, I
can tell you this is not really very feasible.  A site with 10 major
departments will most likely have 5 or 10 subsections, if you bypass the
navigation, you will never experience anything past the first few pages.
Some of us go out of our way to incorporate the navigation into the
overall look and feel of a site, making graphics multipurpose.  Kind of
like having a web site and not submitting it to the engines, no one
knows where it is, same concept, you  have a beautiful site no one can
navigate.

Navigational aides have traditionally been placed at the bottom of each
page...was there something wrong with that method? I thought it worked
real well in Lynx
