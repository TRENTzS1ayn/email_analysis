Thanks to all of you who responded.

The responses are more consistent than I would have guessed, as
summarized below:

* Zero specifically prefer generic links at the top.
* Many specifically prefer links at the bottom.
* Several don't care, as long as it's possible to get past any top links
quickly.

In short, good accessible design should require little or no user-action
at the top of the page to get to the meat of the page-specific content.
On a table-of-contents page, that meat may be the site's general links,
but on subsequent pages the generic links should probably be placed at
the bottom, but if placed at the top a mechanism should be provided to
quickly skip over them.
