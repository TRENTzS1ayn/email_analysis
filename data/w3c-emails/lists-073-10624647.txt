Maybe they're experts in the some fields, but not necessarily
experts in designing accessible web pages?  Maybe they don't
_know_ that they can offer additional information to their
blind users by using d-links or similar code?

It's easier to believe that, than to believe they were presented
with the option of including d-links and made a conscious decision
against using them.

Why not write and ask, though?
