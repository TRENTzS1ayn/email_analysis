Nir solution is, using tables, what I recommend people do using frames: 
Have a side (or top or bottom) frame of navigation links, use proper 
NOFRAMES to allow people in to the body of the site, and include a 
redundant set of navigation links at the bottom of each content page for 
those not using frames-enabled browsing.
