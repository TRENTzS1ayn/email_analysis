regarding the debate of using the word "item" vs. "bullet".   Here are
some more arguments in favor of "bullet".

First,   the word "bullet" can mean "list item" in common parlance.  At
least, that's how it's used around here.  For example, if someone is
giving a viewgraph presentation, someone in the audience may ask:

"I have a question about that third bullet"

The person in the audience is talking about the third list item,
of course, not the little black dot.  


Second, I think it's more useful to use concrete images when a
blind and sighted person are communicating. For example, suppose a
sighted and blind pereson are each viewing a page which as several
headings, several big pictures, and a bullet list.  If the blind person
says "third bullet" the sighted person will immediately know what the
blind person was referring to.  But if the blind person says "third
item" the sighted person wouldn't know whether the blind person means
third heading, image, list item, or what.   .


In general, in my experience, sighted people tend to have
problems thinking abstractly about page content so the more concrete we
make it for them the better   So that's why it's important for blind
folks to know what the sighted folks are seeing so they can
appropriately accommodate them.

By  the way, if you're sighted, please don't take offence.  I'm
sighted myself.
