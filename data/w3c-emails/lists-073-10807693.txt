hi all, 

this was not how i wanted to delurk, but i am absolutely dumbfounded to find
that the result of joining a w3c mailing list is that i start getting junk
email like the three i received today... presumably everyone on all w3c
lists got it since the to: address seems to be @w3.org.

is there not some way of reconfiguring the mailserver at w3.org so that spam
sent to @w3.org doesn't get through? does anyone on this list know who to
contact wrt sorting this out?

anyway, having finished moaning, i should introduce myself.

my name is Wayne Myers, i work for BBC Education Online in London as a 'Web
Assistant', which means i do HTML, Perl and whatever else is going. i am
currently working on a thing called the Betsie project, which is an attempt
at resolving some of the quite serious accessibility problems associated
with various parts of the BBC Online offering by pushing all pages through a
CGI script that alters the page mark-up so as to improve their suitability
for text-speech browsing. Betsie will shortly be entering the test phase, at
which point i shall post the url to this list...

i was just wondering if anyone knew of anything that already does what i'm
hoping to get Betsie to do. i couldn't find anything similar, but that
doesn't mean anything...

cheers etc.,

wayne
