Anyone care to take a look at my idea?  It's at my own homepage,
http://www.idyllmtn.com/~kynn/, and relies on stylesheets working
"correctly" in browsers (or not working at all).  Which means you
can use MSIE 4 to get the full effect, Lynx to get the "degrade
gracefully" effect (d-links on), and if you're using Netscape 4,
you're screwed because they got stylesheets dead wrong.
