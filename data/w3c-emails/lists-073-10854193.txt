When I am browsing your site with a palm-top (300x150 display) a 640x480 
pop-up will annoy the hell out of me, in the same way as a 750x??? table 
with a message saying 'best viewed at 800x600'

This is what, in the Guidelines, would be a priority 3 item - it doesn't 
make the site inaccessible as such, it just makes it annoying to use. 
(where priority 2 is the stuff is accessible, but presents major problems 
to some group(s) of users, and priority 1 means if you don't do this, 
some group CANNOT access your site)

The relative font sizes thing I mentioned to Sue is similar. A slight 
difference is that people with low vision (for example me at the end of 
the day) may wish to set their base font size at 16 points. If you format 
a font to be 10 points, because that is smaller than the 12 points you 
used for your normal font, it makes my life difficult. If you format its 
size as 80% then it is a bit smaller than whatever I use as my standard.
