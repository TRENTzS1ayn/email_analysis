This works pretty well if you have a stylesheets browser. It also works 
well on a browser which uses neither stylesheets nor images. If it were 
used on a stylesheets enabled version of Lynx, then there would be no 
dlinks, unless the user had a stylesheet to override this.

It also provides the little [d] links on IE2, Netscape 3 (For my version 
of communicator it worked - Netscape is unpredictable about stylesheets) 
and other graphics-based, non stylesheet-enabled browsers. For me this 
ain't a problem, but I would be hesitant about trying to sell it...

Another possiblity raised before is to use <A HREF="blah.htm" 
REL="DLINK">. This is analagous to the REL attribute for LINK, but also 
relies on browsers understanding the particular REL - it is good for the 
future but doesn't solve the problem for the past.

My preferred solution for the future is to depreacate the IMG element and 
use OBJECT, which allows for full-blown HTML content, like the following:
<OBJECT DATA="some.mov">
 <OBJECT DATA="some.jpg">
  <A HREF="some.mov">See the movie
  <IMG SRC="some.jpg" ALT="of the picture"></A>
 </OBJECT>
</OBJECT>
  <A HREF="dsome.htm" TITLE="D-Link for some.mov and some.jpg"><IMG 
SRC="dot.gif" 
     ALT="D-link"></A> 
<!-- OBJECT does not have facility for a longdesc as such. Where the 
object is complex, or there is a cascade of OBJECTS it would be nice to 
have all the options. -->

(which allows for all browsers) or

<OBJECT DATA="some.jpg">
this could be a lovely picture of me <A HREF="dsome.htm" 
TITLE="D-link">(description available)</A>
</OBJECT>

(Which only allows for HTML 4 capable browsers. MSIE 4 does a goodly bit 
of this, Netscape 4 does a little bit)
