I have had another go at my thoughts, and come up with a list of dont's, 
which I have added.

These are still no substitute to understanding the guidelines proper. 
They are a mug's guide (ie I wrote them to try and clarify my own ideas 
for myself).

The idea was something like Bobby, but processed by a human (which means 
it can be applied to virtual pages as well as real ones). But I didn't 
realise that until afterwards.
