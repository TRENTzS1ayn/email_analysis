I welcome the various sets of guidelines on accessible web pages,
even if some are contradictory!  What we do not seem to have, however,
are sets of real example good and bad web pages.  I'm thinking in terms,
say, of running a course in accessible webpage design and providing
real web pages (need not be anything large!) as examples of both.  One 
thing I get confused about myself is TABLEs.  Bobby pretty much frowns
on tables alltogther but many sites claiming to be accessible use them.
I do not find tables much of a problem with Lynx myself. I understand 
the problems with using a left hand pane of a table as a list of quick 
links - mainly, under Lynx these popup first and make it awkward to get 
to the content quickly.

So, examples are what we need so we can say, 'no, look at this - this 
is the way to do it.'

Anyone know of any?
