It is not backed up by any statistics.  But if you look at the e-mail 
lists of various screen reader manufacturers, Guispeak and Guitalk, 
Webwatch-l, etc., note what is being discussed at consumer 
conventions, and also consider how many blind people do not have shell 
accounts, the other browsers are being used a lot.  This doesn't mean 
that everyone is happy with the results.  But it does mean that people 
can play audio files and painlessly download stuff, which were 
difficult or impossible through a shell.  Now I realize that Lynx can 
run on your own computer through PPP, and that's what I do, under DOS 
and Win95.  But you have to jump through a lot of hoops to make this 
work, and the windows browser/screen reader combination turns out to 
be easier for most people in most places.  If XML and stylesheets 
really take hold of the web, and new people don't come forward to do 
Lynx programming, Lynx will become less and less useful over the next 
2 to 3 years.
