actually that is good to hear -- as a long time listener of
the World Service I was disgusted by their WWW site.

At one point there was a message here soliciting access
feedback  and stating that the  BBC was "interested" -- but
both then and earlier all I got for in return 
for writing to them was a canned reply.

And their site has more than alt text problems, they abuse
tables extensively and it would take a major AI project to
extract any kind of structure out of their pages.
