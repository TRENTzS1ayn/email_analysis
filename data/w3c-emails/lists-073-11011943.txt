You're right, Lee, examples will help us. I'll be happy to send what I
find as I work, as I also am developing such a course for my university.

As for tables, I often use them to limit column widths for the sake of
readability by _all_ persons. Style sheets are the better answer, though,
and it will be good when more of the web surfing population gets browsers
that support style sheets.

Good luck,

- tom
