Lynx (at leat our copy) handles tables, just not the same way a
graphical browser does. Lynx throws columns underneath each other
correct? This allows screen readers to keep the columnar confusion that 
McCathieNevile described.

BTW, tables- although they were intended for support of columnar data,
were as page formatting kludges in one of the early Arena demos out of
CERN or an early W3C site correct?
