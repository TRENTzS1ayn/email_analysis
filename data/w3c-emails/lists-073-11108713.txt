Nir (I think) said:
I think everybody will agree that tables are better than imagemaps...

CMcCN::
No. I don't. Image maps can (and should) be provided with ALT text for each 
AREA, which makes it simple to deal with a text-only version. For people 
whose alternative is (flawed) screen readers TABLE may not be better.

I do agree that use of images as links is not a really great practise -  
it often causes problems for fully sighted people (http://www.cfd.rmit.edu.au
used to be my example, but I haven't looked for a while) who cannot 
understand how (for example) a light bulb is supposed to imply a gallery, 
or five horizontal bars an image.

A preferable solution is to avoid TABLE as a layout mechanism completely, 
and to provide alternatives to imagemaps.
