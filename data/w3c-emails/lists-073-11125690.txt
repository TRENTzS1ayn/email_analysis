Thank you for your comments.  I agree that tables were not orginally
intended for page layout, but they have been coopted for that purpose.   I
don't think WAI should encourage the use of tables for layout, but I think
WAI should ignore the current practice in the use of tables for layout in
the development of guidelines.
Jon
