> Is numbering the list items important for navigation?


When I polled about this earlier this year a Lynx fan pointed out to me
that having numbers in the list alt tags would be confusing when
listening to lynx with link numbers turned on, since the alt tag numbers
would conflict with the lynx numbers..  In other words, numbers could
hurt navigation.
