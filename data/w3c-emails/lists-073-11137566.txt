I tend to agree with this view.

To me, the use of tables for layout is not going to go away in HTML;
therefore, a more profitable direction would be to fix the relatively few
number of screen readers, rather than the nigh-unto-infinite number of web
pages.

Thanks to Charles McCathieNevile for the excellent example of the problem
with how screen readers deal with HTML content.  Why (he asked, getting
ready to duck) are screen readers so stupid?  A table of contents in a
left-most table cell is tagged as an identifiable HTML block.  Why haven't
any of the screen readers been written to deal with HTML blocks, instead of
just reading across and down?
