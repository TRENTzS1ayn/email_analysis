JRG: Screen readers are designed to be a general purpose access to where
WWW browsing is only one of several tpes of software.  Some browsers are
getting smarter.  Henter-Joyce JAWS program manipulates the DOM of explorer
3.0 to relayour pages so there more accessible.

A table of contents in a

JRG: I think we could ask authors to mark what the tables are being used so
that the rendering of the document could take into account the intedned use
of the table.
