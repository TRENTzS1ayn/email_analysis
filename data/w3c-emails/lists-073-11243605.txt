Hello Dr Weil

That set of WebReview charts you pointed us to is extremely useful. I was
most disappointed to find that my newly-discovered "float" property, which
enabled me to position graphics without tables, turned out to be on the
"danger" list however!

Rats. Back to the drawing board...

The trend of the discussions on tables here seem to suggest it is acceptable
to use a table if the first column is a graphic with a properly tagged
hypertext link and the second column is the written description of the
destination. Going by the simulation Charles gave us, that would read okay
in a screen reader.

Do I have that right?

Sue
