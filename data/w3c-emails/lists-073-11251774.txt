On 11 aug, I will be providing a workshop for "designing web pages for 
accessibility" in the DC metro area (alexandria, va) for the DC Webmasters 
which is now a part of the Association of Internet Professionals (AIP).

The audience will be mostly novices when it comes to accessibility and a 
mixture of experiences.  Does anyone have any material that I could use or 
anything they think should be included. I will be demo-ing lynx, 
pwWebSpeak, bobby (do not yet have winvision or jaws).  Showing people how 
to get information...Lighthouse, WAI, WAI Page Authoring, Trace, etc

This will serve more as an overview and discuss the tools and areas that 
are associated with accessibility design. I will have excerpts from bobby. 

We need to spread the word and everyone has to start sometime!  At time 
there are no guests with disabilities; however, if you would like to attend 
to provide feedback (on the discussion and demo) or provide a short 
presentation and also a discussion after the presentation, pls let me know. 
 Right now, the format has not been set...

Braddock Metro Station is the closest stop and we can discuss 
transportation to EEI which is located on the north side of old town.

...looking for comments and welcome all input and discussion :)

cheers  rob
