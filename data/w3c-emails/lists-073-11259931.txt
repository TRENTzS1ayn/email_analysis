how does JFW and winvision handle Acronyms for those NOT using or designing 
to HTML 4.  In pwWebSpeak, I must separate the letters and slow down the 
speed...

For example DOL stands for Department of Labor and pwWebSpeak reads this as 
"DOLL"  so we put a space inbetween the letters.

Also do they recognize state abbreviations, for example, "VA" is 
"Virginia".
I have just loaded but not played with pwWebSpeak 2, but in the previous 
versions it might be read "VA" as Virginia but miss "AL" for Alabama.

How does WinVision handle abbreviations and state abbreviations?
