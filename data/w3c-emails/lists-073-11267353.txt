would really like to attend.

Reply:  August 11 at EEI Communications in Alexandria. For directions and 
information, please go to http://www.eeicom.com/dcwebmasters/news.html

EEI does a great job hosting the DC Webmasters.  If you have any specific 
questions or want to clarify any particular building accessibility or 
transportation needs, please e-mail myself or Candee.

Also, may be a good idea to let Candee know if you plan to attend, so she 
can have a head count!

Cheers, rob
