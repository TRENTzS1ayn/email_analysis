ALT attributes will be needed for the foreseeable future.  For example.
Let's say I have a web page with a spinning red globe and nothing else using
the following source code:

<HTML>
<BODY>
<A HREF="http://www.foobar.com"><IMG SRC="globe.gif" TITLE="this is the
entry to the Foo Bar"></A>
</BODY>
</HTML>

Note that there is no ALT attribute for the image.  Existing screen readers,
using Active Accessibility (which exposes the HTML object model of IE3 and
soon IE4) will know the following about the image:

Type = Graphic
Name = "this is the entry to the Foo Bar"
Description = blank
Value = http://www.foobar.com <http://www.foobar.com> 
State = focusable, link

If TITLE wasn't present, the name wouldn't be known either.  My point is
that ALT is needed to give a *description* of the image.  In this example,
that could be ALT="spinning red globe".  With the advent of TITLE, we can go
back to using ALT for it's original intention.

Of course, they don't have to use Active Accessibility - a screen reader
could talk to the existing object models present in the major browsers.

those browsers which are developped to be truly accessible will not
need
alt tags.  browsers which are here now have been and will be here
for a
long time to come need a text map of some sort which can be totally
ignored by those who do not need them.
