both screenreaders have dictionaries to which you can add speaking rules.
a rule might look like this:
word rule
dol d o l
the first line is the header line to show what is what.  the actual rule
would look like this:
dol d o l
or:
 dol department of labor
however, if you type:
MR.
you will hear mister.
gee, I wonder what happens if you type mr.y
<grin>
