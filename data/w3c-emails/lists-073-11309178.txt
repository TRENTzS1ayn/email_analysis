We used dashes outside of the link on our site map to separate the links. 
 However, I was later informed that if punctuation was set to none that the 
use of dashes and pipes might not really help.  However, to my knowledge, 
this is the best fix.  The page is 
http://www.dol.gov/dol/esa/public/programs/dbra/toc-text.html.  As I recall 
it was also necessary to put a space between the dash or pipe and the link.

Subject:  Bobby Error Message - How to fix it?

One of our pages gets a Bobby error message saying that "adajacent links
must be separated."  Does anyone know how to do this?  Someone suggested
that I  use a pipe | symbol between the links.  If this is true, then I
didn't put in the correct place, because it did not work. Our website is
located at www.ladse.k12.il.us.  The particular problem page can be
reached from "About LADSE" and then linking to "Member Districts."  Any
help will be appreciated.
