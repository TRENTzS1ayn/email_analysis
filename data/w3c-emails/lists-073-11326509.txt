Hi, Debbie, the general idea is that when you have two text links
next to each other, you can't tell where the first link stops or
the next one starts.  E.g.:

About LADSE Member Districts

That could be: (About) (LADSE) (Member) (Districts), or (About)
(LADSE Member Districts), or (About LADSE Member) (Districts),
or (About) (LADSE Member) (Districts), or...

As you can see, the inclusion of ()s helps greatly in conveying
what I meant.  The same is true on the web.  You can do something
like this:

About LADSE | Member Districts

or you can do something like this:

[ About LADSE ] [ Member Districts ]

I usually end up with this, myself:

[ About LADSE | Member Districts ]

(Using these pieces of text as the example -- I know that you
probably don't have them next to each other in practice.)
