This is a long shot for this list...but is anyone out there developing on 
Netscape Enterprise Server and using LiveWire Pro (Server-Side Java Script) 
to run queries against the database.  We have run into a problem with the 
sql calls and they are handled by Internet Explorer and Netscape browser. 
 Was also wondering if anyone uses lynx or other browsers to submit queries 
supported by Server-Side Java Scripting and Netscape Enterprise Server on 
live sites!  We want to identify any problems that may have been 
encountered by previous developers for graphical and non-graphical 
browsers!

We have run into a snag and would like to discuss offline.  It is probably 
because we are infants in developing Server-Side Java Scripts and Netscape 
Web Server....
