I disagree, in fact, it is possiblt to include 'Alt' tags for each 'Area' 
tag. Not only the that, imagemaps were and are intended for low bandwidth. 
 The bear fact of slicing up images into little pieces to fit in cells 
can't be less work than the map production itself

This is just one example:
<!--webbot bot="ImageMap" polygon="(29,14) (100,16) (88,46) (31,36) 
http://foo"
src="images/layout3.jpg" width="319" height="215" alt=" Foobar"
alt="layout3.jpg (3607 bytes)" border="0" -->
