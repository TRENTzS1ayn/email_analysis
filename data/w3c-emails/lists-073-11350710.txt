When text is linked and separated by a space, we separate with a pipe or 
something to make it distinct.  Say we have a bunch of images in 
side-by-side layout AND we are NOT using a table.  Do we also include a 
separator with the alt tag.  ...Looking to see how on other browsers and 
tools handle this ( that I do not have)

Building upon shurel's example, this would be something like this...
alt="- layout3.jpg (3607 bytes) - "

I disagree, in fact, it is possiblt to include 'Alt' tags for each 'Area'
tag. Not only the that, imagemaps were and are intended for low bandwidth.
 The bear fact of slicing up images into little pieces to fit in cells
can't be less work than the map production itself

This is just one example:
<!--webbot bot="ImageMap" polygon="(29,14) (100,16) (88,46) (31,36)
http://foo"
src="images/layout3.jpg" width="319" height="215" alt=" Foobar"
border="0" -->
