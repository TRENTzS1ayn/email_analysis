The Government Computer News, July 20,1998 has and article, "Web Page 
Authoring Software, Feds say easy formatting is out-of-sight" by Richard 
Walker.

There is a matrix that says "What features do you consider when choosing 
Web Page Authoring software".  The list does not contain any features that 
would help it be compliant with the American Disabilities Act.  Once more, 
this matrix lends proves that ADA is not on many Agencies or Federal Web 
Designer's priority list.  For example, besides the ALT Tag, as a minimum, 
I want the ability to edit the HTML so I can add table summarys, titles, 
etc...  There is also no mention of the ability of web authoring software 
to assist the author in developing ADA compliant code....  Wouldn't it be 
great if Composer or FrontPage allowed you to add table summary, row and 
column ids, titles, etc....  HotMetal Pro is a relational database and does 
not permit you to touch the code.  You have to exit and edit the code then 
re-import.   I havent used hotdog since the 2 release.

Suggest GCN provide an article that discusses the ADA compliance issues and 
the interviews persons with disabilities, highlights tools, WAI, etc...

I copied the editor's e-mail address.  If enough people write in and voice 
an opinion, maybe we can convince them to devote a section! Telephone 
Number is 301.650.2000.
