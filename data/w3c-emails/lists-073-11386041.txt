Techniques mailing list and you'll be deluged with comments like the following

"quite a waste"

"highly graphical sites are meant for visual people and have merit by serving
a different clientele."

"I no longer worry about even trying to support 2.0 (or god

forbid!) 1.0 series browsers. 3 series isn't far behind. As far as browsers

like Opera (minuscule market share), I don't even try."

"Look, we design for people who aren't blind.  That's about all we are
concerned about." 

"all web sites are equally accessible to persons that are sight
disabled. All they have to do is make sure their browser settings are
correct."

"The ADA in no way applies to my web designs, the content thereof or the

accessibility of that content. Period."
