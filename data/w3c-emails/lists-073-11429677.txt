The HTML Writers Guild (HWG) is a non-profit educational organization for
those interested in Web development. 

It is not a professional association, though plenty of professionals are
members. Individual comments should only reflect on the *individuals* that
have made them, not on an organization as a whole, especially one that large. 

It cannot be expected that the entire membership of over 70,000 people will
have accessibility as their first concern in Web design. As has been
discussed here previously, market-place realities sometimes compete with
that. So the quotes of "we've made this decision to only design for X" CAN
in fact be legitimate, even if it's not popular with the disability
community. 

The Guild has put forth a considerable amount of effort at educating our
members on accessibility issues, and we continue to do so. In fact, we're
currently accepting registrations for an online course on accessibility
(http://www.hwg/org/services/classes). 

We're working on the issue as much or more than any other web developer
group out there. However, nobody can guarantee full buy-in to any design
philosophy. 

Best...
