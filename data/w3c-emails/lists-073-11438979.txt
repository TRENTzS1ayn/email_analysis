I would imagine that it would have zero impact.  Vector graphics are simply 
a different compression scenario / scheme.  The other option are rastered 
graphics that are basicly saved pixel by pixel.  Bitmaps are raster based 
images.

I just heard of vector graphics for the first time ever. Apparently a
graphic format that could replace bitmaps, and also apparently being
proposed as a specification to the W3C.

Does anyone know more about these and particularly any positive/negative
impact on accessibility?
