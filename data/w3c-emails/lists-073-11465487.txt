Thank you to all who responded to my Bobby error message.  At least all
of our pages pass now.  I don't know how much this is worth in REAL life
situations.  I have not done any testing on devices disabled people use
for accessibililty, but will be looking into it.

If anyone has more info about Bobby, just how it works, etc. or some
book I can read about these devices people use, I would like to know.  I
will also try to research myself.  Seems to me like there is a need for
information on this topic in general, laymen's terms so that even people
not directly connected with the disabled can understand all of this.
