Ummm, there is a MAJOR problem with this example: It is based on 
non-standard server technology. Although it MAY be accessible, it only 
works with specific software/hardware cominations.

However I agree in principle. The users who are disadvantaged by 
imagemaps are visual users with newish browsers (which don't give very 
good access to the various ALT text) and those using a screen-reader with 
such browsers, which I believe is even worse.

Your example can be rewritten in proper HTML, and there is just such an 
example in the HTML 4.0 recommendation at 
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/objects.html#edef-MAP

<P><OBJECT data="navbar1.gif" type="image/gif" usemap="#map1">
      <P>This is a navigation bar.
      </OBJECT>

   <MAP name="map1">
    <AREA href="guide.html" 
             alt="Access Guide" 
             shape="rect" 
             coords="0,0,118,28">
    <AREA href="search.html" 
             alt="Search" 
             shape="rect" 
             coords="184,0,276,28">
    <AREA href="shortcut.html" 
             alt="Go" 
             shape="circle"
             coords="184,200,60">
    <AREA href="top10.html" 
             alt="Top Ten" 
             shape="poly" 
             coords="276,0,373,28,50,50,276,0">
   </MAP>
