I believe vector graphics will have positive impact on accessibility.
In raster graphics, texts in the graphics are expressed as bitmap
data, so we can't read the text unless we can see the rendered
graphics. But in vector graphics, texts could be expressed as TEXT.
There are so many graphics which include textual information, so we
might be able to extract some textual information from those vector
graphics.

W3C has just started Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) Working Group, so
please see the following URL for more detail.
