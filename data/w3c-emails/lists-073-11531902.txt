As a web developer, for me the argument is not wether not to images or 
text, but the accessability of the location to a text-browser as well as a 
graphical one. Dropping graphics to the eager-to-see graphics surfer does 
not acheive accessability, in fact it discourages visitation. We ought not 
to forget that images carry messages especially to the visual-dependant!

When in 'Text' mode, visited, unvisited, active and (IE)hover works 
perfectly well, with the assistance of CSS.
So where is the argument.
