Jeff & Luanne:  Can you help?  Pls see e-mail below

To WAI Group:  i received an accessibility CD at an EXPO here in DC from 
their booth.  I will copy the point of contact and maybe they can provide 
more information.  Last I heard, Jeff Witt &  Luanne LaLonde were involved 
in the Accessibility Products for Microsoft.

How does one get their hands on the CD? Went to MS' site but didn't see
