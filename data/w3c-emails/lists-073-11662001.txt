FYI, this is from a developer at Microsoft Front Page Expert,

The Message:

Thanks for contacting us.

I think it would be helpful if you included the following links on our web 
site which details our current Accessibility initiatives at Microsoft:

Main MS Accessibility page: http://www.microsoft.com/enable/msaaintro.htm

Other useful links/summaries:

http://www.microsoft.com/enable/msaaintro-u.htm

I appreciate your continued work in this area and it has not fallen on deaf 
ears. I have forwarded your previous comments about Accessibility and the 
Web to our product groups. I am actively pushing for more Accessibility 
features to be included in the next version of FrontPage. My most recent 
conversation with the FP product team was quite positive in this becoming a 
reality for FrontPage 2000. I'll keep you informed as more details emerge.

Hope your workshop goes well.

Thanks.
