the alt tag in this instance will be needed till a new coding scheme for
web pages hense new browsers are developped.  There will be browsers out
there a plenty which cannot and will not take advantage of either active
accessability or java access.  We must keep the broadest perspective in
mind when proposing and writing guidelines.  If I called the website by
phone or accessed it by email or from a third world country's only
computer on their shaky phone system, what would I get.  It is important
to remember what we mean when we talk about who we reach and who will
benefit.  I suspect, if I got the page by mail, I'd get a blank screen if
anything at all and I suspect if I was calling around on a developping
phone technology and hit the web page you describe, the voice would say
nothing or blank page.
If anyone would like to test this from both of the above angles ie phone
and email, I'd be happy to participate.
one thing we seem to need in our effort to develop access guidelines is a
lab or at least some way of getting the right kind of testing done.
Someone if it hasn't been done also needs to write short easily obtainable
widely advertised free instructional materials on how to effectively use
the various browsers for accessing the web.  much of what has been termed
inaccessible by some consumers out there has been termed so because of
lack of knowledge of the capabilities and function of the browser.  this
was me a while back and probably still is with some browsers to some
extent  Annother way it could be approached is to make the browsers so
easy to use that they don't need instruction, but then we'd have to make
sure it was available simply to all.  one more thing.  this is not new,
but it would also be helpfull if websites more of them I mean had
instructions on how best to access their sites with the browsers.  I've
seen this done nicely in several places and it helpped me a lot because I
read a few paragraphs on a website about lynx and learned things I didn't
learn anywhere else.
sorry for the ramble, but this should help a bit to bring us back down to
earth.  I think in the instance you describe Chuck that the alt tag
"spinning red globe" is appropriate.
I think there should be however some explanation of the reason it is there
such as the word logo or perhaps the alt tag should read "companyname
logo", and there should be a short desc or d link.
