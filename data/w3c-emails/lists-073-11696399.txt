As part of the second beta release of Bobby 3.0 (which will happen
within the next two weeks), we will be adding full command-line
support to Bobby so that it can be operated entirely from the 
DOS or UNIX command prompts. The command-line version offers
all the options that the GUI interface does and is included
both for expert users who wish to analyze whole sites in batch mode
and for those who prefer a text-based interface. The output
of the command-line version can be viewed with a web browser
of your choice.

We have also chosen to continue work on adding
accessibility support to the GUI itself. The accessibility
support Sun has added to Java is quite good, but unfortunately
it will probably be a while before Java-based GUIs are 
fully accessible using commonly available screen reading and
magnification technologies.
