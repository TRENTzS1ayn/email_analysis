Hi. This is Rich Caloggero. I posted the original message on this thread.

The website in question is http://www.accessexpressed.net.

I'm still a bit unclear as to the relationship between Notes and Domino. 
Which
is the publishing environment? I've been assuming that Domino is Lotus'
webserver, simmilar to Apatchy and etc. It just serves pages. The 
publishing
environment is Notes. It provides a way to specify the look and feel of the
site and takes care of generating the HTML from the specifications. How 
exactly
does this happen? How much control over the HTML being generated does the
designer have? Does it use all the new features of HTML4 (label fields on 
form
buttons, etc)?

The biggest problem we are having is with the bullet (or twistie) frobs 
which
appear anywhere an object is referenced in a list or database view. See the
directory or events pages on www.accessexpressed.net. I've seen this same 
kind
of layout all over the net, mostly on webpages providing an interface to 
usenet
or mailing list archives, a great application for a database. The twisties 
can
be labeled (and are labeled as "+") and thus when images are turned off,
clickable plus signs appear next to the text of items in the list. For 
example,
we have an alphabetized index of all venues in our directory. The letters a
through z appear with twisties next to them. Clicking on the graphic opens 
up
the list, inserting the database items after the propper letter and 
changing
the graphic to indicate that a expansion of the list is in affect. Clicking 
on
the twistie again collapses the list removing the database items. This is 
hard
to use with a screen reader. The designer says that the text to which the
graphic refers cannot be made an anchor (clickable link). Why? This kind of
layout appears throughout our site.


Please excuse my rambling, but I want to understand this stuff so I can 
make
clear and hopefully informative recomendations to our web designers. Is 
there
any technical docs on this stuff I can look at?
Any info you can provides is most appreciated.
