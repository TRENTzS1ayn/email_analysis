Rich,
Your said  "This is hard to use with a screen reader."

Why is + or - next to a text label hard to use with a screen reader?  Whether
visually or aurally browsing, I have to associate the "twistie" with text
label. Similar to bullets in a list, only twistie's have a function other than
identifying them as a list item...

I agree it might be easier if the +/- link include the adjacent text label when
viewing only links.  Is that what you want Notes/Domino to do?

Since this is a specific topic - I would like to take this discussion off the
wai-ig interest list.

You also said:
"I'm still a bit unclear as to the relationship between Notes and Domino.
Which is the publishing environment? I've been assuming that Domino is Lotus'
webserver, simmilar to Apatchy and etc. It just serves pages. The
publishing environment is Notes..."

Domino is NOT just a Web server, it does handle some of the publishing task
because it knows all about Notes and the application you've designed.  I would
also recommend the following to anyone who wants to understand more:

Developing Web Applications Using Lotus Notes Designer for Domino 4.6

This redbook describes how to develop applications using Notes Designer for
Domino Release 4.6, specifically for users accessing Domino from Web browsers.
Domino combines the open networking environment of Internet standards and
protocols with the powerful application development facilities of Lotus Notes,
enabling you to develop a broad range of business applications for the Internet
and intranet.

The earlier chapters of the book introduce the concepts of Domino and creating
Web applications using Domino, for those readers who may be familiar with Web
application development but not necessarily with using Lotus Notes/Domino for
that development.

The book then describes how to use Domino design elements such as databases,
forms, subforms, views, navigators, and agents to create Web applications.
Other chapters illustrate how to include traditional Web development items,
such as HTML, Java and JavaScript, in Domino applications.

The redbook was written for Domino technical specialists and programmers in
customers, IBM business partners, and the IBM and Lotus community, who need a
good technical understanding of how to develop Web applications using Domino
Release 4.6.

Regards,
Phill Jenkins
