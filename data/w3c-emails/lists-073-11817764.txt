I have not seen these twisties, so I am guessing a bit here, but

It seems that the twisties should be covered by the GL recommendation - 
use meaningful links.

As I read this discusssion, that means that the associated text should be 
prt of the link. 

I am imagining something like some websites use, where a list uses 
graphic bullets which are links, while the explanatory text is not a 
link. This seems to me counter to the idea behind hypertext such as HTML, 
which makes it possible for the text itself to be active, rather than the 
old Prestel-type systems, which simply provided for linking of objects, 
nd text descriptions of what the links might be.

If the Notes/Domino solution cannot provide that (and I would be 
surprised if that were the case) then it is a poor solution indeed. On 
the other hnd, it does highlight the fact that this is not necessarily 
simple, and people need to understand their tools.
