Okay, so the WSP suggests that web authors ignore the published
vendor-neutral standards, and instead use specifics hacks just
to get around problems in implementation?

(I used a pseudo-hack on www.hwg.org's stylesheets, because Netscape's
support for CSS is ... less than robust.  However, there's nothing
invalid about it, it simply is designed to degrade gracefully.)

Isn't it rather condescending to assume that browser authors
-- mainly you're talking about Netscape and Microsoft, right?
with a little attention to Lynx, Opera, and whatever else? --
need to be "educated"?  Is a whole organization necessary to reach
these people, and what exactly is WSP planning to do to make this
happen?

I know, I know, it'll be on the website tomorrow.  Hopefully I'll
find something that makes me think this isn't just another case
of "form an official sounding organization because it makes us
look more impressive, despite not having any way to accomplish the
goals we've for ourselves."
