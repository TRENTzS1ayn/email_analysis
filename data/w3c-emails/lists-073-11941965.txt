KBOkay, so the WSP suggests that web authors ignore the published

KBto get around problems in implementation?

KBIsn't it rather condescending to assume that browser authors

KBhappen?

KBI know, I know, it'll be on the website tomorrow.  Hopefully I'll
KBfind something that makes me think this isn't just another case
