Once more i am compiling a list of the disability laws in other countries and also which ones apply to the web.  Here in the US we have the:
American Disability Act, 
Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act 
Section 255 of the Telecommunications Act 

Looking for comparable data for other countries.  

Appreciate your time! thanks!
