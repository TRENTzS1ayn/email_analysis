Hello IPO/WAI Interest Group members:

If you're attending the Interest Group and Working Group meetings in Austin
next week, Nov 10 & 11, please note that there is an updated agenda for the
meeting at

http://www.w3.org/wai/group/971110/agenda.html

...and also that there is updated logistical info for Austin, thanks to
Phill Jenkins at IBM, in the forwarded message below.

And finally, if you did register to attend the conference and need Braille
or large print but did not request these, please e-mail me directly at
jbrewer@w3.org as we do have these formats available; the registration form
not clear in this regard.

Regards,

Judy Brewer
