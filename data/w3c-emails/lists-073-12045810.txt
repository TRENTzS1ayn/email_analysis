>Web designers shouldn't have to waste 20% of their time just because
>the browser makers can't follow standards.  That's the message the
>HTML Writers Guild, the world's largest organization of web authors,
>is sending to Microsoft, Netscape, and other software publishers by
>supporting the Web Standards Project.
>
>The Web Standards Project is a collective effort by leading web
>designers and concerned end users dedicated to halting the
>fragmentation of the web by persuading browser makers to conform to
>the established web standards.
>
>"All members of the HWG can benefit from the efforts of the Web
>Standards Project," said Ann Navarro, HWG Vice President of Finance
>and a founding member of the WSP.  "Web developers and students
>of HTML spend quite a bit of time learning the quirks of each
>browser, and which features of established standards are or are
>not supported. That time, effort, and expense could be better
>used learning new skills, enhancing current projects, or creating
>new content."
>
>"Support for web standards is long, long overdue," said Joe Cline,
>HWG President.  "The WSP's goals mesh well with the mission of the
>Guild:  providing education on the current state of affairs on the
>Web, and encouraging compliance with the standards set by the
>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)."
>
>The Guild is a strong supporter of the W3C's standards, recently
>mandating the use of HTML 4.0 and CSS2 on the HWG website, and
>encouraging standards compliance by Guild members.  In addition,
>the Guild is a strong proponent of universal accessibility in web
>design.
>
>Browsers play a critical role in authoring accessible pages,
>according to the results of the Guild's recently concluded
>Accessibility Guidelines Implementation (AGI) project.
>
>"We had more than fifty web designers exploring the issue of
>designing with accessibility for disabled users," said Kynn
>Bartlett, HWG Vice President of Marketing and Outreach, and AGI
>project coordinator.  "They identified 'better accessibility
>support in browsers' as the biggest single factor that could lead
>to better usability for everyone.  The browser companies need to
>get on the ball and support the accessibility features in HTML
>4.0 and CSS2."
>
>The HTML Writers Guild plans to educate and inform their members
>about the Web Standards Project, and how they can get involved
>with the WSP's efforts.
> 
>"The Guild's membership in the W3C gives the average web author
>representation in the standards creation process; our involvement
>in the WSP encourages our members to help with the next step: 
>Compliance with those standards," explained Charlotte Crothers,
>HWG Vice President of Member Education.

>About the HWG:
>The HTML Writers Guild represents a membership of over 70,000 web
>designers in 130 nations, and is an active participant in the
>World Wide Web Consortium, the international organization that
>sets the standards for the web.  HWG projects include mailing
>lists for members, online classes, and extensive web development
>resources.  The Guild's website is http://www.hwg.org/.
>
>About the Web Standards Project:
>The WSP's primary objective is to advance the Web development
>industry, by bringing attention to the existing and potential
>problems involved with browser incapatibility. The coalition urges
>browser manufactures to use open standards and support existing
>W3C standards. The WSP's website is http://www.webstandards.org/.
