One possibility is to simply give users direct access to the hierarchy, via
the following functions

parent
child
next/prevous sibling(s).

This does functionally some of what the accordion list does for sighted
users, viz ability to quickly get items for above relationships.

There is problem of getting lost as to which level you're in.  Perhaps some
explicit audio label (e.g. "level 1" preceding output) would do the trick.
Or Raman's audio techniques.
