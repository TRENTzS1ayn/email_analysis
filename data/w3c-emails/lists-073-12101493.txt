Subject:  RE: Twisties re notes/domino




For those of us who do not happen to have Notes available to them, can
someone post a URL or provide sample files that demonstrate the twistie?  I
have a feeling I have seen this in a variety of pages using straight HTML
links, DHTML, and ActiveX, resulting in a situation where we have the same
UI implemented via different techniques.
