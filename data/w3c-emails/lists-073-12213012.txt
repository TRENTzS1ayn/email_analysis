Well, we did the presentation last night!  The topic was Tools that Persons 
With Disabilities use to interact with the web.   Joe Roeder presented 
WinVision 97.   Due to an illness Dave Poehlman could not attend <frown>. 
 With Dave not there, we lost our JAWS expert, so my cohort here at work 
and fellow WAI Interest Group member, Jamie Fox presented lynx.  I 
presented pwWebSpeak.

The audience had a good cross section of developers and interested business 
people.  Many of whom, like ourselves, are trying to provide universal 
accessibility and were there to learn more.  There were audience members 
with various disabilities, such as blind, low vision, and paraplegic who 
shared their experiences and frustrations. The response was fantastic and 
the information exchange was informative.  It was an awakening for the 
developers to see how web pages look on the various tools.

The big surprise of the night was when we walked in...  TV on the Web had 
set-up to video the presentation to post on the web.  Their web address is 
www.tvontheweblive.com.  When the presentation goes live, will circulate 
the URL to the WAI.  This will be a video file with sound.  As this is 
approximately one to two hours, I do know if we will be able to provide a 
text version any time soon <my apologies>.

The presentation was posted on the web.  Please note that at this time 
there is no link from http://www.eeicom.com/dcwebmasters  So you need to 
type the entire URL  http://www.eeicom.com/dcwebmasters/pwd/  This web site 
was designed to be used as resource for people starting out as well as 
others.  If there are any design problems, I accept the blame.  so please 
let me know if you have any problems and also let me know your opinion. 
 One note, I did specify the font face for only the page header on each 
page.  Stella said font face can be a problem with some of the public 
access terminals in the UK.  So as I change a page, I will remove this.

Thanks to everyone on the WAI for your inputs.  and a special thanks to 
Candee Wilson the Special Interest Group Chair of the DC Association of 
Internet Professionals and to EEI for hosting us!
