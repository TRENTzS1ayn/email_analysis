On the Amaya list there is some traffic about why that "test bed" hasn't
been ported to Macs, like: "More web pages are created on a Macintosh
than any other platform. According to WebWEEK, the weekly trade journal
for Internet Professionals, Macintosh is again the #1 platform for     
professional World Wide Web authoring."

Have we been (are being?) blind (pun intneded) to this because it might
account for a large area of the biggest problem - the Web design
attitude that holds appearance to transcend in importance the "content"?
