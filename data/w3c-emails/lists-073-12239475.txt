Macintoshes are not responsible for inaccessible web design any more than
PageMaker is responsible for poorly-designed publications. It's all about
educating web authors, regardless of their tools, and that means we need
guidelines that are clear and understandable.

The new guidelines _are_ an improvement, thank you, WAI. Keep at it.

And I won't jump onto my 25-year-old soapbox about graphic designers who
fall in love with their design at the expense of the information they are
supposed to deliver.
