Has there ever been any legal action taken against a website for non-
compliance with ADA in the US?
I have been writing to the tech support at sites I visit (a recent was ABC's
website - ghastly!) I have not rec'd many replies - mostly auto generated
"We'll get back to you " or "we'll bring this to the attention of our
Engineers".
A grassroots approach can be effective as well. Below is the reply I rec'd
from Bare Bones makers of BBEdit - not a great response - but a prompt and
positive one nonetheless:

Lovey (I feel like Thurston Howel), thanks for writing in.  BBEdit will be
gaining new tools i a future release which will provide support for HTML
4.0.  As for accessibility standards, I will log this as a feature request. 
There are going to be a number of new tools in the next release which should
actually make it easier to support developing such web sites.
