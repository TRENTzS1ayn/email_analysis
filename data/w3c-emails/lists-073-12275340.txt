The wide usage of Mac's for web authoring is 
just a consequence of the fact that the web is 
so young that most people who write for the web 
come from other other professions, namly desktop 
publishing and advertising. 

In a few years web authoring will become a profession of 
its own, and with people who started their professional career
in the Web age. 
Since the web is inherently operating system independent,
the operating systems used by web authors will be more or 
less the same as of the general public.
