Lynx has handled frames since (I think) version 2.6.  It will display
the <noframes> content and provide a link to each frame.  For example,
from <URL:http://tnt.turner.com/babylon5/>:

                                                    TNT: The Home of Babylon 5

   FRAME: [1]nav    
   FRAME: [2]nav_top
   FRAME: [3]meat 
   FRAME: [4]border_right
   FRAME: [5]border_bot

Here, they haven't provided any <noframes>, and their frames are not
as well-named as they could be.  But a user can at least figure out
what's going on and get where they need to.
