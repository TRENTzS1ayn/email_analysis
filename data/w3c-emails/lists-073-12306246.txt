In tooling around with Lynx last night I did see that it seemed to break 
the frames into individual pages.  I don't know if this was all lynxssssss 
doing or if the page author coded it.  Try going to 
http://www.eeicom.com/dcwebmasters/pwd/demonstra.html and follow the frames 
link.

Subject:  Lynx 2.8 and frames?

A colleague recently told me that the latest version of Lynx handles
frames. Is that correct? I didn't see any mention of frames on the Lynx
website.

Thanks,
