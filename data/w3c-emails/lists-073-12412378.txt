Yes, Lynx does handle frames letting you navigate among them as if they were 
separate pages. Using title attribute to provide human-readable understandable 
names for the frames deffinately helps. However, what about frames which change 
in response to actions in another frame. I can't remember where I saw this, but 
a site with a table of contents in one frame which, when items were clicked on, 
changed the contents of the other frame by displaying the indicated section 
there. I guess you could navigate among them if indeed you knew that this kind 
of relationship was present, but it would certainly be a pain. I'm sure more 
complex examples can be cited.
