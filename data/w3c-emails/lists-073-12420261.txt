Caveat 1: This actually has nothing to do with Lynx, just frames.

Caveat 2: This is gossip or hearsay.  Not science and not based
on my own experience.

Caveat 3: The sample here is a very narrow slice of the industry,
contract web designers working in the DC area market which is
dominated by the Federal Government.

But,

I found it interesting that the "buzz" among the professional web
designers in the audience at Rob Neff's seminar was clear and
unambiguous, at least to my eavesdropping ears.  

  Frames are an unmitigated disaster, to be avoided like the
  plague.

  Clients think they are cool.

  They are hard to make work right across different browsers.

  They are hard to maintain.

  Just not worth the trouble.
