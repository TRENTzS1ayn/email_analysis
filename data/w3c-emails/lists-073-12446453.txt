Is Jakob Nielsen's most popular article still 'Why Frames Suck', or has 
it been overtaken (which would surprise me). Certainly people seem to 
find them difficult.

Unfortunately the most common design response seems to be the use of 
increasingly complex tables, which seem to present more complex 
acessibility problems - with frames the problems are simple, and the 
solutions are fairly simple too. With tables the problems are complex 
because they are less obvious.
