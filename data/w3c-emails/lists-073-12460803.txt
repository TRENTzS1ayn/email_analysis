Subject:hmmm

A colleague of mine suggested that a good idea would be
to implement an 
automatic feature in browsers and or server software
that would strip away 
the inaccessible stuff from pages to present accessible
pages.  Does this 
seem like a realistic option.  I know it would still
leave out users with 
older browsers.
