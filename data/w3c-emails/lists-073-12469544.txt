The User Agent Guidelines Working Group
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/> is actively discussing some
abstracting etc. functions that browsers can do that will help.

In addition, if you put the transformation in a gateway or proxy,
you can even reach users of old browsers.  This approach can also
be good for prototyping and experimentation.  Your colleague
might want to get involved in the Evaluation and Repair Interest
Group or Working Group <http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/>.
