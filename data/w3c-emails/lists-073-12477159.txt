Accessibility is a case of thoughtfulness, good design principles,
planning ahead, a clean grasp on HTML, and a desire to make pages
accessible.

There's no algorithm to automatically convert inaccessible pages to
accessible pages -- and there never will be.  It's impossible.

The real work is not found in the tags -- if it were, then any
browser could simply make a page accessible.  The hard work of 
accessibility occurs at the _implementation_ level.

Example:  There's no way that a program could make this accessible.

  <IMG SRC="bd32.gif">
  <A HREF="somepage.html"><IMG SRC="lpwf.jpg"></A>

The author didn't include enough information to make it clear what's
happening here -- and no machine can arbitrarily decide what needs
to happen above, enough to make it usable in even Lynx.

(On the other hand, if you're curious, look at my neglected experiment
at http://www.cgu.edu/degrade/ -- a tool for authors.)
