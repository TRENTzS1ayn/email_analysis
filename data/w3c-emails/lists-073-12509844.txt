If you remember a couple of e-mails ago, mentioned a presentation where a panel presented, "Tools Persons with Disabilities use to interact with the web."  And also said it was video'd by "TV on the Web".    

Well it is now on the web and you can go see us present!!!!!  http://www.tvontheweb.com/channels/able/index.html  This requires real audio and they have a link to real player.

This is great public relations for us!  I cannot say enough about how pleased I am with the quality and turn around time of "TV on the Web". Mind you, they did this for FREE and put it up in three days!  If you are estastic as I am, then please e-mail them and let them know how you feel.  

My only apology is we do not have a caption yet.  We will need to find someone to transcribe this for us...any suggestions?  Any one have spare time to do one module?
 
Once more i would like to thank everyone for their support.  Especially Joe Roeder, Dave Poelhman, Al Gilman, Jamie Fox, Candee Wilson at EEI Communciations, please see the coments page of the presentation!  www.eeicom.com/dcwebmasters/pwd
