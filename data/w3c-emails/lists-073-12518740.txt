There seems to be some messages that are not being posted to the
w3c-wai-ig@w3.org list.  I submitted a message on 8/10 responding to Al Gilman
that reflects my experiences with Notes twisties and screen readers.

The "-" denotes that the section is collapsed, so the available actions are
either to review the information as provided or to choose Enter to expand the
section.  The relevant HTML source code for these collapsed sections is:  <IMG
SRC="/icons/collapse.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="- ">
Conversely, the "+" denotes that the section is expanded, and the action to be
taken would be to collapse the section.

Therefore, to address this issue, I believe that the appropriate solution would
be to have the Notes-to-HTML translation generate an ALT="Expand Section"
instead of the "-" and an ALT="Collapse Section" instead of the "+".  This would
address the "meaningful link text" rule [to which Al Gilman referred].

However, the much more serious issue is that performing an action (collapsing an
expanded section or expanding a collapsed section) results in the page being
refreshed, and screen readers do not presently keep track of the current (at the
time the action was taken) location within the page.  This is extemely
frustrating for blind users, particularly if the page contains many twisties and
they were selecting one near the bottom of the page.  This also greatly reduces
efficiency of working with the information provided.

The best short-term solution is to use the search capability to find the
requested information (the Notes application will need to have the full-text
index created so that the search feature is enabled for browsers).

Al gilman posted a fine explanation of the twisty problem. Here it is. Thanx
Al. Also, someone else named John Somebody wanted a description of this for the

UI issues list. Hope this reaches him ...

[follow-up to discussion of the Lotus Notes/Domino implementation
of expanding lists with inscrutable "+/-" link text on twisties.]

The existing rule about "use meaningful link text" explains why
using plus and minus as the link text for twisties does not work
for screen reader users.  But it does not really tell you what to
do about it because a long substitution would get tedious even in
speech.  We probably need to step back and see what the twisties
are doing for us to understand the problem.

Twisties are used as controls inside what we might call
"accordion lists" by analogy to "accordion file" containers for
information on paper.  These are list structures similar to a
table of contents that the user interface lets you fold and
expand on a section by section basis.  Users of MacOS since
version 7 and Microsoft Windows since Windows 95 will be familiar
with this in the file system interface.

The problem is that the visual user can see where the un-changed
parts of the list come back in the adjusted list presentation.
It is not similarly easy to perceive the structure in terms of
changed and unchanged segments in audio, so far as I know.

Accordion lists are visual context-savers for exploring
hierarchical information structures.  I might even say that
accordion lists are a best current practice for this function.
If there is a comparable best current practice for saving context
inside a hierarchical domain, in the context of an audio user
interface, I don't know what it is.
