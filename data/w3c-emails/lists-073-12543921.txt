Wouldn't a reasonable compromise be

<A HREF=[whatever] TITLE="Collapse Section">
<IMG SRC="/icons/collapse.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="- ">
</A>

assuming that clicking on the images is performed thru an A element?
That way text-based visual users get an intuitive, compact
representation, but the link is labelled with a more descriptive
title.  (I don't know what the behavior of screen readers is when an
image link has both ALT on the IMG and TITLE on the A, but I know
Bobby complains when TITLE is absent for an image link, even if there
is an ALT.)
