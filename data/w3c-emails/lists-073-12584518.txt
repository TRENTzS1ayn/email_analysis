John suggested a TITLE on the link, plus ALT of "-" or "+". This is not 
enough, since TITLE for a link is not well implemented. The meaningful 
text has to be in the link - either as text or as ALT text (or even both) 
for it to provide the required functionality to address the accessiblity 
problem.
