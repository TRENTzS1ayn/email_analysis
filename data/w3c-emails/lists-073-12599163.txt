            Inclusive design: special needs as mainstream HCI

OBJECTIVES
==========

The tutorial explores the practicalities and benefits of promoting
Universal Access. The premise is that we are all *extra-ordinary users*
with special needs depending on task, tools and context. Considering
special needs as mainstream ultimately improves design for *all*.

CONTENT
=======

The tutorial will include:

 o information about causes of exclusion, legal obligations, existing
   hardware and software options for accessibility, useful agencies,
   centres of research;
 o historical and contemporary examples to illustrate the wider
   benefits of designing for special needs;
 o problem-solving tasks and the opportunity to take part in a focused
  discussion.

AUDIENCE
========

  o software designers and developers;
  o people with responsibility for the welfare of those with special needs;
  o HCI lecturers who wish to embrace this topic.

No prior knowledge of disability and IT is assumed.
