The HTML Writers Guild is proud to announce the first session of our new
online web
education service. 

One of the first courses was designed around the Guild's participation in
WAI activities and our commitment to accessibility outreach, and may be of
interest to members of this list: 

Designing for Universal Accessibility with HTML 4.0

Intended for those with intermediate level HTML skills, this course covers
the techniques and skills needed to ensure that the sites you create today
will continue to work tomorrow and beyond, into the 21st century.  Not only
will you be able to consider the major browsers, but for the myriad of
devices now and soon to be in use, including screen readers and braille
browsers for the visually impaired, handheld devices, and other
technologies not yet in popular use. 

Basic HTML and web design skills will not be taught in this course, which
focuses on specific universal accessibility techniques. A separate basic
HTML course is available; those with limited HTML skills should complete
that course or further self-study first. 

This course runs for 6 weeks, beginning Monday August 24, 1998. Full and
Discounted members may register for $25, Trial members for $50. A
certificate of completion is available for an additional $5 (request needs
to be made at the time of registration). Upgrade your membership before
registering, and save!

(All students must be HWG members. Trial membership is free,Full membership
is $40 per year. 50% discounts are available to students, educators, and
those with disabilities that prevent gainfull employment. Documentation
requirements are available online.)

Courses use Eshare's Expressions web forum technology, a threaded-messaging
system that allows students to participate at a time most convenient for
them.
