                                       Seeking Greater Access For Graduate
Students With Disabilities


The participation of ten (10) graduate students is being sought to test the
capability of Microsoft's free NetMeeting software program. For students who
are blind or have low vision, the mission is to facilitate greater access for
students currently enrolled in graduate programs and to assess the
potential of
the NetMeeting program to enhance patterns of networking. Discussions will
focus on the research needs of students and attempt to enhance their progress
at any stage of advanced graduate study. 

Major emphasis will be placed on audio functions and two-way telephone
conversations. Other features, such as video, chat and whiteboard will not be
used.

The pilot effort will be directed by Dr. Robert Butters, former professor,
researcher and director of field placement at Northeastern University, Boston,
MA

Cost
*****
None. Microsoft's NetMeeting software is free and the project director is a
"volunteer research advisor" on the Internet for students with disabilities.


Eligibility
**********
Willingness to participate is initiated by a university administrator or
academic advisor by submiting the name of the student, email address,
university attended, and field of specialization to the project director:
mailto:rbutters@gulfaccess.net

Upon receipt of that notification, students will be informed about acceptance,
details regarding the NetMeeting software, and will be provided with
instructions to properly download and install it.

Scope and Limitations
*************************

As a pilot venture, the program assumes no previous experience with the
NetMeeting software. Considerable emphasis will be placed on gaining an
acquaintance with the provisions for telephone conferencing.

Professional services relative to a student's research progress are considered
to be supportive, not a replacement, for advisement currently received. 

Participation is voluntary. As a pilot approach, it is hoped that new networks
may emerge among students with disabilities in particular, and the higher
education community in general.

I appreciate the support already extended to this assessment of the NetMeeting
conferencing program and would be most willing to provide additional details
upon request.
