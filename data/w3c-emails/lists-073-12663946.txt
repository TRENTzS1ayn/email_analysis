Actually this topic is what the Evaluation and Repair group (WAI-ER) is all 
about. Anyway...

Having a broker/ratings agency to keep track of accessible material (or 
inaccessible material) could be a good marketing tool to promote 
accessible design. Getting people to put their own meta tag in is 
probably not worth the effort, so it would need to rely on third party 
rating, or on some automated system like Bobby, which I don't think is 
good enough - it doesn't stop somebody putting sdghws in each ALT tag 
since their authoring tool required something, and that came to hand.

On the other hand accessibility can be regarded as a binary condition - 
text-only, by virtue of being able to be rendered into braille, signing 
(for the deaf), spoken, large or small, in user-defined colours, fast or 
slowly, is accessible. Ergo, so is anything which degrades to text. 
Certain HTML elements, such as headings, lists, links, and names, are 
rendered by all browsers. Although their absence is not strictly speaking 
an accessibility problem, their proper use enhances accessibility greatly.

The guidelines in fact provide for four levels of acessibility, which 
are quantified: If you do not follow all the Priority 1 Guidelines, then 
your quantum is None - your page is not accessible to everybody. If you 
follow all P1, but not all P2, then your page is accessible to everybody, 
but often there is a poor level of access provided. If you get all P1 and 
P2 you have a reasonable level of accessibility, and if you also follow 
P3 you have a good level of accessibility.

Hmmm interesting - but wouldn't it strip away content too?
How 'bout a META Tag (like Rsaci uses for content) to alert browsers of
accessbility or non?
