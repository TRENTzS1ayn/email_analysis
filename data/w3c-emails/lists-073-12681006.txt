3. WebSite Search Engine Promotion

One key factor for getting people to go to your website, is to have your site on search engines. The more search engines you are listed on, the more hits from your attended audience you'll receive. When including this option, we need the following criteria:

- website to be submitted
- keywords to be used(max. 25)
- Title of Web Site
- 30 word description

Also, we allow multiple submissions, which will allow maximum exposure. Ever so often, sites will bump your listing down so it is a good idea to have the same site, submitted at least once a month, to guarantee to maintain your listing at the top.

Our prices:

100 engines & directories - 15.00
200 engines & directories - 25.00
500 engines & directories - 45.00

6. Ezine Publications

We are now pleased to offer the service of sending Ezine Publications. Basically, an ezine is an informative magazine sent by email on a regular basis.
