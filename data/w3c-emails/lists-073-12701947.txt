I think the recommendations, questions and tips are useful,
since they may make people think of improvements that haven't occurred
to them, such as the ABBR and ACRONYM tags.  As long as the pass/fail
and errors come first, people who don't care about the rest don't need
to scroll any farther.  One change that might be useful is to put the
accessability rating at the top of the report, before the display of
the page's contents.

Speaking of Bobby, I have to express some confusion over the
"If none of the web pages on your site contain accessibility errors"
condition.  How does one define a "site"?  My web pages fall into
several self-contained units, but each of them lives on a larger site
over which I have no control.  Is the Utah relativity homepage
<http://www.physics.utah.edu/research/relativity> only allowed to
display the "Bobby Approved" icon if all of the pages on
<http://www.physics.utah.edu/> pass muster?  That's impossible unless
we get every member of the department to make their personal pages
accessible.
