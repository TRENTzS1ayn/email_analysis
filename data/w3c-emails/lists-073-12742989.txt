Below is a snippet of conversation I'm having with a webmaster concerning
alt tags.  Is there away around the following problem while still using
alt tags or any thoughts?

"There are some images on the site which do not contain alt tags.  These
are usually called either bd.gif or td.gif.  These are simple spacers used
for page layout and should not have alt tags.  If they did, the page would
pop up with little blank squares as your mouse moved over it on browsers
like IE 4 or Navigator 4."
