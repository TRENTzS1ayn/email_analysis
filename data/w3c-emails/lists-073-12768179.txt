On the flipside, if you have no ALT tag, Lynx users get
[IMAGE], telling them there's an image there, but not what its purpose
is.  If you include ALT="", the image disappears completely from the
Lynx display, which is appropriate for an image that carries no
content.  (ALT=" " and ALT="&nbsp;" may also be reasonable choices,
depending on the spacing effect in question.)  Don't lead your
text-based users to believe they're missing something when they're
really not.  Similarly, if NS or IE users have image loading turned
off, that little blank box is telling them not to bother loading the
image, as it doesn't mean anything.  (And at any rate a little blank
box seems like less of a problem that giving some users the false
impression that they're not getting all the content.)

I am, of course, ignoring the unpleasantness of using GIFs for
layout in the first place.
