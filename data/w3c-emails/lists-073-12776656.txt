I disagree, I used this backdoor approach before, then decided not to!  I 
was able to design around it!

I can the support developers side, but ....  What is he separating?  Images 
or text?  If it is images then he can make the images longer and make that 
area transparent.  He could just use a one pixel by one pixel image or one 
pixel by the length needed and align it on the top.  The odds of someone 
bumping that are low - still use alt tag called spacer.  This can be 
effective, but depends on your requirements.

I do not want to question his design layout because I do not know what he 
is trying to accomplish.  Who knows what will work for this person...

Cheers...rob

In my opinion, such spacers should never be used for page layout.

(Note that if they don't have alt tags, they show up as [IMAGE]
all over the place in lynx.)
