IMO the only way to deal with this is to pressure the browser developers
to remove the ALT-as-Tooltips functionality from their offerings. Check
the www-html thread "Questionable implementation of IMG ALT attribute as
tooltips" from the beginning of this year, in which Foteos Macrides
astutely spotted that

====
   what you want is:
        
   <IMG SRC="foo.blah" ALT="alternative_string" TITLE="tooltip_string">

   and broader implementation and understanding of this
   provision in HTML 4.0.

For more info, check out the rant I wrote about this, at:

I agree with Kynn Bartlett that one should not use "spacer" images (HTML
is not a page-layout language).
