1) If you change topics - change the Subject Line. 
       so that Automatic Threading software in the archive will start a new thread.

2) Try to include just one thought or topic per email. (Send multiple if you need to.)
      to facilitate response and threading.

3) Delete any unnecessary or unrelated lines from the original message.
       to make it shorter for reading and storing.  Do retain enough to understand 
       what your message relates to.

4) If new text is inserted within the body of the Old message.
       a) Mark all new text with author initials followed by a colon (e.g   GV:  or  GK:)
             BE CONSISTENT so that a person using a screen reader can use text search
             to find all your comments.
       b) Mention at top of message that you have done so.  For example:
   My comments are below marked with GV: 

5) Do not use indenting to show organization of thought or material unless you also 
    include Outline Labels such as 1,2,3 and a b c.   
    For example this memo properly uses both indents and labeling to indicate organization

6) Put two blank lines before titles to make them easier to find.

7) Send these recommendations to new list subscribers. (And repeat as necessary)
