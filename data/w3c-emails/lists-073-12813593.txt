Chuck is correct - use of tooltips for alt text is a good thing. Even 
when the images are displayed, it can be helpful to have the ALT text 
available. The most common example is for icons used throughout a site. 
Since icons mean different things to different people, it is often 
helpful to those of us with a T3 graphics setup to be able to view the 
information as words - it reinforces the meaning of the graphic, or 
explains it clearly. It is also the case that Opera is the only browser I 
know that allows resizing of the display - small images may be sometimes 
fine and sometimes difficult for people with low vision or partial/full 
colour blindness to understand.
