Out of curiousity, what exactly makes it a right?

I hope this won't start a flamewar.

I'm just wondering what makes accessibility a right, if Internet
access itself is _not_ a right for the general public, at least,
not that I've been told.  Where do rights come from, and who
makes the decision, "this is a right"?

Again, no flames please, and bear in mind that we're on the same
side -- I just want to hear the logic behind this statement.
