Kynn said that my idea of making a whole university site accessible 
before putting the Bobby icon in was good, but impractical in the near 
future. It is certainly, unfortunately, unlikely to happen fast. But...

When the ER group began as the Ratings and Classification (?) group, one
of the ideas behind it was to look at using the PICS rating system to
identify accessibility of a 'website'. (Much as it is used to identify
various features of the content - whether it contains all sorts of things
american voters don't want their kids to see, whether it conatins
educational and canadian content, etc. 

PICS provides a basic mechanism for specifying in a page which of the 
things it is linked to are covered by the same rating as the page itself.

Bobby (and so far as I know) ER have not gone down that path. It may be 
worth revisiting the idea. It may be worth telling your University (as I 
told mine, not that they were very interested) that the icon won't go on 
until it is done.
