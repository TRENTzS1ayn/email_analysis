You've made this assertion, with its implication that the usage of ALT
increased as a result of the implementation as tooltips, before. I've
yet to find any evidence which backs up these assertions. If you can
point me to some, I'd be grateful.

... or does your insistence on using the term "ToolTip" as opposed to
"tooltip" mean that you consider that the two are different animals?
That might explain a great many things.

Hmmm... they weren't able to disable image loading in their browser?
Perhaps they should have got a better browser (tm).

No... all through GUIs, tootips are used to provide ADDITIONAL
INFORMATION about graphical objects.

It's not surprising that people will abuse ALT if the UAs implement
tooltips in a way that is BAD - Broken As Designed.

As regards your assertion that implementing ALT as tooltip increases the
usage of ALT, you're entitled to your opinion. However, you keep stating
this as though it's fact. Evidence, please?

100% of the time, no "ALT tooltip" is better than an "ALT tooltip".

While HTML 4 seems to me to be corrected in this respect, there are
still browser developers who seem to retain the attitude that ALT text
as tooltips is acceptable. While this attitude persists, problems such
as that quoted by the original poster to this thread will continue to
arise.

A page reference would be useful. Hypertext is good for such things, you
know.

I disagree entirely.
