The Americans with Disabilities Act and its regulatory apparatus makes
accessibility a right for persons with disabilities under certain
circumstances.  In this case, the "amount" of accessibility that a given
site has to provide partly depends on whether the site is government or
privately sponsored.  Also, a set of definitions for web accessibility and
other things similar was recently issued as part of the development of the
ADA.

In general, government sites have to meet a higher standard of access than
private sites; I am no expert, but the overall standard for private sites
would be accessibility that is readily achievable.
Given the nature of markup languages, it makes some sense that the standard
of "readily achieveable" will be pretty high for web sites.  However, none
of this has been tested yet.

Time will tell-but my guess is that the expectations from a legal
perspective will be fairly high for sites.
