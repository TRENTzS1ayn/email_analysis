I understand that, which is why I say that of course providing an
accessible site is a *good thing*. However the assertion that is at times
made that accessibility is "a right" (not just "right") can bring
significant resistance to an idea that may otherwise be accepted with
interest. 

While everyone here would be thrilled to see all web sites be accessible,
there is a "real" difference between those that are legally required to be
in certain jurisdictions, and those where accessibility is desirable. Not
putting forth everything as "required", IMO, will bring greater acceptance.
