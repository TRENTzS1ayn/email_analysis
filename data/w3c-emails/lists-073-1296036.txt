I have a couple of questions

1. In a case like this where I start off by quoting the original
email, what's the best way to quote and add my comments?  What I've done
here is use the usual greater than sign.  I've also inserted a phrase "I
have a couple of questions" to indicate where what I'm saying starts.

2. When we mark our comments with our intitials, are you saying
that we mark each line with our initials, for examples

LRK: Now is the time for all good men
LRK: to come to the aid of their country.

This adds reading clutter it seems to me.   Also, the first
sentence runs into the second LRK.  Would some other convention be
better, e.g. to enclose the text by e.g.  "LRK start" and "LRK end".
(Insert your own initials of course, grin).  Here's how it looks and
sounds:

LRK start: Now is the time for all good men
to come to the aid of their country.
LRK end.

This is also easier to type.
