Windows, being a GUI, does not have an imageless mode :) Thus there can
be no equivalent of ALT text in that environment. Tooltips are generally
associated with a time delay so that the user's display is not
unnecessarily cluttered. Thus what you see as a "textual representation"
*is* in fact additional information, which is only made available if the
user requires it. Appropriate behaviour in Windows does not necessarily
translate directly to other media.

At least we agree on that ;)

So many lists, so little life :(
