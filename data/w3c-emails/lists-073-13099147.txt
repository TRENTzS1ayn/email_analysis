To answer my own question, I found the ISO number and title of the standard:

http://www.iso.ch/cate/d16880.html
ISO 9241-8:1997
Ergonomic requirements for office work with visual display terminals (VDTs)
Part 8: Requirements for displayed colours

The text is not available online, as far as I can find.
