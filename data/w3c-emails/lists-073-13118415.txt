just ran across the Internet Software Consortium.  Has the WAI ever 
contacted them?  Here is the URL and a snippet from the home page.
http://www.isc.org/

The ISC is a nonprofit corporation dedicated to production-quality software 
engineering for key Internet standards. Reference implementations of 
Internet standards often have the weight of "de-facto standards" and we 
want to make sure that those reference implementations are properly 
supported. We are also committed to keeping these reference implementations 
freely available to the Internet community.
The ISC administers grants of money and equipment to qualified software 
developers who then create and/or maintain freely available software used 
on most of the Internet. We fund these efforts by selling support for the 
software and by donations. Our funding agencies are corporations and other 
parties who believe that freely available implementations of key protocols 
are necessary to keep the Internet running.
The ISC is now offering support on ISC software.
The ISC is now a nonprofit corporation.
