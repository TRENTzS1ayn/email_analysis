oh, try parens or <>
then again, it might think it's invalid html if you use the latter.  I
like your idea though.  what makes you think it will change pitch?

**wink* or *pout* or whatever...) and the use a CSS stylesheet so the
**smile* is printed out in red (or pronounced in a different peach,

*Any help appreciated...
