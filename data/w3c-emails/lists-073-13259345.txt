Mmm... that is an idea...

Using CSS2 and the @aural media, I guess we could make some kind of
on-the-fly translator for the most usual ASCII art, so on visual
environments they would see ' :) ' or whatever, and on aural UAs have a
gigle, or a description of the emoticon... that would require CSS2 fully
aware UAs, btw...

Would such a thing be possible with CSS2? (haven't dug too much on the
@aural possibilities yet...) i am thinking is something like:

span.smiley@aural { ":)": Rose.read "Smiling face" }

or

span.gigle@aural { ":)": Rose.play "gigle.wav" }

Thanks,
