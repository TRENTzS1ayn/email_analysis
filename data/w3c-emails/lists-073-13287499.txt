The Institute on Independent Living has certain sections of the site
translated to Swedish.

My question:  In writing meta-tags; table summaries; image ALT
descriptions, etc. do I need to use the ISO-8859 entity for the Swedish
characters (i.e. &auml;) or can I just write the character as it appears
(? - "a" with an umlaut)?

Also, where can I get a complete list of LANG attribute codes - without
having to pay for a list from ISO?

Thanks
