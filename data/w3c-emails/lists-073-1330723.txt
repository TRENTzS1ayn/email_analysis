LRK's reply:
No, actually what Gregg and George said was, quote, 
 If new text is inserted within the body of the Old message.
... Mark all new text with author initials followed by a colon (e.g
GV:  or  GK:)  
unquote.

To which I suggested just marking the beginning and end to reduce verbal

 I like Neal's suggestion of a character to search on to find new

curley brackets {} ?

I'm also sympathetic with Jim's caution about changing what people are
used to.
