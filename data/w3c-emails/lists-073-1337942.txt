Hello List,

Leonard had a question about replying to a message and then inserting
information.

We mean this to be very simple.

1. a person replies to the message and this normally inserts a > sign to
the left side of the message.

2. Go to the top of the message and state that you want to insert comments
and that you will use your initials before each comment. GWK: is what I
normally use.

3. Where you want to make a comment I put GWK: and then go on for as long
as necessary. I don't put GWK: at the beginning of each line. The person
knows the inserted information is over, because you then bump into the >
again.

I normally say, "in the above information" or "in the information that
follows" This gives the person a clue that you are referring to what is
above or below your comment.

When I read such a message, I end up reading the  first part and then
search for the initials followed by the colon. This saves a ton of time
especially on long messages. I use this technique when people ask me to
review large documents and proposals as well. 


Hope this is helpful.

Best
George
