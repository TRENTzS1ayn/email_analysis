Doesn't Emacs support html-helper-mode on Windows?  I have used Emacs on
Windows 95.  It didn't seem to be any different than the X11 version.  I
don't know how it would work with a screen reader, though.  That may be a
challenge.  I don't believe there is a version of EmacSpeak for Windows.

Also, Emacs is free.  That would be a plus for highschool students.

Though you did limit yourself to win95, I'd like to point
others on this list at Emacs--
there are some excellent tools for producing valid HTML
--especially html-helper-mode
