             News Bulletin From The Worldmachine TECHWIRE Service
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WAI (Web Application Interface), is a new technology packaged in the most
recent versions of the Netscape Enterprise and Fast Track Web Servers.
It allows web developers to creat CORBA based server-side applications in
Java, C, or C++.  Designed as a fast, robust, and scalable replacement
for CGI (Common Gateway Interface) programs, WAI could quite possibly
become the new standard for creating server side web applications.
