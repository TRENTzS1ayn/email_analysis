Another vote for emacs; my first response to the HTML
composition tool question is always psgml-mode.  Composer, Amaya, et
al can only handle elements and attributes they know about; give psgml
your DTD and it automatically knows what's valid where.

(Apologies for the drift off topic, but the more people who
construct web pages without insulating themselves from the code, the
more who will be able to comply with accessability standards.)
