From my point of view: go for HoTMetaL Pro 4.
from SoftQuad (http://www.softquad.com/products/pc-hmp4.htm)
you can download a trial version for some 60 days I believe
it is by far the best html editor I am aware of
HoTMetal comes now with some interfaces to softbraille etc.
so it became very accessible as a product
HoTMetaL PRO 4.0 is a validating editor, 
that enables the generation of high quality HTML. 
Using the 'Check HTML' command one can verify
that the markup in a document is correct and complete.
Furthermore, HoTMetaL PRO has implemented a 'Check Accessibility' 
command which checks documents against a set of accessibility guidelines.

good luck,
