There is talk about designing a standard Web browser that completely
matches W3C standards. Doing this will hopefully show the Web community
that it can be done and put MS and NS to shame in the process.....hopefully
causing them to revamp their own browsers in the process. What is the
status of Amaya? Is that something that can be turned into a full standard
browser that the community at large can make use of?
