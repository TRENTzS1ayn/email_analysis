I remember W3C talking to Netscape about this one about a year ago (so 
it's not new).

First, Netscape is using it in a completely different way, it's really
an innocent collision of acronyms.

I kind of remember an informal agreement to the effect that Netscape
will not assert IPR or claim trademark etc., as long as W3C doesn't
deny Netscape's right to use the WAI acronym for their Web Application
Interface (WAI) program.

Note that WAI is on the list of Trademarks owned by W3C listed at
