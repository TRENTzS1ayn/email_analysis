Good points George, There is, however, one slight problem.  When you said in
your message,
"The person knows the inserted information is over, because you then bump
into the > again."
I had to change the punctuation level of my screen reader in order to hear
the greater than sign pronounced.  True, if I knew I was going to have to
look for that sign, I could possibly put up with hearing all the other
unwanted punctuation just to hear the greater than sign.  It might, however,
be preferable to some to choose a character which is spoken when the least
amount of punctuation is turned on in the greatest number of screen readers.
This is why, in an earlier post, I suggested an asterisk.  In the number of
screen readers I have used, this is one of a number of commonly pronounced
symbols in the condition stated above.  Of course, there are others that
could be chosen also.
