All those lovely things you say about Hot Metal Pro 4 are relatively true,
but my experience with it was that it was very difficult to use with a
speech synthesizer, and I deleted it from my system before the trial period
ended. 

I use a combination of HTMLPRO3 (I think they are up to about 5 now) and
DreamWeaver finding the former the very simplest to use with speech access.
