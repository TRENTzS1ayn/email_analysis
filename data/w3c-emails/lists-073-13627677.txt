I'm not quoting the original message here because it was too long and too
well done and what I have to say will be short.
First, Trace should be congratulated and that's what this thread started
out to do.  Adobe as well is making commendable efforts toward
accessability and I believe we'll see more strides in the direction of
access.

My only reservation towards pdf at the moment is that as it is when you
hit it it is inaccessible in the same way that garfield is on the
washington post site.  It doesn't matter if it can be emailed or proxied,
the plain simple fact is that it takes an extra step.  This is a fact that
should be well publicisized and the use of pdf should be encouraged only
after long and carefull evaluation of the situation has taken place to
assure that there is no better solution and even then, in this case as
with the case of a highly glitsy site, if the site will be of use to or
heavily trafficed by pwds who use adaptave equipment as I do, there should
be an alternative that is readily accessible.  The day will come when the
mdium will not matter.  the rendering will take place regardless.
