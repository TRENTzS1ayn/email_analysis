     Folks,
     
        Why not combine the AC two-day meeting in January with ALL the 
     Interest Groups' (IG) meetings?  
        Like I said earlier, two trips to/up/down the West Coast to 
     short-lived events (1-2 days each) on successive weeks in January 
     doesn't make a whole lot of sense--but it sure eats up a lot of
time 
     and resources.
        Comments?
     
     Bill Flanigan

Joseph,

If we combine the AC and PIG meetings, I suggest the following calendar:

12 January 1998        P3P Protocols and Data Transport Working Group
Meeting
13 January 1998       Policy Interest Group (PIG)
14-15 January 1998      7th Advisory Committee Meeting

May we have facilities for the 12 and 13 January in the San Jose Area ?

Regards,

Yves
