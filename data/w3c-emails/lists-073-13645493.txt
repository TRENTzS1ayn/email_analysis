WAI:  I am interested to know if there are any solicitations for WEB services from the US (DoD or Federal Agency), State or Local governments that require compliance with the American Disabilties Act, discuss universal accessibility, or WAI?  Seems to me that if we are asking for compliance (without standards) then we should be educating and pushing the Government Procurement personnel, such as the Contracting Office and Project Managers.  

In reality, we know its a requirement, but until we educate the people that write the government solicitations, progress will be slowed. The Contracting Officers are the ones that we need to target for education and the best way to accomplish this goal is to provide guidance. Basically, help them write it (so to speak).  

Has the WAI addressed this?

Please note that Susan and Karl are with GSA's Center for IT Accommodation (CITA).  Susan is the Director.

Susan (or Karl): Do you know if this has been addressed?
