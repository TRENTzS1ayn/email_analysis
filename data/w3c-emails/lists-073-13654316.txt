If I put an HTTP-EQUIV Content-type into a web page then (as I understand 
it) I don't need to rely on the person who runs the server setting it up 
to give the correct content-type for all my pages.

In addition, I produce HTML material to be run from a CD-ROM as files  
- there is no server to program, so the HTTP-EQUIV is the only mechanism 
available.

A related question is how to specify the Language of a document - as I 
understand it it is possible to use an HTTP-EQUIV to 'fake' a server 
response, but I can't recall what it is (Content-language: en ???) Does 
anybody know?
