I wouldn't think that was true.  The average server defaults to sending
files as plain text for any resource it doesn't understand.  I don't
believe that setting an HTTP-EQUIV would work if the file is binary
(program/audio/video) and the server sends that as text.

New MIME types should be easy to add to any server.  I know that it only
takes a couple of minutes on Netscape Enterprise Servers.
