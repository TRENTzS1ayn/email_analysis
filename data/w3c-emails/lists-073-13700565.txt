I understand this much.  But, I am not really sure why it must retrieve the
document twice from the server.  I would think that once it parses the EQUIV
it could just parse the same file over again.  The data shouldn't have
changed.  But, that is where I am unsure.  Maybe the data is changed somehow
before it is written to the cache.  In any case, correct headers are most
definitely preferable.  I have never looked inside a browser.  I have been
inside Apache quite a bit, though.

The language negotiation is a bit baffling, though.  It is so simple, yet,
so complex.
