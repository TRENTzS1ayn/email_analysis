This is a reply to Kelly:

I agree.  Not all files are seamlessly converted.  You need to be aware 
what you are converting.  If it is a document with text, then it should be 
ok.  However if it is a form, it may not convert well.  You should test 
before you post!

Does anyone know of PDF Form (where  you can enter data)?  Would like to 
see how these convert.

I don't want to start a debate here but my personal opinion is that all
thse converters do as much harm as good.  If you ask me pdf is a
problematic file format at best for people that are blind.  I recently
tried to convert a batch of IRS documents and the results were disasterous.
 Yet the person at the IRS knew all about these converters and pointed me
directly to them and seemed oh so very pleased that the documents would be
made accessible by this convert technology.
