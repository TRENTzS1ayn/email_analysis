I can come up with a few:

In FDA we receive stacks of paper documents from industry and citizens that
can number hundreds of pages per document title.  We scan and put these
into Acrobat format, since these documents have not be supplied to us in an
electronic format. This is the only way we can keep up with the pace of
information flow.  We have difficulty with document conversion with
electronic copy as well.   Do you know how long it takes to convert a 1000
page WordPerfect document with scientific notation into HTML?  We have to
make these documents available to the public due to the FOI Act.  Also,
most lawyers want an exact "look and feel" of a document for legal reasons.

I prefer HTML, but it's close to impractical.  I can convert a 25 page
document into PDF in 5 minutes, while it would take 4 hours for HTML.
