...a large segment of the "public" goes missing here then, and in the

+electronic copy as well.   Do you know how long it takes to convert a 1000
+page WordPerfect document with scientific notation into HTML?  We have to
+make these documents available to the public due to the FOI Act.  Also,
+most lawyers want an exact "look and feel" of a document for legal reasons.
+
+I prefer HTML, but it's close to impractical.  I can convert a 25 page
+document into PDF in 5 minutes, while it would take 4 hours for HTML.
