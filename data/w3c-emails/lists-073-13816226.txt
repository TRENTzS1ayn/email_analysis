Some "new?" info.

Here's your chance to make Netscape Navigator 5.0 a
standards-compliant
dream (and to rain death on all this browser-dependent
workaround
nonsense that we're all SO sick of). Netscape is asking for
your help,
and Taylor tells you how to give it to them (with a focus on
the future
Navigator's renderer, the "Next Generation layout engine").
Yay.
