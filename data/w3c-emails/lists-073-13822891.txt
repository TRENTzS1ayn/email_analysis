ok, on to forms we go.  there are two methods that work nicely.  use
something like ms-access to create the form the other formerly popular app
will do nicely too dbase I think it was called.  then when you give out
the form give it out in a runtime form so that it can be filled out just
by basically tabbing around.  annother sollution is macros.  you can set
up a form in a macro so that it can't miss.  wp51 was great for this.
there are I'm sure myriads of other solutions out there.
it is a bulky problem to be sure.
