From Chris Hasser

A final note:  I.M.H.O., your comment about contracting officers was not
quite complete.  When a contracting officer writes a statement of work,
technical details are often supplied by someone more closely involved in 
the
area in question.
Rob>  True, and the procurement office will ask for the standards and 
references.  Could the WAI come up with a policy and reference list.  I 
know, lets ask Al Gilman! Al, what do you think?

So efforts to educate government technology officers
would not be in vain.  You might consider targeting the chief information
officer for each cabinet department for a letter from the WAI.
Rob>  Good idea, but most CIOs do not have much authority.  The position is 
still a paper tiger when it comes to agency policy and standards.  Whether 
or not this changes, it is still a good idea to send a letter from the WAI. 
 It is a start or a foot in the door. This should also be sent to the 
Procurements and Contracts Office for each Agency.  How do we make this an 
action item?  If the Feds require this on a soliticitaion, the IT 
Contractors will respond and perform to the Statement of Work.

Rob>  Chris, please keep us posted on the conference in October.

Thanks..rob
