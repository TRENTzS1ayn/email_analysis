Understand that my comments about the pdf file converters doing as much
good as bad were in no fashion meant to be critical of the work done by
those involved in the process.  I'm sure if any usage log were examined
(not implying any is kept) my email address would show up fairly often.

From my perspective, that as someone who's trying to use the assorted
documents created in pdf, there are two problems.

The first is that which I've commented on here in the past i.e. the
conversion doesn't always produce usable results.  This is a technical
problem that has all kinds of solutions that work to varying degrees.

The larger problem is only partly technical in nature.  Most places that
distribute materials, especially forms and alike, in a pdf format still
expect you to print that document and complete the material in the
traditional pen and paper fashion.  Even if the convert was flawless in
reproducing the layout of the form, it is unlikely that the organization
receiving the material would accept my word processed version of their form.

I suspect that if the problem of accepting the actual results of the form
in an alternative format were solved the pdf issue wouldn't be nearly as
problematic.
