Here's an answer from Martin Duerst, our local I18N expert.

Looks indeed like i18n.

I guess you are referring to the fact that you don't have a server on
a CD-ROM. But I guess having a small server-like thing might actuall
give a lot of other benefits.

This is indeed a problem, but more of education than anything else.
I'm planning to upgrade the i18n pages on the w3c site to explain
this in more detail. For Apache, for example, only one change is
needed in the central setup, and the rest can be done locally in
each directory.

The number of browsers that implement other, much more widely used
links such as "home" and "up" is very low. If link as a general
construct takes off, it may be a good idea to think about this.

But there is a big problem with all these approaches. If you add a new
language, you have to update all the parallel documents! This of course
applies less to a CD-ROM, but e.g. for servers of the European Union
and similar cases. There, automatic language negotiation is the best
way to go.

Above, as far as I was understanding, you were speaking about language
negotiation (i.e. how is the right document sent back if there are
several in different languages).

Here the answer is VERY clear. Use HTTP-EQUIV or the equivalent on the
server. The "trick" with the font is against all standards, and will
lead to all kinds of problems, e.g. wrong results from search engines,...
