We at the FCC are struggling with the same issue.  We
receive hundreds of thousands of pages of comments in
rulemaking proceedings every year, and retyping them all
into ASCII is not possible.  PDF as an interim format to at
least make these docs partially accessible seems to be the
best (only?) technology available right now for a collection of
documents received primarily in paper format. 

I encourage Adobe to keep improving the accuracy of the
ASCII converter.  Of course we'll continue to look for other
solutions too.   Meanwhile, we have committed to
reproducing all comments directly related to rulemakings
about Telecom Services to PWD's by scanning the
comments, OCR'ing them via Adobe's utility and then
manually cleaning up the OCR version.  Unfortunately very
timeconsuming, and not available as quickly as we'd like.

...a large segment of the "public" goes missing here then,
and in the
cases where relivant, could you provide them in zipped text
format or at
least wp?
