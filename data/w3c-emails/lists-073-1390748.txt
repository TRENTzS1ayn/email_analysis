Bill, et al,

I have wrestled with the question of when and where to hold these meetings,
now that I am Acting leader of the T & S Domain at W3C.  I had personal
motivation to move the meetings dates, as I have another commitment during
the week of the 5th.

Unfortunately, holding these meetings surrounding the AC meeting is not
something that the W3C Staff can accomodate.  This is because we feel that
honing the presentations we make to the AC meeting is of the highest
priority, and we use the 2 days prior to the AC meeting to do that.

Also, we did announce the date and place for the IG meetings at the last
meetings, and we expect that some number of members made plans on that
basis.  It would be unfair to them to now change the dates or place.

I don't see a solution to this problem that would not inconvenience someone
planning to attend.  Do any of you?

Alan
