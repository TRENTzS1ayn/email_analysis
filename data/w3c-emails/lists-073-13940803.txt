Thanks for taking the time to evaluate portions of my site and writing an
excellent evaluation.  I can't believe how quickly the Adobe Access
converter works.  The quality of the conversions leave a lot to be desired.

You comments definitely spur me on to do more HTML conversions.  I'm still
stuck with PDF for when I receive paper copies of documents though. 
Hopefully our future use of a document management system will give us more
original source documents, which will cut down on the number of paper
documents we receive.
