This isn't meant as a criticism, as I do understand the realities of time,
technology and funding.  However, what often happens when people start
making documents related to disability accessible and pay less attention to
other materials is that you potentially keep disability as a marginalized
population.

I might not care thing one about disability aside from my own situation but
could be deeply interested in other activities of the FCC or other
agencies.  This materially is equally as important.
