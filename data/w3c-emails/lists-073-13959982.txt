three points:
1> adobe is committed to the highest level of access possible.
2> perhaps there is a middle ground between stomping on people and
accepting the status quo.
3> it is possible to work within the system and effect change and not
loose heart.
we may get discouraged from time to time, but I've not lost heart lo these
many years.  till the time comes...
let's make the best use of the tools we have both for access and content
production and let's talk about html xml, web navigation and the host of
other things that make the web the web and work with people off list on
the pdf issues.
Thanks!
