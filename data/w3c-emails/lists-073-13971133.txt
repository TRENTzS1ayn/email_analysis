Kelly Ford's comment is right on point.  Focusing on items
directly related to services to persons with disabilities is only
an interim response.  Another reason to look for a
technology solution rather than relying on manual
intervention.

what often happens when people start making documents
related to disability accessible and pay less attention to
other materials is that you potentially keep disability as a
marginalized population.

I might not care thing one about disability aside from my own
situation but could be deeply interested in other activities of
the FCC or other agencies.  This materially is equally as
important.
