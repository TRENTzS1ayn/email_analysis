One of the nicest ways I have found of doing these, for all concerned 
parties, is to create an HTML form (without a submit button)

Although it may require a signature, which can only be added by hand (so 
far as I can figure out) all the other information can be entered in a 
form on-screen, which allows the use of assistive technology such as 
screen readers, as well as enabling the writing on the form to be 
computer generated and legible (assuming people use a legible font on 
their printer).

Trying to organise conferences where people handwrite important 
information in an incomprehensible scrawl made me realise the value of 
this technique. Having to produce a form which was print-and-post because 
a cheque or money order had to be mailed made me realise the benefits 
that it could provide to the people filling in the form.
