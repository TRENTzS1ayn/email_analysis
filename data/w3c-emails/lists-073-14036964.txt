This is the result of Web access discussions on another mailing list. The
word is slowly getting out.

>Text of Response
>
>I am responding to your letter on behalf of your constituent, {}, regarding
>accessibility of "web pages" on the internet to people with visual
disabilities.
>
>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires State and local
governments
>and places of public accommodation to furnish appropriate auxiliary aids and
>services where necessary to ensure effective communication with
individuals with
>disabilities, unless doing so would result in a fundamental alteration to the
>program or service or in an undue burden. 28 C.F.R. ? 36.303; 28 C.F.R. ? 
>35.160.
>Auxiliary aids include taped texts, Brailled materials, large print
materials,
>and other methods of making visually delivered materials available to people 
>with visual
>impairments.
>
>Covered entities under the ADA are required to provide effective
communication,
>regardless of whether they generally communicate through print media, audio
>media, or computerized media such as the Internet. Covered entities that
use the
>Internet for communications regarding their programs, goods, or services
must be
>prepared to offer those communications through accessible means as well.
>
>Mr. [] suggests compatibility with Lynx browser as a means of assuring
>accessibility of the Internet. Lynx is, however, only one of many available 
>options. Other
>examples include providing the web page information in text format, rather
than
>exclusively in graphic format. Such text is accessible to screen reading
devices
>used by people with visual impairments. Instead of providing full
accessibility
>through the Internet directly, covered entities may also offer other
alternate
>accessible formats, such as Braille, large print, and/or audio materials, to 
>communicate
>the information contained in web pages to people with visual impairments. The
>availability of such materials should be noted in a text (i.e.,
screen-readable)
>format on the web page, along with instructions for obtaining the
materials, so 
>that
>people with disabilities using the Internet will know how to obtain the 
>accessible
>formats.

>The Internet is an excellent source of information and, of course, people
with
>disabilities should have access to it as effectively as people without 
>disabilities. A
>number of web sites provide information about accessibility of web pages,  
>including
>information about new developments and guidelines for development of
accessible
>web pages. Examples include:

>Center for Information Technology Accommodation General Service

>These sites may be useful to you or your constituent in exploring the 
>accessibility options on
>the Internet. In addition, the Department of Justice has established an
ADA home 
>page to
>educate people about their rights and responsibilities under  the ADA and
about 
>the
>Department's efforts to implement the ADA. The address of the ADA home
page is

>Subject: Web Page Accessibility
>
>http://www.cast.org/bobby/
>
>Welcome to Bobby
>
>Bobby is a free service of CAST that will analyze single web pages for their
>accessibility to people with disabilities. Bobby will also examine a page's
>HTML to see if it is compatible with various web browsers or HTML
>specifications. Bobby was created at CAST (Center for Applied Special
>Technology). Founded in 1984, CAST is a not-for-profit organization whose
>mission is to expand opportunities for all people -- especially those with
>disabilities -- through the innovative uses of computer technology.
>
>Three versions of Bobby are available:
>
>   1.Bobby 2.0 - This on-line version analyzes individual web pages for
>accessibility using a list of commonly accepted  accessibility barriers. All
>pages on your website must receive four stars to display the Bobby Approved
>icon. This legacy approval criteria may not be an option after July 1998.
>
>   2.Bobby 2.01 - This on-line version analyzes individual web pages for
>accessibility using a subset of the February 3 working draft of "WAI
>Accessibility Guidelines: Page Authoring" that can be automated. All pages
>must pass to display the Bobby Approved icon. Page authors wishing to signify
>compliance
>with these more stringent guidelines may wish to add "with WAI 0203" below
the
>icon.
>
>   3.Bobby the Application (beta 1) - This application will test local files
>and entire websites for accessibility. It is written in Java and will run
>under Solaris and Windows 95/NT. Like Bobby 2.01, it uses the February 3
>working draft WAI
>accessibility page authoring guidelines. To download the application, go the
>Bobby 2.01 home page.
>
>Suggested Approach
>
>CAST recommends that web developers use Bobby as the first step to ensure
>accessible web page design. In addition, we suggest the following:
>
>   1.Read the most current "WAI Accessibility Guidelines: Page Authoring".
>   2.Review the "WAI Accessibility Guidelines: Page Authoring Checklist".
>   3.Request feedback from visitors to your web site.
>   4.Retest web pages frequently with updated versions of Bobby.
>
>True accessibility is ultimately a human endeavor and Bobby is only one step
>in the process of making a site accessible to as many people as possible.
Also
>note that the WAI page author gidelines are a work in progress. Depending on
>the frequency of new releases, CAST will make every effort to provide a
>version of Bobby for each new set of WAI page author guidelines.
