     Hello Alan,
     
        Here are some options you might consider:
     
                1.  Since the AC meeting has "highest priority," why not

     skip the IG meetings this time?
     
                2.  Next time (six months out), schedule the IG meetings
so 
     that they are held AFTER the AC meetings--say the AC meets on
Monday 
     and Tuesday followed by IG meetings on Wednesday and Thursday.
     
                3.  Hold the IG meetings this time (and, perhaps in the 
     future) via teleconferencing--I've used this for up to 20 people
with 
     good effect.
     
        All of the above have one objective:  to save money for (1) W3C 
     members and (2) the W3C itself.  It's as simple as that.  
        
        Let's also be frank about this:  there seems to be a heck of a
lot 
     of overlap between topics, presentations, discussions, and
individuals 
     at both AC and IG meetings.
     
        Comments?
     
     Bill Flanigan

Bill, et al,

I have wrestled with the question of when and where to hold these
meetings,
now that I am Acting leader of the T & S Domain at W3C.  I had personal
motivation to move the meetings dates, as I have another commitment
during
the week of the 5th.

Unfortunately, holding these meetings surrounding the AC meeting is not
something that the W3C Staff can accomodate.  This is because we feel
that
honing the presentations we make to the AC meeting is of the highest
priority, and we use the 2 days prior to the AC meeting to do that.

Also, we did announce the date and place for the IG meetings at the last
meetings, and we expect that some number of members made plans on that
basis.  It would be unfair to them to now change the dates or place.

I don't see a solution to this problem that would not inconvenience
someone
planning to attend.  Do any of you?

Alan
