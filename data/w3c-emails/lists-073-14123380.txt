Hello WAI Interest Group Member:

This message invites you to review a new Working Draft of the "WAI
Accessibility Guidelines: Page Authoring." The WAI Page Author Guidelines
Working Group has worked for several months to reprioritize and restructure
these guidelines, and increase their usability.

TIMELINE: Please send all comments and questions to w3c-wai-gl@w3.org by
17:00 US EDT Tuesday, September 15, 1998.

After a one-week review period (September 9-15, 1998) comments will be
reviewed and integrated into the document by the Working Group.  The
resulting new Working Draft will be posted to the W3C Technical Reports
page <http://www.w3.org/TR> to replace the current public Working Draft,
bringing us closer to issuing the WAI Page Author Guidelines as a Proposed
Recommendation.

The document to review is located at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH. Linked from this document you
will also find a detailed "Techniques" document, providing technical
information on how to implement the guidelines. This "techniques" document
will most likely be issued as a non-normative appendix to the WAI Page
Author Guidelines. The Working Group welcomes comments on the Techniques
document as well.

Thank you,

Judy
