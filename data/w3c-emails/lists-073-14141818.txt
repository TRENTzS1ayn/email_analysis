We use pwWebSpeak and Lynx.  PwWebSpeak is available for evaluation from 
www.prodworks.com and Lynx is available free somewhere.  This may be an 
oversimplification but I'll say it anyway.  I feel that if a site is 
functional in Lynx and all the content is present (assuming the site has 
some) then it is pretty accessible.  This should of course be double 
checked using free tools available such as the W3C HTML Validator 
(http://validator.w3.org), Bobby (www.cast.org/bobby), and a personal 
favorite Web Site Garage (http://www.websitegarage.com).  The first is for 
HTML 4.0 compliance verification, the second for accessibility verification 
(no flaming me on this point) and the third for other aspects such as 
search engine readiness.  Hope this satisfies your question.

Subject:  Using text readers to test accessibility

Hi all,

Can someone point me to some text readers that can be used to test Web
accessibility?
I'd love to test these out. This would also be a great resource for other
Web developers.

Thanks.
