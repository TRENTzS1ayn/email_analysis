You probably want to use Lynx, a unix (or Linux) based text browser.  There
are ports for other OS's as well.

I have done a quick web search and have found:

http://leb.net/blinux/blynx/index.html
BLYNX: Lynx Support Files Tailored for Blind and Visually Handicapped Users

http://www.crl.com/~subir/lynx/binaries.html
This page has links to a dozen or so version of Lynx that run on most
platforms, includint Windows, the Mac, and various flavors of Unix.

Hope this helps,
Thomas
