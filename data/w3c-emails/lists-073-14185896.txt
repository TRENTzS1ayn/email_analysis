The real point is to provide a print-and-post form (for example to go with
a cheque) which is accessible. A blind person cannot fill out the form
with a pen very easily. If the form is in HTML, then it can be filled out
using fairly standard forms of Assistive technology. A basic assumption is
that the minutiae of the form's layout are not critical - using a GUI
browser they actually come out looking quite nice, but one of the benefits
is that the information is typed rather than scrwaled, so it is fairly
easy to interpret. 

The pay system I did was a bit more complex. Hours, employee data, and 
pay rates were entered into a form. The form was processed by the server, 
which checked the authorisation, antered the data into the database, 
calculated payment rates, and returned a table of information which had 
to be printed and submitted with an ink-on-paper signature.

Again it is impossible to control the output completely, but it is 
presented in some reasonably legible format by any browser (if the code 
is properly written - I did it using Cold Fusion and SQL which allows the 
required flexibility)
