There has been some contention that certain sites must post documents
that come to them in the form of printed materials.  It is fairly
evident that the only people still using mechanical typewriters are the
detectives on TV cop shows.  I would be surprised if *any* of the print
materials presented for posting to government web sites weren't at some
point in its history in the form of bits and bytes, therefor when the
webmaster is requested to post printed matter she should "just say no"
and demand the electronic version that preceded the submitted print.
