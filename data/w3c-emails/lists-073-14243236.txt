Working in libraries with commercially published publications, I have
discovered that, specifically, some journal publishers or resellers don't
have access to a single, manageable stream of electronic source material;
the first point in the production system at which everything is in one
format is when it's on paper.  Admittedly, saying their production process
is chaotic doesn't address what their process should be, or how they might
address accessibility, but that's one situation.

Another is that some commercial publishers are fanatical--if not
completely paranoid--about maintaining consistent visual presentation of
their materials.  It is a branding issue for them.  Again, this is a
mindset that cares about the good of the company more than the good of the
customer, but there it is.

For either or both of these reasons, PDF is the norm in commercial
publishing of electronic journals; HTML, SGML, and other flexible formats
are in the minority.  That's why we have a couple hundred Gigabytes of PDF
on our servers.  We cannot demand the ancestor electronic format because
it simply isn't for sale.
