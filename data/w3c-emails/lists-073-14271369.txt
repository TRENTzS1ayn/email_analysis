To give everyone an idea on the scope of the government requirement.  Much 
of the paper that needs to go up was typed in 1960.  A chunk of the Freedom 
of Information Act Information (FOIA) was type before computers.  I have 
seen letters from the early sixties that need to be posted.  The letters 
are old and have all the old signatures and stamps on them.

I think everyone needs to size of the task.  Sun Tzu said know thy "enemy"

There has been some contention that certain sites must post documents
that come to them in the form of printed materials.  It is fairly
evident that the only people still using mechanical typewriters are the
detectives on TV cop shows.  I would be surprised if *any* of the print
materials presented for posting to government web sites weren't at some
point in its history in the form of bits and bytes, therefor when the
webmaster is requested to post printed matter she should "just say no"
and demand the electronic version that preceded the submitted print.
