The list may be interested to know that the PDF accessibility problem was
one of the driving forces that led to the establishment of the City of San
Jose Web Design Standard in 1996 which is found at
http://www.ci.san-jose.ca.us/oaacc/disacces.html 

For example, an ADA complaint was filed in my office against the City of San
Jose by a blind City Commissioner (appointed to advise City Council on
disability issues) who needed access to City Council documents.  Our City
Clerk had posted the documents in PDF which prevented assistive computer
technology such as screen readers from accessing the City web site.

Currently, our web accessibility standard requires that if a City department
posts a document in PDF, then the document will also be posted in an
accessible format utilizing ASCII or text HTML.  Exceptions to this
accessibility requirement are those documents depicting information which by
their very nature are graphical, such as street maps, building plan
drawings, and pictorial diagrams.  In addition, all hyperlinks to PDF
documents must include the word "PDF" within the hyperlink description.

As City departments update their pages, they are now implementing the City
Web Design Standard.  As solutions arise to resolve barriers to effective
communication created by new technology, the City Web Design Standards will
be revised.  We welcome all efforts of Adobe and TRACE to improve the PDF
product and understand the benefits of PDF.   However, as long as complex
documents fail to convert to accessible HTML, the management of this issue
for local government will require the standard to remain in place to ensure
non-discriminatory public access to City documents.

As this list can understand, a number of United States State and Federal
laws embody civil right protections for people with disabilities.  For
further information about how the United States Americans with Disabilities
Act of 1990 applies to the internet, please see a short article I wrote at
the request of the American Bar Association based on a law lecture I gave at
Santa Clara University School of Law:

A Web Accessibility Standard."
