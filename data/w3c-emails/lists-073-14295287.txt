Hi all,

This event also has a Web Accessibility speaker.
----

The Web Standards Project will hold a "Birds of a Feather" gathering during
Miller Freeman's Web '98 conference to promote Web developer and public
support
for encouraging browser makers to fully comply with standards created by the
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and other standards bodies.

The event, sponsored by C|Net Builder.com, is scheduled for Wednesday,
September 23rd from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. in room 104 of the Hynes Convention
Center.

WaSP speakers include Steve Champeon, Senior Technical Consultant and
Vice-President,     hesketh.com/inc. Champeon will be discussing the project's
goals -- to eliminate the wasted time and effort working around browser
incompatibilities and to stop the fragmentation of the Web by persuading the
browser makers that common standards are in everyone's best interest.

Champeon will also provide updates on the progress that's been made so far.
WaSP's launch last month drew worldwide attention to the problems caused by
the
current patchwork support for standards, which the group estimates adds 25
percent to the cost of developing sites.

To fix these problems, WaSP is urging browser makers to fully support
Cascading
Style Sheet 1 (CSS-1), the Document Object Model (DOM) and XML in their 5.0
browsers.

Also speaking at this event will be Harvey Bingham, a Web Accessibility
Consultant.  Bingham is working with the Yuri Rubinsky Insight Foundation and
sits on several working groups for the World Wide Web Consortium?s Web
Accessibility Initiative. He will be introducing the W3C?s draft of page
authoring guidelines whose purpose is to help Web developers make their sites
more accessible by all.

"It's time for the browsers to start fully supporting World Wide Web
Consortium
(W3C) core standards -- standards that Microsoft and Netscape helped develop
and promised to support -- so that people building Web sites can spend more
time building better sites and less time fighting browsers over compatibility
issues that create unneeded expenses for everyone, at every level of the Web,"
said WSP co-founder, Glenn Davis, Chief Technology Officer of Project Cool,
Inc., a Palo Alto-based educational resource center for Web development.  

This will be the first in a series of trade show events to bring together Web
developers and the Web-using public in order to raise awareness about the
problems caused by the current patchwork support for standards.

This event is open to the public.
