Charles McCathie Nevile's above paragraph is an example of the  
dilemia faced by agencies needing  to produce information in 
many different languages and making that information accessible 
from the website.  PDF is often used for this purpose but for 
accessibility reasons is not necessarily the best solution.  

We are investigating the use of Unicode with HTML 4.0 to 
develop and display the documents directly to the browser.  Using 
individual fonts such as MingLu (Chinese), GulimChe (Korean), etc. is 
also being considered. 

We do not wish to 'reinvent the wheel'  and would like to discuss 
this issue with others who are who are enabling the viewing of 
multilingual web content without using a PDF format.  I apologise if 
this is not a topic for this list and would appreciate being pointed 
to the correct one.

Thank you
Lorna
