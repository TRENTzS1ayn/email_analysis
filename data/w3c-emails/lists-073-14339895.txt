For a quick introduction to what kinds of devices exist, you
could consult the technology glossary at the following site:

   Linkname: ATRC Home Page
        URL: http://www.utoronto.ca/atrc/index.html

   Linkname: Technical Glossary
        URL: http://www.utoronto.ca/atrc/tech/techgloss.html

On the other hand, this may not really be what you need.  This
technology is not free, nor is it always easy to set up.  There
are things you can do with various websites and mainline tools
which are useful for checking out your site.  But not all these
things are under one roof, so to speak.

The WAI Evaluation and Repair Interest Group has been set up for
people like you to compare notes on what works for you.  Your
post is as good a match to "an interest in evaluation and repair"
as I can imagine, as meant in the charter of this group.

Under the ER home page at http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/ you will find
a list of existing tools and services.  We need people like you
to try them out and post your reactions to w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org.

The Evaluation and Repair Working Group exists to point
toolsmiths at the holes that are not covered by existing
capabilities.  But the toolsmiths need to hear from their
customers, like you, as to what works and doesn't work in the
current offerings.
