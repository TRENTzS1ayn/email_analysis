Well, as a member of W3C Internationalization (I18N) Working Group, we
are also interested in the interactions between I18N and accessibility.
As Al pointed out, we have I18N Interest Group for discussion among W3C
Members, but we have also public mailing list, www-international@w3.org,
for general discussion about I18N of the Web.  For more information about
W3C Internationalization Activity, please refer to
