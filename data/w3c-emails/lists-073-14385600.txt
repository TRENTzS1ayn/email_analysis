Well falks, to those who say its too early to 
use stylesheets for layout, I must say that the tests in:
http://www.macvirus.com/test/pp/w3c-home/
come out nicely in tabular layout (some problems with test five)
while http://www.w3.org comes "linear" in my browser.

I am using Opera3.5 beta under windows3.1; CSS turned on; tables turned off!
