Marju asked if there was a guideline about how to use frames in a way 
that enabled various points to be bookmarked, and said the current 
technique was to rebuild the frameset each time, with all links having 
TARGET="_top"

Nir said that the solution was to not use frames, since rebuilding the 
frameset every time a link was followed was a waste of bandwidth.

That is a kind way of viewing it. Rebuilding the frameset each time is 
like publishing a book in modules, with a binder and complete table of 
contents available, and then only supplying the modules along with the 
binder and contents. Non-frames browsers, such as lynx, will be forced 
back to an intermediate step of establishing the relevant frame for each 
link followed, which is worse than when frames are correctly coded.
