Hear, hear.  Even for frames-capable versions of links, rebuilding the
frameset means an extra step to get to the content pages.

A less draconian solution, if you want to use frames, is to write a
simple CGI that creates the appropriate frameset for any content
document.  I started doing this so I could provide multiple entry
points to a frameset without constructing a bunch of static documents.
You can use SSI to add a link to the appropriate frameset on every
content page, et voila, fully bookmarkable frames.  (Doesn't work if
there are more frameset states than content documents, but 99% of the
framesets out there are one or more menu frames plus a single content
frame.)  See http://www.slack.net/~whelan/cgi-bin/tbrw.cgi for my
implementation of this idea.
