I am looking for a set of symbols that may be used for web and other
delivery channels to convey stand actions.  Standard actions such as Help
(how very apt), Print, Pay Now, Email,... up to about 20 or so that could be
used for wider-access but also including multicultural aspects.

General questions though, would a set of symbols like this be useful ?  Can
a set be established that really mean the same thing to a wide range of
users?  Like a STOP sign, is this international and/or recognized by all?
All feedback, excluding flames, most welcome.

Regards, James
