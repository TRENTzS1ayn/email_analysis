There are some symbols which are pretty common - stop signs, for example. 
I think a question mark is widely recognised for help, and an envelope 
reasonably widely for email. (All this assumes sighted users, of course). 
There are other syumbols which are common, but mean different things - 
magnifying glasses, wavy lines, dollar signs, credit card logos, and 
various other icons are ubiquititous, but are understood differently 
according to context and personal background. So they may not be as 
helpful as they could.

(This is why some grahpic communicators are good, and some are 
also-rans.) There are libraries of these things on the web.
