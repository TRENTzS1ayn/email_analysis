Traffic lights [Stop/Go]; red and yellow striped hazard signs [Caution];
chevrons [Direction]; 'voltage' flash [Electronics or hardware]; speech
bubble [Talk]; 'thinks' bubble [Concepts]; Open book [Literature, text];
exclamation mark [Attention]; Eye [Visuals/Images]; Printer Icon;
Dollar/Pound sign; Cashiers Till; World [Web]; etc I think are all pretty
safe. Beyond these, you enter cultural, semantic and conceptual thin ice.
