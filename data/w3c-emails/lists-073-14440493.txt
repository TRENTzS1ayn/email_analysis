I am looking for a set of symbols that may be used for web and other
delivery channels to convey stand actions.  Standard actions such as Help
(how very apt), Print, Pay Now, Email,... up to about 20 or so that could be
used for wider-access but also including multicultural aspects.

General questions though, would a set of symbols like this be useful ?  Can
a set be established that really mean the same thing to a wide range of
users?  Like a STOP sign, is this international and/or recognized by all?
All feedback, excluding flames, most welcome.

Recommended (required?) reading: "Illustrating Computer Documentation: The Art of Presenting Information Graphically on Paper and Online" [http://www.horton.com/html/icd.htm] by William Horton. The book includes a 20-page chapter "Labeling With Icons and Visual Symbols" and a 10-page chapter "Global Graphics" which addresses internationalization issues such as cultural differences in the meanings of symbols. He cross-references all his summaries and recommendations to a 350-item bibliography of the original research publications.

This book is the first, and last, resource I turn to when I'm about to embark on a new publishing project.
