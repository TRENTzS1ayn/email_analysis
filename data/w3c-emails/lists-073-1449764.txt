FYI - it was great to see the plug "often accessible as text"

And now for today's cool web site...

PBS ONLINE
http://www.pbs.org/
One of the only television sites to make you feel you don't need a
TV, the Public Broadcasting System's online presence could
satisfy the masses without an umbilical cord to the tube. Sure,
there are pages devoted to upcoming movies, and PBS previews
abound, but such standbys as P.O.V., Nova, and The McNeil-
Lehrer Newshour, boast enough meaty content--often accessible
as text--and interactive intrigue (via RealAudio) to supplant their
TV counterparts. Links from the Democracy Project and the
Newshour's background transcripts take you all over the world,
through history, and into reference sources. Local PBS stations
are hooked up, too, broadening the informational universe. And
the Life on the Internet series clarifies how all this came to exist in
the first place.
