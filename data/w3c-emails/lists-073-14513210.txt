It would seem that written language used in any electronic or print
material would specifically require that symbols commonly accepted for
the specific language would be the best choice. The possibilities of
having a misunderstanding is greatly reduced when the designer's native
language is the same as the target audience.

Major problems develop when instructions are translated from a foreign
language into English. Ask any father who attempts to assemble a bicycle
on the evening before Christmas and the product was manufactured in
China.

To determine if there is any universal acceptance, someone must first
collect and publish symbols used as part of English documents and see if
there are any differences that might occur in American, Australia, and
England. 

Other individuals who publish materials in other languages would be
needed to provide provide the symbols they use. Complete universality
may be impractical, but perhaps translator of a short list of symbols
could be developed.

For example, a web site that has a selection on the main page that
allows the visitor to select English, French, Japanese, Chinese,
Russian, etc. would use the most appropriate symbols as part of their
translation of the document.

I have no previous experience with the specific problem, but it provides
an interesting question that should be addressed.
