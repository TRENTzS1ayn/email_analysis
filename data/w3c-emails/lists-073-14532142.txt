I have prepared a set of powerpoint '97 slides on the recent guidelines. I
did not have time to await the official set being developed in the EO
working group. They are a contribution to that effort. 

I present them Wednesday, 19980923 at the Web conference in Boston, Hynes 
Convention Center Room 104 6:00 to 7:30 at a Birds of a Feather session.
I'd welcome your presence. I was volunteered for this a week ago, and knew the
latest and greatest draft was soon to be released. So, I've spent today
readying the talk based on that 19980918 release.

As they include a W3C WAI logo their size ballooned by a factor of 2 to
186Kbytes. That makes them inaccessible over email to so many. Please 
have a look at them from my site:

or that file pkzipped (33Kbytes):

I'd appreciate any critique and suggestions on repairs to them before noon
tomorrow.
