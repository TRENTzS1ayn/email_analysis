ASG: If a coupon-clipping example were used as an illustration of
the new LONGDESC attribute, this would be a good explanation of
why the new attribute is needed and would get the
access-to-commerce issue before the web author community.

On a longer time horizon, this scenario is also a good one for
the Authoring Tool Guidelines team to consider.  These coupons
are worth very little money, and are normally produced with very
low-cost publishing setups.  The text defining the business offer
needs to be captured on the way into the image, not as the image
is reduced to a GIF.
