A Web Accessibility Information Day was held in Melbourne yesterday (Tuesday 
22 Sept) organised by Liddy Nevile, of the Sunrise Research Laboratory.

Around 50 people came to each of four one hour talks presented by Liddy, 
and then were able to see some different technologies in action, 
including a palmtop, Jaws, TVRaman's Emacspeak, a kiosk and a touch-screen 
browser developed for people with learning disabilities.

The day was a success, with a number of people from many different 
organisations, including web designers, lawyers, Telstra (Australia's 
major telecommunications company and a sponsor of the day) and others 
taking back to their work a new outlook on designing and on commissioning 
websites.
