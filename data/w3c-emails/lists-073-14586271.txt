Hi Charles
    Is anyone looking into making presentation materials such as those used
by Liddy freely available for use by others?
    A colleague at UKOLN and I recently ran a half day session on metadata
and we intend to make the materials (PowerPoint files [plus HTML versions],
hands-on exercises and group exercises) freely available.  I think it would
be useful if something similar were done with WAI materials.
    Thanks
      Brian

>A Web Accessibility Information Day was held in Melbourne yesterday
(Tuesday
>22 Sept) organised by Liddy Nevile, of the Sunrise Research Laboratory.
>
>Around 50 people came to each of four one hour talks presented by Liddy,
>and then were able to see some different technologies in action,
>including a palmtop, Jaws, TVRaman's Emacspeak, a kiosk and a touch-screen
>browser developed for people with learning disabilities.
>
>The day was a success, with a number of people from many different
>organisations, including web designers, lawyers, Telstra (Australia's
>major telecommunications company and a sponsor of the day) and others
>taking back to their work a new outlook on designing and on commissioning
>websites.
