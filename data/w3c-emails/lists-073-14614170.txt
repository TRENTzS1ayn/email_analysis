... I was just perusing through my local library's catalog.  I did not find the
book you referenced.  So, I searched by Author and found this one.  Have you
any experience with this book?  It appears to be an update.  ...

It's a different book by the same author. Horton has a list of books he's authored on his company's Web site at http://www.horton.com/html/bookintro.htm. This lists both "The Icon Book" you found (I'm not familiar with it, but now I want to look for it!) and "Illustrating Computer Documentation."
