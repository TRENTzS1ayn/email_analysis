There is a very innovative of use of symbols on the following site.
www.signbrowser.demon.co.uk Also I think you could check out the widgit site
www.widgit.com

Dusty' Home page
http://www.microweb.com/ddutton/dustyd.html
here photos are used as bookmarks/links. The photo bookmarks act as visual
reminders to the user who has difficulty in reading returning to their
favourite pages.

Meldreth Manor School www.rmplc.co.uk/eduweb/sites/meldreth use a
combination of large print and speaking by symbols.
One curious thing here is that these web sites are accessible to people with
learning or cognitive disabilities but probably not accessible under the
w3org guidelines. A bit of a dichotomy I think
