The field of Alternative and Augmentative Communication (AAC or "Aug. Com.") is
a well developed specialty, primarily within the purview of Speech Language
Pathologists (SLP).  One very critical topic in this field is the selection of
wordless picture systems for non-vocal persons.  These symbol systems have a
tendency towards internationalism because they are designed for young children
who have not yet learned to read.  As odd as the idea may seem, there are
several companies which derive a large portion of their incomes selling
communication icons!

Probably the most popular is the Picture Communication Symbols (PCS) of which
there are over three thousand (color and black and white):  Mayer Johnson -
About the PCS (http://www.mayer-johnson.com/PICTSYMB/Aboutpcs.htm), follow the
links for BoardMaker to see the color samples.  Feel free to give these people
grief for not having alt text!

To be fair, I should mention their biggest competitor.  Prentke Romich has the
longest history of a commercial vendor with regard to electronic communication
aids.  They favor a smaller symbol set (less than 200, all in color) and, while
interesting, is probably not relevant to this thread:  Minspeak FAQ
(http://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/scs/faq.html).

This thread seems to betaking a direction towards wordless international
communication.  Persons interested in this should learn about Blissymbolics, a
communication system originally Developed by Charles K. Bliss (1897-1985) for
the purpose of international communication (think "League of Nations" and you
will have an idea of how successful he was).  Bliss has fewer than one hundred
primitives that can be combined into thousands of words.  Visit Blissymbolics
Communication International for more information (http://home.istar.ca/~bci/).
