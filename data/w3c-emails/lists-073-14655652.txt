Hi Al
    Thanks for the message.
     I wasn't really intending to comment on the WAI guidelines so much as
the resources provided by the WAI community including contributions to
mailing lists.  When I view the mail archive on the web URLs are converted
to links - so arguably you shouldn't give URLs for binary files.  I
understand that the W3C don't want to be seen advising people what they
should do in email, but I think it's useful for people interested in WAI
issues to be aware of the implications of typing in something like binary
URLs (e.g. http://dodgysite.com/delete.exe) - see
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/1998JulSep/ to see what
happens.

Brian

(BTW It's just occured to me that using a tool like Bobby across the web
archive of this message could / should give an accessibility warning - with
the obvious implications of what is a website, and can accessibility checked
be turned off for certain areas).
