Step back for a moment and ask yourself - "Why do they use an image in the
first place?"  It's apparent to me that the image of the coupon is taken
directly from the electronic pre-press the newspaper is using.

Does anyone honestly believe that a free service will pay someone to read
and type in the thousands of lines of text that appear in the coupons?
Especially since the newspaper has already paid someone to enter the
information initially into their pre-press system.

Looking at just one coupon for "Arco."  There are two maps, 4 separate
coupons, 6 corporate logos and (I'm guessing here) over a hundred words.
That's just one entry that might have a lifetime of a week.

If LONGDESC= was available, in this case, no one would take the time
required to put the information in.  Access is not access if it's
prohibitive to implement.

ASG: If a coupon-clipping example were used as an illustration of
the new LONGDESC attribute, this would be a good explanation of
why the new attribute is needed and would get the
access-to-commerce issue before the web author community.

On a longer time horizon, this scenario is also a good one for
the Authoring Tool Guidelines team to consider.  These coupons
are worth very little money, and are normally produced with very
low-cost publishing setups.  The text defining the business offer
needs to be captured on the way into the image, not as the image
is reduced to a GIF.
