Agreed.  It is [universal, not just disability access] better
practice to cite a distribution site start page or something that
will invoke the README for the context where the binary is
available.  That way, if there are alternatives available, you
learn about them when you follow the reference.  Without having
to back up and snoop around with URL hacking tricks.

Two examples of things for which there is currently no way to do
a Bobby-like automatic check:

- what is a site?

- your original point corresponding to the C.1 guideline.

But I think it is better to read the Bobby results with a grain
of salt than to skip whole patches of Web because they contain
uncheckable features -- it [mostly] all does.
