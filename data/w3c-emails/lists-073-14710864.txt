I have to disagree on this:

>Yet, very basic Sign Language is universal. 

There is no such thing as universal sign language. Each community's sign
language is a naturally formed language with it's own phonology,
morphology, and syntax. If a Deaf American and a Deaf German meet on the
street, they *won't* understand each other. What they *will* be better at
is a mutual gesturing. Since they both use language through a visual
medium, they're more receptive to communicating physically.

I realize this is off-topic, but I gotta use my MA in ASL Linguistics
*somewhere*!
