Thank you Kynn for spotting this. 

Yes October 6th, a Tuesday, (was) the original close-of-registration, and
the 13th, also a Tuesday, is the date of the workshop. 

And an update: the workshop proved so popular that they have had to close
registration early. 

If anyone has questions please contact me.

thanks,

Judy
