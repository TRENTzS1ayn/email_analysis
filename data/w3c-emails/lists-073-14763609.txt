Just a quick note to agree with Jessica Chaiken, working as a British Sign Language (BSL) interpreter, variation of Sign Language occurs within the UK, as well as internationally.

With regard to;

This 'signed english' does not represent BSL but rather a signed language in its own right, probably a signed system called Makaton.
Lastly, within the UK there is also Signed Supported English (SSE) which varies from the phonology, morphology, and syntax in BSL.

This may seem off topic but the understanding of the difference phonology etc, in Signed Languages is important for Deaf people's access to information.
