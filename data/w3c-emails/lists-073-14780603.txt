I looked over them. They are very nice, and they do comply with 
the guidelines in large part. The Duttons' pages are short a few 
alt-tags. The Meldreth school has a very incomplete navigation system, 
and some of the alt-tags could possibly be improved a bit, but generally 
it seems accessible, if slightly confusing to me.
