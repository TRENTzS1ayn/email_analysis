Though not readily available as it should be, there is a 'person first'
protocol of language that is being urged into use when referring to persons
with disabilities. It is the APA standard, currently.   I can send a
brochure on this to you by snail mail or by fax.    I am trying to get this
information onto our web site, but alas, no time, no time.  Maybe I will get
a chance in November or December.
