An alert for those who are considering attending the WWW7 Conference in
Brisbane in April:  the submissions deadline (intent to submit a paper,
poster, tutorial, etc.) is today, December 1, midnight Australian Eastern
Standard Time; which is also 2pm GMT and 8am EST in North America.  

There will some presentation on WAI as part of the W3C management update at
the conference, and very likely a dedicated day of accessibility activities
on Thursday or Friday.  Papers and tutorials would give additional
attention to accessibility.

Sorry for the short notice.  If you are submitting, please let me know as
well.  Also, please indicate accessibility as a keyword in the submission
form (if that is indeed your topic).  

For additional information, please see http://www7.conf.au/

Regards,

Judy Brewer
