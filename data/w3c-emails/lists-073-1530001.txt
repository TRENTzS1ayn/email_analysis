     Judy:
     
     May I have some guidance from you regarding members of the W3C 
     advisory committee?
     
     Hope all goes well.

An alert for those who are considering attending the WWW7 Conference in 
Brisbane in April:  the submissions deadline (intent to submit a paper, 
poster, tutorial, etc.) is today, December 1, midnight Australian Eastern 
Standard Time; which is also 2pm GMT and 8am EST in North America.  
     
There will some presentation on WAI as part of the W3C management update at 
the conference, and very likely a dedicated day of accessibility activities 
on Thursday or Friday.  Papers and tutorials would give additional 
attention to accessibility.
     
Sorry for the short notice.  If you are submitting, please let me know as 
well.  Also, please indicate accessibility as a keyword in the submission 
form (if that is indeed your topic).  
     
For additional information, please see http://www7.conf.au/
     
Regards,
     
Judy Brewer
