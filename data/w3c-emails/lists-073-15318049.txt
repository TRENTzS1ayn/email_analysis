Hello all,

The Web Standards Project is soliciting Web design "war stories" from the
public. Have you been stuck designing a Web site for a client that had to
be a certain way in all browsers? Did you end up spending countless hours
creating workarounds for the areas that weren't standards compliant? I know
this is especially an issue with making sites accessible- I've recently
started consulting on accessibility myself. Full support by both browsers
of CSS-2 positioning schemes may allow designers to stop using tables for
purposes of layout.

Come tell us your horror story.
