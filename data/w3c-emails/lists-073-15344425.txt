Excellent question -- participants in a HWG project earlier this
year identified "a browser that would show me what my site sounds
like" as one of the most important aids to creating accessible
web pages.

I highly recommend pwWebSpeak -- it costs $150 but you can get a limited
use trial copy for free by asking.  The webpage is 
http://www.prodworks.com/ -- and this reminds me, I need to pay my
$150.  This product is a must-have (in my opinion) for serious web
designers who care about making their sites universally accessible!

(Yes, prodworks people, you can quote me on that. ;) )
