Have a look at the sigtuna browser, a speech output browser for WinNT 
(and 95?), for unix systems TVRaman at adobe has written a piece of 
software called emacspeak, which can be used alongside EMACs and the W3 
browser package - Jason White in Melbourne uses such a system.

Sigtuna relies on a speech system being present already. I don't know if 
there is one available for free, but I would suspect they can be got for 
very little.

That's all the freeware I know about...
