Having the most accessible web browser won't do a bit of good if the
content isn't readable.  What would be nice is for some of the content
developers to get on board the accessibility campaigns.  But individual
letters from people probably aren't going to convince them of this so I
wonder what might be done.  Is there an arm of the web accessibility
efforts that reaches out to content developers like the Orange County
Register?

Authoring tools certainly should automate the process of making accessible
texts as much as possible.
