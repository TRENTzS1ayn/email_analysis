Wouldn't longdesc be more appropriate for this?  (I know the drill, browsers
don't support it, therefore it is useless.  I disagree with that argument,
and, no I probably wont change my mind.)  I agree, why bother with the alt
if it adds no value.  Especially, if it is an annoyance rather than useful.

So...  Who says that Bobby is always right?  It is very good, but, humans
are still smarter.  Bobby is simply suggesting that you should check it.
Bobby is useful for making sure you mean what you say; I wouldn't call it
the final word.  I would call it a very worthwhile project.

Also, if it is truly of no significance, why is it even there?  I have to
say that if the image is truly of no intellectual value, then perhaps it is
wasting space or possibly cluttering.  Again, possibly not, you must be the
judge of that.
