When I have a vertical rule, I use ALT="|"... similarly when there is a
graphical image for the bullet (when I _have_ to use it!), I use ALT="*" for
the first level, and ALT="-" for the second level rather than saying
ALT="bullet". Also, I now avoid using spacer GIFs, but when I did, I used to
use ALT=" ". With the space in the alt text, I thought that I wasn't putting
unnecessary text and still conveying the message of space. Although, with
this practice, I get Bobby approval, do you all think it's a good practice?
Or, do you think there is a better convention?

Pawan...
