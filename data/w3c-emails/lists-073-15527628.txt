Sounds like a reasonable idea.  I try to use longdesc and alt as they are
described in the specs.  alt would be best used to present alternative
content(Why wasn't it <IMG></IMG> to begin with?), not to describe the
image.  Since your 'invisible spacer' has no visible meaning, then there
would be no parallel in text.

Well, that is an interesting question.  The answer is almost as elusive as
the question.

Probably not.

This is the option I choose.  Bobby isn't perfect, that is a given.  If the
icon's message is to further accessibility, then I don't believe they should
require your document to be perfect, according to Bobby, in order to show
the icon.  (Rating system perhaps, although it would be complex.)  If the
message is to promote Bobby, then they can do what they will.

And, many are happy to remain blissfully ignorant.  They should probably be
able to stay blissfully ignorant if we manage to do a good job.
Unfortunately, we are still far from that time.

Yes, can be a sticky situation.  Hopefully, in the future those sorts of
problems will begin to dissolve.

I would say silent.  That's my opinion, though.  Also, it seems to me that
stating, in the ALT text, that <IMG> is an image is a bit redundant.  Many
of the speech browsers, that I have used, will state that it is reading text
from an image.  For example, your alt text might read like "Image, Image,
This image is nifty."
