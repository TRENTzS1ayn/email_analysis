alt="" makes the image disappear in browsers that don't display images.
while ommiting the alt altogether makes the word IMAGE appear instead.
This applies to Lynx and Opera. With Netscape and explorer both option 
are the same. 

Writing alt="image: vertical rule" makes the backgroung of the 
vertical rule as wide the text "image vertical rule" in Opera. So it 
becomes a vertical "band"... The "band" effect also happens 
with no alt as the word IMAGE takes some space too.

To make a long story short alt="" is a must for all images 
that serve no purpose beyond formatting.

Concerning the title attribute, the specs. don't say how it should be displayed.
Therefore I hardly use it. I use it rarely and carefully in anchors where the display is 
more or less predictable, and in ACRONYM and ABBR in the first time the 
abbreviation appears in the document. I also never nest titled elements.
