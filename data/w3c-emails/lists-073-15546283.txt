I don't think it's redundant as much as it's just wrong.  ALT text should
be used as an *alternative* to the image, completely replacing it.  The
user shouldn't need to know whether the ALT text is replacing an image or
whether it's just plain text.  Telling a non-visual user about images that
they can't see is an unnecessary reminder that the Web is, sadly, a visual
medium first and foremost.

This seems wrong of those speech browsers.  If I use

<H1><IMG SRC="wdglogo.gif" ALT="Welcome to the Web Design Group"></H1>

I don't want a browser saying "Image, Welcome to the Web Design Group" when
"Welcome to the Web Design Group" provides the information more succinctly
and without the distracting reminder of the Web's visual bias.
