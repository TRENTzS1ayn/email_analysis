ALT="" tells the browser that the image has no replacement.  Omitting the
ALT attribute tells the browser that the author didn't think about ALT text
(since so few do).  In such cases, some browsers will use "[INLINE]" or
"[filename of image]" to tell the user "Hey, there's an image here--it
could be important."  With ALT="", those browsers would display nothing in
place of the image.

Note also that the ALT attribute is required in HTML 4.0.
