This doesn't seem like the right way to handle TITLE attributes aurally.
The TITLE attribute gives "advisory information" [1], so I don't think it
should be read without somehow indicating that it's only giving advisory
information.

"Advisory information" on an IMG seems like a good place for a short
description of the image ("Blue vertical line", "Girl on the beach"), but
these descriptions should only be offered if the user wants them.  If I
were using a voice browser, I would only want descriptions when listening
to a page that was clearly graphically rich, such as a photo album.  In
other words, the reading of TITLEs should be a user-configurable feature
that defaults to off.  When reading the TITLE, the browser should indicate
the context by saying "Image: Girl on the beach" or using a distinctive
voice for "Girl on the beach" so that the user knows that he or she is
hearing a short description of an image.  The short description should link
to the LONGDESC if one is offered.

(I haven't used pwWebSpeak, so I don't know how close my description is to
what is now implemented.)

You're also getting the approval of HTML validators (if you're using HTML
4.0) and Lynx users.
