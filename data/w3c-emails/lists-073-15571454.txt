I find it interesting that so much attention is being given to spacers when
the site reads so strangely.  Because of the two columns, the links to the
left and the main text tothe right, as you read through the descriptive
text, the words for linking are tossed into the mix as they are reached in
the line by line reading of the WinVsion Screen reader. To add to the
confusion, they seem to have one letter somehow highlighted or underlined
to form the link key so that they are read I nformation then on with the
descriptive text. Believe me this is more distracting than whatever may or
may not happen with spacing images if the user happens to have images off
which BTW I never do as I like to get what I can from what there is to see
with my low vision. 

POINT 1 put the links at the top or bottom so they don't interfer with the
reading of the main page text. 

POINT 2 There are far more people with low vision who like to see what they
can, but still need text help to identify graphics than there are totally
blind who don't care that they have to view a page without graphics. I am
notpleased having to be forced to pretend I am totally blind in order to
get any information about graphics., What ever happened to the picture
caption from the printed page days?
