I agree about advisory information. I find the title useful, but not
something that should be read automatically. For example, if I use the ABBR
tag to indicate that U.S. stands for United States (obvious to most, but
perhaps not to others), pwWebspeak reads "United States U.S." every time. If
it were possible to have some kind of aural clue that a title was available
when the abbreviation or acronym was read, then I could only hear
descriptions of those that interested me. I know what W3C stands for. I
don't need to hear it every time. I'll write to the Productivity Works about
this.
