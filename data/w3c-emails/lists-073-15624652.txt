I can agree with the idea of making title reading optional. At present, in
webspeak, it is not. Your example of ABBR is a good one, but raises several
other issues:

1. With title reading ON, should we hear:
"U.S., United States, "
or
"United States, abbreviation U.S."
or
"U.S., title United States"

2. With Title reading OFF, should we hear:
"<auditory cue> + U.S.", replacing auditory cue with either musical note or
voice cue or nothing.

Should the "Detail" function (in webspeak), when selected for "U.S", read
the title to you?

3. Would the "Page Summary" function (in webspeak) list all abbreviated
terms on a page, with definition?


My preference will be to make Title reading optional, and handle the reading
behavior via style sheets.  We'll explore the Summary option a bit more.
