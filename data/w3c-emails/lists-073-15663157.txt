Has there been any legal precedents set for forcing companies to have
accessible sites, similar to ADA laws?

I'd guess that there hasn't, due to the apparent dearth of accessible sites.
I'm working on a public university website, and am wondering if there's any
legal arguments I can throw into the ring to help  convince them of the need
for a highly accessible site.
