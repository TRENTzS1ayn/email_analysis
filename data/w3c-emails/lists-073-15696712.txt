Not sure I agree Kynn.  Using pwWebSpeak, I see two - unsupported script -
at the top of the page.  Would like to know what I am missing and what
script you are using..is the capability just for show and tell?  It is but
that statement in the code is not coming up on my copy of pwWebSpeak

I agree.  You might want to put a TITLE on the IMG with this
information instead.

On the other hand, it does say that the JavaScript is pointless,
so at least you know you're not missing anything.  I personally
would leave the note out too, though.
