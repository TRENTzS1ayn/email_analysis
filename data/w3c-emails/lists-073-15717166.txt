Is there a page reference somewhere for pwWebSpeak's acronym.  Would like to
review it.

Sorry, I was too eliptical.

I am not (to first order) knocking ABBR and ACRONYM as a way to
associate full-word text with abbreviations.

What I was talking about was user-aware selection of which to
say, assuming that you know both.

Later, assuming that we can get some agreement on internet
dictionary interfaces, I would like to plug into that and retire
the requirement for ABBR and ACRONYM markup, which is an awkward
implementation of information better handled in a dictionary.

I just expect better response working on the browsers to use the
dictionary interface than working on the authors to use the ABBR
markup.

So I am not resting on our laurels with the definition of ABBR
and ACRONYM.  But yes, for now they should certainly be used.
Not to let "the better" get in the way of "the good."
