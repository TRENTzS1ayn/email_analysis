Eric;

The operative words here are "public university".  Being a public entity
and the recipient of federal and state funds, this university is bound by
ADA, 504, 508, and the DOJ rulings on accessibility of web sites.  If this
is truly a public university then there is no question here as to wether or
not they have to comply.
