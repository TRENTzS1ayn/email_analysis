1. Explaining the option, if you giveit:

My order is marginally better: make the positive statement of
utility first (after all, you took the trouble to include it) and
the apology that this is of use only to some visitors second.

But what you have done right by covering those two points
of information is _much_ more significant that any "betterness"
involved in flopping the order of statement.

2. Summarize the hotkeys issue:

Single-key commands are a class of interface entity that the user
wants to memorize.  If they change from web page to web page,
that is hostile.

But motor-impaired users benefit from this practice,
significantly.  They really care to minimize command-channel
tokens.

That is an IIRC instant summary of the issue.

What to do about it is still under discussion in the working 
group.
