Sarah Auerbach (sarah_auerbach@zd.com) is writing an article about accessible
web-based training for the magazine "Inside Technology Training".  She would
welcome any of the following:
   - case studies where webmasters have created accessible training
   - case studies where webmasters have converted previous pages
   - URL's for existing accessible web-based training as examples
   - tested guidelines for making accessible web-based training
