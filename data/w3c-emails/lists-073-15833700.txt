Sarah,

I have written a chapter on making web-based training programs more
accessible to pwd for an forthcoming book on web-based training programs,
edited by Badrul Khan. I don't know whether the chapter has been accepted
yet; I should know soon. 

I'm not ready to distribute the chapter, but I could share with you some
of its ideas.
