Hello,

I am a graduate student in instructional design and technology, working in
a school where accessibility is not just a concern, it is a priority. The
department in which I work  is considering offering some of our courses
through distance education, utilizing the capabilities of the internet. As
the webmaster, I have for years been making sure our websites are
accesible,  following the standard guidelines to the best of my ability.

My question is, does anyone know how universities who offer on-line courses
deal with asccessibility issues and their course materials that are offered
over the web? Are there policies/procedures  concerning students with
disabilities that have to be established by a university  before these
courses can be offered? For  an extreme example, what does the University
of Phoenix do when a student with low vision problems wants to enroll in a
course?  Do they have to make sure all of there web pages are accessible,
and if so, who enforces it?

Please excuse me if this is not the appropriate place to pose these
questions, I am looking for guidance and really don't know where else to
begin my research. Any information anyone could offer would be greatly
appreciated. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Ashli Molinero
