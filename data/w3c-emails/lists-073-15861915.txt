> Hello,
>
> I am a graduate student in instructional design and technology, working in
> a school where accessibility is not just a concern, it is a priority. The
> department in which I work  is considering offering some of our courses
> through distance education, utilizing the capabilities of the internet. As
> the webmaster, I have for years been making sure our websites are
> accesible,  following the standard guidelines to the best of my ability.
>
> My question is, does anyone know how universities who offer
> on-line courses
> deal with asccessibility issues and their course materials that
> are offered
> over the web? Are there policies/procedures  concerning students with
> disabilities that have to be established by a university  before these
> courses can be offered? For  an extreme example, what does the University
> of Phoenix do when a student with low vision problems wants to enroll in a
> course?  Do they have to make sure all of there web pages are accessible,
> and if so, who enforces it?
>
> Please excuse me if this is not the appropriate place to pose these
> questions, I am looking for guidance and really don't know where else to
> begin my research. Any information anyone could offer would be greatly
> appreciated. Thank you for your time and consideration.
