I am presently earning my Master's Degree in Technical Writing from Utah
State University.  As an Access Technology Specialist for the past ten
years, I am helping the University to make their program accessible to
everyone. So far I have taken 8 classes online. While I have encountered a
few problems, we have solved them all, and are constantly working to make
the entire program even more accessible.  

anyone with questions may feel free to write to me privately.
