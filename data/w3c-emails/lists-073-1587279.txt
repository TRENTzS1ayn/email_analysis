taking into account their audience and the type of web matter they are
doing, it comes down to a couple of choices.  If they are doing public
business or are envolved in government or education here in the u s in any
case, they are subject to pollicy.  If they are doing business of any
kind, it would stand to reason, that the shear numbers of people that
might be attracted to their sites would it were that they were more
readable for all might turn the tide.  In none of these senarios fits, or
if other constraints prevail, there is nothing to move the mountain.
it is in everyone's interest to have information that is given given in a
way which is accessable to all.  Instead of asking what motivates people
to produce accessable sites, we should perhaps make it so appealing to do
so that they can't refuse.
microsoft has some passages which summ this up pretty in their
accessability documents.
Why should accessability be a factor in design?
