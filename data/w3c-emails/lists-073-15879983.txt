We know there are people you capitalize on the misspelling of web addresses.
They will post advertising or lewd material to these pseudo-sites in the
hopes of attracting an audience or pushing their cause to the unsuspecting.
Well, I thought I had heard about most of them, until I mistyped Netscape in
www.netscape.com as http://www.Netscaep.com/ then a pop-up menu opens up to
another hardcore site....

I do not recommend people go to this site at work as it is an x-rated and
may not be a proper use of a business or government computer, unless you
have permission!

This site was created on 5 Oct 98, which explains why it has gone unnoticed.
