Good idea, Kynn:
Here are links to show who's linking to Bobby from Infoseek (1982), AltaVista
(3294), and Hotbot (902), respectively:

As a guess?  I'd say fewer than 1% are in compliance with the WAI
guidelines.

Probably about 20% are "mostly accessible" due to the use of ALT
text.  That's probably WAY optimistic on my part, but I try to
think positive. ;)

Try doing an AltaVista search to see how many Bobby logos you can
find. ;)
