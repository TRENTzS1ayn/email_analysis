Here is a question that my girlfriend asked me:  How do I put a video on my page so that it will be accessible.  I told her I didn't know as I would never use one.  But the person she is doing a page for wants one.  I told her that it could make her site un-accessible if it didn't work right and that it will not work on all browsers. (As I know nothing about putting videos on a page, I hope this information was correct.)  My question for this listserv is:

Is there a way to put a video on a page so that it will be accessible?

I thank you for your time and consideration on this matter.
