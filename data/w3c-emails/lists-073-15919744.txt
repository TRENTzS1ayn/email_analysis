Accessible to whom?
?
Deaf - IE4 with Windows Media Player supports closed captioning (with user
selectable format schemes and mulitple language support):
http://microsoft.com/enable/products/sami.htm
<http://microsoft.com/enable/products/sami.htm>  
?
Blind - Provide both a regular and an audio-described version of the video.
Microsoft is working on ways to make AD as easy to do as captioning but we
are not quite there yet.

Subject: Videos & Web Pages


Here is a question that my girlfriend asked me:? How do I put a video on my
page so that it will be accessible.? I told her I didn't know as I would
never use one.? But the person she is doing a page for wants one.? I told
her that it could make her site un-accessible if it didn't work right and
that it will not work on all browsers. (As I know nothing about putting
videos on a page, I hope this information was correct.)? My question for
this listserv is:
?
Is there a way to put a video on a page so that it will be accessible?
?
I thank you for your time and consideration on this matter.
