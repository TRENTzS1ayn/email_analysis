I believe that the new G2 audio/video stuff from Real media 
(http://www.real.com) is SMIL compliant, and players (and I think some 
of the encoders) are available free. But the short answer is that Kynn is 
right - at the moment video accessibility is in its infancy. There were 
some examples posted to one of the WAi groups (I think it was this) by 
Geoff Freed a few months back, so it can be done.
