There are several methods available for making multimedia accessible, depending on the format you want to use:

For QuickTime, see the sample accessible clips posted at NCAM's Web Access Project:  www.wgbh.org/ncam.  QuickTime allows the inclusion of captions and audio descriptions.  Full instructions on adding your own captions and descriptions may be found at this site. 

For SAMI, see www.microsoft.com/enable.  SAMI allows the inclusion of captions and, soon, audio descriptions.

For SMIL, see www.w3.org/audiovideo.  SMIL has been implemented by RealNetworks using their new G2 player.  See www.real.com for more information as well as documentation on how to add text tracks (captions) and additional audio tracks (audio descriptions) to multimedia.  I've uploaded two examples of accessible SMIL clips to an ftp site:  log on to ftp.wgbh.org, switch to /incoming/ncam, download CAR1.ZIP and ELEV1.ZIP and do the following:

CAR1:
1.  Create C:\CAR
2.  Unzip CAR1.ZIP into this directory
3.  Open CAR1.SMI from within the G2

ELEV1:
1.  Create C:\ELEVATOR
2.  Unzip ELEV1.ZIP into this directory
3.  Open ELEV1.SMI from within the G2

You should see captions and hear audio descriptions.  The captions should be centered; I've received a few messages from people saying the captions are appearing on the far right.

Here is a question that my girlfriend asked me:  How do I put a video on my page so that it will be accessible.  I told her I didn't know as I would never use one.  But the person she is doing a page for wants one.  I told her that it could make her site un-accessible if it didn't work right and that it will not work on all browsers. (As I know nothing about putting videos on a page, I hope this information was correct.)  My question for this listserv is:

Is there a way to put a video on a page so that it will be accessible?

I thank you for your time and consideration on this matter.
