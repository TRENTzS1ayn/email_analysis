I liked your demos!  I'd like to put in my two cents and mention that I've
solved the centering problem you describe below.  Please see my comments
interspersed with yours, below.

[Erik]:
The reason some people are seeing the text at the far right is that the
SMIL file's region for the RealText stream is not the same size as the
RealText stream's native size (which is 320 x 180 by default if no width or
height is specified in the RealText's <window...> tag).  The default
behavior of SMIL has changed for the case where no "fit" is given in a
region, and this is the case in the latest Beta-2 G2 player but not in
prior G2 players.  The default "fit" is now "hidden" instead of "fill", so
people with the older players will see RealText resized to fit the given
SMIL region, and newer players will see the top left 120 by 200 pixels of
the un-resized RealText window.  Also, resizing the "system" font (via the
<font size="5"> call) can look pretty ugly as it doesn't scale up well in
Windows as you will see if you play just the rt file on its own (or in the
SMIL presentation with the latest G2 player).  Note: you don't need to
resize the font if you set the width and height of the rt file in its
window tag as follows: <window width="200" height="120" ...

Hope this helps,

videos on a page, I hope this information was correct.)  My question for
