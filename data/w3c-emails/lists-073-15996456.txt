1. New WAI Authoring Tool Guidelines draft & upcoming IG review:

The WAI Authoring Tools Working Group (AUWG) posted an updated working
draft today <http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WAI-AUTOOLS-19981102.html>. There
will be a WAI Interest Group call for review this week on an updated draft,
before the document goes to the W3C Technical Reports page as a first
Public Working Draft. Stay tuned.

2. Feedback needed on authoring tool accessibility:

Twice a year, representatives from W3C Member organizations meet to review
W3C work. As part of the WAI report to the mid-November W3C meeting in
Kyoto, we will discuss accessibility issues in authoring tools. Both the
output and the user interface of authoring tools remain a concern in terms
of accessibility. If you have comments on accessibility of authoring tools,
please send to
w3c-wai-au@w3.org.

The WAI User Agent Working Group (WG) released an updated Working Draft,

updated techniques document
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19981030/wai-useragent-tech>,
thanks to the hard work of AUWG members at the meeting in Minneapolis
October 23-26. Minutes from the meeting are available at

message
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1998OctDec/0102.html>
describes the changes in this draft. There will be a WAI Interest Group
call for review this week, before the draft goes to Technical Reports as a
replacement for the July 3rd public version.

4. US EITAAC holds first meeting:

The US EITAAC (Electronic and Information Technology Access Advisory
Committee) met for the first time on October 15 & 16 in D.C. There was
general agreement that the EITAAC
<http://www.access-board.gov/notices/eitaac.htm> should include Web
accessibility among the areas for which it develops standards for US
Government procurement. Minutes of the meeting are available at
<http://www.access-board.gov/eitaac/meeting-minutes-1998-10.htm> including
instructions on how to follow EITAAC mailing list discussions, which are

held in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA on Tuesday, October 13 are now
available linked from the workshop agenda at
<http://www.w3.org/UI/Voice/workshop/minutes-13oct98.html>. The workshop
