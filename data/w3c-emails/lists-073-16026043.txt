WAI IG CALL FOR REVIEW: Updated User Agent Guidelines Working Draft

Please review and comment on the updated User Agent Working Group draft of
October 30 <http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19981030/>, and the
associated techniques document
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19981030/wai-useragent-tech>.

WAI IG comments will be incorporated before the document is posted on the
W3C Technical Reports page as an updated Working Draft, to replace the
current UA document dated July 3. This draft incorporates UAWG discussion
from the October 25-26 UAWG meeting in Minneapolis, and is nearing Proposed
Recommendation status.

TIMELINE FOR WAI IG REVIEW:
Send comments by close of business US Eastern Standard Time, Tuesday,
November 10, 1998, at the latest. Earlier comments are appreciated.

WHERE TO SEND COMMENTS:
Please send comments to the w3c-wai-ua@w3.org list. The UA WG mailing list
is archived from the UA home page at http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA if you would
like to view other people's comments.

REVIEW QUESTIONS:
Jon Gunderson, Chair of the User Agent Guidelines Working Group, asks that
people consider these questions when reviewing the document. All other
feedback is welcome as well.
1. Is the document understandable and clear?
2. Does the format/structure of the document work well?
3. Are the priorities appropriate as indicated?
4. Do people have recommended additions for the techniques document?
5. Is anything missing from the guidelines?
In addition I would add:
6. Does the document comprehensively address cross-disability issues in
user agent accessibility, e.g., accessibility issues for cognitive
disabilities, hearing disabilities, physical disabilities, and visual
disabilities?

MORE DETAIL ON DOCUMENT STATUS & CHANGES:

this draft. Your reviews will bring additional perspective to their work.
