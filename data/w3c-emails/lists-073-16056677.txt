Hi y'all 

I thought I'd pass this your way. Please feel free to forward this to your
other mailing lists and sign up yourself. I'll be running the Web
professional discussion- we'll be talking about the ADA complaint out in
California amingst many other disability legal issues. Hopefully I'll see
some of you there.

Thanks.
-----------------------

I would like to cordially invite you to participate in ADR Cyberweek, an
online conference about using the Web for alternative dispute resolution
and mediation. This free conference is being run by the UMass Center for
Information Technology and Dispute Resolution and is sponsored by over 40
companies including the Hewlett Foundation, Academy of Family Mediators,
the American Arbitration Association, and the Society of Professional in
Dispute Resolution. Using O'Reilly's WebBoard software, the conference will
take place entirely on-line from November 9th-13th at
http://www.umass.edu/cyber

There are many topic that will be discussed including Gender and Dispute
Resolution, Student Mediators, Indigenous Dispute Resolution and  the Net,
Should High Tech Disputes be Mediated, and most importantly, Web
Professionals and Dispute resolution.

We've created the Web Professionals and Dispute Resolution topic because
there are many legal issues that people in the technology and software
industry have to deal with on a day-to-day basis. Some include domain name
disputes, digital copyright laws, accusations of libel, and more recently,
ADA complaints.

In this forum, we hope to cover all of these issues and more, making sure
that Web professionals are informed of their rights and are armed with the
information necessary to stay protected from any legal action taken against
them.

Sign up today at http://www.umass.edu/cyber, it's free!
