One of the problems with being in the WAI circle is the tendency to
forget that other people are also publishing their version of how to
make the Web accessible.

At http://www.artictech.com/howprog.htm is a set of guidelines published
by a screen reader vendor, Artic Technologies - interestingly enough it
doesn't qualify for a Bobby logo! (although on the whole it is readily
accessible).  The chances of their recommendations gaining widespread
acceptance is clearly nil but it may be of some interest.
