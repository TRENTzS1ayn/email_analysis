Well, the screen reader vendor's thing was more
about programming computer applications, rather 
than writing HTML pages, that are not a program 
in any well defined sense.

The resourse of New South Wales was about
web authoring. It is generally OK, but somewhat 
outdated. Laws and regulations change slowly.

In the spirit of "Refer vs copy", lets hope that in 
the future when we'll have WAI guidelines as a 
W3C recommendation, legal or regulatory agencies 
will be able to define their rules with respect to 
"the WAI/W3C recommendation at the time the page was 
produced, or later" and this way being kept updated
without the regulation being changed.
