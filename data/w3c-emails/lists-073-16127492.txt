Craig,

We use the voice web browser, pwWebSpeak and Lynx (its free).  We cannot
afford to purchase the screen reader, WinVision and Jaws For Windows in
additions to all else.
For more info, please see

Subject:Screen Reader Research Help

Hello,

We are a new Web development company and we want to be able to offer
accessible versions of all sites we create. There don't seem to be a lot of
developers who are explicitly including this in their development services.

In order to do this, we want to start down the path of testing pages with a
screen reader. Eventually we would like to develop the capability of
performing usability testing on multiple platforms with a variety of
software. We are, however, still on the learning curve about many of the
accessibility issues and are not in the position at the moment to make the
kind of financial investment we would ultimately like to make.

Can anyone sugggest:

What would be a good first purchase of screen reading software/synthesizer
hardware for the Windows platform?

Any resources we might consult that would give us access to reviews and/or
user feedback about such products? Data about product useage?

Any other list or forum through which we might communicate with screen
reader users?

Thanks in advance,
Craig Wilson
