Hello Craig!
I took a look at your web site and the accessibility portion has all you
really need in the way of guidelines and being on this list will yeild for
you several individuals with special browsing and other interface issues.
In addition, I cannot resist pointing you to another person with your same
name at a company which has done a lot of work in the field of access on
and off the web.
Henter-joyce Inc. Has produced most likely the most versatile general text
to braille and speech pc interface to daye.  Their sales manager shares
your name if I remember correctly.  Our goal which you should keep in mind
though is to produce a method of page authoring and interfacing that is
independant of what you use for that purpose.  If I use netscape or ie or
xyz browser, I should be able to access all components of a site with no
help from my aid except for that which is normally rendered that being to
make it possible for me to interface with the document or applete in my
own special way.
you can reach henter joyce however at:
http://www.hj.com
or by contacting:
sales@hj.com
I believe they have a timed evaluation package such that it will expire on
a given date.
Thanks for asking.
