Like most of the other folks, I have used Cold Fusion to drive websites. 
I don't use the development stuff supplied - I tried it once and didn't 
like it, but there is no reason why you can't create perfectly accessible 
CFML, although some of the components that it offers are only in 
inaccessible formats. (When are we going to get re-presentable controls 
like sliders?)
