Yes, you are correct.  It is relatively accurate.  It is far more accurate
than not having any form of validator.  My standard practice is to markup a
document completely using CSE 3310 in HomeSite.  When finished, I will run
it through the W3C validator to catch any stray errors like missing or
incorrect attributes, invalid entities, etc.  I fix the errors then
revalidate just to be sure.  Not as pretty as having a built-in sgmls.
However, usable.  When in doubt, I refer to the W3C for the correct answer.
It is a matter of knowing where to look when an error occurs.  In my mind,
W3C is always the definitive source.
