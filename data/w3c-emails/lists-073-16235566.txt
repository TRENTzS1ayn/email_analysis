That's great--it's how CSE should be used.  The problem is that many people
assume that using two validators would be redundant so they just use CSE
and miss the critical step of real validation.

FWIW, the W3C Validator is not infallible.  Take, for example, the
following three URLs:

http://www.w3.org/Press/1998/DOM-REC.html.ja
http://www.htmlhelp.com/ja/reference/html40/
http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/entities/latin1.html

These pages are all valid HTML 4.0, but the W3C Validator disagrees.  (The
WDG HTML Validator [1] correctly declares these pages to be valid.)
