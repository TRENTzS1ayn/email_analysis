That's true, and as Daniel said, some folks are trying to fix it.

I'm sure this is valid, because I wrote it and validated it ;-)

BTW, though WDG HTML Validator found no errors in the following document:

  http://www.htmlhelp.com/ja/reference/html40/new.html

but actually it's not valid.  It's syntactically correct, but its
character encoding doesn't match declared charset.  HTTP response
header says it's encoded in ISO-2022-JP, but actually it's encoded
in Shift_JIS.

The result is devastating; it makes the document totally unreadable
when one uses a browser which respects charset parameter.  Some browsers
in Japanese Windows platform can read it regardless of the charset
parameter when it's encoded in Shift_JIS, so sometimes authors don't
realize this problem.

Anyway, declaring correct character encoding scheme is critical to
make your documents accessible.
