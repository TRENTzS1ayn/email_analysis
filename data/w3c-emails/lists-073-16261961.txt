Sad but true, that's where education is needed.  An understanding of how
things should work will always be better than allowing a validator to make
your final decision.  At this point, I can say with some confidence that
there isn't any program that validates HTML perfectly.  It is mostly a
matter of little oversights.

The humans need to know what they are doing, in other words.  A combination
of good tools (maybe not even perfect) and an understanding of how to use
them properly will always be best.  An ignorant user and a good tool will
rarely achieve much more than mediocrity.  An informed user and a bad or
degraded tool has a much better chance.
