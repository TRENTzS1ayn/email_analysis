The correct version of the article published today in the San Francisco
Examiner is found at 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/examiner/hotnews/stories/12/
Bblind.dtl

Apparently, a draft version of the newspaper article was inadvertently
released.

Today Radio Station KGO reported on this.  I also received calls from
members of the blind community who were upset that the San Francisco
Examiner website did not post the article in an accessible format at
http://www.examiner.com

I am referring people to the print version of the article at San Francisco
Gate at
