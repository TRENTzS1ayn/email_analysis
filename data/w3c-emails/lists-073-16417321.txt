In addition to the ICEB, there is BANA (Braille Authority of N America)
which recently approved signs and rules for brailling electronic
addresses (e-mail & URLs) and filenames in nontechnical contexts.  This
group governs brailling music, chemistry, mathematics, etc. -- all
different "languages".  BANA's website is:
http://edtech.sandi.net/epd/bana.html .  BANA's board just concluded its
annual meeting in Boston Nov. 10.  In the U.S., the National Library
Service (part of the Library of Congress) is one key contact -- among
much else, it certifies Nemeth (scientific braille), music and literary
("standard") braille transcribers.
    Are ICEB, BANA, etc. invovled with or aware of this WAI group?
