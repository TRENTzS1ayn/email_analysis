(I probably should have mentioned that BANA actually started the UBC
project, and remains actively involved in it through ICEB.)

Yes, both ICEB and BANA are aware of WAI, and obviously share its goal
of promoting accessibility.  The UBC project is grounded in part on the
recognition that automatic rendering in braille from the Web and other
electronic sources is already important and growing more so all the time, and
so in that sense it may be regarded as a symbiotic effort.  Likewise, work
with existing braille codes is increasingly along the same lines (even
though more incremental in scope), because UBC itself is still a research
project in the development and evaluation stages.
