Dear List Members:

An article entitled "Blind man files complaint for cyberspace access"
printed in the San Francisco Examiner on Thursday, November 12 contained an
statement by Henter-Joyce President Ted Henter that warrants clarification.

The Examiner quoted Ted as saying, "It's a piece of cake to make a Web site
work for us. I hate
to see the government make the rules to live by. It's not worth having the
government involved."

Taken out of context, the first part of this quote appears to refer to the
way that JAWS for Windows presents web pages to blind computer users. This
is not the case. What Ted said to the reporter was "It's a piece of cake for
them (web authors) to make a web site work for us (blind computer users)."

We regret that this information was presented in this way, and further
regret using this space to clarify this point. We do, however, value the
opinions of the people who use this and other list serves, and want all
discussion of Henter-Joyce, our products, policies and views to be based on
factual information.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,


Wilson Craig
