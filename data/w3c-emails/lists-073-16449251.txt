 I am the one that originally forwarded the info on the HTML virus to a member of
your group, with the thought that it may be of interest to HTML folks.  I had read
about it at www.macintouch.com.  I myself would not let Microsoft decide for me
what is valid information concerning the performance of the software.

As for this information being commercial spam, I have no association at all with
the Russian company AVP, nor have I ever been a member of the Communist Party.
