The Science Access Project has a good discussion of Braille at:

http://dots.physics.orst.edu/index.html

Also good is the Purdue University Visions Lab discussion at:

www.chem.purdue.edu/facilities/sightlab/introi.html

However, I've heard of Grade I, II and III, Nemeth code, and computer
braille, but never "Type II".  I checked these pages and didn't come across
this terminology either.  Could it be a variation of Grade II?
