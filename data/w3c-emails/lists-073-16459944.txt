Wilson Craig of Henter-Joyce: "Taken out of context, the first part of
this quote appears to refer to the way that JAWS for Windows presents
web pages to blind computer users. This is not the case. What Ted said
to the reporter was 'It's a piece of cake for them (web authors) to make
a web site work for us (blind computer users).'"

WL:: The reason we have a WAI and its associated interest and working
groups is because it's not seen as "a piece of cake" by either most web
authors or the companies that produce authoring tools.  To imply (or
state directly as the other part of his quote did) that these issues can
be solved through "voluntary" means without "government intervention" is
hopelessly naive.  Ted put his foot in it and trying to put it in a
better light is not helpful.
