Your way of looking at it: Web access is seen as hard to provide and
requires enforcement.  Access will only happen where it is enforced.
Conclusion: Successful Web access will require watchdogs monitoring
each and every site, and sufficient enforcement involvement
(presumably the government) to monitor and punish every site.  Where
government funds are insufficient, or the law is inapplicable, access
will not happen.

Ted's way of looking at it: Web access is not hard, or should not be.
Access will only happen where education has reached.  Conclusion:
Successful Web access will require an aggressive education campaign,
but we need not wait for shock troops to be available to begin.

Which is more likely to produce a more accessible Web?
