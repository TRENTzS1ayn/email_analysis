Seems to me a lot (I mean a very lot) of web sites are bring done through places like Geocities, Tripod, Angelfire, etc.  Most of those web sites have owners who do not know what html really is. They just go in and fill out forms, and VOILA!  They this exciting, graphically jazzy site that is really cool.  I don't even think a tiny, tiny part of the people who have web sites even know what accessibility is.  So, do these web editors have to conform to making accessible sites or the person filling out the form?  Unfortunatley, they may not want to give up all the pizazz on their site,either, even if they took the time to educate themselves on the fact that people other than sighted ones surf the net.  When I found out, I felt I just had to do what I could to make my sites accessible.  (Everyone should have a chance to visit my wonderful site---*laughs*) 

I can not give an opinion as to whether govenment should involve themselves or not, and if they do, is that so bad?   When you come right down to it, we are the government, right?

*Sigh*  This is my two-cents worth.
