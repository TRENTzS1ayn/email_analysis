1. First Public Working Draft of WAI Authoring Tool Guidelines

Congratulations to the WAI Authoring Tool Guidelines Working Group for
releasing its first public Working Draft
<http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-WAI-AUTOOLS>. Thank you to the WAI Interest Group
members who commented during the review period. We welcome additional
comment to w3c-wai-au@w3.org. Please help us bring this draft to the
attention of authoring tool manufacturers and writers's groups that may
have an interest in commenting on or participating in further development
of the document.

2. New WAI User Agent Guidelines Working Draft Goes to /TR Page

Thanks to the hard work of the UA Guidelines Working Group, there is now a
substantially updated UA Guidelines draft at
<http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-WAI-USERAGENT>, and a techniques document linked
from that. And thanks to the WAI IG for your comments during the review
period. As this document approaches W3C Proposed Recommendation status, we
are particularly interested in cross-disability
review comments. All of the WAI Guidelines are intended to reflect
functional requirements of users with visual, hearing, physical or
cognitive disabilities. Do you find anything missing from any of these
perspectives? Comments please to w3c-wai-ua@w3.org.

3. WAI UA WG Meeting Scheduled for December 11 & 12

There will be a User Agent Guidelines Working Group meeting on December 11
& 12, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, which will likely be the last UAWG
face-to-face meeting before the document goes to W3C Proposed
Recommendation status. To attend this meeting you need to be an active
member of the UA Working Group. Information on the meeting is available at
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1998OctDec/0175.html> and
at <http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/1998/12/wai-ua-f2f-19981211.html>. Contact the
Working Group Chair, Jon Gunderson, if you have questions.

4. W3C Web Characterization Activity starts

The W3C started a formal activity on characterizing the Web recently.
Information on the Interest Group is publicly viewable at
<http://www.w3.org/WCA/>. The WAI Education & Outreach Working Group is
preparing an initial statement of requirements for this area (ours will be
just some among many requirements, and much data already exists but this
activity may help organize that data), to facilitate assessment of changes
in the accessibility of the Web over time, to track trends in device usage
for accessing the Web, to document performance efficiencies in retrieval of
pages using style-sheet encoding of presentational information, etc. 

5. W3C Advisory Committee meets in Kyoto November 18 & 19, 1998

WAI will again be one of the four W3C Domains presenting to W3C Member
organizations at the semi-annual World Wide Web Consortium Advisory
Committee (AC) meeting in Kyoto, November 18 & 19. This meeting is open to
one AC Representative per W3C Member organization, and provides an
opportunity for update and feedback on Consortium activities. You can find
out more about the W3C in general at <http://www.w3.org>.

Regards,

Judy Brewer
