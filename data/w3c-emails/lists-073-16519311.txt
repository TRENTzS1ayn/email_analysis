In My Humble Opinion,  If access of any kind were willingly given to people
with disabilities there would be no need for the ADA.

Kynn can tell you about some of the posts on this subject on the HWG lists.
They are downright vitriolic.  I agree that Government Intervention should
not be necessary.  But lets see shall we talk about accessible rest rooms?

Sincerely,

Mike Burks
