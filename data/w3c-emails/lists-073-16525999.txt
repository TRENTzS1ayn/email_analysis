We need mandated accessibility - and as much noise as possible - to get
compliance moving and to make compliance high profile enough that the
average web author becomes aware of it. More than that, mandated
accessibility is necessary just because there are still lots of bathrooms
that aren't accessible, no matter what the sign says.

We need education to get the average web author to make a genuine effort
to create accessible web pages. That author does not and will not use HTML
coding but _can_ learn that accessibility is relatively easy (even
challenging), accessibility can include bells and whistles, and
accessibility just happens to be darn good online design.

We need people in lots of places to sift the thick language of
accessibility guidelines into understandable methods that the average web
author will use. When we can help clean up our corner of the world, _that_
is positive energy well spent.

I think the average person reading what Ted said just might have gotten
part of the positive message that needs to get out: Accessibility _can_ be
done.
