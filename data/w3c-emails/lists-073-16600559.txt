Here at Butler, we have been training new web authors with Composer for
most of a year because

1) It is the only web authoring package the university will buy because

   a) it is free.

Kidding aside, just about any one can pick it up because most people climb
a steeper learning curve with word processing. However, they do not learn
HTML and so it helpful -- no essential -- that Netscape is cleaning up its
own code. I hope that truly happens.

When I train Composer (or any web authoring), I teach accessibility based
upon how they think, organize and write, not on whether they use <i> or
<em>. For the average web author to create accessible pages, we need
software that will do the robotic work of creating clean code.

Composer works well for us, other than the fact that its interface for
creating and using tables is extremely clumsy and makes people not want to
use tables. Oh, hey, maybe that's a blessing... ~(;-{)}
