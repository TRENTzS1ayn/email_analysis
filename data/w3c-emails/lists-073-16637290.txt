Someone else mentioned it already but I think that government rules tend to
send up warning flags with many people.  Also, government interference will
likely stifle innovation.  Can you imagine what would happen to the web if
it were regulated by the US Congress?  HTML 4.0 would be the official
standard for the next 48 years.

Your way of looking at it: Web access is seen as hard to provide and
requires enforcement.  Access will only happen where it is enforced.
Conclusion: Successful Web access will require watchdogs monitoring
each and every site, and sufficient enforcement involvement
(presumably the government) to monitor and punish every site.  Where
government funds are insufficient, or the law is inapplicable, access
will not happen.

Ted's way of looking at it: Web access is not hard, or should not be.
Access will only happen where education has reached.  Conclusion:
Successful Web access will require an aggressive education campaign,
but we need not wait for shock troops to be available to begin.

Which is more likely to produce a more accessible Web?
