Would that be a bad thing?

The problem here is unequal access.  The solution is better web design
practices.  Unfortunately too many web designers are either ignorant
or lazy, and won't do it right by themselves -- and so some people are
suffering.  Thus the government is forced to take action, and require
these things that the web designers really should be doing themselves
in the first place without outside interference.
