That simply does not follow.  When people are suffering, *someone*
should take action.  It is not "Thus" that it must be the government.
In some situations, it is possible that the government is the best
agent to effect change, but it does not follow that where there is
suffering, there needs to be government.  (In fact, there is often
already government there...)  I have yet to see a compelling argument
that application of the ADA to the Web will actually produce
anything.  Large companies and municipal sites may be forced to change
their ways, but smaller sites, no less interesting (in fact, maybe
more interesting) to the disabled, will likely ignore the legislation
unless actually sued.  I maintain that our effort will be more
productive if spent on education rather than legislation.  The
legislation is also only effective within a single country; spreading
it necessitates a repeat effort in every target country, while
education does not stop at national boundaries.  The ADA will be as
effective on the Web as the CDA.
