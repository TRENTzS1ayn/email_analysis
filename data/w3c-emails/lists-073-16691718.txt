It won't break your budget to buy two sites/passwords from your
ISP.  Keep one for test and integration.  Only give your
fumble-fingered content experts the post-password for that one.
They could potentially trash one another's play space but you can
restore from the pulic site to which you hold the keys.  They
have to check sub-sites in through you.  This is not a big burden
when it is just a tree-replace after you have checked and
accepted the stuff on the preparation side of the site.

This is what the Virginia Dep't of Ed. did.  Works for them.
