Reading all the mails, it seems that there are 2 points of view about a
successful web access : either it requires an aggressive education
campaign, or a " government intervention ".

In France, where the political and cultural context is different, this
debate does not really exist. As regards accessibility, the two aspects are
additional.

For example : in France as in others countries, a law exists to make the
building accessible, to reserve parking spaces... This summer, we had an
aggressive education campaign to explain to the man of the street that a
parking space reserved is not a free parking space. This kind of campaign
is necessary to explain, to inform, to make people aware of that. It is the
same situation with the law about the obligation to employ personal with
disability : this law cannot be a success if the firms are not informed of
the interest to do that ; they will prefere paying a fine rather than
employ a disabled person.

We think that a successful web access requires education and legislation.
