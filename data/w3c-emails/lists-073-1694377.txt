I think the initial steps taken by companies like SoftQuad with HoTMetaL
4.0 are an exact indication of how influential and pervasive accessible web
development can be when the interface itself has built-in accessibility
validation and tools. Corel is looking to implement similar tools. I
suspect the Micrsoft will do likewise with Frontpage. Sun with Java tools.
If we can get corporations like Miramba, Netscape and Oracle to follow
suit, we're more likely to see accessible web sites in the future.
