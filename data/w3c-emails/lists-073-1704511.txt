Microsoft is proud to announce the release of Internet Explorer 4.01!  This
release of Internet Explorer adds full support for Microsoft Active
Accessibility(tm) and fixes many accessibility-related problems with the
initial release of Internet Explorer 4.0.

Microsoft has made this new release available on our web site,
http://microsoft.com/ie/.  Internet Explorer 4.01 replaces version 4.0 that
has been available since September 30.  The CD-ROM version will be updated
as well.

In addition to the already existing support for user authored style sheets,
control over font color, size and type and the many accessibility features
introduced with Internet Explorer 3.0 last year, Internet Explorer 4.01 adds
the following:
*Full support for Microsoft Active Accessibility, including the HTML
document area, the Active Desktop, and new "Menu bands"
*Active Desktop is keyboard accessible and the Microsoft Channel Bar
includes keyboard access and MSAA support
*The new HTML help system is accessible via the keyboard
*Full-screen mode can be toggled with the F11 key to provide access
to the menu band.
*System Caret position updated when a screen reader is present or
through an advanced option setting
*ALT attribute information can be fully expanded when running a
screen reader or through an advanced option setting and ALT attribute text
is shown using the correct text colors, including link color
*Advanced Options dialog now show "On" or "Off" when running a screen
reader
*High Contrast settings are now compatible with Internet Explorer 3.0

This release of Internet Explorer includes full support for Microsoft Active
Accessibility.  This support was planned for the 4.0 release, but was
delayed due to quality and technical issues.  Microsoft apologizes for the
delay in fully supporting Active Accessibility in such an important product.
The Active Accessibility support in Internet Explorer 4.01 is more complete
that what was available with Internet Explorer 3.0.  More information is
available about the HTML document and new features of the HTML 4.0
specification are now exposed such as the LABEL and TITLE attributes.
Included in the Internet Explorer 4.01 package is the Microsoft Java Virtual
Machine (VM) which includes full support for Microsoft Active Accessibility
and the new Active Accessibility for Java.

Internet Explorer 4.01 requires Microsoft Active Accessibility version 1.1.
The Active Accessibility Redistribution Kit (RDK) is available from the
Microsoft Accessibility and Disabilities FTP site at
ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/mscorp/enable/msaardk.exe or from your accessibility
aid vendor.  Your accessibility aid might also need to be updated to support
the new features present in Internet Explorer 4.01.  Please contact your
vendor for details.

There is a comprehensive Reference Guide to using Internet Explorer 4.01 by
people with disabilities.  You can download an electronic copy from our web
site at http://microsoft.com/enable/products/ie4.htm.
