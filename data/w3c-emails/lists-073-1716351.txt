Hello All,

I'll put my comments after the item I wish to mention. I use GWK:: for this.

GWK:: yes we could introduce markup. That would work for example, instead
of writing "smile" a person could  enter the HTML equilivant to this. It
seems a lot easier to just write smile, grin. So, we start with a concept
everybody knows like frown and then we teach them the ascii art version,
and then we teach them the HTML notation for the same thing they knew in
the first place. Sounds like a lot of work for nothing. Oh, by the way,
thanks for that list of ascii art. I never knew what that stuff meant -- my
screen reader never reads it anyway. GRIN.

GWK:: I think you are wrong here. If you have a large document that you are
commenting upon, you don't want to go through the document visually to find
the editor's comments. You search for GWK:: to find these.
