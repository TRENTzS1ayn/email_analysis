The difficulty is introduced by CSS allowing user-defined sheets. In 
earlier HTML, there were a fixed number of Styles (H1, H2, P, UL etc). 
Setting up 'presentation sheets' for these could take advantage of the 
multi-media aspects of CSS such as the ability to define an 
audio style, a screen style, etc. without risking it being subsequently 
over-ridden. (Except Author sheets override reader sheets, which 
seems stupid to me)

Another possibility would be to change the interpretation of specificity. 
If a user could declare an H1 style, to be regarded as specific to every 
instance of H1, including a class, id, etc, it would alleviate the 
difficulty.
