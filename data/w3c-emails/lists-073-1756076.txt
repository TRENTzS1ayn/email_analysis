An informational point should be made here.  This is known by some, but is
worth stating here as it fits in with the process of development of
guidelines for email.  When I recieve a message that is a reply or a
forward, I usually skip down to the new section or read the new section by
moving my cursor that reviews the screen down quickly through the message
listening for the new info.  Most of the time, I can tell which is new and
which is old due to the fact that I've read the old.
you don't have to set the screen reader to speak > greather than before
each line that is read in a continuous read to find the new passages,
because as you pass over each line, if it has a > greather than at the
beginning of it, it can be spoken because you can set the punctuation
level of the reading cursor to allow for that.
if you want to do something such as Only speaking the > greather than at
the beginning of a paragraph, that can be easily done in the dictionary of
most screen readers.
Thanks!
