AG:: There are dictionaries for smileys already -- we don't
need to define the dictionary here, just use it.

-- Al

PS (Linguistic backtrace):

"Complice smile" means 
"the trigram semicolon, hyphen, close-parenthesis"  ;-)
which means "a smile delivered with a [conspiratorial] wink."

The semantics of a smile delivered with a wink is that the
speaker is alluding to some private knowledge unarticulated in
the message but shared between the speaker and her [ac]complice.
It signals a condition of complic[ity] existing between speaker
and hearer.

Ergo "complice smile."

QED.
