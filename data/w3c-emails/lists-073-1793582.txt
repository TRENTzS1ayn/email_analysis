Regarding having the screen reader dictionary let you know when there is a
greater than sign at the beginning of a paragraph while ignoring other
greater than signs;  It is far from being that easy.  I use 5 different
screen readers here at Trace.  Some of them don't come even close to
allowing this to happen.  I believe we will need to come up with another
alternative.
