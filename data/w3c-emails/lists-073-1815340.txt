I'm trying to figure out the point of all this.  Is the goal to ask the
makers of email client software to allow customization of their quoting?  Or
is the goal to get people to change the way they write email?

If the former, then I suggest you get some of the makers of email programs
in.  If the latter - good luck!

Most programs, like Eudora and Outlook and Outlook Express allow for some
customization and Outlook can even get very close to what has been proposed.
