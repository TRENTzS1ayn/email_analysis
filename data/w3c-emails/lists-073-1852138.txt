Hello WAI Interest Group members,

If you reply to this message, please do it privately to me or others who've
written on this topic, but not to the WAI interest group list-serve.  Thanks.

The reason the thread had started on this list-serve was in response to
difficulties encountered with long quoting sequences during high-volume
discussions on other WAI list-serves.  Thank you George Kerscher and Gregg
Vanderheiden for summarizing some suggestions to try to ease communication.

The reason the thread is now ending is because the main purpose of this WAI
Interest Group list-serve is for discussion of the overall Web
Accessibility effort.  In the future we'll give a pointer to a revised copy
of e-mail suggestions, for reference when needed, but not for discussion on
this list.

Thanks for your cooperation on this.

Regards,

Judy
