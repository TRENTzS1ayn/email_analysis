The user style sheet need to more than over ride author styles or even
there sub classing styles like H1.  Since many authors will use absolute
positioning in spatial formatting, if you say enlarge all H1 (and it also
enlarges sub classes) you may end up with a screen full of alphabet soup.
What is need in the browser is a mechanism to say ignor the entire author
style sheet and use just mine.  This would eliminate the impossible task of
users needing to know anything about the authors classing or positioning of
tags.
