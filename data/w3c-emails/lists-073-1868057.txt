JT:
I agree, this would then depend on the browser.

There may be situations however when we do want some of the author style
declarations to come through. I can't think of a good example right now but
I have come up with some in other conversations. For this reason it would
be good to have a strong, specific override mechanism in CSS. Could we have
something similar to "important!", possibly "access!" which can only be
used in the user style sheet?
