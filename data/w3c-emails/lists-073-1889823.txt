yes, you can have a rule like enter enter=paragraph.  you can have a rule
like: enterenter>=quoted paragraph.
Mail programs have a find or search or where is capability which can be
used although not necessarily cleanly to find :: or what ever you want
them to find.  I mark up text this way.  When I'm reading something that
is long, I type a string of chars in the place I left off so that I can
find it again.  I usually use a string of question marks then search for
them when I'm ready to resume reading.
