Hi all,

The latest version of the CSS2 specification draft  (11/07/1997) specifies
the following cascading order.  It includes an "important" attribute (as
Jutta suggested).  for more info see http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-CSS2/cascade.html

1.  declarations marked '!important' carry more weight than unmarked
(normal) declarations.  
2.  Author's style sheets override reader's style sheets which override the
user agent's default values.
3.  More specific declarations override more general ones.

"This strategy gives author's style sheets considerably higher weight than
those of the reader.  It is therefore important that the user agent gives
the user the ability to turn off the influence of certain style sheets,
e.g. through a pull-down menu...A reader rule with an important declaration
will override an author rule with a normal declaration.  An author rule
with an important declaration will override a reader rule with an important
declaration."
