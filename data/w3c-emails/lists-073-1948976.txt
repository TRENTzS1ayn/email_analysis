JRG:: The WWW clearly is moving toward an object oriented view point with
CSS and DOM.  I don't know alot about XML, but I bet it is object oriented
or will be developedd from an OO perspective.  So from that stand point I
am not sure we cannot talk about our work without talking about OO issues.
 I think this is more true of the PF group, since the PF group will be
dealing with the underlying formats.  I am not sure as yet how the current
use of OO technology on the WWW will affect the WAI-UI group.  Do you have
any specific examples of how something current being described in any of
the WAI would change with your suggestion?

From most authors and user prespectives the OO will be transparent.
