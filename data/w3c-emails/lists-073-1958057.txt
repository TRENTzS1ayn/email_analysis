The CSS standard does this. But it is a recommendation. Why not make it 
part of the Cascade rules? The virtue of this is it is fairly easy to 
make the change, and it would be retro-active for CSS1.

The problem of specificity is a little harder. It would be possible 
simply to allow ANY user Style to override author styles, and ignore the 
specificity rules. But they can be a useful tool. So it would be better 
to include a mechanism which allows the user to set the specificity of 
their style. For example, I may like to have my H2 style override any H2 
subclass, but have a (differently styled) H2 subclass which will override 
an H2 with an ID attribute. This preserves the ability to mark out 
particular objects which the subclassing allows.
