I think that we need to come up with something that is simple for end user
to use to get the presentation they need.  We have not even talked about
what happens if a scripting language starts to modify style sheet
attributes.  

I would like to propose that an accessible WWW page is one that renders the
information content well without the style sheet, and therefore turning off
the author styles and substituting the users style sheet will solve alot of
problems.  The limitation of this approach is the ability of authors to
varify that information is still rendered logically without the style
sheet.  This also does not solve all problems like tables and frames, but
gives the user alot of control over visual effects such as color and font
features.
