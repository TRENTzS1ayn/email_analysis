At a "Birds of a Feather" session at the recent IETF meeting, two
things were supported by a rough consensus.

One: "Content Negotiation" is probably a misleading title.

Two: There is enough interest in having some Internet shared
definitions of features to communicate (such as screen size and
color depth) so that an IETF WG should be formed.

This topic has accessibility consequences, and there are probably
plusses and minuses to all feasible approaches, from an
accessibility perspective.
