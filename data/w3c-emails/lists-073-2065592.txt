Hello WAI Interest Group Members,

I am sending three Calls for Participation out following this message, for
Working Groups which are part of the Web Accessibility Initiative at W3C.  

The charters for these working groups are also available on-line at the
URL's indicated, along with additional background information on the WAI.

Please let me know if you have questions about the WG's.

Happy Holidays,

Judy Brewer
