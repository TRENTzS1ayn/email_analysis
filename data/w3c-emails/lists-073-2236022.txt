Greetings,

I joined this list shortly after the WAI meet in Los Angeles.  Up until
today, I have been a lurker on this list.  I really enjoyed the meet.  
Since the discussions on that day were purely technical, I apologize for
not being able to participate.  However I have already started to collect
information from Deaf sources regarding browser accessibility.  I will share
the information with this list once I have enough replies.  

Richard Roehm
