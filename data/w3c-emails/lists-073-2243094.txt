WEB SITE DESIGN FOR THE BLIND
There are a steadily growing number of the half-million blind people
nationwide who regularly use computers for work, education and
pleasure, and technological breakthroughs are occurring almost daily
in text-to-voice scanners, Braille printers and specially designed
software to help overcome the barriers of icons and other graphics of
the visually oriented World Wide Web. Recently, Blind Industries and
Services of Maryland in Baltimore opened a fully accessible
site-including graphics-that  contains information for both blind and
sighted people --  http://www.bism.com/ . The site was specifically
designed to include graphics:  "We didn't want just a plain boring
screen because sighted people use the site as well."  Creating the
graphics-friendly site required "a lot of major revisions" of
conventional Internet design concepts.  (Washington Post 4 Apr 98)
