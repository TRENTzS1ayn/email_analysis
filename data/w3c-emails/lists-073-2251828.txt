The site is not bad in Lynx (Image maps are still a mess - the answer 
seems to be to use seperate images, each as a link. In this particular 
case it would be a big improvement)

In 24pt Font the standard graphics version is still pretty messy though. 
And why put a text only link at the bottom instead of the top?

A good start, but clearly a long way to go.
