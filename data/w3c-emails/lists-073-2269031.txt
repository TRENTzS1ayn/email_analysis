There's a company called Be who are making an "innovative" operating
system that works on Apple and Intel computers and that they tout rather
highly at http://www.be.com/ so after Jaap got no response I tried.

At least I got an answer!  This sounds so familiar - what we used to
call "the same old same old" - or just simply "the okeydoke."

Hi, and thanks for writing!

While we have put some thought into alternative input methods and would
like to add things like voice recognition, unfortunately we haven't had the
time or resources to devote to this engineering effort (Be has fewer than
30 engineers!). The good news is that the modular design of the BeOS would
ease the effort to add this kind of support, when there is time and
resources to devote to this effort. I'm afraid I cannot give you a
timeframe as to when to expect this added support.

Thanks for your interest in Be!
