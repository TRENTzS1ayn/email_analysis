Actually, the NT platform is a good candidate for a voice command/response driven OS,
IF, IF Microsoft (c) would expose an API into the GDI module of the kernel !

Then, we wouldn't have nit-picking (more than usual) conventions imposed on the apps programmers and the screen readers and scrapers would have a consistent method of interpreting info that the OS is presenting to the user.

And, wow, the browser based shells (a la NT5 and Explorer 4) would then be subject to the same conventions as the WEB pages that the WAI is solidifying, only now at the OS interface level.

Could we stand such consistency ?
