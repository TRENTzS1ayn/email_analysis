CAST Announces Bobby upgrade  & Beta release of  Bobby Application

CAST (Center for Applied Special Technology) is pleased to announce the
release of a major upgrade to the Bobby (v. 2.01) web site
(http://www.cast.org/bobby) and the release of the Bobby Application (Beta
1).

The Bobby web site  is a free service of  CAST  that will analyze single web
pages for their accessibility to people with disabilities. Bobby will also
examine a page's HTML to see if it is incompatible with selected web
browsers or HTML specifications. Major changes to the web site include:

* Use the W3C's HTML 4.0  Web Accessibility Guidelines for Page Authoring to
determine accessibility of a page.
* Implementation of both Required AND Recommended WAI guidelines is
necessary to get "Bobby Approved".
(Be sure to check previously approved pages)
* Access to a FAQ page to assist people with questions about Bobby

The Bobby application is available for downloading on the Bobby home page,
or go directly to: http://www.cast.org/bobby/download.html. It is a free
application  that:
* Tests local files and entire web sites for accessibility.
* Gives you Lynx-style page previews for every page.
* Is written in JAVA and will run under Solaris and Windows 95/NT.

In addition, a generic Java installer is available for other platforms that
run Java version 1.1 or greater. Another version will be released in a month
that will run on MAC OS. It will also have improved accessibility features
for users with disabilities.

About CAST: Founded in 1984, CAST is a not-for-profit organization whose
mission is to expand opportunities for all people -- especially those with
disabilities -- through the innovative uses of computer technology.
