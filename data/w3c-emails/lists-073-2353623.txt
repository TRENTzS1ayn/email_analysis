Has anyone heard of this organization? I heard a brief interview with the
founder and visited their site at:
http://www.naw.org

Their goal is to set up a curriculum & certification process for the
profession of Webmaster, covering the increasing variety of things
Webmasters are asked to do: from content development to site maintenance to
design issues.

It's hard to tell if NAW is 10 people or 10,000, but if they become a
significant force it will be crucial to get accessibility into their
curriculum.
