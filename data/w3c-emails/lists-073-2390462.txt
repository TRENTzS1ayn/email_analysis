Bobby says: 

1.A LABEL must be associated with the INPUT control.
     Line 29: <INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="$TEXTBASE_NAME" VALUE="BACKFILE"
     CHECKED>Current research.

I can't find a good accessible example of a correct implementation. I've
looked through section 10 of the WAI Accessibility Guidelines: Page
Authoring, W3C Working Draft 03-Feb-1998, and section 17.4 of the HTML 4.0
Specification, W3C Recommendation 18-Dec-1997.

When I click on #1 above Bobby takes me to an example that doesn't seem to
apply to my case. The above INPUT stuff goes to our cgi.

Any help would be appreciated. The page I've been testing is at
http://www.cais.com/naric/temp/allinone.html. I've been trying to stick
LABEL text in there, but it shows up on the screen (I don't want it to).
