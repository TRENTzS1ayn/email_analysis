Hi, 

Thanks for the suggestions the other day re: the LABEL and ACCESSKEY
commands; I've run the resulting test pages through Bobby and the W3C
Validator and they appear to be pretty clean, generally.

I would appreciate receiving comments about structural HTML 4.0 and
accessibility issues concerning the pages

http://www.naric.com/naric/temp/index.html
http://www.naric.com/naric/temp/search.html
http://www.naric.com/naric/temp/guestbook.html (has java)

Most of the links don't work... the first two above are template pages.

Comments and/or references to the specs and guidelines, and/or examples to
study, whatever, would be nice.

Thanks,

danw
