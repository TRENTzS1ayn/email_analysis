The new guidelines sucks.  I just had my deafwatch.com site checked by 
The Bobby checker.  Last year I got 3 stars  this sime 3 accessibility 
errors.  My site basically is a very simple site and it goes in the direction
that a text version will not be needed.

I really dont know where these guidelines are comming from but I dont like it
and I feel the sole responsibility of making webpages accessible rests on the
browser makers NOT the website authors.
