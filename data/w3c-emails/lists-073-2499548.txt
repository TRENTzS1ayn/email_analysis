Yowsa.  In what way?

Are you objecting to Bobby's implemenation of the Guidelines
(which are the older ones, not the new ones), or to something
specific in the Guidelines you don't like, or just to the idea
of author guidelines in the first place?

>I really dont know where these guidelines are comming from

Aren't there credits and an explanation of where the Guidelines
come from on the Guidelines themselves?

>but I dont like it

Why not?  Give some reasons besides "they suck" and "I don't
like it", and it's likely that your concerns may be addressed
in a later version.

You may feel that -- but you're completely wrong.  The web
author _has_ to supply enough information for the browser to
display information, or else it simply _can't_ make a page
accessible.

For example, if I have a page that looks like this:

    <IMG SRC="wr40ns.gif">
    <BR>
    <A HREF="lft.html"><IMG SRC="lft40ns.gif"></A>
    <A HREF="rit.html"><IMG SRC="rit40ns.gif"></A>

...there's simply no way that any browser, no matter how smart,
can display this in a way that will be as accessible to a 
blind user as to a sighted one.  No way, no how -- and it's
the fault of the page designer, not the browser.

If I said, instead:

    <IMG SRC="wr40ns.gif" ALT="Welcome to Kynn's Politics Page!">
    <BR>
    <A HREF="lft.html" TITLE="Left Wing Rhetoric Page"
      ><IMG SRC="lft40ns.gif" ALT="The Far Left"></A>
    <A HREF="rit.html" TITLE="Right Wing Rhetoric Page"
      ><IMG SRC="rit40ns.gif" ALT="The Far Right"></A>

...then anyone can understand it, even by reading the "raw
HTML".  (Note that in the hypothetical example above, the images
would consist of fancy graphical versions of the text above,
perhaps with big arrows pointing in different directions, or
whatever.)

So, you may be pissed that you don't get a high enough Bobby
rating, and I understand that and welcome your feedback on
the Guidelines, but you're way, way, WAY off base if you think
that accessibility is primarily a _browser_ issue and not an
authoring issue.
