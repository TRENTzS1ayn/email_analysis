Sorry to ask this if it is too basic, but what is a D-link? I have tried
to extract it from the archives, but find no references to it.

BTW, I am new to this list. My only discapacitation (besides my asthma
which is not too disturbing for Internet issues) seems to be the way I
organize things, which nobody else seem to share. I'd say that could be a
mental discapacity.

nevertheless, I think accesibility for anyone is of paramount importance
and I was really glad to find the W3C had setup this innitiative...

I hope to learn about and contribute to this issues...

thanks,
