I'm not clear what you are asking for. The guidelines do include
an example of client-side image maps:


  <IMG src="welcome.gif"
       alt="Image map of areas in the library"
       usemap="#map1">
  <MAP name="map1">
     <AREA shape="rect" coords="0,0,30,30"
        href="reference.html" alt="Reference">
     <AREA shape="rect" coords="34,34,100,100"
        href="media.html" alt="Audio Visual lab">
  </MAP>

The idea is simple. The img alt attribute is used to name
the text menu, with each entry labelled by the alt attribute
for each area element. A further point is to keep the alt
text to 12 characters or shorter. This will be important for
access by cell phones and devices with small displays.
