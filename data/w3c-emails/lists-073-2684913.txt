on Fillers:
Filler graphics are a problem in that they come up as images, are almost 
never ALT-tagged, can consume excessive bandwidth, and are 
therefore annoying. I think that the use of filler-type dlink images, 
like the appropriate use of images in general, resolves the problems and 
stops being annoying.

on LONGDESC:
As I understand it, the LONGDESC attribute is essentially a link to a 
description page. This means it does the same thing as a D-link, but 
insteaad of the user looking to see whether it is a D, or every second 
Image is ALT-tagged D-link, or some othe solution, there is a mechanism 
for the browser to implement a standard pointer to the description in 
every case, providing some uniformity for the user.

There is no difficulty in collecting the descriptions on the one page, 
but if that is done the best way is to link to the particular description 
within the page, for example:

<IMG SRC="mypic.gif" ALT="charles' picture" LONGDESC="images.htm#mypic">
<A HREF="images.htm#mypic"><IMG SRC="dlink.gif" ALT="D-link"></A>

where dlink.gif is a tiny image (1 white pixel?) which blends into the 
background.
