I really dislike the hard-coded carriage returns in the ALT attributes.  You
can never predict what will wrap and won't in a browser.

Internet Explorer 4.01 has an option to make sure the entire ALT text is
displayed, under the View Menu, Internet Options, Advanced, "Always Expand
ALT text".

Internet Explorer 3.x and 4.0 also supported this feature, but was
programmatically turned on by the presence of a screen reader.
