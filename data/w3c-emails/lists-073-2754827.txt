Thanks!  I spent quite a bit of time in the HTML 4.0 spec looking for the
max value and at the WAI meetings I was told that SGML didn't define one.
I'm am not going to verify whether or not IE allows 65k ALT attributes
though. :)

Not true.  Although not usually enforced, HTML's SGML declaration
*does* define a maximum length (see
<URL:http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/sgml/sgmldecl.html>):

                  ATTSPLEN 65536

This limits the total length of attribute names and values, as
contained in the start-tag, to 2^16 characters.

                  LITLEN   65536

This limits the length of any one attribute literal to 2^16
characters.
