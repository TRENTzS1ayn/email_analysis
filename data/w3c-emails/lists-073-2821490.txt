Hello All

In most cases a screen reader will ignore punctuation if it is set to do so.

Typing mode is another story.  Most screen reading packages allow the user
to turn punctuation on and off as a user option.

The thing to remember about accessibility and graphics is, that if the
graphic is important to understanding what the page is about, then a
description is in order.  If it is window dressing, then using something
like * in an ALT tag is probably OIK.

If you have a list of things with a bullet of some kind, it is probably ok
to have the ALT tag with punctuation in it.  Like so.

* Apples
* Oranges
* Grapes
