demonstrates both the traditional 'd' link, which as many people have 
pointed out does not sit well with the average web designer, or many of 
their customers, and the suggestion of Ree Dollof, to use the d-link as a

Using the ALT-tagged following image technique, perhaps it could be 
called something like image description link instead of d-link...

I will provide a demo of what I mean later tonight.
