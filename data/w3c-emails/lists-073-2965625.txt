Yeah, I forgot to mention your choice. :)  I don't like the word
'D-Link' because, well, it doesn't mean anything.  'Home' has an
established, well-known definition within a web site; most people
learn this quickly.  'About our company' is self-descriptive.

'D-Link' means nothing.  If it said 'Page Description' or something
like that, it might make a little more sense.  'D-Link' by itself
is poor design because it's not obvious at _all_ what it's supposed
to be or how website users should use it.

So I like your idea -- but once again, I think the implementation
is not a good one, and a poor implementation will lead web authors
to simply not use it, and we all suffer from that.
