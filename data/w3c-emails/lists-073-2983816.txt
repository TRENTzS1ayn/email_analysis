This isn't a bad idea.

The only problem, of course, is when that image is used as a link
already.

Well, except it's "canonical" only because the _server_ (not the
web page creator nor the web browser) thinks it is.  In other words,
when I say 'http://www.hwg.org/', it's the HWG web server that
chooses to give me index.html, not my browser that asks for it.

Except with visual UAs, the web author would want to turn this
off.  Why?  Because web authors _love_ turning off borders around
pictures.  Forcing a border back on them for the sake of giving
accessibility features doesn't mean they'll "just have to live
with the border" -- it means they'll dump the accessibility
features.
