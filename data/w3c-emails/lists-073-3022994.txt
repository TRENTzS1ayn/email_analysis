I concur strongly with Bruce on this.  Especially in relation to Bobby
not making allowances for tables with only two rows or only two columns and
just a few words per cell.  Such tables usually manageable with a screen
reader regardless if they are read line by line, column by column, or row by
row.

Otherwise, Bobby is/can be a wonderful tool for web authors who are
unfamiliar with accessibility issues.
