Hi Jeff

You have a good point and I grant you, some of us don't consider
everything.
however beina Web Page desiner myself I'd like to point something out...

Not many pages are designed by Blind/deaf-blind people hence the usually
use
windows which means that DOS is left far behind.... Even my own web site
(Deaf-Blind Network Australia) isn't accessible through DOS although it
comes
in Text only, Framed, and graphics versions.  It's simply because it
uses HTML
4.0.

Unfortunately the way forward in HTML programming is not neccessarily
the best
for the disabled community.  take DHTML (Dynamic HTML) for instance
which will
soon take over Java.  DHTML is fully graphical... Forget text and it's
considered the next best thing.. Ah well..
