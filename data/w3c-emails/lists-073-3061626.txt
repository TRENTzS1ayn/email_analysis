But Lynx is still used by people, and I wouldn't want people to see a page
spattered with these strange "D-link" things unless they wanted it that
way.  Lynx should, by default, hide D-links unless the user explicitly
requests them (with some command key).  When shown, the D-links could
probably just be "[D]" to minimize the visual disruption.
