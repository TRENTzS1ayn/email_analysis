I think you misunderstand the issue.  This is a not a case of 'Bobby'
not only misidentifying an unaccessible page as accessible but vice versa.
Therefore, when we give 'Bobby' as a resource tool to web authors
interested in making their sites accessible, and it kicks back a page that
is accessible as not--- we are faced with much negativity to our cause.
Especially with the new all or nothing approach.

If I go about suggesting to web authors not to use tables
because 'I don't like them,'  the conversation is going to end right there
-- and forget any efforts to make their web sites accessible. However, if
I can show the HTML 4.0 guidelines and the WAI guidelines and present the 
issues that multiple browsers including text browsers need to be able to
read their pages, -- then I have a sporting chance.  

HTML 4.0 and WAI guidelines should be our mainstay, right??? I can
appreciate personal opinion of what HTML 4.0 accepted protocol best to use
in a given situation, but not in the context of accessibility standards.
Or am I missing something here?
