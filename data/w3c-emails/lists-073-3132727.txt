Greetings WAI-IG and UACCESS-L,

This is a special invitation to the Markle Foundation's E-mail for 
All Universal Access Conversation.  The focus of the event is on 
universal access to e-mail and the Internet.  For our Universal 
Internet theme we have drafted the following question:

An essential aspect of a "Universal Internet" is access to technology
and content regardless of disability. What is being done to 
ensure broad access to the Internet's content and services? 
What are some recent successes? What challenges remain? Will 
designing for accessibility incorporate access through non-computers 
devices?


How can we improve this question?  Does anyone have a generalist 
short essay on the topic that they would like share during the 
event (see the web site for details)? If you have additional policy 
questions that you would like to raise please send them in via our 
comment form or e-mail to: emfa@publicus.net

The event as a whole covers a wide range of issues related to 
"universal access" and the audience that is coming together is quite 
diverse.  Please help spread the word to others who you think would 
be interested.

Cheers,

Steven Clift
E-Mail for All

P.S. We have designed our site with accessibility in mind and would 
appreciate any comments or concerns that you might have before the 
event starts next week.  While e-mail receipt of the event is our 
basic accessibility approach, we are working on the look 
and feel template for our web archive which uses MHonArc.  Has anyone 
used this tool and manipulated the "rc file" with accessibility in 
mind?  If so, I will forward your advice to our web designer.
