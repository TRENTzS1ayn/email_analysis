I think the GL discussion should move over to the GL list to keep
detailed discussions off of this general interest list.   We risk
losing people from this list if we start too detailed a discussion
(and too many postings) on this list rather than the working group
lists.   Anyone interested in following these discussions is welcome
on the other lists.  (it also allows you to see the other related
discussions)

Thx

Gregg
