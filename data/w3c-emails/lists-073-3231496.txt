I think this is not a Bobby problem, but a problem with the browsers 
which should be referred to 1. the UA group, and 2. The people from 
Microsoft and other browser manufacturers on this list (I don't think 
Netscape are at the moment :(, but Microsoft certainly are)

The problem is that in Communicator, and presumably other browsers, ALT 
text ONLY shows up as a tool-tip - ie the browser assumes that people use 
graphics out of habit. (bad assumption - Lawyers on $400/hour generally 
don't want to wait for the images any more than blind users do, as I was 
reminded last night)

There is not much else that can be done about this - it is _possible_ for 
authors to solve some of the problems, but it seems a stupid way to 
approach them, and many designers will (rightly in my opinion) blame the 
browser producers for poor design and (wrongly in my opinion) refuse to 
work on the problem themselves.
