Norm,

The page does have some access errors. The problem is that for some reason
Bobby is stumbling over the Javascript and not analyzing the rest of the
page. This is a bug that we will put on the list of things to change.

Thanks for the feedback. Hope this helps.

Subject:Help me with Bobby??!

I was asked to look at a page of my college.
I used explorer 3.2 with graphics off and found it almost totally useless.
A
friend found a similar situation with graphics off on his netscape.

Bobby said the page was perfect.  Lynx worked fairly well and so did
webspeak.

Would someone use explorer or netscape with no graphics and see if my
experience is true.  If so why did Bobby score it highly?

The link is a work in progress and not really public:
