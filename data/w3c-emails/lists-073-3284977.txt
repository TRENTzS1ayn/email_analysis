I amnew and may speak too soon, but I have been having a load of trouble
with my talking mouse in WinVision97 moving over a link only to have the
link disappear from the screen entirely. Even if it has an alt tag so it
reads as I pass over it, once it has done this it is gone and I cannot find
it again. this is becoming very frustrating as these links become more
popular with their cute little buttons that say absolutely nothing in
graphics mode and disappear in text mode. Where am I?
