I was wondering about that accessibility question myself.  We have a
javascript that does the rollover -> change buttons to show the 'active'
button.  Without Javascript you just see the normal button.  Without
graphics, you get the alt text for the link.  So should I be worried that
Bobby wants us to have a <noscript> for this?  Does anyone have a
recommended <noscript> for this?
