There is no need to describe every single feature that a user is missing.
All this does is say "You're not good enough to see this page as I intended
you to see it, but here's a clue."

I regularly disable JavaScript to avoid annoying distractions, but that
kind of NOSCRIPT adds a worse distraction than unnecessary animations or
messages in my status bar.

There is no appropriate NOSCRIPT for image rollovers because NOSCRIPT is
only useful to provide alternative content for a SCRIPT that generates
content.  Since the vast majority of SCRIPTs provide dynamic interactivity
instead of generating content, the NOSCRIPT element is rarely needed.

Bobby is wrong for complaining about a missing NOSCRIPT.  That error was
based on an earlier version of the Guidelines Working Draft that was also
wrong, but has since been corrected.
