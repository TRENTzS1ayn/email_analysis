This is why I was wondering about the effect of a noscript.  If the script
is merely flash, then all you are doing is saying slightly more politely
than is sometimes the case "Ha, you should be using a better browser."

This is what I was thinking.  In fact, this is what I told the person who
ran a page through Bobby that contained a rollover script.  I'm glad to see
that it is also the opinion of others.
