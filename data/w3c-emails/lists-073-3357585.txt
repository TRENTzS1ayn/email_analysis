LQ:  Imagine a browser which has scripts permanently disabled.  The use of
NOSCRIPT to the extent you have described provides an unnecessary
distraction while reminding the user that the Web doesn't cater to such
people.

LQ:  Then push for a LONGDESC attribute for SCRIPT.  NOSCRIPT is for
alternate content, and alternate content is not a description of what the
user's missing.

>they enable all users to understand how the page is designed to be seen.

LQ:  If the page is designed to be seen, then it's not designed to be
accessible.

LQ:  All this page has to do is use the image URI in the HREF and add
"return false" to the "change" function.  Then the page transparently
provides an alternative to the script, making a NOSCRIPT element
unnecessary and distracting.
