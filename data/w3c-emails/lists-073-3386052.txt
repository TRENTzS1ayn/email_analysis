And then there are the blind web designers out here who LIKE knowing graphics
are on a site and how they were used. I'm frequently altering my position too,
as I basically agree with Liam, but this particular issue is "iffy," in my
opinion, subject to the author's discretion. I maintain it's better to have
too
much information than not enough, particularly as web pages are often used as
learning tools for others.
