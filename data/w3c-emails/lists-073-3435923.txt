LQ:: I wouldn't do anything merely to satisfy Bobby, but TITLE="End of
Section A", TITLE="Start of Section B" or TITLE="New Section" would be more
appropriate and less verbose for an HR element.  For an IMG element, the
TITLE should be context-free; TITLE="Thin blue line" would probably be
best.  The ALT attribute on IMG would provide a suitable replacement in the
spirit of HR's TITLE attribute.

I think TITLEs on HR elements are rather silly though.  The level of the
next heading should indicate whether one has reached a new section or not.
When writing new pages, I find myself not using HR.  Sometimes I use a
style sheet with a 'border-top' instead of an HR, but usually I find that
the document is more attractive visually without any dividing lines.  It's
structurally sound either way.

LQ:: I use ALT="" as a "for decorative purposes only" label.

LQ:: Then I think we'd be sacrificing the high level of usability provided
by seamless accessibility.
