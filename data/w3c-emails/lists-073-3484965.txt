LQ::  You shouldn't have to.  With seamless accessibility, all you do is
disable Java and you're left with a usable alternative (as the content of
the APPLET element).

LQ::  With seamless accessibility, the ALT attribute provides a replacement
for the image, not a description of it.  The TITLE attribute gives a title
for the image, typically in the form of a short description.

LQ::  The TITLE attribute tells you what's there to look at.  The ALT
attribute replaces what's there to look at.

Seamless accessibility does not deny you any access.  If you want to know
about the images, you can know about them through their TITLE and LONGDESC
attributes.  If you don't load images and don't care about them, you never
have to know that they're there.  Either way, the page appears optimized
for your browsing environment.
