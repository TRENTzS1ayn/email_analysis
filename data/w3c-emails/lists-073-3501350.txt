If I disable JAVA in some places I must be I am then told to go away and
get a browser that is JAVA capable. Now I realize that in the best of all
possible worlds when all is right with access this won't be the case but
for now, it is, too often, and so i must go text only as the version
provided for me to access.

Are you capitalizing seamless accessibility? I'm not sure what this term
is meant to mean. I encounter ALT tags that say everything from IMAGE
(that's informative) to "snowflakes". what I am saying is I'd rather it say
snowflakes or family portrait rather than "picture" some do, some don't. I
want to know if there are snowflakes even if i am supposedly just listening
because I have been put into listening mode unwillingly.
