LQ:: I use the term to differentiate it from the kind of accessibility many
others advocate, which is to describe what a Web page looks like visually.
Seamless accessibility means that a Web page appears to be designed
specifically for the user's browsing environment, whatever that environment
is.

LQ:: I'd rather have the ALT attribute give a replacement for the image.
If the image is pure decoration, then there is no need for anything to
replace it.

LQ:: Use of the TITLE attribute (for example, TITLE="Wilson Bentley
Snowflake") allows this.  Browsers should allow the user to toggle among
three modes:  1) load all images; 2) don't load images but show the
presence of images with ALT text displayed and TITLE available on request;
3) replace images seamlessly with ALT text.  The second option is the
user's way of requesting "seams".
