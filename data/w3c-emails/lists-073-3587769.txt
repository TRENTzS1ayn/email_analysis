Liam is right about NOSCRIPT adding stuff into pages. LONGDESC does not 
seem to be appropriate for scripts, and I do not see another way around 
the problem. 

In general terms, many users are coming across things they 
cannot 'see' all the time - I use lynx at home because I have no other 
Internet access - I can see images when I am at work, and would quite 
like to know what I should mark for reviewing or download. 

The javascript problem is a bit trickier - there are a few things that 
should be added for accessibility beyond just referring the browser to an 
image, but I think Liam has provided the pointer towards the best solution.

The point of a NOSCRIPT is to decribe a script. Having thought about it a 
little more, I would usually place the description in comments anyway, 
which obviates the need for NOSCRIPT.
