>Making the Web more accessible
>
>
>The next time you go to the store, your office or a public
>building, look around and you will see access ramps and other
>means for assisting the disabled.
>
>Now go to your favorite Web site or your company's home page.
>You are unlikely to find any features to assist the disabled.
>
>Lack of such accommodations is a growing problem for Web
>developers, IT managers and disabled users. Not only does the
>lack of assistance limit access to information, it cuts off a
>potentially large group of users, or customers, of online
>businesses.
>
>Until now, most users with physical or cognitive disabilities
>merely got by on the Web. Some use text readers, speech
>synthesizers or voice-activated commands to penetrate HTML. But
>that access is in danger of being cut off as the Web becomes
>more application-centric, with complex scripts for generating
>dynamic content, which text-based software can't translate.
>Likewise, hearing- or visually disabled users can navigate a
>site but are left behind when audio or video is the source of
>information.
>
>The solutions to the access problem are many and simple. First,
>IT managers and Web-design teams should wake up to the need to
>maximize access for all types of disabled users.
>
>Second, developers should follow Web design recommendations
>being drafted by the World Wide Web Consortium's Web
>Accessibility Initiative group. When the guidelines are
>published, within the next few months, they will call for
>standard ways of presenting content that will make it easier for
>disabled users to navigate a site, such as implementing standard
>style sheets instead of custom HTML tags and offering
>closed-captioning and transcripts of multimedia presentations.
>
>Third, IT managers should learn about the potential crossover
>benefits that access technologies will give to their nondisabled
>work force -- for example, "hands-busy" workers, such as those
>in factories or operating rooms.
>
>The Department of Justice has ruled that the Americans with
>Disabilities Act has jurisdiction over public Web sites the same
>way it does over public buildings. If adoption of accessibility
>initiatives is slow, lawsuits may result.
>
>We take for granted the infrastructure that assists the
>handicapped through the everyday world. IT managers and online
>developers should make access to the Web just as ubiquitous.
