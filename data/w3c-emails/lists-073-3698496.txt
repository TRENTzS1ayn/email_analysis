                     _The Next WAVe(sm):_                 
       Auditory Browsing in Web and non-Web Databases  

    I am pleased to announce the formal establishment of _The Next
WAVe(sm)_, a new clearinghouse devoted to Auditory Browsing in Web and
non-Web databases. The URL for _The Next WAVe(sm)_ is:  

       http://www.public.iastate.edu/~CYBERSTACKS/Wave.htm      

   I believe that the projects, research, products and services profiled in
_The Next WAVe(sm)_ will be of interest to librarians and computer
scientists alike who seek to enhance access to Web information sources as
well as information found in conventional database systems.  

     For those who have limited knowledge about Auditory Displays, I
strongly recommend reading any and all of the excellent papers from the
first international conference on auditory display organized by the
International Community for Auditory Display (ICAD).  

   Gregory Kramer (editor), AUDITORY DISPLAY: SONIFICATION, AUDIFICATION AND
AUDITORY INTERFACES Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc., Reading,
Massachusetts, 1994. ISBN 0-201-62603-9   

    This volume is a seminal work in the field. [I strongly recommend that
every research library obtain a copy for their collections.]  

     I also strongly suggest a visit to the ICAD homepage at  
  
               http://www.santafe.edu/~icad/  

     I believe that both the able and disabled will find the efforts
profiled in _The Next WAVe(sm)_ to an important resource of value for
facilitating access to Web resources.  

      I am greatly interested in developing this clearinghouse further and
would greatly appreciate learning of other research, projects, products, and
services in the following areas:  

Auditory exploration of data via sonification 
Audification (audible playback of data samples)
Real Time monitoring of multivariate data           
        Sound in Immersive Interfaces (Virtual Environments)                   
        Perceptual issues in Auditory Display               
        Sound in generalized computer interfaces
        Technologies supporting Auditory Display creation
Data handling for Auditory Display systems 
Applications of Auditory Display 

        I am particularly interested in projects in Assistive Technology as
well as auditory or multimodal access in computer interface and  the use of
sound in data mining and Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) [For
information about DM and KDD, see my Four-T-Nine-R(sm) project at:
http://www.public.iastate.edu/~CYBERSTACKS/4T9R.htm] 

    _The Next WAVe(sm)_ is the second in a series of three planned
clearinghouses devoted to Sensory Information Navigation (SIN) [:->]. _The
Next WAVe(sm)_ complements _The Big Picture_, my clearinghouse devoted to
Information Visualization available at

      http://www.public.iastate.edu/~CYBERSTACKS/BigPic.htm

    As always, Any and All suggestions, comments, critiques, queries,
questions and/or contributions are most welcome.
