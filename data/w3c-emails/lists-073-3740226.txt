I have the following HTML in a web page - 
http://www.srl.rmit.edu.au/charles/index.html

<img src="images/charles2.gif" TITLE="charles" ALT="Charles" 
LONGDESC="images/charles2.html" ALIGN="LEFT"><A 
HREF="images/charles2.html" TITLE="Description of Charles2.gif"><IMG 
SRC="images/dot.gif" ALT="D-link" TITLE="link to description of 
Charles2.gif (previous picture)"></A>

What it does in Netscape is fairly predictable - there is an image, then 
a little white dot (on a white background) with a big blue border, linked 
to a description. With Images off, I get two boxes about the same size, 
one containing an image icon and the text "charles" (the ALT text), 
followed by one with a blue border, containing the icon and the ALT text 
"D-link".

But using MSIE 4, I cannot find the image by any means I know, in any 
configuration. Does anyone have an idea why?

(this is the same MISE I use to view objects included with the OBJECT 
tag, which works generally very nicely. Does that mean I have some 
bizarre version nobody has heard of?)
