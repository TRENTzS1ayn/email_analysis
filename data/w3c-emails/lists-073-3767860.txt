The point was that the ALT text does not appear, since the odds of 
hitting it by accident and getting the tool-tip text are vanishingly 
small. In Netscape, the object is displayed at the correct size to fit in 
the alt text - this is much more friendly.

Netscape places a border around images used as links by default. That 
way I don't have to guess where the links are and where the plain images are.
If I wrote a stylesheet I might specify no borders, but I personally find 
them very handy.

(I can tab to it fine, but I can only read half of the status bar - the 
half that doesn't tell me what I'm getting)
