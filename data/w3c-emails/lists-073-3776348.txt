Okay, but what's the point?  <smile> If you want to reserve more space for
the image, use HEIGHT and WIDTH.  If you ask me, you're trying to take
advantage of a bug in Netscape, which puts borders around images which are a
link.  Is there something in the HTML 4.0 specification that says user
agents should indicate when images are anchors?

Your comment confused me:

In Netscape, the object is displayed at the correct size to fit in the alt
text - this is much more friendly.

Friendlier than what?  What's the correct size of the object?  To me, it's
the size of the object, which is really small.

Under IE4.01 with "Show Images" off and "Always Expand ALT Text" on, the
entire ALT text of both images is shown.

The point was that the ALT text does not appear, since the odds of 
hitting it by accident and getting the tool-tip text are vanishingly 
small. In Netscape, the object is displayed at the correct size to fit in 
the alt text - this is much more friendly.

Netscape places a border around images used as links by default. That 
way I don't have to guess where the links are and where the plain images
are.
If I wrote a stylesheet I might specify no borders, but I personally find 
them very handy.

(I can tab to it fine, but I can only read half of the status bar - the 
half that doesn't tell me what I'm getting)
