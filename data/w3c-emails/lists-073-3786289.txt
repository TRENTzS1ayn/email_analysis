it is only when the images are off that I really care - if people are 
loading the images I assume they don't really need a LONGDESC. The border 
around images in general is something I find helpful - rather than guess 
which are links and which are just images, I can easily see (if I was 
tabbing around I suppose I could find out too, but as a visual user it 
isn't my normal way of doing it).

Aaah. A polite way of saying 'read the instructions you idiot'. Sorry 
folks - thanks Chuck. Everything is clearer to me now.
