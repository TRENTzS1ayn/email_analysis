Ummm, if bordered images are helpful then why not make them reliable across
UAs on your site?  Why not add a style which specifies that anchored images
should have a border.  Rather than hope the UA does it by default.  I agree
that bordered images are often helpful in this way.  I kind of like the
hover pseudo-class implemented in IE4.  I use it on occasion.  It is a great
cue for visual users when used to slightly change the border color.  That
way if it isn't apparently a link then a visual user gets a hint if they
pass over it.  Will something like hover be added to CSS proper at some
point?  Kind of tough to call since its nature is basically an event-driven
form of the link pseudo-class.  I haven't been following CSS developments
very closely for a few months.

Something like this for anchored image borders:
A:Link IMG {Border: 2px ridge #00F;}

IE4 Hover pseudo-class:
A:Link IMG {Border: 2px ridge #00F;}
A:Hover IMG {Border: 2px ridge #10E;}
