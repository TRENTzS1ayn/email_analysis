Note: this is an answer to a message sent to GL but it belongs here (I think).
The message that I reply to is appended below.

The guidelines exploit new features of HTML4.0 but these features 
shouldn't harm any user of an older browser. If an author write a summary 
for TABLE and a longdesc for IMG, an older browser wouldn't crash, it just
wouldn't do anything with these attributes.

One must admit that HTML4.0 allows for more cross-media accssibility
than older versions of HTML. Using HTML4.0 accessibility features helps 
users of new browsers but doesn't hurt others. The "interim"
guidelines take into account current limitations of browsers.

Concerning low level hardware, I think that there is a tendency 
(at least in declarations) to make browsers more economical in RAM,
and browsers that implement HTML4.0 (or at least significant parts of it)
may be installable on older machines as well. Modern browsers may be 
smaller in RAM than existing ones (e.g., the huge Communicator 4).

Nir Dagan.
