that is why we have competition and irate users on all sides of the fence - 
and i try to avoid the microsoft vs netscape vs sun vs everyone else 
battles.  this is not a perfect world - i just want to know where the 
problems are for each product and engineer a work around!

lets face it - html web authoring tools are still not there...two cents

Subject: Re: Using htlm editors to produce clean code?

My many thanks to the several people who have responded privately to my
initial post.  I will endevor to ensure that the most salient points are
posted here.

The consenses so far:
1) FrontPage is quirky and you still have to know html to use it.
2) It doesn't take much work to correct Communicator pages.
3) Other packages MIGHT do the trick.

I am still not satisfied.

The beauty of Communicator is that, once it is set up, a neophyte can 1)
select "edit", 2) make changes, 3) select "publish" AND THEY ARE DONE!
The person doesn't have to know anything about ftp or html.  (For that
matter, they don't even need to know a password, but this only works
with one account/directory.)  When you add to this that the person is
using software (the browser) that they are already comfortable with, we
are talking about a NEAR ZERO learning curve.

Even editing one line of code destroys the simplicity here.

Does anyone know of a way to modify Communicator's behavior?  Would the
commercial versions address this need?

How is it that no one at Netscape or Microsoft worries about producing
html 4.0 compliant code?

Thanks,
Bruce Bailey
