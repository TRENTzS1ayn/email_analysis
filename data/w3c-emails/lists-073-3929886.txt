Most unbiased observers of the Web would probably agree that the
original WWW concept was that everyone (unskilled individuals included 
if not in particular) have a venue and tools to publish globally 
without being subjected to long periods of training.

The original poster has found a tool which (for his purposes) does 
just that, but which lacks provision for a DOCTYPE declaration and 
which also inserts a few other annoyances into the documents.

What is needed is not for everyone exposed even temporarily to the
internet to be goaded into becoming highly-skilled HTML authors; 
rather we need to find temporary solutions for the problems inherent 
in the present tools (which is exactly what the original poster
requested).

Does anyone out there know a way to force the Composer segment of 
Netscape Communicator to include a DOCTYPE declaration, as a step 
toward validation and accessibility, as requested by the original
poster?
