The practice authoring software has of rewriting code is a really 
annoying, and often destructivee thing. Since most authoring programs are 
still not as good as a person writing 'bare code', and most are miles 
away for accessibility/universal design issues, they ought to leave the 
code as it is, or ask before they take things out. I am not sure how to 
get this implemented, but I know that I have not recommended any product 
because of this - it takes about as long to teach somebody HTML as it 
does to explain to them how to use a program like FrontPage properly, and 
in the long run it means that they can take the rubbish pproduced by an 
authoring program and fix it.

I am encourageed to hear good things said about HoTMetaLpro - I'll have a 
look at it as soon as I can - life would be easier if there was a product 
that could be recommended
