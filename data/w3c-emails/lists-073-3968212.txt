The discussion has been prompted because 'someone's secretaries need to 
produce HTML, but don't know how to write HTML'.

The simple answer is:
Provide them with proper training, so they do know how to produce HTML. 
Most people can learn to produce basic HTML, and to understand why that 
is preferable for so many cases, in a few days. That is the bottom line 
cost - you cannot make strawberry jam from cow's manure, you have to buy 
strawberries.
