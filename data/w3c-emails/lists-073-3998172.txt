I agree one hundred percent, it's better to take the time to learn how to do
it right.  I also started out with Composer and as I learned more about HTML
I found myself reworking the code and to date I have written the same pages
five or six times.

The tool I use now is the Arachnophilia HTML editor and while it is not
WYSIWYG it is easy to learn and use and is extremely flexible and user
configurable.  It allows you to preview your work on up to six different
browsers and will even convert RTF files into HTML.

It includes a minimal tutorial on HTML and although it was apparently
written pre- HTML 3.0 it was very thoughtfully written to allow for
inclusion of new tags and languages. (I use it for CSS as well as HTML
documents.)

It can be downloaded free from: http://www.arachnoid.com/arachnophilia/

Yeah, but why buy strawberries and make jam when you can just buy the jam
ready made.

Of course it tastes better if you grew the strawberries yourself and made
the jam, but this analogy is getting beaten pretty thin so...
