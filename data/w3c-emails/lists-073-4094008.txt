Do you have a look at Amaya. It's free available on Windows and Unix platforms
and provides well formed documents.
In Amaya, you have also the "Alternate view" that displays a document without
CSS and images (it displays the Alt attribute instead), the "Table of Contents
view", the "Links view" and the "Structure view".
