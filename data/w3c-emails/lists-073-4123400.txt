I agree that this is a problem.  It will likely continue to be such for a
while.  My only suggestion is that the browser makers support <LINK> better
(Hint Hint, Microsoft; IE5?).  You know, like NCSA Mosaic.  Mosaic creates a
toolbar with buttons for each <LINK>.  It uses the rel/rev, title, and href
of <LINK> to create icons, labels, and links for the buttons.  It is
analogous to the 'links' toolbar in IE only it changes for each page.
