Thanks Chris for posting the URL.

I began learning HTML at
http://www.davesite.com/webstation/html/
An Interactive Tutorial for Beginners.

>>>Or even in an hour: see
<URL:http://www.shore.net/%7Ecrism/zeroto.html>,
an underused (IMO) basic HTML tutorial, covering
HTML Level 2 and providing a good basis
for further self-teaching.<<<
