Has anyone used the Opera browser at
http://opera.nta.no/ ?

I'm curious as Opera makes claims that it is
a superb choice for users with a handicap; it
can be navigated with the keyboard only.

Additional claims are Opera stands out
from the rest in that it actually adheres to
the HTML standard, making it the ideal
reference browser for web designers tired
of adapting their pages to either of the competitive browsers.

Thanks,
