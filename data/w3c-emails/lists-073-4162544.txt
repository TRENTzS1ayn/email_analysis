Yes, I like it very much.  Also note that http://www.operasoftware.com
is an alternate URL for it.

I don't have "a handicap", but the keyboard navigation is pretty
nice.  I use a few keyboard shortcuts simply for the sake of speed.

It's good for testing because it does HTML 3.2 pretty good, and
is highly configurable -- more than either MSIE or Navigator --
allowing you to easily toggle images/colors off and on, disable
or enable frames (vital for viewing "noframes" tags), and other
fun stuff.

It's only "missing" three major things:

* Full HTML 4.0 support (hopefully coming soon)
* Support of any kind for stylesheets (hopefully coming soon)
* Good support for Java (which I won't miss)

It does most everything else you'd want -- SSL, javascript,
plugins, etc.

One big selling point is the size -- it's still small enough
to fit on a floppy, and yet compares favorably to Navigator and
MSIE versions 3.*-something.  Very fast both to start and load
pages, with lots of cache-level controls makes it good for
older computers.

Wow, I sound like an evangelist, don't I?  Drawback is that it's
not simply a marketing tool for a huge corporation (as MSIE and
Navigator are), but a real product supporting a staff of around
15 people or so; this means that it's not given away for free, but
costs $35.  (Half-off discount for educational users, such as 
me-the-university-employee.)  I think it's more than worth it,
though, and I urge everyone to give it a try.

No, I don't get paid for this. :)
