Looked at it.  No offense, but there is no way that page will change
secretaries, English professors, and other non-technical people into
producers of valid, accessible HTML in an hour.  "Self-teaching" is
a crock, too; people want things to be easy, not want things to be
"learnable if you just spend enough time doing it!"

I can sit down with an average non-technical CGU employee and teach
them communicator in an hour, and assuming they're familiar with
Word, they can be publishing on the web by the end of that hour,
without learning HTML.  Will they make great pages?  Nope.  Will they
be able publish?  Yes, and I see that as the promise of the web.

My only concern now is "how to make it painless for those people to
be able to include accessibility considerations."  As yet, I don't
have a good solution for that one, since the editor programmers
haven't been the best partners in terms of cooperation.
