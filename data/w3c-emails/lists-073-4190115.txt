We don't use Word Perfect here.  Our secretaries are not going to
want to learn another word processor, and our tech support staff
are not going to want to have to support another program, merely
so that we can produce "good HTML" rather than "workable HTML."

While I understand the difference between "HTML that we can see
and looks fine to us" and "valid, accessible HTML", it's pretty
hard to sell the concept to non-technical folks who can look at a
web page and say, "that works on my Netscape -- what's wrong with
it?"  It's doubly harder if I have to convince them to change away
from a word processor that works, for dubious reasons such as
"this doesn't pass validation."
