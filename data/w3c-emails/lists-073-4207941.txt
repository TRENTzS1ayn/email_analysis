I have used the Opera browser, and been very impressed with it. It does 
not implement Java, nor much in the way of javascript if anything, but it 
is nice to use and it is small in size.

Opera claims that they will be implementing CSS2 in the next couple of 
months, which would be nice.

It is not, however, free - it costs about USD$35 I think. The demo 
version is fully functional for a month.
