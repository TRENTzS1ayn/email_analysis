I have a registered copy of Opera.  It seems like a decent browser.  I don't
use it often, though.  The current version seems like no more than a MDI
variation on NCSA Mosaic.  I don't like the fact that it is a relatively new
browser that costs $35 and doesn't support CSS.  The only way to manipulate
rendering is with HTML 3.2 or HTML 4 transitional markup.  One more reason
for people to use deprecated HTML markup.  I would really like it if it was
as revolutionary as 'the press' says.  Give me CSS and I will follow.  I
don't really care if it supports Java, ActiveX, Javascript or anything.  I
just want it to handle not supporting them.  I haven't tested its handling
of objects, I just thought that I should mention it.

That is my take on Opera.  In general, I think that it has great potential.
