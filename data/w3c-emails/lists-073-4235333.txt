> Helmar at Opera Software says Opera 3,3, the next version, will support 
> style sheets CSS2. Previous plans were to have opera 
> support CSS2 in version 4, which is currently slated for release in 
> August/September. They earlier promised CSS would be included 
> in 3,0, which was released on new year's, but it didn't. 
> 
> This would make Opera the only mainstream browser which supports CSS2. 
> 
> Of course they may break the promise again. But if I post this news 
> everywhere then it'll be harder for them to break the promise!!
