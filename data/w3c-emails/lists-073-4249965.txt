If seamless accessibility means presenting different material to 
different audiences, each audience not knowing what the other is getting, 
then I am not at all in favour of it.

I am, like I suspect most people here, in favour of solutions to 
accessibilty problems which do not rely on the 'get a life - download 
hotbrowser version 567 for the BBC Micro to see this website' approach.
