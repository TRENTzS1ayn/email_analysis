LQ::  That's okay, because seamless accessibility doesn't mean that.  With
seamless accessibility, everyone gets the same content.  It's just that
users get content presented optimally for their browsing environment rather
than a description of how that content might be presented in some foreign
browsing environment.

LQ::  Exactly.  When we describe how a page looks visually to the
non-visual user, we're simply saying "Get a life--download eyes now" in a
nicer way.  D-links are obtrusive because they tell the non-visual user
that he or she is viewing a visual page.  For this reason, D-links should
never be automatically rendered all the time; they should only be rendered
when the user requests more information on how the page looks visually (as
with the "*" key command in Lynx).
