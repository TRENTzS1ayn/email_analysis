I was running through the last few posts to see if anyone had mentioned
this product ...

Yup, and it works with HTML 4.0, is easy to generate valid code, and gives
the WYSIWYG and under the hood views of the same HTML without putting in
ugly proprietary tags. Very nice to see something which only writes what
you input for a change.

www.dreamweaver.com or www.macromedia.com/dreamweaver are the URLS.

They do listen too, if enough noise is made. ActuallY I think the feature
set for DW 2.0 (its 1.2 at present) includes a whole bunch of support for
accessibility options incl plugin integrations, better support for ALT and
descriptions etc and _I think_ some tutorial support for designing more
flexible web pages eg for text only, voice navigation.

BTW, I do not work for macromedia.
