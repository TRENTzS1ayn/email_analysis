I designed my company's web page using Netscape Composer, and I edited
the HTML for accessibility purposes in Notepad. My company wishes to use
Microsoft FrontPage for further web development, however, when I
imported the Netscape version of the page into FrontPage, I experienced
a number of formatting problems. Has anyone had any accessibility issues
with FrontPage-made webs?
