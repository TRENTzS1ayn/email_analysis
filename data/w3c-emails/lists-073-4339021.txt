Well, FP's improved in later versions.  I don't use it myself --
I don't use _any_ HTML authoring crutchHHHtool, save
for vi/notepad/lemmy.  However, my wife and I have basically
discovered that whenever we find a really bad page -- it was
almost always FrontPage generated.

This may simply be a problem with user education rather than
something the FP _programmers_ can fix.  I dunno.  Perhaps
FrontPage and other tools make things a little _too_ easy?
(Which goes against what I said previously, a little -- however
I think that things should be easy _and_ produce good code.)

As I said, FP is better than it was, and as I don't use it,
I'm afraid I don't have any specifics that are worth passing
along.
