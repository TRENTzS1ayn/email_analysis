Larry Behrens requests:

Many of us are admittedly new to both the list and the finer points of 
accessibiility.  Could you somehow rephrase the above (for those of us 
who are logically impaired <G>). I thought the purpose of the D-link 
IS so that those who want a verbal description can get one. (?)

Are you opining that the D-links themselves should only appear on
request, rather than being a constant reminder that *there's more*?
If so (and I can agree with that concept), do you have a suggestion on 
how that might best be done on a page?

Thanks for any clarifications, from any sources.

Regards, Larry Behrens
