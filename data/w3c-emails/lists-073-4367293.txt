Larry Behrens suggests:

While I, also, do not use Front Page (anyone see a pattern here <G>), 
I certainly respect your attitude; any manufacturer who wants to better 
their product deserves input, so may I suggest that you access 

http://www.hwg.org/search.html and do a search for Front Page (etc.)

Those are the people, professionals and hobbyists alike,  who either 
do or do not use your products (and they are not shy about revealing 
the *why* <grin>). 

You may already have someone assigned to monitoring those lists; if not, 
I certainly would suggest it.

Regards, Larry Behrens
