WC:: Within the body of the OBJECT element, an author can provide as much
text as they would like, or even alternative OBJECTs.  If the OBJECT is of
type "image/gif" and the user wishes not to load graphics, then the content
of the OBJECT could be displayed or the user agent could create a button
that will cause the text to be displayed on request.  The user agent could
do a number of things:  pop up a window with the description, include the
description in-line, or however the user wants it presented (ala style
sheets, user agent configuration, or whatever else comes about).  I think
HTML has included the appropriate provisions for the user agents to do
something interesting and useful.
