There has been much talk on using the description / d link.  Is this not 
redundant when the alt tag is used effectively?  It seems to me that a page 
should be able to stand on it's own even if all images are stripped from 
the site (as with low vision and blind users).  It's all about content.

Regarding  D-links-
What about making them the same color of the background?  The screenreader
will still see it.
