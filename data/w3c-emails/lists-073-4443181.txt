About one month ago - on april 16, 1998 - I needed an HTML
viewer. The main reason for this was the outcome of the ADOBE
PDF2HTML convertor. I started looking for an easy to use HTML
viewer that still works in DOS.
Most viewers I found only removed the HTML tags; others - like
LYNX for DOS - were so complex to use...

                  Therefore I tried it myself

L_H is an HTML viewer. The funny thing with this viewer though
is that you can easy "configure" it. It can be very useful to
be informed about certain tags. In other cases you might
prefer just plain text.

Next to several basic functions simply change the INI-file or
make alternate INI files which you can add through a parameter
on the command line.
Basic functionality

The basic functionality available:
 -   Support for basic HTML tags like new line (BR), paragraph
     (P) etc.
 -   Support for presentation aspects in text format for HTML
     tags like font (FONT), bold/italic/underline (B/I/U) etc.
     and color and background color attributes.
 -   Support for links and anchors.
 -   Support for tables. For single level (not nested) tables
     the table layout is shown. As an alternative cell
     numbering is available. This mode supports nested tables
     (see /T option).
 -   Support for (nested) lists.
 -   Simple support for framesets.
 -   Support for non-standard symbols. This does NOT include
     the SYMBOL character set yet.
 -   Support for suppressing specific texts like scripting
     procedures etc.
 -   Support for special screening on HTML files produced by
     the Adobe PDF2HTML converter.

If you need more support simply add the required entries to
the INI-file.
Remarks and comments

If you do have any error reports, comments, requests for
enhancements etc please let me know. I up to now only
implemented what I needed myself.
