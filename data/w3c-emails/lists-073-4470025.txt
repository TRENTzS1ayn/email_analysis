LQ::  I don't want the screenreader to see it unless the user of the
screenreader explicitly asks for it.  D-links describe what images look
like and thus tell the non-visual user that she's viewing a visual page.
As an author, I want every user to think that the page is made specifically
for her, so I don't want the non-visual user to get distracting remnants of
anything visual.

The description linked to by a D-link is not important for communicating
the content of a page.  The content of the image is expressed by the ALT
attribute in the case of the IMG element and by the element content in the
case of OBJECT.
