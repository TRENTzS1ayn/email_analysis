Right now I am using a text-only connection to read my mail and browse. 
When I come to a page designed as Liam describes, I will have no ideas 
what that page will be like if I swap to a full PPP connection and a 
graphical browser. Let alone knowing what the objects I cannot see are.

This is discrimination on a massive scale. It is also the antithesis of 
portability/interoperabiliity - it is creating various classes of user, 
allowing each to imagine they are the only class of user, and not letting 
them know if ther is something they are missing - an intensely 
authoritarian approach to information dissemination.
