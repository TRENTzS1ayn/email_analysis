LQ::  Background images are specified in a style sheet, along with margins,
leading, fonts, colours, voices, and auditory icons.  Do you really think
that authors should describe each and every one of their style rules for a
small group of misguided users?  If some blind users think the Web is a
visual medium, then the EO group should fix that rather than forcing
authors to dilute their content and screw people who view the Web as device
independent and expect it to be that way.

LQ::  I'm not aware of the voice-family specified on pages because I don't
use Emacspeak.  If I were conversing with an Emacspeak user, I suppose that
the voice-family used on a particular page may come up.  Should the author
tell me and everyone else about what voice-family she chose so that I can
be better prepared for such a discussion?

LQ::  SOME PEOPLE view the Web as a visual medium, even though they may use
the Web in a non-visual environment.  We need to educate these users
instead of giving in to their misguided views and harming those with more
sensible views.

CMN::

LQ::  Where does it stop?  If <HR> is content, then the link colours and
fonts must be content as well.

The author is the only person in a position to efficiently decide what
aspects of a page are content and what aspects are presentation
suggestions.  You want to pile it all on the user and make the user sift
through everything to find what he or she thinks might be content.
