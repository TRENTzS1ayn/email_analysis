"Discrimination"?  How?

If you want a browser that will tell you when an image is there,
you should use one, or write one if it doesn't meet your needs.

You could always view source on pages if you like; you may get better
luck reading Liam's pages in raw HTML than in a text-only browser.
All of the information for your graphical browser _is_ still in 
there.  He's _still_ giving the same information to everyone.

It's not his fault that your text browser doesn't give you more
information.
