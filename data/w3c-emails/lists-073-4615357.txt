While I agree that people should have the ability to hear or not hear long
descriptions or d links, I'm really bothered by the implication that comes
across in some of the mail that people who want to know what a page looks
like are somehow wrong or misguided.  For example, a statement that
describes descriptions of visual aspects as a "frill" that "some people
value".  Saying that someone values a "frill" come across to me as a
put-down of that person.

As far as I'm concerned you try to give a person what they want, period,
without any value judgments.
