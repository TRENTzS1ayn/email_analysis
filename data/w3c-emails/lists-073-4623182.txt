How about a concrete example.

Consider a web page by a web design house (http://enhanced-designs.com/,
referenced in Liam's signature)

The page has three sections, each decorated by an large image of a
intricate, symmetric, glowing snowflake.  The three snowflakes are all
different.

I would like to hear from people who are blind, or have low vision, whether
they personally would want to know about those images.  I expect that as all
people are different, we'll get a lot of different answers.
