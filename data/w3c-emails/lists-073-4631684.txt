I have a lengthy text description on (and of) our site so verbose as to
be belabored.  My rationale comes from a discussion I had with one of my 
daughters who works for Lucent.  I found the logo they chose on
splitting from AT&T to be odd, and we spent quite some time talking
about it.  

Had I, for some reason, been unable to *grab* that logo and ask about
it, the discussion probably would not have taken place; I would have
been the poorer for that.

But that's me.  We are not designing just for me, and I loudly echo 
L. Kasaday's:
