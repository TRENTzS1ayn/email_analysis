LQ::  They're misguided if they think the Web is a visual medium.

Why is there so much effort here to describe to a non-visual user what a
page looks like, but no desire to describe to a non-aural user what a page
sounds like?  I think the answer is that a lot of people consider the Web a
visual medium, and that's the wrong approach to solving the accessibility
problem.

LQ::  I didn't intend it that way.  I view Cascading Style Sheets as a
frill, but they are a frill that I value strongly.

LQ::  Even if what the person wants would hurt the accessibility and
usability of the Web?
