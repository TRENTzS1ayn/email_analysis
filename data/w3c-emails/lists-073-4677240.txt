Liam: "Why is there so much effort here to describe to a non-visual user
what a page looks like, but no desire to describe to a non-aural user
what a page sounds like?"

WL:: the "desire" is quite specifically addressed in the guidelines. 
The real reasons are: 1) Most Web Sites don't "sound"; 2) the attention
given to people with visual impairments in our discussions is because
Windows attempted to disenfranchise them from the computer election and
despite Liam's frequent protestations to the contrary the Web has become
a decidedly "visual" medium in the sense that so many designers are hung
up on appearances - therefor the continuing imperative to emphasize the
divorce of "content" from "presentation", even though the marriage
between the two makes their individual identities somewhat fuzzy.
