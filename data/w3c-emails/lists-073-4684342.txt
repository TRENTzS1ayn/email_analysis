The other case which Al did not account for (and nor have I in thinking 
about OBJECT before, but I will be working on it Monday ;) is where users 
are not viewing any images etc to speed their browsing, but still want to 
know when to pick up an image. A link to the image inside the content of 
the object would be very helpful for such users, as well as a link to the 
description.
