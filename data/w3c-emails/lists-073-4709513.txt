LRK:: If you provide a seamless page with the option of displaying
the visual aspects, how does that hurt the accessibility and usability of
the web?

By the way, just to reveal a personal preferance, I prefer to watch
non-English films with subtitles instead of films which dub into English to
attempt a seamless presentation.    It particularly annoys me to discover a
film is dubbed without being told.
