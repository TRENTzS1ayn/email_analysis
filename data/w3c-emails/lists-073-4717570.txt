LQ::  It doesn't.  That's why I've been arguing for it.  I'm just concerned
with those who would rather force the visual descriptions on everyone (or
at least on all non-visual users).

LQ::  It seems like you're saying that Web pages presented in non-visual
environments have been dubbed and that the natural medium for Web pages is
visual.  I'll assume that I'm misinterpreting your analogy.

There is no dubbing required for presenting a Web page seamlessly in
non-visual environments.  The point of seamless accessibility is that the
page adjusts naturally to all browsing environments.  The non-English film
dubbed into English is not seamless.
