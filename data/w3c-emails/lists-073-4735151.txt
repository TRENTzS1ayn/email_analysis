The W3C agrees with you.

I think that if you review the Proposed Recommendation for 
SMIL you will find it supports that scenario well.

OBJECT in HTML 4 gives you an ordered fallback sequence but
SWITCH in SMIL 1 gives you a range of choices.  And a few
presentation-wide logicals which mean you don't have to walk
through all videos turning on captions, for example.
