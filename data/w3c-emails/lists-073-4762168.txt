Len writes: "Anyway, that's how I feel.  But really, how I feel or how
any other sighted person feels about this is irrelevant.  The only
relevant thing is that there are some people who are blind or have low
vision want the descriptions, and therefore they ought to have the
option to get them, while not be forced to do so.  I think everyone
would agree with that?"
