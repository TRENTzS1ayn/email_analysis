Greetings,
I can tell you all this: I spent the entire weekend fighting with 
FrontPage, trying to get it to import a page that was made originally 
with FP without messing up the formatting. I was completely unsuccessful. 
I have never had a positive experience with the import tool in FP, and, 
if one doesn't use one of the FP "themes," working with FP is quite 
difficult.
