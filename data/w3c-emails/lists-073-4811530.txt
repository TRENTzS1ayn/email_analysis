I thought you would be interested to know that the American Bar
Association has invited me to discuss ADA issues as well as web
accessibility at their national conference in Washington DC next month.  It
will be held June 17-19 and according to the press release, "Prominent
policy makers and legal experts from across the mental and physical
disability communities will convene at this three day national conference to
set comprehensive goals for a national agenda on disability law and policy."
The conference is entitled "In Pursuit...A Blueprint for Disability Law and
Policy."  See http://www.abanet.org/cle/programs/n98bdl.html

My participation is on the closing panel charged to develop the
blueprint on disability law and policy for the next millennium.  At the
request of the Bar, I have submitted a brief paper entitled "Applying the
ADA to the Internet:  A Web Accessibility Standard."  It discusses legal
incentives for web accessibility and includes the United States Department
of Justice Policy Ruling that accessibility requirements apply to the
internet as well as the Office of Civil Rights, United States Department of
Education internet legal analysis.  It also refers to my support of the work
of the WAI by the W3C.

The article will be available in the conference materials as well as
afterwards in the Continuing Legal Education of the Bar materials.  When I
have found someone willing to post it on their web site, I will forward the
url.

The conference is open to the public and meets mandatory continuing
legal education accreditation from all states requiring continuing legal
education for the Bar. 

Lastly, the conference kicks off on Capitol Hill with a
congressional reception and will cover eight substantive law panels:
Children and Youth; Health; Access to the Courts and Justice; Criminal
Issues; Housing and Community Support; Education; Treatment and Habilitation
and Employment.  The final closing panel on the last day will then pull the
discussion together and develop the national blueprint for disability law
and policy.
