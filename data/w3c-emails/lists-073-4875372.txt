For the first question, use relative links instead of absolute links.
For example, use
<a href="site-map.html" title="Link to DBRA Site Map Page."><img 
src="images/buttons/site-map.gif" border="0" alt="Link to Site Map." 
WIDTH="90" HEIGHT="25"></a>
instead of
<a href="http://www.dol.gov/dol/disclaim.htm" title="Link to Department of 
Labor Disclaimer."><img src="images/buttons/disclaim.gif" border="0" 
alt="Link to Disclaimer." WIDTH="90" HEIGHT="25"></a>

  The second question should (note should) be moot as the web is designed 
to be cross platform / platform independant.  However, there may be 
differences in user agents (ie web browsers) that I am not aware for 
disabled users.  Hope this helps.

Subject:  HTML to CD-ROM

I have an unusual question: I designed an accessible web page using
Netscape Composer, and I would like to put the whole web on a CD-ROM for
distribution to clients who either have disabilities themselves or work
with people who have disabilities. The parts of this process that are
puzzling me are the following:

1. I have no way of knowing what drive letter each user has assigned to
their CD-ROMs. How do I structure the links on my page in the CD-ROM
version without this knowledge?

2. How can I make the CD accessible to both Mac and PC users?

I appreciate any wisdom that you all can send my way about this issue!
Thanks!
