Ummm, it's a good idea. But if Bill Clinton says 'It shall be SO', then 
it makes not one jot of difference to the 5.75 billion of us who are not 
in the USA (possibly not even some Canadians). It's that 'World Wide' 
bit in the phrase. Tim B-L, because he's not seen as an American 
Imperialist, and Bill Gates, because he's seen as an Imperialist over the 
US as well as the rest of us, would be good people to have embrace this. 
For the rest, places like ASEAN, CIS, EU, OAS (does it still exist?) and 
UN are the sort of fora to which we should be looking if these things are 
really important. In practical terms the approach should probably be 
through national governments, of course.
