Trained technical staff with expertise in the field is what the WAI 
groups are. We are not perfect, but nor is Clinton the perfect President, 
or Bill Gates the greatest imaginable CEO. We have to work with what we have

This is the real reason. Adherence to the Guidelines is a good first test 
of a website, but does not actually guarantee Accessibility. The reason 
why these sort of issues are decided by common law rather than statute in 
Australia is because there are too many grey areas to frame satisfactory 
legislation. Certainly reference to the guidelines can be made to answer 
certain questions, but the document is not, and probably should not, be a 
part of legislation. On the other hand I would applaud companies stating 
it as policy that they should adhere to the guidelines, since there is 
not the same possibilty of recourse to legal sanction which may be 
erroneously applied through ignorance or inadequacy of the guidelines.

None of these are actual reasons why William's idea is bad, just 
arguments which will be produced in an attempt to stymie it.

The answer CAN be as simple as somebody with authority saying 'make it 
so' which will provide the impetus for accessibility to become a major 
issue, ahead of the decision between animated flames and bouncing balls 
as the best decoration for a page. As we all understand, from being a 
major issue to successful implementation is a long road, but there is 
nothing in principle wrong with a push-start along that road.
