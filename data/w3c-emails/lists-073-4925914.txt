Yes, but not everyone has access to the WAI groups.  The average
company cannot simply expect to have you or me at their beck
and call; I, for one, don't come _that_ cheaply, even for things
I believe in. :)

We are in agreement here.

Not a reason why it's _bad_, but a reason why it's unrealistic.
All of the above are very real business decisions, made for perfectly
legitimate reasons within some company, government, or other
organization by the people whose job it is to make those
decisions.

As much as you or I may want this to be a priority for everyone,
it simply _won't_ be the number one priority for most people.  They
have different goals, different objectives, and it is not the
place of a bunch of mostly-academic very smart web geeks working
with the W3C to make those business decisions for them.

That's all it takes?  I doubt it.  It's one thing to expect
accessibility before bouncing balls; it's another to demand that
it be the HIGHEST priority, and to expect companies to value it
as much we do and invest a great deal of time and money into
making it so.

Question for you:  How many millions of dollars should the U.S.
government spend on this project, were Bill Clinton to simply
say "make it so"?  Do you have any idea?  How many man-hours (or
woman-hours!), training courses, new software, contractors, and
whatever else would have to be paid for?

You and I may be able to sit back and say "well, hey, it's worth
it, because accessibility is Good" -- but it's not our money (less
yours than mine, even, since I pay U.S. taxes :) ) -- and we're
not the ones who have to prioritize a budget.

So, I'm not saying the idea is a bad one in principle.  I'm all
for it, theoretically.  But practically and realistically, it
isn't nearly as easy as just finding the right World Leader to
make a speech and order people around; accessibility is not
free.  It will cost someone something to do.  If we're not the
ones paying the cost, I don't believe we have the right to decide
that the cost is worth it.
