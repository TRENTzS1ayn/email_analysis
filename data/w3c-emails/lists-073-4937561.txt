Well, I finally started something! <cat-like smirk>

Kynn: "That's all it takes?  I doubt it.  It's one thing to expect
accessibility before bouncing balls; it's another to demand that
it be the HIGHEST priority, and to expect companies to value it
as much we do and invest a great deal of time and money into
making it so."

WL:: Of course there are copout arguments raised about this but to
accept that it will "cost millions" to begin posting accessible
materials on such and such a date (skip retrofitting for the moment) is
absolutely absurd.  If the people making these websites are so lame they
can't incorporate a few criteria into their ritual, they are incompetent
to be doing this work.  This is going to happen and by putting some
pressure on we can accelerate the arrival of the "when" of it.  Even if
the "edict" just sends a message of "get ready" it's worth doing.
