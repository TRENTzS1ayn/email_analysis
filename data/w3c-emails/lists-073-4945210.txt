HEh.

"Copout"?  No, these are the types of business decisions that
people who have "influence" -- the ones you want to reach --
have to make every day.

No it's not.  If you question the "millions", then can you provide
a better estimate of cost?  How much _will_ it cost to produce
this?

Surprise -- these people _are_ incompetent!  Well, in general, most
web designers are definitely incompetent when it comes to accessible
web design.  That's part of our problem.  People aren't just 
_choosing_ to "not make accessible pages"; they're ignorant, both
of the issues and of how to address them.  There's a lot of work
that needs to be done, even among "expert" web designers (let alone
those who are less than expert).

Well, I could agree with a "get ready" message, but in general, I
don't let politicians tell me what I "need" to learn in my
profession. :)
