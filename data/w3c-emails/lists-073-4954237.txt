HotWired's WebMonkey department, which focuses on web design issues, has
begun a three-part series on web accessibility. Written by Matt Margolin,
the series looks at the legal issues of web accessibility, as well as
delving into the features of HTML 4 and CSS. At this writing, the first two
parts have been published, totalling ten pages.

Although the material on HTML and CSS will probably be boringly familiar to
those who care, the legal background (covered in part one) is an interesting
overview, and may be a useful pointer to show web publishers who don't get
the problem, and/or don't understand their legal obligations.

You can find part one here:
