Judy Brewer announced the Braille work we are starting as follows:

"The WAI Protocols & Formats Working Group (PF WG) is setting up
a sub-group within the overall PF framework, to propose
recommendations to the CSS and style properties working group,
and to the XSL working group, and to consider Braille use in
other Web technologies as appropriate.  Look for further info
from the PF WG on this."

The purpose is to make the Web a platform for flexible and fluent
use of Braille as a document medium.
