Is it conceptually possible to make a "Filtered Interface REgistry" that
would function as a "poor person's firewall", interpose an internally
maintained proxy server with a registry of all one's name, address, etc.
and properly secured credit card stuff so that a conforming interactive
forms submission on a Web site could (at the whim of the client) access
all that information without one having to repeatedly be entering
"William Baldridge Loughborough..." (with a surname as long as mine this
becomes a main reason for having wanted a computer in the first place!)?

If such a feature became ubiquitous it might help accessibility.
