Probably so.  By the way, have you tried the Opera browser?
(Currently available only for Windows machines, both 3.X and
95/NT.)  It has the ability to enter your information, including
your name, address, phone number, etc., into the browser, and
then quickly and easily paste that into any text field form.
The way I do it is with a right-click and then a select, but
I imagine there are probably keyboard shortcuts too, knowing
how Opera is put together.  (Lots of keyboard commands.)
