sorry, I missed it, what was your credit card information <grin>
seriously though, isn't this bound up somehow in something you can get
like a certificate?
some sites cdnow for instance will provide you with an auto login allowing
for the information you describe and much much more to be filled in only
once and never again unless you need to change something.
