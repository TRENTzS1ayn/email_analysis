Yes, these facts can be saved for you by a remote server, and
they can be remembered for you by your PC.  If you let somebody
else remember this stuff, there are security and privacy issues.
If these facts are going to be remembered on lots of PCs by
software from competing companies, there are data definition
issues.

That's the point of defining an e-commerce schema using something
like RDF so that all web tools would have a sufficiently
interoperable idea of the data fields that go into a retail sales
transaction, and whether you were operating from Quicken,
CitiBank, Opera or whoever, the associations (through the schema)
of the fields in the commercial website and the remembered
personal profile in your cache somewhere would auto-fill those
things that you had filled in on some other form.
