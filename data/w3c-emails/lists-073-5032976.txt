I saw a nice quote on a Shockwave list about the BBC site ...

"You can create a good website for a thousand dollars. You can create a
good website for ten thousand dollars. You can create a good website for
one hundred thousand dollars. Unfortunately you can also create a bad
website for a thousand dollars. You can also create a bad website for ten
thousand dollars. You can even create a bad website for one hundred
thousand dollars."

Replace 'good' and 'bad' with 'accessible' and 'inaccessible'. Enough said. 

>"Personally, I have tended to feel that their website consistently goes for
>'showing how clever their designers are' rather than taking an interest in
>providing a *useful* and widely accessible service. For example, the way
>they always leap on the latest things ('Frames', 'JavaScript', etc) in a way
>that block access to some people and their apparent assumption that the only
>OS in the world is Windoze."

Unfortunately there are methods of 'failing gracefully' in terms of
functionality (eg to no Java) which are not well known. Also unfortunately,
the folk who designed the BBC website had no idea about browser variety,
let alone plugins and renderers for accessibility.

Anyone run Bobby over the site ? Horrible. Even the first page
(http://www.bbc.co.uk/home/today/index.shtml) is filled with errors.
