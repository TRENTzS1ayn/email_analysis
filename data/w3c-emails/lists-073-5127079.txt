Please take a look at JAWS for Windows 3.2 and its internet reformatting
capabilities with Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.01. I think that you
will be quite impressed. JFW 3.2 is in the final beta stage now, and
will be shipping mid-month. You can find an internet reformatting demo
at http://www.hj.com/JFW/JFWIE.html. 
 
I would truly apprecite your feedback. 

Sincerely, 

Wilson Craig
