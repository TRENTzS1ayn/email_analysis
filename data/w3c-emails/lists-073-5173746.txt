I agree fully.  Please do not waste our time and abuse the group.  On top 
of that, it is a waste of the advertisers time also.  A sensible person 
would realize that the WORLD WIDE web isn't restricted to Lake County.

I would appreciate it if you would not send advertisements through the W3C 
mailing list. Using the mailing
list as a means of cheap advertising defeats the purpose of having a 
subject-based discussion group.
Thanks--I hope that others share my feelings on this matter.
