As chair of the User Agent Work Group I invite members of the WAI interest
group to review the current working draft of the User Agent Guidelines.
This is one of three sets of guidelines being developed by the W3C Web
Accessibility Initiative (WAI).  The other two are Page Author Guidelines
and Authoring Tools Guidelines.  The working draft for User Agent
Guidelines can be found at:

http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/wai-ua-browser.html

Please review the draft and send any comments or questions to the User
Agent Work Group (www-wai-ua@w3.org) by Thursday, June 11th.

One areas of special concern are the ratings of importance of the items in
the working draft.  We want to have a minimal set of prority 1 items, since
browser developers will focus on these items first.  If there is a large
number of priority 1 items, many developers may say that they cannot do all
of them so they will pick and choose the items they will implement.  Their
choices may not be the most important.  So we want to limit the priority 1
items to the most important to implement for accessibility.

Look forward to your comments,
Jon
