Jon: "So we want to limit the priority 1 items to the most important to
implement for accessibility."

WL:: In the AU WG we were faced with such reluctance on the part of
vendors that we decided to focus on 1 (*ONE*) "priority 1" item:
ALT="text".  In the case of browsers, this should not be quite as
necessary but since the working draft has (I believe) over 20 it is
probably time to get a sense of what we can realistically expect
cooperation on.  My feeling is that if we focus on how central
everything connected with implementation of CSS2 is to the thrust of our
effort (and the chance of making a real difference), we should emphasize
the earliest focus on that, partly to avoid the browser makers from
getting caught up in DHTML, XML, etc. to the exclusion of the one ray of
hope that has emerged to drive a wedge between marking up for
presentation and content.  By putting pressure on CSS2 implementation we
have a realistic goal for them and that would IMHO yield the greatest
effect overall.

The draft just looks too big and elaborate - if we are writing for the
people who write software, I think they can get the gist of the idea
with a much terser presentation.  What I miss is the equivalent of the
"check list" where the ideas are: less numerous; more succinct.  Anyway,
that's my "vote."
