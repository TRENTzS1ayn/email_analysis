Several people have already gotten back and located the Henter Joyce group
for me relative to the TV news story I listed-- they never mentioned the
software by name or I would have known where to look-- thanks for the info
everyone.

You know TV people, they have to make everything sound totally brand new or
it can't be on TV!
