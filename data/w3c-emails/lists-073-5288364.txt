I hope that this isn't a terribly ignorant question, but I'm interested
in putting forms on my department's web site, and I'm worried about how
to make the forms accessible. Is that possible? I was planning on using
FrontPage to do it, but I gave up on FP when I ran into formatting
problems with it's import feature. I will probably end up writing the
forms in VB Script. Any ideas or URLs with info about this would be very
helpful. Thanks!
