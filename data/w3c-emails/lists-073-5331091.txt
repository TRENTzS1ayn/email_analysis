HTML forms are accessible for nearly all browsers (assuming the brrowser is 
reasonably accessible in the first place). VB Script is not. Not even nearly.

But the answer would involve using something other than FP it seems, or 
drawing up your page in FP and then fixing it using Notepad or something.

This seems to be a standard thing in accessible design - until the tools
are a LOT better, learning HTML is at some level pretty necessary. Lucky 
it's pretty simple.
