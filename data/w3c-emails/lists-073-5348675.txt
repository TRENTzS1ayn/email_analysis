Chuck said
'Whoa, hang on a minute...'

So I'd better clarify...
VB (and Javascript and Java) are far from universally supported. This 
provides an accessibility problem even before considering what is 
actually done. Chuck is quite right - using HTML to write a form is not a 
guarantee that it will be accessible, but it is a step towards being more 
certain.

There are a whole raft of issues that need to be considered, but the 
point was that by relying on scripts inside pages there will be a raft of 
users locked out by the technology. 

My comments were not meant to stand as a guide to what makes stuff 
accessible, but were just a response to what immediately struck me as the 
biggest accessiblity concern in the approach outlined. Detailed 
explanations available on application - but I guess this disclaimer is a 
bit late.

cheers

Charles
