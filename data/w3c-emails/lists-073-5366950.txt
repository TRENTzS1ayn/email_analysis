Yes, there is an MSIE 2 (I use it reasonably often because it is nice and 
small), and it does work with forms.

Actually I assume there is an MSIE 1 as well, but I have never heard of 
it. But then I never heard of DOS 1 - the oldest versions I new of were 
2.11 and Apple DOS 3.2

Forms run through CGI scripts are almost universally supported (except 
they can't be put onto CD's without a lot of work). I think the ISINDEX 
thing is older, but the experts would have to confirm that.
