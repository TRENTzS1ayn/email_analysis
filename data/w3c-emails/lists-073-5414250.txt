Henter-Joyce's JAWS for Windows 3.2 includes functions for reformatting
web pages with Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.01 that solve many of the
problems that blind people have when surfing the web. 

By reformatting the page to exclude non-linked, non alt-tagged graphic
images, placing all text in one column on the left side of the page and
placing the word "link" before each link, the program makes MOST web
pages easily accessible. 

At any time, you may bring all links on the page up in an easy-to use,
alphabetical list box that also tells you how many links are on the
page. The tools on the tool bar are displayed in a list box with another
keystroke. 

The functions described here are also applicable to Microsoft Outlook
Express e-mail. 

Please visit the Henter-Joyce web site at
http://www.hj.com/JFW/JFWIE.html to read more about this product. I
apologize for using this list as a marketing tool, and I do so with
reservation, but this product addresses many of the problems that are
discussed here on a regular basis.
