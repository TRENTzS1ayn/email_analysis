I would not be in favor of abandoning developpment of good practice
policy development or implimentation because of any effort no matter how
outstanding and this one truly is, that effort might be to render access
to a particular segment of any population.

In my day to day activities, I have contact with many individuals who's
lives would be so much simpler if only a document producer or web
page/site author made a small change here or there or began their work
with access in mind.
