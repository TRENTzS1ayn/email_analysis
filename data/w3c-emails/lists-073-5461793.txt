The UA Guidelines editors have published a new  draft of the guidelines at

The document 
is also reachable from the UA Group page [2]. Note:   We have not yet created
the Postscript or PDF versions.

This draft incorporates most of the suggestions and comments send to the UA
mailing list 
(as well as some comments sent to other WAI mailing lists). The complete list
of changes in this 
document is located at [3].

We intend to release this draft as a public Working Draft according to the W3C
process. This means (among other things) that as soon as the Director approves
its publication, it will be announced to the Press and linked from the
Technical Reports page [4].

Please note that this is only a Working Draft, which means that W3C and the WG
expect it to change. Here is the disclaimer from the Status section of this
draft [1]:

<BLOCKQUOTE> 
This is a W3C Working Draft for review by W3C members and other 
interested parties. It is a draft document and may be updated, 
replaced or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is 
inappropriate to use W3C Working Drafts as reference material or to 
cite them as other than "work in progress". This is work in 
progress and does not imply endorsement by, or the consensus of, 
either W3C or members of the WAI User Agent (UA) working group.</P> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The goal of a public release of a Working Draft is to harvest feedback from a
larger audience. As this document is a work in progress, we will incorporate
structural and content changes in the coming months, until the WG feels the
document is stable enough to be submitted to the Director as a Proposed
Recommendation. 
(For details about the Recommendation Process, please consult [5].)
