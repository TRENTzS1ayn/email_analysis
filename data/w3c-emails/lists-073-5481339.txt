Dear IG members,

From Universitat de Valencia E.G., we have translated into Spanish the
document PAGEAUTH-0414 about WAI Accessibility Guidelines: Page Authoring
(W3C Working Draft, 14-Apr-1998).

The URL is http://acceso.uv.es/accesibilidad/estudio/PAGEAUTH-0414.htm and
it is part of a comprehensive report in Spanish about web accessibility
which can be found at http://acceso.uv.es/accesibilidad/estudio/

We have tried to follow to the maximum extent the guidelines for
translation and reproduction as especified in W3C copyright page and
copyright FAQ. If you find any mistake or incorrection please let me know.

We felt that this translation was necesary in order to promote
accessibility awareness between the Spanish speaking web community, bearing
in mind that many of us are not so fluent in English. We intend to keep
translating next versions of guidelines, specially when it becomes a W3C
official recommendation.

Best regards,

Rafael Romero.
