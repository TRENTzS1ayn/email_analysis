It is not appropriate to use SCOPE and HEADERS for layout tables.
These are to be used when one cell (de_facto header) gives
generic inforation about one or more other cells.  Pure layout
tables don't have these logical relationships between cells in
the grid.

For nested tables, I would have to see what it is used
for to comment.

For column or row groups you may use AXIS to construct a category
hierarchy.  That is, use AXIS if you have second-order metadata
visible in the table.

Yes, it is about alternate views.  It was supported by the WAI
reviewers, not invented by them.  Alternate views have proved
helpful in audio browsing of complex tables in some (not
exhaustive) experiments.

All the HC work is still public.  If you don't find what you want
in terms of a life-size example in the final HTML 4 language, you
may find it helpful to review the discussion for some
interpretation.

This just gives you a rough orientation to the general ideas.
This is a good topic for the page authoring subgroup list.
