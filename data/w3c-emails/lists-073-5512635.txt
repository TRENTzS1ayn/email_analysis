Hiya.

I have followed this listserv now for several months. As a non-tech
person, I struggle with a lot of what I have read because it often assumes
I have knowledge I don't have. I'm not giving up, though, because I want
to understand the new standards and how to implement them.

I will have the job of educating several hundred people to meet those
standards. My first job will be convincing those several hundred people
that accessibility is important but, somehow, that job seems easy compared
to understanding 1) the standards, 2) how to implement them, and 3) the
esoteric language often used on this listserv.

Please bear with me. Ironically, I am finding that my ignorance is denying
me accessibility to learning about accessibility.</whine>
