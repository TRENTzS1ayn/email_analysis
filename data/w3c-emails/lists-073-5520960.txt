Thank you for speaking up.  The situation you describe is just
how it is.  Please bear with us.  We have an Education and
Outreach team working feverishly to develop materials which will
make "the message of Web accessibility" accessible to the general
Web user.

Please forgive a certain amount of techno-babble on this list.  We
have to use this list when it is not clear which specialized
group should handle a particular idea.  So here you will get all
levels of traffic from novice to specialist.
