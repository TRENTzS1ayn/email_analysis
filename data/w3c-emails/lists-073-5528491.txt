Concerning nested tables: 
SCOPE and HEADERS can refer only to cells of 
the _same_ table in which they appear. 
A nested table is a content of a cell of a table. It is impossible to 
refer to it from a cell of the nesting table exactly as it is impossible
to refer to a list or a paragraph in a particular cell.

Regards.
