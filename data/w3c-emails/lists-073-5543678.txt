Tom, you are a key resource.

Over the years, I have found that the people with the answers
don't understand what the right questions are.

The Usenet FAQs are good tutorial literature because they are
organized around the questions that people actually ask.

One of the key strengths of the WAI is bringing people together
from very different backgrounds.  Nobody is going to understand
every message on first reading.  The reason we have an email
list is not to publish final material but to have conversations.
If a message is confusing, please ask a clarifying question.

Honest, we do a _lot_ of this on the WAI-PF list, too.  The 
experts don't understand one another until they ping-pong
a few messages.
