If you would like to unsubscribe from the w3c-wai-ig@w3.org mailing list,
send mail to:

  w3c-wai-ig-request@w3.org

and put "unsubscribe" in your subject line,

rather than sending a message to the mailing list itself.

You don't need to put anything in the body of the message.

If you have a question or comment to the list managers, please mail to
jbrewer@w3.org or danield@w3.org directly, rather than to the list.

Thank you,

Judy
