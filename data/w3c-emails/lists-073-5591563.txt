Is there a typo? Isn't "Dalmatian"  spelled with an "o" .  I have a 
dalmation and this kit is NOT everything you need to train a dalmation. 
 Anyone who owns these wonderful spotted wonder (hyper ) dogs will tell you 
that you need "cookies."  They ain't stupid and they refuse to listen 
unless there is a treat involved!   They love human contact and really get 
upset and destructive if you leave them alone!  It has taken ten years (and 
an unfortunate surgery, see http://www.neuticles.com/index.html/Tp10e.htm) 
to get him to calm down.  Now he just throws pillows and, if the trash is 
down, will spread it through the house....need I say more.

Sorry, its Friday and I couldn't resist!  So my apologies to the serious 
types...rob
