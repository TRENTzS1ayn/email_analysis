Many here will know that lynx with a screen reader can be misleading.  When there is a table with 2 or more links across the screen horizontally, and I ask my synthesizer for the current word, it usually tells me I am on the item preceeding the item that lynx is really at as the present hot link.

Is there any way to handle the table to avoid this or is this just something we blind users need to live with.

I live with it ok, but would like to construct a page that would let novices avoid this confusion.
