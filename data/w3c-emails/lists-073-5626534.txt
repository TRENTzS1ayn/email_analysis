>Is there a typo? Isn't "Dalmatian"  spelled with an "o" .

Sorry, Rob--these puppies originated in Dalmatia, a province of Austria on
the Eastern shore of the coast of Venice.

Please tell me you didn't spend money on neuticles! That would indeed be
unfortunate.  It is, however, fortunate that you did have him neutered!  He
should be, unless he is such a perect specimen that he could be used as
part of a breeding program to improve the dalmatian breed.


Have fun with your spotted dog--
