Hi,

The possibility of submitting a form by pressing enter even though
the focus is not on the submit button, is very important. By behaving
this way IE4 saves keyboard users a lot of keystrokes in big forms
lets say with 8 controls. The first control is the important edit
field and the following 6 controls are of less importance. Because IE
let's you submit the form when the first field is filled in you as a
keyboard user does not have to use the tab key 6 times to get to the
submit button. The only other way to accomplish this is to use
accesskeys in forms, and then the user has to know wich keys are
assigned to the controls.

Regards

Claus Th?gersen
