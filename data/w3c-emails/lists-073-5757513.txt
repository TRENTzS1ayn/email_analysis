One approach which might work equally well for the mouse-free and 
eyes-free modes of use would be if there were standard "review"
and "submit" methods for FORMs.

Review would get you a compact presentation of all the current
field values that would be submitted should you submit, and place
the focus on a submit element [or equivalently, arm the
"submit" command, if it is not always available in a FORM.]

Submit would also be a browser verb, equivalent to a macro which
does the hotkey for the submit element and then activates the
submit.

This is applying hierarchy to online transaction processing.  It
is something like the story about how DIV is a better structuring
device than Hn.  

There are more consumers who are tripped up by forms than just
eyes-free consumers.  Some set of operations that work on the
FORM structure as a unit, and include "review" might be able to
reduce customer complaint levels across the board, and build
consumer trust in electronic commerce.  It is certainly the way
responsible telephone order takers work.
