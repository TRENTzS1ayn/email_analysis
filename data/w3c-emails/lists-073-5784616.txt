ACE FRIENDS:  
On July 7, 1998 the Federal Web Consortium is sponsoring a one day
Universal Access seminar at the NIH Natcher Center in Bethesda, Md.  This is
a free seminar and registration is required. You can register for the
Universal Access seminar (and two other free seminars on web security and
digital libraries, scheduled for later this summer) at:

Universal Access Seminar Description: Meeting the Challenge of Web
Accessibility for Everyone

Citizens expect this powerful media to work for everyone, including people
with disabilities. Agency heads have a mandate to ensure government
services and information are readily available to everyone. Learn about the
best current initiatives and approaches in Federal agencies for solving web
accessibility problems at this practical seminar. Listen to nationally
known accessibility experts (including W3C members) discuss built-in
capabilities and tools that are currently available or in development.
Leave with the practical resources and policy background you've needed to
confidently meet your agencies' access requirements.
