Section 508 of the Rehab Act requires that federal agencies not buy
inaccessible.  It's not much of a reach for that to apply to Web
Authoring Tools *and their output*.  If a word processor or whatever has
the "facility" to produce inaccessible code as a by-product of its "save
as markup" feature, it should not be acceptable for federal purchase??
