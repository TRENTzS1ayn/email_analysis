With this message I withdraw my nomitation for the coordination
group. I do not think it is useful to continue a nomitation
that will apparently not carry out.
Because of holidays in Europe I will not be able to join
WAI meetings in UK. I'd like to express this will not have
any influence of other WAI work.

A more detailed explanation will be send to the W3C WAI coordinator.

Best regards,
Jaap
