Dears,

I'm a Web Consultant and Macromedia User Group Leader.
My group are developing one solution for visual impaired and
blindness. The project still on start. The solution consist on 
three steps:

1) Localization
Every site wich support blindness must create and put a 
blindness version of site at:
http://www.yourdomain.com/blindness 

2) At home page one audio / visual pin sign this site has
a blindness support, this audio /visual pin links to
http://www.yourdomain.com/blindness 

3) Take a look of complete release (english and Portuguese)
and a live example, and leave a comment / suggestion on our
project forum. 
http://www.flash-brasil.com.br/blindness  
please use "guest" as login and password.

On release you will found some comment about
DOSVox , this is a solution developed here on Brasil 
to read and allow writing blindness persons. With 
this resources blindness persons help us on the 
project.

This first idea was developed before official SMIL 
release, now I think this sollution must addapted to
SMIL.

Please let me know what you think about this, if you
aggree, disagree. If you found consistence or not.
If there was some visual impaired on this mailing list
let us know your comment, it's much important to
the project.

Finnaly, the project is free and we will share the solution
with tutorial to anybody. 

With best regards,
