I would prefer the whole site be accessible, not just a segregated
segment or separate set of pages. My fear for your approach is that 
different versions get out of synchronization.

That is more inclusive than requiring the selection of a text-only
version on each page. I expect that user preferences will be
adequately provided through behaviors, that can be used to tailor
what a server delivers to the user agent's expressed desire.

From my limited experience with shockwave over a year ago, it made heavy 
use of graphics, particularly for glitzy dynamic textual material.  
I hope but do not know that you only use it to demo the alternative
accessible material. I am unwilling to use or arbitrarily allow a 
shockwave tool onto my system. Your site requires it, so is therefore 
inaccessible to me.
