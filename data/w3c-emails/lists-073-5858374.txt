Interesting idea. It could be helpful for people with low vision, but
requiring people who are fully blind to randomly move a mouse around in
hopes of hitting a link or some text is a bit impractical.

How would a blind person know if they had found all of the info or
whether there is more info they have missed on the screen -- or worse
yet OFF the screen if the window needs to be scrolled down? If a blind
user finds a link once but searches to see what else is on the screen,
how long will it take to find a link the second time -- assuming the
user can remember what it was?

Is there a thorough, practical keyboard access method I missed?

Good luck. Keep working on it.
