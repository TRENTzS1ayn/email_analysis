Dear WAI Interest Group Participants,

Calls for participation for two WAI groups related to evaluation tools follow.

Regards,

Judy

--------------

Attached are Calls for Participation for two new Web Accessibility
Initiative (WAI) groups:

 - WAI Evaluation & Repair [ER] Tools Working Group
 - WAI Evaluation & Repair [ER] Tools Interest Group

These groups will address tools used to evaluate and improve accessibility
of the Web.  Proposed charters for both groups are available for review at
the URLs listed below.

If you have any questions or need further information, please contact
Daniel Dardailler, WAI Project Manager (danield@w3.org), or Judy Brewer,
WAI Domain Leader (jbrewer@w3.org).

Calls for Participation -- WAI Evaluation & Repair Tools Working Group and
Interest Group:

As an essential step after improving accessibility of Web technologies and
producing best practices guidelines, evaluation is a vital stage in
accessible design. The Web Accessibility Initiative is establishing two
groups to address the creation of tools to evaluate the accessibility of
Web sites, repair elements that are not accessible, and coordinate
prototyping or development work as needed in the area of accessibility
validation.

The groups propose to start their work via email, with first face-to-face
meetings towards the end of July.

Procedure 

  1. Read the two proposed charters at
     http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/charter-er-ig
     http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/charter-er-wg

  2. Before 24:00 GMT 29 July 1998, fill out the form below and send it to:
     Working Group: <wai-er-wg-participate@w3.org>
     or
     Interest Group: <wai-er-ig-participate@w3.org>

-------------

Executive summary

  These two groups are the "ER Working Group" (WAI-ER-WG) and the "ER
  Interest Group" (WAI-ER-IG). These groups will work together toward
  a W3C/WAI "toolkit" that will be offered to people who create and
  maintain Web sites and people experiencing difficulties while using
  the Web. The toolkit will contain stand-alone tools as well as
  modules that can be incorporated into other Web authoring tools.

  ER-WG will consist of those people who are actually creating and
  writing the toolkit. Members of this group will implement the tools
  based on input from the interest group (see below), Web authors, and
  the availability of funded or volunteer programmers.

  ER-IG will systematically collect feedback from potential tool and
  Web users, discuss issues around evaluation and repair, and provide
  input to the working group.

  Relevant to this group is an existing tools list available at
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/existingtools
