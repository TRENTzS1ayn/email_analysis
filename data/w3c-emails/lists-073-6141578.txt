From Smith-Kettlewell Institute:
--------------------------------------------------
Re graphics: A picture is worth 10K words -- but only those to describe
the picture.  Hardly any sets of 10K words can be adequately described
with pictures.
------------------------------------------------------------
More pictures can be described with words than words with pictures.

Love.
