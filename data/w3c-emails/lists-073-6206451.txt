I posted the article because it highlighted an issue that is relevant to 
this group and has already been identified by a previous poster:  when 
does this work of developing standards, tools, designs, guidelines, and 
protocols turn into a de facto process of developing public policy?  the 
article and the concerns raised are not so much about pics but the 
process and means used to develop and implement the standard

Parts of the WAI seem to have some public policy components.  It may be 
helpful to clarify these areas and identify if the w3c and the wai is the 
appropriate forum for those things.
