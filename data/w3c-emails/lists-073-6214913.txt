Double oops.  Totally agreed.  As my first introduction to PICS came via 
the thread-initiating message, I assumed that the topic fell within the 
parameters of 'web accesibility'.  I should have kept better track of 
which mailing list was for what purpose.

I have found a PICS mailing list, "pics-info@w3.org".  At first sight it 
would appear to be devoted to information and requests for clarification 
about the technical aspects of PICS.  I will make inquiries.  Since this 
would appear to be the first time W3C activities have directly raised 
ethical questions, there may not yet be an appropriate forum.

With regards to copyright, it is most likely that the transcription of 
the article falls within the fair use provisions;  it is certianly within 
the spirit, if not the letter.

If one of the other miscreants finds a better forum than pics-info, would 
that person please e-mail me.
