It may be of interest, given that PICS is under discussion, to note that
there has been some consideration of its use as a means of labeling web
sites with respect to their degree of accessibility to people with
disabilities. How useful do members of this group think that such labels,
particularly if they were made by a party other than the creator of the
site, would be to people with disabilities? Would it be helpful to have
the option of restricting search engines or other tools just to sites
which possess a high accessibility rating? What other applications of PICS
content labels would be useful in the area of accessibility? Should the
WAI develop a PICS labeling system with which web sites could be
classified?
