I don t think that any automated tool alone can make that kind of judgement.
Anything that restricts the flow of information is pernicious as far as I am
concerned.  To me the first level of accessibility is being able to get to
the site...if the tool says NOPE this site is not accessible, does that mean
that valuable information is not there?

Anything that automatically restricts access to information chills me to my
soul.  The expostulations that I am being paranoid do not comfort me in the
least.  The weight of historical evidence supports the conclusion that
censorship in any form is not a good thing.

Sincerely
Mike Burks
