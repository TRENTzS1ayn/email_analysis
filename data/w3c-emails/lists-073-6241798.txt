A PICS-label bureau based on accessibility would be a useful thing, I 
suspect. Since one of the things that creates accessibility problems is 
lack of allowance for people not using high-bandwidth applications like 
Java or pictures, it could double as a way of promoting good design. Many 
people who have no apparent access problems choose not to download such 
things for the time it takes. If this could be translated into research 
which showed that people were filtering out poorly designed websites, 
there would be an incentive in the market to improve the overall standard 
of design. After all it takes about the same amount of effort to do 
something badly as it does to do it well.
