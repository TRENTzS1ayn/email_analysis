Chris pointed to one of the major problems. Authoring tools are not 
really designed with accesibility in mind, and too many website authors 
simply do not understand the principles of good design.

It is NOT harder to maker a site accessible than to make it without 
caring. It IS harder to fix it afterwards, although (as suggested) often 
not much harder.

An interesting fact I obtained when working as the webmaster for RMIT 
University, one of Australia's largest (42 000 students): Of All people 
who viewed our front page, approximately _half_ did not bother viewing 
the pictures. (Based on a study of the log files. Not perfect but not 
bad. Around 100 000 hits in the period in question)

So it is true that the pressure should go onto those who make authoring 
tools (especially as most of the biggest are made by w3c member 
organisations) to get it right. Australian equal opportunity law
apparently may be able to be used to force websites to come up to 
scratch, but it is not really the ideal way to achieve the real goal.
