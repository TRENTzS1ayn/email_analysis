Dear Web Accessibility Initiative Interest Group Participant:

This message announces the next Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)
meetings, to be held in Los Angelos, California, USA, on March 21 and 22,
immediately following the CSUN Conference at the L.A. International
Airport.  A preliminary agenda with venue and hotel information is
available at http://www.w3.org/WAI/1998/03/agenda.html  We advise you to
book hotel rooms as soon as possible if you plan to attend.

This is a combined 2-day meeting of the WAI International Program Office
Interest Group, the WAI Education and Outreach Interest Group (in
formation), WAI Protocols and Formats Review Working Group, WAI Mark-up
Guidelines Working Group, and the WAI Browser Guidelines Working Group.
(Additional WAI meetings will be held in conjunction with the WWW7
Conference in Brisbane, Australia, in April -- additional information to
follow.)

Please note that these dates -- March 21 and 22 -- are a Saturday and
Sunday.  These were the only days feasible if we were to hold the meeting
in coordination with the CSUN Conference as WAI participants requested
during our November meetings in Austin.  We are pleased to be holding the
WAI meetings in conjunction with CSUN, one of the largest conferences in
the world on technology and disability.  This year's CSUN Conference, which
runs March 17 to 21, has an extensive track called "Increasing Your Net
Worth" on accessibility of the Web where many WAI participants will be
presenting.  For additional information about the CSUN event, please visit
the CSUN home page at http://www.csun.edu/cod/prereg.html 

A registration form for the W3C WAI meetings is available off the WAI
agenda page.  Registration is required in order to attend the WAI meetings.
 Registration is due by Tuesday, February 24, 17:00 Eastern Time, USA.  

If you have questions or concerns about attending the event, please contact
either Judy Brewer (jbrewer@w3.org) Director of the WAI International
Program Office, or Daniel Dardailler (danield@w3.org), Project Manager for
WAI.  

Thank you, 

Judy Brewer
