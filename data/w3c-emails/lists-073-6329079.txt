Other than a boolean rating like, i.e. "this site does/does not 
contain pornography," it is extremely difficult to devise a rating 
system in which two people answer the same way, and probably even
more so with accessibility since there are so many different
definitions of it. I suspect that if we are to try and create a 
PICS based accessibility rating system, it needs to encompass both a 
human judgement of accessibility AND an automated judgement of 
accessibility. Does anyone know of examples where people 
have actually created a PICS rating system and applied it
by automated or human methods to rating large numbers of sites?
I wonder what some of the experiences are.

As far as restricting access by an automated tool, that's what search
engines do.

BTW, This is a good discussion for the ratings and certification
group.
