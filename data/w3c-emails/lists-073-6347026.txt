I'd like to second Joshs' note that this discussion better suits the
PICS-WG and Libby Neville. 

Having said that, I'll voice my meager opinion anyway...There is a
fundamental question, perhaps two or three that really need to be answered
in light web usage and PICS:

1. Why? What *real* purpose would it serve? What is goal are we really
trying to achieve?
2. What is the inherent benefit of PICS in light of accessibility -- a tool
or a rating system?
3. Are there other alternatives?

(Actually, that's 5 questions, isn't it...)

I've thought about this lately, particularly as a result of the discussion
thread. I am not convinced that a PICS based service will really do
anything as a certification or rating system -- unless perhaps someone is
in the business of certifying or rating web sites. Seems to me that those
services died a long time ago. Fewer and fewer sites included the Magellen
or Top 5% logo's anymore. Perhaps those in the writing business would see
similar value....but I doubt anyone else, particularly from a business
standpoint would.

Rather I see it's intrinsic value as an accessibility tool. Something that
can be developed concurrent with imbedded authoring tool accessibility
wizards and functionality. It would help those of us who are in the
business of helping others make their sites accessible. I realize that this
is less proactive in nature...but I think it's the more practical approach. 

For example, at every workshop/seminar I conduct, webmasters and site
administrators always ask me the same two questions: What authoring tools
support accessible design and what applications/utilities can be used to
expedite the process of improving web site accessibility. Everyone seems
eager to do it...they just want access to the tools to automate the process
more.

With that in mind, one would question whether the current functionality of
PICS is really valuable to accessibility. Accessible content isn't about
the kind of content (i.e., pornography) but rather how that content is
constructed in order to view it (or render it in an alternative format). As
I noted above, what is it that we want to really achieve? It's not the
words...it's the ability to read those words. Right?
