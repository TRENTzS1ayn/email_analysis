Charles,


This statistic of yours,

This is very interesting.  Were these students using graphical browsers
or something like Lynx?  

I'd readily believe that this many people would ignore images even if
they had graphical browsers, especially if the site was usable without
the images.

Do other people on the list here know of similar statistics?
