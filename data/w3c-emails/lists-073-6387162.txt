Liddy Nevile is on the road, & has seen some of these e-mails but not been
able to respond yet.  So I will try to summarize her reaction, & then let
her speak for herself when she gets back on line more.  

Yes, this discussion better suits the Rating & Certification Interest Group
for which Liddy is developing a charter.  But given that the list isn't up
yet, this discussion has served as a good airing of some issues, also ones
she is considering.  The RC IG (name still may be changed) will be looking
at a variety of ways to accomplish evaluation and/or validation of
accessibility, so PICS is not a "given" as the tool in this area.

I'd like to ask people at this point to send additional comments directly
to Liddy at liddy@rmit.edu.au rather than to continue extensive discussion
on this topic on this list.  Once the Call for Participation goes out for
that Interest Group, which should be within the next several weeks, those
interested can pursue the discussion there.

Thanks,

Judy
