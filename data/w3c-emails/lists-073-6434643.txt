This is a general question regarding the evolution of Lotus Notes 
databases into warehouses for online documents.

My organisation is seriously looking at changing its website from a 
html centric site, to one where the documents reside on a domino server, 
within Lotus Notes databases.

The way this Notes centric site will work is that the documents will be 
developed as rich text only, then dumped into a Lotus Notes database. Only 
when this document is called by someone on the web will domino then add html 
on the fly to the document, making it web-visible.

As we consider the issue of accessibility an important one for our
organisation, 
we are concerned as to what impact this may have on the accessibility of the 
information. 

It seems that if the html is developed on the fly when a document is called, 
then we would have limited control as to the quality of that html.

I would appreciate any views on this.

Thanks

Robert Savellis
