What you get from the automation is consistency.  If the HTML
conversion is good, it will all be good.  Automation is
ultimately your friend, once they get it right.  I would claim
Chris Maden's recent post as support for this idea.

You are left with the question "Have they got it right, yet."
That question is something one could actually look into.

Consider requesting references from your Lotus sales organization
to sites now served in this way which are comparable to what your
site would do.

Get some of your friendly web users to review the example sites.

Back them up with a little HTML Validator and Bobby evaluation,
but trust the people.

Review your punch list with the people who would be maintaining
the Lotus scripts that generate the HTML.
