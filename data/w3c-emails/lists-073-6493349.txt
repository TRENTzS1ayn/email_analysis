Before asking about the quality of the conversion process, you have to
wonder about the quality of the storage format used by domino, rtf it
seems.

Does it allow for attaching textual description of images, short and
long, does it separate presentation from content/structure (i.e. is it
style sheet based), does it provide the required level of abstraction
for list and table, if it has input, like imagemap and form, does it
store alt text for sensitive spost or things like accesskey and
field grouping ?
