A few people have mentioned the difficulty of going through all those web 
pages and changing the little alt tags.  A small application that 
searches HTML text for alt-tag-less images and provides a view of the 
relevant gif or jpeg along with a text field to enter a description would 
facilitate proper tagging.  This might be helpfull for those who have 
entire web sites to retrofit, full of images with uninformative 
filenames.  (My theory is that, when it comes down to it, most web 
masters would rather have accesible sites).
