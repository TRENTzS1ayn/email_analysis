ASG::

The eventual goal is that it is intrinsic in the formats and
automatic in all the tools.

In the mean time we have walk-before-run scenarios to develop.

I like Leonard's idea of combining a bad-page search engine with
a swift-fix authoring station.  It will have more zing if you are
demonstrating how easy it is to fix arbitrary pages pulled at
semi-random off the Web.  Not canned toy examples.

People who can contribute components for such a demo should talk
to Liddy <liddy@rmit.edu.au> about WWW7.
