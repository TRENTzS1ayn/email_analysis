I got a note from Judy that you were discussing ALT tags - hope this helps:

My libwww robot [1] does the basics needed, I think. It finds all the
references to images that do not have ALT tags and lists them in a simple
file format like this

<linked found here> --> <pointer to the image>

like

http://www.w3.org--> http://www.w3.org/icons/w3c

would say that the icon "http://www.w3.org/icons/w3c" was referenced using
an <IMG> tag from the page "http://www.w3.org" without an ALT tag.

It also has the capability of actually downloading the images as it goes
along.

The nice thing is that it traverses the web sites much faster than any
other robot that I know of because it uses HTTP/1.1 [2] in a clever way [3]
which also puts a lot less pressure on the server.
