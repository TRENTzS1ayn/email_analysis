Concerns re the proposal.

1. Scale - How to appreciate the work load in 'describing' the number of
images on the web.
This appreciates over time at quite a rate.

2. Complexity. Auto-description could be hit and miss.

3.How to ensure aligned interpretation. Context provides the clue.
Missing context could
put a wrong light on the image description. [I drew a 'dog in a
manger', you described a
puppy]
4.How to resource.
A misguided volunteer using graffiti as the alt text is a real
'threat' to the service.
Linguistically appropriate descriptions? The source associated
text could be in any
language, the description should be in the same one. 

In terms of achievability, the simpler function of 'list my img set',
'prompt for alt text' (with prompts
for repetitions) seems both achievable and sufficiently modular that it
could be built upon. it could
be either client side or server side, and as has been shown, can be
implemented quickly and
efficiently. A client side element could be used directly by 'lazy'
authors as an after thought; 
generate the page, run the app (plug in?) and fill in the gaps.

I like simplicity, this solution has it.
Hope I haven't sounded too negative re the well thought out proposal,
but pragmatism
makes me think a simpler solution on which we could build is a solid
start.
