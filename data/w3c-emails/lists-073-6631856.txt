Yes, context is important (Len Kasday already commented to me
privately about that) but it's also hard to achieve, as the page URL
itself is often too broad a reference (when the image is buried down
the bottom of a long page for instance).

Yes, although I don't think this is likely to happen, one could
imagine a subscription with access passwd for describers, just
requiring a valid email.

Also possible is heuristic code that looks for dirty words (but
vandals are likely to just say "a dog" when a picture of "a car" is
shown...)

Good point, the language of the including page should be indicated,
but we also need to take for a given that english is the esperanto of
the 21st century :-)

Not at all.
Thanks.
