Great idea.

On a related note, here is a pointer to some technology that
would help us put this prototype together 

Muffin found at http://muffin.doit.org/
is a proxy server written in Java that can sit between the
users browser and the rest of the WWW and act as a filtering
gateway.

I'm still playing with it to see what all one can do, but
the possibilities are huge given the variety of filters it
enables.
