and others have commented on the same line.

XLink (currently part of XLL, the linking specification for XML) has
interesting applications here.  An accessibility service could add
annotations to sites they do not control; Greg could not only suggest
these corrections, he could implement them as external links on a page
well-publicized within the visual-impairment community.  Anyone
loading the accessibility link database would get the added
information.
