Hi Larry,

I agree that the question is how to best help web page authors to find the
problem - how they intend to solve the problem is another question and is
probably a function of what authoring tools they use etc.

From a personal point of view, what I want is a tool that I can easily use
to run over my set of resources and tell me where there are missing ALT
tags. This was the reason for adding the functionality to the libwww robot
in the first place [1].
