Not hardly.  On several mailing lists and newsfroups I frequent, it
has become an amusing exercise to drive a phrase to closure (the point
at which a round-trip produces the starting phrase).  In a recent
example, "I hate spam and want Congress to make it illegal" came back
as something like "I hate Spam, which it Congress educates itself
illegally."  Try it.  Have fun.
