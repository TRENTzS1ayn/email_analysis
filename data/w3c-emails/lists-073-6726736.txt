Larry asks: "Has anyone analyzed the quality of these automated
translations?  Good enough for a native speaker?"

WL:: please don't get us started on how good OCR, translation, voice
recognition are or might become.  We are trying to do something *now*
and particularly the translation stuff would be lots better addressed on
whatever list deals with internalization.  Daniel's proposed server is
not pie-in-the-sky and correcting HTML and accessibility errors by
individuals would have an exponential effect, particularly on sites that
anybody was actually interested in.  As to the enormity of the
undertaking, the point about AltaVista or even Project Gutenberg shows
that scale is something that the brevity of a "web year" makes feasible
