This is on offline exchange I had with Daniel that I'm posting here
(after getting OK from Daniel of course).  I omitted some intro words,
e.g. where he said it was OK to post etc.

I labeled each paragraph LRK:: and DD:: so people would know who was
who.  My new comments are labeled new LRK::  My primitive mail system
doesn't put in the >

DD::Yes, a hash is a very good way to find duplicate.

new LRK:: If you processed the page to put in the needed anchors for
purpose of display  then you'd go right to the image.

LRK:: yes, this is really a whole different way of doing things...
figuring out a fallback when nobody put in the ALT text.
