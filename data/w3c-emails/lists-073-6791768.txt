 One of the things I have been curious about is the state of
 text-to-sign translation into ASL, for example.
 
 Do you happen to know about that?

No I am not aware of any such software. There are software that allow you to
type a word and it will give you the sign for it.  However, because ASL has a
drastically different grammar structure from English, I have yet to see a
software that is able to translate from text to ASL.  I will ask around and
get back to you.
