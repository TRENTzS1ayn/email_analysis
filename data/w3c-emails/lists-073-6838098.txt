WL:: This assumes that they want "off the hook" which is likely not true
in light of the oft-voiced observation that most of them want to "help."
Also, dealing with retrofit requests is much more annoying and time
consuming than "staying on the hook."

WL:: Of course we are *determined* to change the world!  In addition to
"requesting" changes on individual notification, we must pursue the
guideline, outreach, education, authoring tool modifications, etc.  The
client/user will have to step up her "web police" activity and all the
tools spoken of in recent exchanges will serve her well, particularly if
there is a centralized ombudsperson <g> to help.
