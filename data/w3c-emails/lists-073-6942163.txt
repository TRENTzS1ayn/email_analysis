One difference we (RNIB) need to recognise,
for an acronym, presented to a low end synth speech
system 'reading' a page, the acronym needs to be 
'spaced out', such that RNIB becomes R N I B,
whereas this is not necessary with an 'abbrev' which can
(often) be 'read out' without being 'spelled out' - if you 
catch my drift. 

This (IMHO) necessitates differentiation between the two.
How many authors appreciate such finesse I am unsure.
