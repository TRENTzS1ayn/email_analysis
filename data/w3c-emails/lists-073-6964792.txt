In-house experience seems to respond.

1. User preferences 
Punctuation can be turned on or off
(Assumes you are using  --)
2.Screen reader capability.
Can the punctuation be 'turned off' may not be on some
lower end products.
3.Likewise if 'm-dash'  (#151) or any other 'graphical'
character
is used, with high end products they can be 'trained' to
pronounce them as 'm dash' or ignored.

Perhaps the cleaner solution is to use the proper entity
set
then permit those who can and want to, to train the
system
to 'pronounce' entities as intended.

The quick and dirty is to avoid using them - there are
alternatives.
