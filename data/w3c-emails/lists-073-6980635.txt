It's basically a long dash, try looking at &#151; in a
browser or try ALT 0151 in wordpad (or whatever) on a PC.

These pages have a couple instances of &#151; in them:

http://www.labournet.org.uk/llb/1998/february/news3.html

I've had a look at the spec at the w3 site but &#151; is not
there - I guess it's a propriety thing that either Netscape
or Microsoft introduced.

Other characters that I've been using that are also not
"correct" are &#147; and &#148; as they look better that
&#quot; but I guess they will only work on a MS Windows
computer and do something weird on a UNIX box or whatever -
can speech synthesizers handle them? If not I'll change them
all to &#quot;
