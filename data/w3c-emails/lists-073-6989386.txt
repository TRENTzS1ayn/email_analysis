The SGML view would be that the markup reflects the authors
intent.
The 'braillists' view would be as you say.
I must support the former position.

If it is an acronym, mark it up as such, if an abbreviation for
a longer
word, mark it as <abbrev>. Thats the black and white version.
The grey
shades come in where a word is both pronouncable (as an acronym)
and
is an abbreviated form. 

Acronyms are formed from the initial letters (or syllables) of
other words [chambers].
hence radar is an acronym - should it be marked up as such? I
would say no.

Abbrev is 'part of a word written instead of the whole'. E.g.
abbrev. When I (sighted)
read that I read it as the full word. The text to speech system
cannot do that, hence
perhaps the 'right' thing to do is avoid the use of
abbreviations.

Acronyms are less easy to avoid! They are in such common use it
simply needs judgement
as to the need to expand to the full -  or mark up as an acronym
and ensure recognition as
such!

Hope that helps
