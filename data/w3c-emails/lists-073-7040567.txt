I did a quick check and found the following using JAWS For Windows: In
Netscape 4.01 and MSIE 3.02, &#151; is spoken as "ANSI 151". The JFW user
can choose whether to have various gradations of ANSI characters spoken,
but very few would know what it meant. In Braille it shows up as sort of an
underline character (dots 4,5,6,7).

With Lynx 2.6 it just shows up as "&#151;".
