My thinking is that a person familiar with the context in which 'RAM' is 
being used might find that really irritating.  But I gather that you are 
thinking of a mark-up to browser to screen reader chain, rather than 
direct parsing of the mark-up by a text-to-speech browser.  In that case 
I almost agree with you, except that for people reading the acronym 
visually, R space A space M would be less than optimal.  Thus, I would 
suggest that the HTML 4.0 specification should instruct that browsers 
support optional acronym spacing.
