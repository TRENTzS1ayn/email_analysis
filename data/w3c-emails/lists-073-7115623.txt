Apologies to anyone for whom this has been the case.  In a context like 
wai-ig, I feel that I can usually trust others to beat myself up for me, 
and I think someone would have mentioned it.  But I have the thread here 
locally on my Mac, and I'd be happy to edit for legibility and re-post 
any message if that is the case.

In terms of the more general question, screen readers will always have to 
deal with ASCI occasionally, and (although I'm not familiar with the 
technology) I suspect that on-the-fly parsing of mark-up is not 
neccisarily standard.
