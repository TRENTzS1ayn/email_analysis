[Pawson, David]  
No, I was thinking that we need to identify them. Treatment of
them can
be localised (I would only expand them when outputting to a text
to speech
system, inserting the spaces - a browser app may treat them
differently.
My main request is that they be identified by being tagged,
which permits
treatment of them! If they are unidentified, then we can't treat
them other than
as plain text.)

regards, DaveP
