[Pawson, David]  DP: Exactly. If we can persuade the authors to
tag these
beasts, then such output treatment software as CSS can 'deal'
with them.

Its when we don't tag them up that we are into guessing games.
Right tagging will support right treatment [which is where this
thread started if I 
remember rightly].
