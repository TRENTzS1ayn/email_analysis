How about if the mountain won't  come to ....

the difficulty would appear to be in getting finger and hot link
together.
If its hard to get the finger to a small area, how about sensing
the touch, then
causing the nearest link to 'hot up', and present itself? The
touchscreen
coordinates know where the finger is - use this to 'snap' the
nearest link to the
users finger (touch object if not a finger). This could be
easily done visually or
aurally - informing the user which link is now ready for
activation. If its the wrong one,
lift off or move. If OK, hold for a period or some other ack
signal to say go.

This could be done with a local Java app using a small message
area for messages or
speech output even better. That way we operate with any hot
linked page, instead of
asking authors to change the way they operate, one of TV's
themes.
 
Just a thought.
