While this is good, it's also a danger.  Because HTML/CSS doesn't allow for
everything that advanced document tools need, a lot of "meta" data is thrown
in.  In the form of meta-blocks and custom tags that can only be read by the
applications themselves.

It's good that it'll advance HTML/CSS eventually.

For example, when AOL and MSN announced that they would support "open"
internet standards, everyone cheered because they felt that the sites would
be accessible via any browser.  As it turned out, both services loaded up
their sites with ActiveX controls and Java applets and forced you to use
their own browsers to work with the sites.

Yes the were using HTML, but just as a carrier for closed objects.

I was talking to a person from Lotus and they said they were rewriting all
their applications to save in the HTML/CSS format as their native format.
So even if you never publish to the WWW users of those tools will be using
these standards.  So HTML/CSS is being used for more than the WWW.
