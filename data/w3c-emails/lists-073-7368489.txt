JRG: I think that Chuck makes a good point is that many compainies will use
the customization capabilities (loop holes) in the standards to try force
people to their companies products.  This will probably only get worse as
XML gains popularity.

JRG: If the semantic information is separated from the presentation
information it will probably be good. 

My main point of the message was that HTML/CSS could be used for more
things than just WWW publishing.  This would increase its popularity, but
as chuck points out may not improve universal access.
