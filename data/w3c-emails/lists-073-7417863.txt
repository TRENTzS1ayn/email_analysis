With regards to checking if browsers support special symbols:

I bounced elements of this thread over to the style list server 
(www-style@w3.org), and Liam Quinn (liam@htmlhelp.com) wrote to refer me 
to a web page at the URL 
<http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/entities/>.

The pages there have tables that say what the characters should look 
like, alongside your browser's rendition of them.

I noticed that my current browser, Navigator 4.0, supported very little 
*except* m-dash.

Matt.
