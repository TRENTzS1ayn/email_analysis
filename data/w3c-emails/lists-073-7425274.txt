[Pawson, David]  

Surely the simple need is for IE4.xx and netscape to implement
ISO latin 1?
[I.e. be capable of displaying the correct glyphs for each
entity in the set].
In deference to those out there who only live in MSDOS, perhaps
this should
be a switchable option?


My logic says that the html generator programs will follow the
browsers fairly
rapidly. I.e. the html editor software programs. Is that
reasonable?

My only real concern is that the single ISO latin 1 is only one
of a number needed
for true internationalisation. A Unicode shift would give a real
move forward, permitting
a wider use of the other entity sets.
