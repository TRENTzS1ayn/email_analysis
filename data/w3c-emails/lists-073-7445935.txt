The codepages 850 for DOS and 1252 for Windows adequately (IMHO)
encompass the Latin 1 (iso-8859-1) character set.  The problem has two
aspects:

(1) The HTML editor software programs are not respecting that the
    values of numeric character references are for the HTML Document
    Character Set, which it iso-10646 (essentially, Unicode) as of
    HTML 4.0, and iso-8859-1 (a subset of iso-10646) in previous HTML
    specs, and are generating numeric character references in the
    range reserved for control characters -- disallowed for HTML --
    but corresponding to intended characters such as fancy dashes
    and quotation marks in the Windows codepage;

(2) that the browsers are treating these character references
    in that range as references to the corresponding characters
    in the Windows codepage, rather than as disallowed values
    in the HTML Document Character Set.

Both aspects of the problem need to be addressed simultaneously, or you
are likely to find yourself in the position of hoping that the tail can
wag the dog.

The HTML 4.0 specs now include named character references for
all of the characters which are presently being handled via invalid
numeric character references (except smiling face :).  Here is a list
of the invalid nurmeric character references being encountered on today's
Web, and their correct numeric (in hex notation) and named references:


        Conversions of invalid numeric (MicroSoft codepage)
        character references to valid Unicode numeric or named
        character reference (names as in HTML 4.0).

INVALID     Numeric   Named             Character
-------     -------- -------   -----------------------------------------
&#1;    ->  &#x263a; (none)    WHITE SMILING FACE
&#130;  ->  &#x201a; &sbquo;   SINGLE LOW-9 QUOTATION MARK
&#132;  ->  &#x201e; &bdquo;   DOUBLE LOW-9 QUOTATION MARK
&#133;  ->  &#x2026; &hellip;  HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS
&#134;  ->  &#x2020; &dagger;  DAGGER
&#135;  ->  &#x2021; &Dagger;  DOUBLE DAGGER
&#137;  ->  &#x2030; &permil;  PER MILLE SIGN
&#139;  ->  &#x2039; &lsaquo;  SINGLE LEFT-POINTING ANGLE QUOTATION MARK
&#145;  ->  &#x2018; &lsquo;   LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK
&#146;  ->  &#x2019; &rsquo;   RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK
&#147;  ->  &#x201c; &ldquo;   LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK
&#148;  ->  &#x201d; &rdquo;   RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK
&#149;  ->  &#x2022; &bull;    BULLET
&#150;  ->  &#x2013; &ndash;   EN DASH
&#151;  ->  &#x2014; &mdash;   EM DASH
&#152;  ->  &#x02dc; &tilde;   SMALL TILDE
&#153;  ->  &#x2122; &trade;   TRADE MARK SIGN
&#155;  ->  &#x203a; &rsaquo;  SINGLE RIGHT-POINTING ANGLE QUOTATION MARK


As I noted in a previous message, for accessibility reasons
Lynx 2.7.2 is performing the above conversions of invalid numeric
character references, but that's a catch-22.  We're now seeing
messages like this from people who rely on the empirical behavior
of browsers instead of understanding and complying with the standards
for interoperability:

"We gee, &#145; and &#146 get me the quotation marks in Lynx,
 and it's developers are fussy about standards, so that must
 be OK."

Sigh... &#x263a;

Note that a number of smiley and frowney characters are available
in iso-10646, and I hope the named entities for them are added to the HTML
specs soon, because the present situation on the Web is a serious threat
to world peace. :)
