Absolutely. Particularly as there is so much variety, and so little
agreement, amongst the browser developers (as well as between versions
of the same browser).

We seem to be chasing ourselves around in never-ending circles. The
browser developers have a view on what ALT is, or means to them, and
produce a browser which renders it in a certain way. Web authors see the
effects, write code accordingly, and modify their behaviour in an ever-
more futile attempt to cater for the changing browser behaviour.

As far as I can see this has arisen because of ambiguity in the original
specification - but this ambiguity still remains unresolved.

Why is it so difficult to reach a concensus on such a basic concept as
ALTernative text for images?
