CAST (CENTER FOR APPLIED SPECIAL TECHNOLOGY)
With a web site you can communicate with the world. Boost the impact of
your efforts by maximising accessibility. How? Visit the CAST web site
and
use its free, web-based service, "Bobby". Enter the URL of the page(s)
you
want analysed and the page is returned to you, annotated with icons
highlighting disability access and browser compatibility problems. Click
on
an icon for a description of the problem. The CAST site has more to it
than
 Bobby, but even if it didn't, it would be worth the trip. You can
download
Bobby's (PERL) source code and to run your own copy on any UNIX
computer.
