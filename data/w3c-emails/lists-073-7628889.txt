Much of the "cool" aspect of web presences is somewhat heading in the
direction of making the web more "tv-like" instead of "magazine-like"
and the latter is *mostly* the foundation we have been trying to affect
with our authoring tool guidelines.  As the sites become more "exciting"
(whatever that is) and dynamic the problems for people with visual
problems become different and the model we must use is much more
amenable to amelioration by something like "descriptive video" - about
which our participants from the Boston PBS place know a great deal since
they receive very high marks for their work from its intended audience
of blind folks.

The art of doing only just enough describing goes to the heart of the
current thread about Alt/title/longdescr functions and it might be
useful to brain-pick about how to get authors of dynamic sites to use
the expertise of these folks to enable their medium/message/semantics to
be conveyed by words, spoken or printed.

That NetScape saw fit to extend HTML for a proprietary "layer" tag is in
a way unfortunate since in general the same thing can be readily
achieved with CSS2, but then they wouldn't have something IE doesn't
have and the "browser wars" could have a truce that might help our
clients <sarcastic grin>.

So if Larry Goldberg could codify what it is that makes for good
practice in video descriptive art it might provide us with some talking
points.
