I appreciate the compliment and will pass it on to our excellent "describers."

Codifying ain't so easy, though we've attempted to do so for years.
We have certainly been applying these description techniques to GBH's
own web site (www.wgbh.org) through the use of D-tags throughout.

You may want to check out the site associated with the children's program "Arthur"
to see how we deal with cartoons, drawings, etc.:
http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/arthur/

click on the standalone "D's" and you will at least see how we describe and
what we describe.

Some rules of thumb (actually, just plain common sense):
- describe "key visual elements" - that which is needed for understanding and no more.
Yes, this requires a human judgement call, but not everything can be automated :-)
In TV, we don't have the luxury of unlimited time and space for our descriptions, so
less is always more.  The same should hold true for web surfers.

- don't make judgements about meanings of images and people, just describe what they
look like; i.e. don't say "picture of an angry man" say instead "picture of a man with
bulging eyes and veins standing out in his neck" (an extreme example).

- I'll see if I can dig up any other "rules" that may help.
