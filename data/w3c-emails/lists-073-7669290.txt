Coupling Al's first and third points (below), if the force feedback mouse 
can give an indication of when the user is at the edge of the display, it 
could be helpful. The feature that may be even handier is the ability to 
expand the display to an arbitrary size. On my screen, I can open a 
window that is bigger than the screen, and then have to, as it were, 
position the screen over the section I want to see. A force-feedback 
mouse could identify edges of a window bigger than the one I could see. 
On the other hand, if it s possible to enlarge the window for ever, 
things will get lost. This is the value of being able to get around the 
display using a keyboard, which need not require a spatial model at all.

On the other hand, force-feeedback gives something to deaf users that a 
beep doesn't.
