Chris. I can download pdf reader on my desktop and read the stuff - it 
doesn't work on my laptop. Although Acrobat is free it comes at a 
hardware cost - plain text on the other hand, assuming the document can 
be rendered in text (some diagrams are VERY difficult to explain) is free 
and works on existing hardware without a problem. (This point is why I am 
forwarding the answer to a private question back to the list)

Chris Hasser wrote that he could create a plain text version of his pdf 
document if it was needed, and that he knew a blind person working for 
Adobe who had no problems with pdf.

Thoughts anybody?

My thoughts, questions etc are my own, and at my work we argue about this 
stuff every so often...
