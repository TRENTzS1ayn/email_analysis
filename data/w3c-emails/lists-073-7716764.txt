Does anyone have a good design example of how to use the ACCESSKEY to
increase the accessibility of a page.  I am working on a project to create
some accessible WWW based educational technology and our group has been
trying to figure out how to use the accesskey feature to enhance
accessibility.  Some of the problems we are facing with the access key is
the need to explicitly state the presence of the access key in the
document, but different Browsers may require different modifier keys to use
the access key.  For eample in MS-Explorer your need to type ALT-S for
ACCESSKEY="S", and on some other browser it may be something else like
Ctril-S or just S by itself.  So you just can't tell people to type S or
ALT-S?  
Another issue is consistancy, does anybody have any ideas on how to assign
keys so people can learn when to expect an access key?
Thanks,
Jon
