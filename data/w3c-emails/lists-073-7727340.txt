In regard to separating graphic-links.
What I do as an author is the following:

Separate icon-links with a 1 pixel transparent gif with the alt text of *
or some other separating character. Height and width being specified.

(see e.g. http://www.econ.upf.es/%7Edagan/about.html )

This should work fine in browsers that implement ALT text correctly.
(e.g. Lynx).

In graphical browsers it looks almost like not separating the links.(e.g.
Netscape 3 or 4). For both cases of images on or off.  
(I have no clue what a screen reader does here)

However it seems that graphical browsers do not implement ALT text 
correctly. They either don't show it, cut it short if it doesn't
fit the box, or show it as a tooltip only when one points the mouse to
the box of the graphic.

In my view:

1. separating text-links is important from the point of view of usability
 of sighted users, therefore separating icon-links is a good idea,
 even without considering accessibility. (sighted users don't get the images
 if they don't want them, and then they should get separated text links.)

2. Guidelines of authoring should be based primerly on what the specs say.
 This is the only way to coordinate actions of authors and browser vendors.
 (this is most relevant for ALT and title attributes).
