In my view the best approach is to assume first that the Specs
are implemented correctly and to build the guidelines (as 
a first iteration) based on that.

Many of the problems you mention are dealing with the controversial 
implementation of ALT in graphical browsers.

It seems that the designers of these browsers assume that users are 
people who can (physically) view the images but sometimes choose not do so,
e.g., shutting off images to  save download time.

For this reason the boxes of images are drawn allowing the users to download
images separatly if they so choose.

I think that the specs are very clear about the new OBJECT element, more 
than about alt to images. The spec says quite explicitly that if images are 
turned off the content of the OBJECT element must be shown. No box or cut off
alt text etc. 

I noticed that when I used the OBJECT element with an icon-link in one of 
my pages (with Height and Width specified) MSIE4.0 for Windows 3.1 
implemented
it wrong: Providing scroll bars and hiding the little image behind them,
and the link didn't work. This was with images turned on.
(I took it off my page...)

A more careful study of the implementation of OBJECT should be done.
(I'll write some test pages when I have the time...)
 
But in principle using OBJECT when the text is essensial seems to be the 
solution, if OBJECT is implemented as the specs say.
(and maybe putting decorative image with OBJECT with no content)

True. but no-alt is invalid. N.D.

I have seen many pages myself with *links*  alt tagged with an 
empty string.  The author here just tried to get "formal validity"
of his page (e.g. the HTML writers guild) rather than using his head.

In principle the author should be the one who decides what he wants to show
to users who don't see the image.  This principle also
resolves the function/description debate. The author should think
 what does best for his readers  N.D.

I think that a great deal of the problem is that title attribute is not
well defined in the specs. We don't know what to expect with it.  N.D.
