I'm not sure if I understand your comment.

What we are looking at is to announce, for example, the button caption, 
followed by the access key (including modifier).

 For example:  [Search] is announced as "Search Button, Alt S" in the least 
verbose mode.

Also,  in the post by Dave Bolnick, an author specificaiton of available 
short cut keys is also a good approach for use by the screen 
reader/browser, yet this can also be generated by the browser if not 
available.

Thanks for the information on ACCESSKEY.  But isn't the browser
implementation kind of a big deal.  If I put a statement like "Press S to
submit the form", the user has to press more than S in most browsers.  So
many people will think it doesn't work.  But if I put the "Access key for
the submit button is S".  Most people won't know what an access key is.
There must be a better way to use the access key for authors to adopt it's
usage.
Jon
