I think it was David who gave the example of some invisible text used to 
describe accesskeys.

This seems another example where designing for accessibility is simply a 
case of designing well. The same accesskeys would be useful to sighted 
users. One of the nice features of the Opera browser is that it is easy 
to run from the keyboard.

But the confusion between page keys and browser keys is likely to be a 
large problem. Add the fact that there are many Macintosh users out there 
and it gets potentially harder again.

Unfortunately I don't have any solutions to offer yet. And the browser 
wars don't make me hopeful that those who are best placed to help will do 
so, since it would essentially require giving away some control over User 
Interface which is seen as proprietary material.
