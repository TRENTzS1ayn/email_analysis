<<It seems that the designers of these browsers assume that users are

That's not the case for Internet Explorer, which has spent a great deal of
time and effort in making it an accessible browser.

<<I noticed that when I used the OBJECT element with an icon-link in one of 
my pages (with Height and Width specified) MSIE4.0 for Windows 3.1 
implemented it wrong: Providing scroll bars and hiding the little image
behind them,
and the link didn't work. This was with images turned on.>>

Can you provide the markup for this?  Thanks,
