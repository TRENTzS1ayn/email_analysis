I realize this may not be the usual convention with quoted material, but
I'd like to request that people place it after rather than before their
own reply to a message.  Headers on this list tend to be long as it is,
and having to hear quoted before new material makes it worse for screen
reader users like myself.  

Thanks for considering this,
Jamal
