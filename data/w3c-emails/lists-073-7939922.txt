I think that text links that are not separated
may confuse a sighted user, who may think that 
two words of different links belong to the same link.
This reduces uasability.
Therefore I attempt to separate them. 

With icon links, there is no need for a user that sees the 
icons to create additional separation, since the 
icons look sufficiently separate, and there is no 
room for confusion.

My additional work and markup was to improve rendering 
in text-only or non-visual media, in a way that I hope 
does not make problems to any user.

Nir Dagan.
