Should the ALT attribute take on this role, in addition to its other role
of replicating the function of the image?  Is there a reason why we have to
attach everything to do with the image to the ALT attribute?

The TITLE attribute fits perfectly for this function.  ALT gives pure,
context-sensitive, media-independent content, and TITLE gives a
context-free description of a media-dependent element.

No, but it's acceptable to assume that everyone reading my page won't mind
that they can get all the content at the expense of missing descriptions of
eye candy.  If I force descriptions of eye candy into ALT text, I'm taking
away from the content of the page.  I don't think it's worth it.

I like #1 and #2, but #3 is inconsistent.  If I were listening to a Web
page, occurrences of #3 would be distracting and/or confusing.  An example
incorporating all three would be nice...
