Have you reviewed Nemeth code and related Braille dialects for
Math?

Have you looked into what Raman has done re: speech?  e.g.

 T. V. Raman

 Brian Hayes: Speaking Of Mathematics
 http://www.amsci.org/amsci/issues/Comsci96/compsci96-03.html

After you shop around I'm not sure you will find a lower-risk
approach than working with MathML.
