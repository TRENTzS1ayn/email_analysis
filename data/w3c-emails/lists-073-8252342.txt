Raman,

You're right that I didn't give any thought to the need to control
presentation.  So I did skip over that a bit too lightly.

But still, what do you think of the proposal of writing a DSSSL style
sheet that translates Maden's proposal for semantic math markup  to
MathML? The semantic math markup could  specified via XML and thus
extended at any time; and simultaneously the DSSSL stylesheet could be
extended to optimally produce the optimal MathML markup.   

Might this give the best of both approaches?  Or perhaps you had
considered that and rejected it out of some consideration I'm not
thinking of?
