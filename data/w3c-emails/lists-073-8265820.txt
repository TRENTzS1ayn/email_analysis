This is a response to a question on the java-access list about access to
javascript.  Since javascript is quite distinct of course from Java,
I'm cross pointing it to the Web access interest group where related
topics come up.  I'd suggest moving it to the IG list if it continues.
 
I'm especially interested in what Chuck Opperman or someone else has to
say about this from the Microsoft perspective, and what anyone from
Netscape would have to say from the Netscape perspective.

Chuck (or other Microsoft person)
:
As I understand it, Microsoft is saying that an advantage of  DHTML over
Javascript is that it is a complete object model: every object on the
web page is accesible to the DHTML.  With active accessibility (AA),
does this mean that a screen reader with active accessibility read the
page after DHTML has updated it?  

I'm asking first in principle, and also in practice, if any current
screen readers can do it.

If  DHTML with AA  can do it,. and if Netscape's javascript can't.. then
the advice, at least in the interim, would be to switch to DHTML and
MSIE.  Please note the "if's" in the previous sentence!

Plus, if there's someone from Netscape listening, would you give your
perspective?  My knowlege of DHTML vs Javascript is extremely limited
and perhaps I am not correctly characterizing DHTML vs Javascript.

Thanks.

Len
