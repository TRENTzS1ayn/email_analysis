You may want to start off with the disability-related web sites 
themselves, especially those in your immediate area,-- if it is similar 
to my experience in the state of Georgia, many of them are not using 
universal accessibility standards. 

Other suggestions:
-- You will need to get the regional education and government web sites 
on board as well.

-- As a method, I would really promote http://validator.w3.org/ to 
webmasters as well as business owners, program directors, etc . . .
This site allows you to enter an url address and get feedback as 
to how well it adheres to HTML 4.0.  You could also use 
http://www.cast.org/bobby/ 
which does a similar service (though I don't know if it is WAI 
compliant.  (Comments on 'bobby' anyone)?
    In any event, this gives immediate feedback to the webmaster and 
their bosses as to how UA their site is.

Good luck,

Wayne

P.S.  Seeking editorial comment here:  Seems to me that WAI and 
universal accessibility is being addressed at the national and global 
level quite adequately, but not so well at the region/state/community 
level.  Would love feedback on this.
