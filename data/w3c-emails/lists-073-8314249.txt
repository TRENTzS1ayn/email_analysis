> these standards which are posted at our web site
> (www.ci.san-jose.ca.us), the County Advisory Commission for Persons
> with Disabilities recommended to the Board of Supervisors that the
> County adopt the City of San Jose web accessibility standards.  In

> of Santa Clara Board adopted the City of San Jose web accessibility
> standards.  
> 
> As Chair of the County Advisory Commission for Persons with
> Disabilities, I was proud that the WAI launch occurred in the only

> To get us started, here's a short list of what I have so far:
> 1. Official city page advertising its use of WAI guidelines
> 2. Work with chamber of commerce to promote use of WAI guidelines by
> businesses with internet (e.g. Create COC Award, make use of WAI
> guidelines
> an accreditation standard, etc.)
> 3. Work with ISPs, Web Designers located in city to promote WAI
> guidleines.

> Any ideas that would flesh out what I've suggested or, even better,
> that are
> entirely new would be great.
