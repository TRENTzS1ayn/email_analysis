The "IBM Guidelines for Writing Accessible Applications Using 100% Pure Java"
are now available!  This is the industry's first set of 100% Pure Java (tm)
application development guidelines for accessibility. The guidelines are based
on the Java Accessibility API and their implementation on the Java Foundation
Classes.  IBM is focusing on the Java platform for accessibility and is
encouraging developers to exploit this new technology. Learn more about the
accessibility issues being addressed and read the guidelines on IBM's
