LQ::  This is the way it should be, in my opinion.  ALT text is
*replacement* text, not descriptive text, so you shouldn't know whether the
text you're hearing is ALT text or normal text.  ALT text that cannot be
identified as ALT text when listening to a Web page is good ALT text since
it provides accessibility seamlessly.

Of course, browsers should give users the option of adding seams.  Lynx
does this with the "*" command, which forces the display of "[INLINE]",
"[LINK]", etc. on all images.
