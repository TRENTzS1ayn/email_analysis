I have long suggested that those working on some of these issues unplug
their monitors and mice for some lengthy period of time.  Only then will
some of the access issues make more sense.

Those who teach people who are blind to walk with a cane or guide dog must
go through the same experience in some blind folded fashion.  It is in
this way that they learn to really trust and understand both the methods
they are teaching and gain insight into the real experience.
