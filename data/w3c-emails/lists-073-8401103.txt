Hi Jaap,

The Central Ref doc (or master doc) is presented this way.  Problems first 
followed by solution strategies.   The other guideline docs were arranged 
to make them more concise.     Should we think about lengthening the 
guidelines and doing the same format at central reference doc?   This is 
easier to understand but we get so many complaints about the length of the 
guidelines docs.   Thoughts anyone?

Gregg



WAI should identify the problems first (didn't we discuss this in Nice) and 
then try to prioritize this list of problems.  This must of course been 
based on importance of the items and not on possibilities to solve it.
Best regards,
Jaap
