Last I heard, someone was working on a project to add some subset of
JavaScript capability to Lynx.  If Lynx want's to support XML/XSL,
it'll need that capability eventually anyway.

Lynx, with patches.  I can't tell you how to get them, because then
I'd be an unlicensed arms exporter, thanks to my freedom-loving

may find a non-US source for the SSL patches.
