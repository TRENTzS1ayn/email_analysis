Hello all,

Please consider joining the new mailing list w3c-wai-rc@w3.org which
has been set up to discuss the mission and charter of a new WAI group
that should deal with tools and practices like Bobby, Lynx-it, etc,
used to check, evaluate, as well as improve access on the Web (RC
stands for "Rating and Certification" but this is somewhat inaccurate
and the group is up for rename).

Len Kasday and Liddy Nevile are co-chairing this activity.

The current list of w3c-wai-rc subscribers is attached.
(to auto-subscribe send a mail to w3c-wai-rc-request@w3.org with
Subject:subscribe) 

Also check http://www.w3.org/WAI/RC for some details and current
activitie in that area.

You have til the end of the week to subscribe and then discussions
will start on the w3c-wai-rc list itself.

Thanks.

Current w3c-wai-rc mailing list (no need to re-subscribe).
