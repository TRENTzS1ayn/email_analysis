In addition to the Royal Institute, the CNIB in Toronto, the Natl
Library Service for the Blind (part of the Library of Congress) and
national libraries around the world may all be able to offer local
helpers who are not on e-mail, but who are avid communicators and
readers, but not sighted.  I believe there's a section of IFLA in Den
Haag (Intl Federation of Library Associations) devoted to this too.  Let
us know if you need further details.

Another reminder -- a time-tested print code (braille) is about 180
years old and has been adapted and standardized to write foreign
languages, musical scores, mathematical and chemical notations (Nemeth)
and other technical subjects -- all with the same 6-dot block.
