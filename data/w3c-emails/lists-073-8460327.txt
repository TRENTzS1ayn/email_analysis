Hi,

I was wondering if anyone was familiar with Spyglass's conversion
software, Prism.  Apparently, Prism is proxy based system that
reformats HTML documents for display on non-PC devices such
as cellular phones.   I know that proxy servers have been discussed 
and used before to improve document accessibility, but I thought 
it might be worth looking into Prism. I'd be interested to know
if anyone has looked at their conversion routines.

Information on Prism can be found at
