Hi,
Both the au and ui groups are meeting via phone this week.  I'm afraid
I keep having one of those pesky questions cropping up for me.

Basically, how many browser companies have shown a willingness to
modify their browser software.  Various browser companies may show
something like moral support.  However, this type of support can
be fairly cheap.  What happens when they need to expend resources
for changing their software to include accessibility?  For example,
as near as I can tell, Netscape has not shown any interest in taking
on the chore of modifying their browser software to include
aceesibility aspects.  If the WAI decides what is needed in browsers
without participation of browser companies, the browser companies
will have less a sense of ownership of the issues and will be more
reluctant to make changes to their software.

Scott
