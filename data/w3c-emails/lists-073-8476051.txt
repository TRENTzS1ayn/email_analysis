Dear Web Accessibility Initiative Interest Group Member:

REQUEST FOR REVIEW OF ACCESSIBILITY RECOMMENDATIONS IN SMIL:

You will shortly be receiving a posting about accessibility recommendations
for the W3C's "Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language" or SMIL.  SMIL
allows integrating a set of independent multimedia objects into a
synchronized multimedia presentation.  Using SMIL, presentations such as a
slide show synchronized with audio comments, or a video synchronized with a
text stream can be described. 

These accessibility recommendations are being developed through review of
the SMIL specification by the WAI Protocols & Formats Working Group (PF
WG), and discussion between the PF WG and the SYMM Working Group which has
been developing SMIL.

The review materials will be updated to reflect comments received within
the following week.

FORMAT FOR REVIEWING MATERIALS:

You will receive a message from Al Gilman, chair of the PF WG, with a
pointer to several pages summarizing the issues for review.

Preferred format for responses on this review is: please send general
comments to the WAI Interest Group mailing list (w3c-wai-ig@w3.org), and
detailed comments to the protocols and formats working group
(w3c-wai-pf@w3.org).

TIMING OF REVIEW:

We appreciate comments by Saturday, March 7.

NATURE OF PROPOSED RECOMMENDATIONS:

Please bear in mind that the draft recommendations which you will be
reviewing are precisely that: draft recommendations, which after review
will be proposed to the SYMM Working Group of the World Wide Web
Consortium.  While we will be working to ensure that as many of these
recommendations are accepted as possible, there is no guarantee that this
proposal represents the final content of SMIL.  In some cases better ways
to address these issues may emerge after discussion.  We appreciate all WAI
Interest Group members treating the proposed recommendations with this
sensitivity.  

Thank you in advance for your time reviewing this material.  If you have
any questions on this process, please contact Judy Brewer (jbrewer@w3.org)
or Daniel Dardailler (danield@w3.org).

Regards,

Judy Brewer
