In response to Scott Luebking:
I think the issue of industry paricipation central to making changes is one
issue we will be talking about at the UI telephone meeting this week.   I
think both the UI and AU groups have this same problem of getting industry
involved.  Microsoft will be particpating in the UI meeting, so they are
showing leadership in this area.  I think we need to be creative in looking
how accessibility features will be implemented, while at the same time not
trying to compromise what are the accessibility goals.
