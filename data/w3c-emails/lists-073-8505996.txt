Some more details on the ongoing SMIL process and where we are 
asking for your input.  There is a mini-website at

  http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/SMIL

which contains a collection of information about requirements and
scenarios relating to use of multimedia by people with
disabilities or using assistive technology.

There are also private conversations going on at the same time
about technical details of possible SMIL features, but we (the
WAI-PF working group) have agreed with SYMM to host a public
discussion at the level of usage scenarios and operational
requirements so that we can have the benefit of the expertise of
the wider WAI-IG community.
   
Current contents of the mini-WebSite are

   Overview:
          George Kerscher provides his  personal perspective on
          accessible multimedia.
          
   Scenarios:
          A start at a collection of  usage scenarios, kindness of Cindy
          King.
          
   Recommendations:
          A DRAFT of  recommendations for SMIL to maximize accessibility
          is up for discussion.
          
Let us hear from you

As Judy outlined, please send your comments to this list or the WAI-PF
depending on the likelihood of general interest.
   
   Technical Detail
          Please send detailed technical or editorial points to the
           WAI-PF mailing list at <w3c-wai-pf@w3.org>. If you use the
          acronym SMIL in your subject line it will be appreciated.
          
   Operational Considerations
          Follow up on the  Interest Group list at <w3c-wai-ig@w3.org>
          with more general ideas as to how multimedia can serve people
          with disabilities.
          
   We are interested in input that pertains to both thresholds and goals
   for accessibility. Thresholds are the point at which information
   becomes utterly unusable. Goals are scenarios that describe how a
   person with a disability (and possibly using assistive technology) can
   interact with content normally presented as a multimedia show in a way
   that is slick and truly convenient.
   
   SMIL will not cure all the ills of the world but it looks to be a big
   step forward. We need your help to make it a sure-footed step forward,
   as informed as possible by an understanding of how to provide full and
   independent access to information for all.
   
What happens with your Input?

   The WAI-PF team working on the SMIL review will update the public
   pages here with your comments as an operational description of
   accessible multimedia. We will use this description for reference and
   motivation in the private discussion of technical details in the
   developmental specification.
   
   This public area will be kept open and updated to reflect your
   comments until it is retired on or before the public release of a
   Proposed Recommendation for SMIL from the W3C.
