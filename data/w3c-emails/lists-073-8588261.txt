LRK::
One common frame idiom is for one frame to be a table of contents.  When
you pick a link or button in the table of contents it changes the
contents of another frame.  In the present version of your browser, what
happens when the user picks such a link or botton?     

If someone can tell us what other browsers, or combinations of browsers
and screenreaders, do, please join in.

BTW, the author guidelines discuss frames at 
   http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-0203.html#Frames

Also, what would be a good home for collecting this sort of information,
i.e. the behavior of current browsers and browser/screenreader
combinations?  E.g. should it be considered as part of the charter of
the new RC group  http://www.w3.org/WAI/RC/ ?  (Advertisement.
