Hello,
sorry for the short cut, but my system crashed down :-)
So, here is my question again:
How is it possible to describe a list or a table fo rthe blind.
I have only a very small solution that describes the programmed
format of the table. Perhaps there is someone who is much better
in finding a solution. Thanks for all.

By Henrik!
