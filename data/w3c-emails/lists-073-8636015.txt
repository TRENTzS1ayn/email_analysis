These comments are in response to to Cynthia's comments about SMIL.

More and more I see the usefulness of both audio captioning and closed
captioning.  Not just for those with disabilities but for everyone.  As
Cynthia points out, these can be used by people who would like to choose
their mode, for whatever reason.  We all learn differently some people
prefer video to sound, or perhaps text.  For sure some people learn better
if they can use them all.
Universal Design will allow this.  Some last year I read an estimate that
650 million people will be accessing the web with hand held devices within
five years.  Well I don t think they will all be squinting to look at little
tiny pictures of the World Wide Web!  Microsoft wants to put computers in
cars.....I should hope the driver is using voice input, and audio readout
for what is on the screen.  I believe we will see more and more of this type
of thing, and we should be ready to point out the economic advantages.

Sincerely,

Mike Burks
