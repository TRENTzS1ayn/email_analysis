What if, when you click on a link in the left-hand navigation
frame and this results in new data targeted to the main frame,
the active mouse would take you to the hand position signifying
the upper left corner of the main frame where the new content
was?

Would that be too weird?  Have you thought about or tried that?
Sorta snap-to-frame when the logical thread takes you to a
new frame.
