When the browser switches frames, is there any cue that this
has happened?

SL::

I'm not quite clear about the question.  The frame changes in response
to the user's action so the user is expecting a change.  I think the browser
does say something about a new frame so that the user doesn't think
that link changed the web page rather than just the frame.
