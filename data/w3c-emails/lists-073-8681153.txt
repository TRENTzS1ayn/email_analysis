My apologies for re-hashing a three-week old thread... I have been
tardy in responding to a couple comments on force-feedback mice.

Evan Wies responds:
The FEELit mouse is actually an absolute device, so your wish is
granted.  We do tricks in software which dynamically changes the
scale of the workspace so that you get both fine-pitch control and
a large virtual workspace, despite a constrained physical workspace.
The balance between these two can be user-configured.

Evan Wies responds:
Here's some data to support your hunch.  We have conducted a formal
Fitts Task experiment with three conditions -- FEELit with forces
"snapping you to targets", FEELit without forces, and a conventional
mouse.  There was a 61% performance improvement going from FEELit without
forces to FEELit with forces and a 49% performance improvementgoing from
a conventional mouse to FEELit with forces.  With force-feedback, targeting
errors (where the user misses the target) were reduced 26% from a conventional
mouse and reduced 70% from a FEELit without forcces.  This is without any
long-term training on the FEELit (whereas users were well trained on the
conventional mouse).

Evan Wies responds:
The FEELit mouse will be able to change its size dynamically to accomodate
different screen resolutions.  (We will also have to find a solution for
multiple monitors.)  This feature is not implemented now, but will be when
it hits the shelves.  I don't think we considered some of the finer points
of your comment, so thank you for your suggestion!
