Well, there is at least one company that has been doing browser
accessibility since 1996 and is fully involved in the WAI, both in funding
and participation.

Hi,
Getting accessibility into HTML 4.0 was an excellent accomplishment.
I think the next major goal needs to be getting accessibility into
browsers.  Many of the accessibility issues for web pages result from
browsers' being inaccessible.  In order for browsers to become
accessible, the browser companies need to be recruited into participating
in the browser accessibility process.

What resources does WAI have?  I think there are three important ones.
First, there's the association with W3.  The second is support of the White
House and the administration.  The third is money.  If I remember correctly
from the WAI launch last year, WAI was going to be given several
hundreds of thousands of dollars for each of the next couple of years.
I'm figuring there's probably a fair amount of money available.  From
what I understand, Judy is the only staff person for WAI.  I haven't
seen any announcements for grant applications or awarding of grants.
I don't believe that WAI has been many sponsoring conferences.  So, there's
probably a fair amount of money available unless W3 or MIT get hefty cuts.

I wonder if there are some creative ways to use the power of the White House
and some of the WAI funds to recruit browser companies into the browser
accessibility process.  A simplistic idea would be to set up an afternoon
meeting at the White House for CEO's of browser companies and use
some WAI money to fly them in.  The White House could convey the
importance of getting accessibility into browsers so that regulations
aren't needed.


Scott
