addressing scott's comments below:
Not all the browser companies are US based - Opera, which has addressed 
many accessibility issues, and overall done well, is Norwegian. Arachne, 
which is currently pretty poor on accessibility, is from the Czech 
republic. And not all the world is convinced that lunch on the white 
house lawn means anything much at all. South East Asia is a rapidly 
growing market, full of people with disabilities caused by war and its 
aftermath, and Vietnam, to take an example, got its first Service 
Providers online last December.

Perhaps providing more information on who is a good guy and who is a bad 
guy would be helpful for some companies. In places where central planning 
and regulation play a larger role (European countries would be examples 
here) the problem may not be as severe, although I don't have any idea.

I think software people are by and large aware of the ideas, but most of 
them are market-driven, so until there is market demand for products 
which support accessibilty inherently, rather than as an add-on, those 
products are not likely to have a big impact on the web overall.

One way to do this is the regulatory approach. Another is for people to 
boycott sites which do not provide accessibility. And another way is to 
wait until enough people can't get access, and simply point out to the 
content providers that they are missing out on a substantial slice of the 
market.
