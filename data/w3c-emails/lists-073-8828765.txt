Al Gilman asked for people's recomendations about well-designed frmaed sites.

The site www.teddyworks.com.au was a project that got shelved. It was a 
frame based site, which was intended to work equally well without frames. 
A major consideration in the original project was that for it to be 
maintained it would have to have a single version that worked properly, 
rather than be built as two versions of the same site.

Although the representation of pictures probably leaves a bit to be 
desired I would be interested to hear how people find this site - what I 
did right and what I did wrong. As far as I can see it works very well, 
but my vision is always blurred a bit when I am looking at my own work.

Thanks - awaiting the praise and criticism ;)
