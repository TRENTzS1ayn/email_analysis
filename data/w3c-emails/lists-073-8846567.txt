Charles McCN has given us an interesting post on the "business
case."  What do others think?  I have just inserted my working
draft of technology futures in the area Charles touches on.

to follow up on what Charles McCathieNevile said:

Text is cheaper to send but that cost is decreasing rapidly.

Audio is much easier on the ear.  Synthetic speech is grueling to
listen to for any length of time.

AG:: 

It's cheaper today to set up for speech than Braille, and people
are investing madly in the ability to bring that audio capability
to market at lower and lower prices.  Audio access devices are
the telephone and walkman; these are cheap.  It's the computer
that is expensive, not the audio.

Computers will catch up.  The disabled should not let themselves
settle into a backwater of un-supported technology.
