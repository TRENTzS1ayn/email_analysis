        Reply to:   RE>>SMIL text and audio

Regarding sending text or sending audio - this is not an either/or proposition - 
these alternate modes of presenting information in synchronization
with moving audio or video or just graphics are useful for people
with various disabilities as well as for translation purposes.  Some
people prefer movies audio-dubbed into their own language and some prefer
subtitles - SMIL should allow either at the producers' option.
