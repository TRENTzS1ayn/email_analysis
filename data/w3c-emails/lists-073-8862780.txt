Yes, whatever the producer wants, SMIL allows for either.  You
can even do both with a SWITCH wrapping them so that the consumer
can choose among alternatives the producer has provided.

Other things things that are not so nailed down are
transformations that the producer didn't anticipate.
Text-to-speech is the most common of these, but what if the the
consumer has a speech recognition plug-in.  Should they be able
to bring up a subtitle window with what it guesses?
