To follow up on what both Al and Larry have said:
To me it would be important for the producer to package as both sound and
text with the graphics, but it is equally important to for the consumer to
be able to choose what they want.  This is a pretty general rule that is
being forgotten by many in the marketplace.  The consumer is still king and
those who cater to that will always be more successful.  If you can let the
consumer choose whether they want sound or text you will be better off.
This could go for translations into various languages as well.  In general
it is my feeling that good customer service rules should apply in this area
as well as any other area where you are presenting information to people.
After all they can always go somewhere else.

Sincerely,

Michael R. Burks
