Hi,

Last week I came across the Amaya browser or html test program that
the W3C is developping. I have downloaded and installed the browser
to see how it works. With speech wich means JFW without modifications
of any sort the menues worked fine, but I could not find any way to
navigate the html structure itself. The program can present html in
different views and for one of them I do not remember wich one it is
stated that the view will give a good idea about the accessability of
the page. The browser is intended to be used as a test program for
new html and other standards, so it is beeing said that the
user interface may change very quickly. In short is there any idea in
working more with this program?  Since it is beeing written in
Java one simple idea would be to refer the author of the program to
the new IBM guidelines. The url to find the program is
www.w3.org/amaya
