People always have to settle for the level of technology they can afford. 
For many of us, that means buying the least we can possibly survive with 
- it is not about being physically disabled, but financially - if I can 
make do with what someone else throws away I will be able to use the web, 
if not I cannot afford it at all.

And speech does not help deaf people in the slightest. As audio 
technology improves, one part that improves is speech synthesis.

Australian deaf people, as I understand it, learn Auslan as their first 
language - the Australian sign language. It has a grammar and vocabulary 
different to english, which they learn as a second language. Since that 
is the first language tey are likely to encounter, they are already at a 
disadvantage. If it is sent around as audio, and the have to rely on a 
piece of equipment that they have no other use for to make the files go 
back to text, they are likely to be left further and further out.

In the world out there cost is a real factor. As Asia increas its online 
presece, it will be a bigger factor - currently Vietnam is said to have 
3000 computers, it got ISPs in December, and there are 70 million people 
there. The amount of money they have to invest in technology solutions 
for blind people, deaf people, or any other group is limited, and the 
cheapest option has to be shown to be functionally inferior before it can 
be rejected. That includes the case where one person can have the 'best' 
or lots of people can have something that works better than nothing.

(Sorry if I'm harping on - if so tell me to shut up)
