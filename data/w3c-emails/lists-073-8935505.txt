I agree with Charles about the cheapest option, at least to begin with.  The
fact is that before audio cards improved, the cost of a screen reader was
much higher in terms of the equipment needed to make it work.  Is the price
dropping on technology?  Of course it is, but this has to be measured in
terms of the money available in any particular culture.  Americans in
particular have to tune themselves into this.  We need to take a look at the
overall situation in an area or country and make our decisions based on
that, not on what is available in our culture alone.

Sincerely,

Mike Burks
