Don't get me wrong.  Text is the content format which is
accessible (as of now) under the widest variety of disability
conditions.  A functioning backbone formed by text alone (but not
necessarily isolated in text-only pages) is a virtual requirement
for an accessible website.  I think the Page Author Guidelines
say this.

On the other hand, show some of your clients whose first language
is Auslan a SMIL program where there is a video caption track
signed in Auslan, and tell me they'd rather have text.

Unless we take the initiative in demonstrating how the backward
compatible and the leading edge can be combined in a robust,
flexible way we will continue to see new modes of inaccessibility
springing up around hot techniques on the leading edge.
