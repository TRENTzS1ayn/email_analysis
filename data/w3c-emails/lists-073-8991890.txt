In discussing frames, Al pointed out that LINK is largely ignored. Meybe 
that should be rectified. CSS means that the use of LINK is likely to 
enter into people's consciousness a bit more. But its applicability is 
limited by its generality - like META, it may be too broadly specified to 
get a good running as a useful idea.

It is also possible that the use of multi-lingual sites and the LNK 
REL-alternate LANG=xx may promote use of the idea. All the multilingual 
sites I have looked at (I think there have been about 4) have simply 
offered links using the A HREF system. (although I may be wrong - I have 
not yet tried to set my preferred language to sometihng other than english)

Perhaps the mistake was made in introducing frames seperately rather than 
by using LINK to create the connections and attributes like width where 
format control was desired. Have we lost a good idea, or are we 
justwaiting to use it really well?
