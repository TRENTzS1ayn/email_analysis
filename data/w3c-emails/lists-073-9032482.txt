Mike Burks, after viewing the URL (http://www.melbourne.org ) offered by
Charles McCathieNevile as an example of a bad frames site, said:

To which I'd like to reply:

I believe we'd benefit more from an example of good and proper use of
frames on an accessible site. Not only does an "inaccessible sites list"
humiliate the designer who, perhaps, did not know better (or, as indicated
in Mr. McCathieNevile's mention, chose to disregard the information), it
does not, in my opinion, serve as a constructive aid in teaching people
more appropriate design.

This is not Driver's Ed, in other words. We see enough "crash films" in the
course of day-to-day web surfing to know what we want to avoid. Let's
emphasize what we want to promote.

Respectfully submitted,

Re? Dolloff

P.S. My apologies to the group if this message is duplicated. I think I
originally made a mistake in the address.
