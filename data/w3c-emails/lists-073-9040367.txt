I agree with Al that we must take great care in posting sites that "cast
the first stone" since our own web sites are often less-than-perfect and
those who are most offended already have an archive of URLs of even more
less-than-perfect exemplars of the problem.  That is what we must point
to: that there is a problem and that the people with the problem need
(deserve?) help with it, particularly since at the present time ALT tags
only work when put in by the author.

My subject line pokes a little fun at the balkanization of what we try
to do because each working group, interest group, whatever is so clearly
made up of a mutual membership and never have I been made more
forcefully aware of the truth of one of my favorite maxims: "We are all
members of one another."

Many of my acquaintances and correspondents get all mushy when I explain
what I do for a living but actually it's undertaken because the shared
intimacy of groups like this has been shown to prevent further heart
attacks in people like me with coronary artery disease.
