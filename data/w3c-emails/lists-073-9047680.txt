I think we need to both, the point is to good sites should be brought to the
fore and the bad ones should hear from people.  For two reasons,

1. So they know that it makes a difference.
2. So that if it was inadvertent(in this case it apparently was not) they
can correct it.

Ignoring the issue will not solve it.  The ADA did not get passed because
people only presented positive images.  It takes both.  Make no mistake it
is a matter of economics and until this becomes apparent in one way or
another to some organizations, they will do nothing.  Again if this was not
true the ADA would not have been necessary.  And neither would any other law
or policy that promotes equality.

Sincerely,

Mike Burks

Mike Burks, after viewing the URL (http://www.melbourne.org ) offered by
Charles McCathieNevile as an example of a bad frames site, said:

To which I'd like to reply:

I believe we'd benefit more from an example of good and proper use of
frames on an accessible site. Not only does an "inaccessible sites list"
humiliate the designer who, perhaps, did not know better (or, as indicated
in Mr. McCathieNevile's mention, chose to disregard the information), it
does not, in my opinion, serve as a constructive aid in teaching people
more appropriate design.

This is not Driver's Ed, in other words. We see enough "crash films" in the
course of day-to-day web surfing to know what we want to avoid. Let's
emphasize what we want to promote.

Respectfully submitted,
