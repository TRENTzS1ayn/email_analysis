For the case of multimedia presentations, the SYMM Working Group
is working on an approach.  For the general case that you are
talking about, no, but it's on our radar screen.

"Description - Next Generation" is one of the functional areas
where I said to the Coordination Group that we need a development
effort, and they directed me to develop a briefing package and
run it through my WAI-PF group first.  I have not discharged that
action item yet.  I would regard the scenario you describe as
falling in the "Description - Next Generation" area.  We will at
least be batting ideas around in the meetings at CSUN which may
result in more concrete work items in this area.  Finding a
solution involves looking at more than protocols and formats, I
suspect.

Other old business in my estimation includes Frames, Tables, and
dynamic content.  All are areas where the current achieved
accessibility is below what we want and a planned development
task may be required to make adequate progress, in my personal
opinion.
