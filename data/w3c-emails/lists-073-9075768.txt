well said. this list and group has spent way too much time
in speculating about things like the meaning of alt and
title while leaving the poor end user out there to suffer.

I've expressed my displeasure at this privately many times
in the last few months-- it's good to know that I am not
alone in this.

And yes, I concurr that the WWW is becoming more and more
unusable daily.
