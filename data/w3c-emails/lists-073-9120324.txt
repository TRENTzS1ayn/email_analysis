Dear Web Accessibility Initiative Interest Group Participant,

The message below is a Call for Participation for a WAI working group on
Education & Outreach.  

A few things for background -- at the November WAI meetings in Austin, the
WAI Interest Group decided that it would be useful to form an interest
group to focus specifically on education & outreach.  Of the people
initially interested in education & outreach at that meeting, some people
expressed an interest in helping develop materials on accessibility
improvements in HTML 4.0 -- the reference piece at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/html4-access is an outcome of that.
Another group of people expressed interest in reviewing a draft charter,
which they did.  The draft charter also got some review by W3C, who
recommended that it become a working group because it has such specific
deliverables in terms of the educational products it will review or produce.

If you are interested in this area, please read through the charter
carefully, including the time commitment we are requesting people make.  If
you're interested in education & outreach, but want to follow the
discussion more generally, just being on the WAI Interest Group will enable
you to follow the highlights of the discussion and to know immediately when
new materials are available.

And if you have questions or comments, please e-mail me!  Thanks,

- Judy
