Dear all,
under the point WWW access for blinds on my homepage:
http://www.fh-worms.de/~quintel
you find several sections. Inside teh sections there are the first
results of my code-generator. Each file has two parts which are
separated by a line <HR>. The first part is the original code,
teh second part the new generated code. If you want to see the
result, load the second code in lynx and you will see that such 
a HTML-Code-result will be readable by a screenreader. Of course,
this is the first try. I will go on by writing a screenreader
especially for AYE. I think at the end of march I will be able
to release the first beta-version of AYE. At this point you will
see the results on my homepage. At the moment the result are not
optimal but it is a beginning.

Greetings 

Henrik

PS: If you have any suggestions please feel free an e-mail me. Thanks.
