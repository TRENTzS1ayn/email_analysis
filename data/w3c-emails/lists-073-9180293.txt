One of the principal shortcomings of HTML as it currently stands is that
it does not provide a markup system for the representation of mathematics.
This problem may be addressed, as previously discussed on this mailing
list, by integrating XML content (including, therefore, MathML) into HTML
documents, provided that accessibility requirements are satisfied by
ensuring that the user agent has access to the underlying semantics of the
expression.

A hierarchical scheme such as that developed for the SELECT element, which
can categories the input fields of user input forms within a conceptual
structure, should also be included in the agenda. Moreover, the importance
of a generic language such as HTML which is widely supported by user agent
software and distinguishes semantic content and structure from
presentation, should be emphasised as a key to achieving the goal of
medium independence which is an essential aspect of accessibility.
