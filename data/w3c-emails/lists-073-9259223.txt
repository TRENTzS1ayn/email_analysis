First thing, pickup a copy of ?Inside Dynamic HTML? by Scott Isaacs.
Published by Microsoft Press, ISBN #1-57231-686-1.  The book?s jacket claims
that the ?complete, fully searchable contents of the book in HTML? is
available on the included CD-ROM.

Also, review our Dynamic HTML site at
http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/default.htm
<http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/default.htm> .

I?ll be posting regular information about DHTML and it?s accessibility
implications, good and bad, to this list as we move forth.

One thing to note ? Dynamic HTML and the Document Object Model work, was at
least partially driven by Scott Isaacs, a Program Manager here at Microsoft
who is really a friend of accessibility.  He pushed hard for a lot of
accessibility enhancements with regard to forms in the HTML working group
and was harping on me a year ago about how an HTML object model can be great
for accessibility.

What kind of things can the UA group do to influence the DOM
WG and
probably more important what does the UA group need to
understand about the
issues facing the DOM WG?
