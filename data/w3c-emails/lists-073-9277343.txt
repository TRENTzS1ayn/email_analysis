Unfortunately I do not properly understand what you are seeking. If you
are referring to ACSS, then the only implementation of which I am aware is
T.V. Raman's Emacspeak in cooperation with the W3 browser. The latter
includes a default style sheet which specifies certain ACSS properties.

To avoid unnecessary misunderstanding, I would suggest that Emacspeak and
similar software, which interprets the markup together with audio style
sheets, should not be referred to as a "screen reader", since its function
is not to read the screen but rather to produce an audio representation of
the document. It constitutes an "audio formatter" in T.V. Raman's sense of
the term.
