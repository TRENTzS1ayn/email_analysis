My apologies if this isn't the sort of thing to be discussed on this list.
Stripping out the advertising nature of what follows, it seems like these
are some of the folks that should be approached about automating accessible
web design.  Does anyone know much about this particular package or the
category in general?  Which tools do the best job of creating attractive
and accessible pages?
