Chris,

First let me tell you that your company is unusual in that you are willing
to look for help for your site because is not accessible.

 My experience has been that even when a company wants to make their site
accessible they DON'T want another company to do the retrofit, even when it
is their specialty, they want the company that has the contract to maintain
their site to do it. For free, of course.


I would be interested in talking to other accessibility "retrofiters" like
myself to see how they are doing with the current market, and if there's an
association I would be interested in joining. Ditto for a listserv.

Kathy
