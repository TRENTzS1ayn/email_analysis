Creating an Association and listserve would be a BIG undertaking, so before
we go rolling off I think there are a couple of things to consider:

1) Is there an Association, or division of html/webauthors assn that covers
this area? (I don't want to reinvent the wheel) (research needed)

2) Is there a listserv (ditto research)

3) If not where would we put it.  (www3?  ilusa.com?)

4) Where to get the money for it (grant writer? [I have one, but more is
good])

5) Who will maintain it (listserv)(webpage)

And do we want to put in the time necessary to make it a sucess? 
I'm very interested and will start the research, and get back to you with
the results.

As to your comment on getting jobs if the company principals are disabled,
I haven't run into that yet, being a small company or individual is much
worse in my estimation.
