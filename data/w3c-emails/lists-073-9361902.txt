This could be my cue.  The HTML Writers Guild (www.hwg.org)
is very interested in the accessibility issue and we're
working to promote the concept within the industry and educate
our members -- many of whom _are_ freelancers/contractors --
on the importance of designing for universal accessibility.

I need to run off and do some user support in my "day job"
at Claremont Graduate University right now, but when I get
back, I'll write some more about the Guild's plans and
activities in this area, including our "Accessibility Month"
in April, and our Accessibility Guidelines Implemenation
project.
