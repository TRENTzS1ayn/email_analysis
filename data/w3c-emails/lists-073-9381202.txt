Dear WAI IG Members,

Immersion will be offering a demonstration of our FEELit force-feedback 
mouse at the CSUN conference this weekend.  The demonstration will be held 
in a room of the LA Airport Marriot in open house fashion on Saturday March 
21.  It will include applications working within Windows, allowing the user 
to feel icons, window borders menus, etc. using active force feedback (not 
simple brakes or buzzers).  The room number will be posted by the hotel 
elevators.  We'll also make sure the concierge at the hotel and the 
receptionist at Immersion (1-888-467-1900) are aware of the room number. 
 We will be there from 10am to 1pm.  Appetizers and beverages will be 
served.  If you can attend, your feedback would be valued.
If your schedule conflicts with this time, we may be able to accommodate 
you on Friday morning.  Leave a voicemail at (888) 467-1900 x238 with your 
contact information and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
