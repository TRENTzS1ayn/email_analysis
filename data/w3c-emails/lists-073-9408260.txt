One example is that in browsers that can ignore CSS (through either design
or user option) CSS based spatial formatting can be eliminted.  Visual
button effects can also be created in style sheets, so people do not have
to use GIF images to create the effects.  A URL to an example follows:

The Trace Center may also have examples, contact Wendy Chisholm.
