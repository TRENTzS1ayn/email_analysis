Hi, Joe
I believe your point that a blind person focuses on one window or one
frame at a time is quite valid.  That's why the approach I used in
my browser with showing a single frame at a time and letting the user switch
between frames seemed to work pretty well.  Providing a menu with
information about each frame helps the blind user choose the
appropriate frame.
