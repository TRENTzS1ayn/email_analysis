An idea I like -- and one that will be playing a role in the
HTML Writers Guild's AGI project (www.hwg.org/opcenter/projects/agi.html,
under construction) -- is to do a "retrofitting" of a "bad" site,
and then present both before and after views, including comments
on how the accessibility "upgrades" were done, and what exactly
was involved.
