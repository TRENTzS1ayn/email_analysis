Has any study been done on html editors and which ones write to HTML 3.2 or
4.0 correctly (and hopefully somewhat neatly) and without using proprietary
code or doing something weird so not to be UA?

Especially in non-profit and educational sites, these pages are going up on
very low budgets and by people who because they do computer support or
manage the data, are expected to author the web site as well.
