> over the administration's policy on making Web pages compatible for the
> disabled.  I respectfully ask you to review the administration's policy on

> Text of Response
> 
> I am responding to your letter on behalf of your constituent, [],
> regarding accessibility of "web pages" on the Internet to people with
> visual disabilities.
> 
> The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires State and local
> governments and places of public accommodation to furnish appropriate
> auxiliary aids and services where necessary to ensure effect communication
> with individuals with disabilities, unless doing so would result in a
> fundamental alteration to the program or service or in an undue burden.
> 28
> C.F.R. Sec. 36.303; 28 C.F.R. Sec. 35.160.  Auxiliary aids include taped
> texts, Brailled materials, large print materials, and other methods of
> making visually delivered material available to people with visual
> impairments.
>         
> Covered entities under the ADA are required to provide effective
> communication, regardless of whether they generally communicate through
> print media, audio media, or computerized media such as the Internet.
> Covered entities that use the Internet for communications regarding their
> programs, goods, or services must be prepared to offer those
> communications
> through accessible means as well.
>         
> Mr. [] suggests compatibility with the Lynx browser as a means of assuring
> accessibility of the Internet.  Lynx is, however, only one of many
> available options.  Other examples include providing the web page
> information in text format, rather then exclusively in graphic format.
> Such text is accessible to screen reading devices used by people with
> visual impairments.  Instead of providing full accessibility through the
> Internet directly, covered entities may also offer other alternate
> accessible formats, such as Braille, large print, and/or audio materials,
> to communicate the information contained in web pages to people with
> visual
> impairments.  The availability of such materials should be noted in a text
> (i.e., screen-readable) format on the web page, along with instructions
> for
> obtaining the materials, so that people with disabilities using the
> Internet will know how to obtain the accessible formats.

> The Internet is an excellent source of information and, of course, people
> with disabilities should have access to it as effectively as people
> without
> disabilities.  A number of web sites provide information about
> accessibility of web pages, including information about new developments
> and guidelines for development of accessible web pages.  Examples include:

> These sites may be useful to you or your constituent in exploring the
> accessibility options on the Internet.  In addition, the Department of
> Justice has established an ADA home page to educate people about their
