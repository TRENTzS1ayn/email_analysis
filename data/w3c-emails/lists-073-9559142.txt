All,

I think both need to be done.  If everyone was ethical and responsible there
would be no need for the ADA in the first place, and people with
disabilities would not have the horrendous unemployment rate that they do.
Such a site with the laws would be useful.  It will also be difficult to put
together, but it should be done.

Just my opinion.
