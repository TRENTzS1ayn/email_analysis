Hi,
I think that such a web site is important.  Part of my believe is that
disabled people need to be self-advocates and such a site would give
them some of the necessary tools.  I lean towards using the carrot and stick
approach.  I usually like to start off with a soft sell, i.e. just giving
them the information about what is needed.  If no response, clarifying
more about how the current condition is affecting my life as a fellow
human being.  If still no response, then I go to the stick bin.  (The web site
could be the "stick bin".)  Often, I need to only lightly hit them on
the shins with the stick to get them to pay attention.

Having worked at a public university on and off, I've seen enlightenment work
only part of the time.  Many times enlightenment loses to budgetary bulliness
or bureaucratic backwardness.

Scott
