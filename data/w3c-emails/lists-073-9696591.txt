I think you've done a wonderful job of creating a page that looks good
in Netscape and Lynx.  If it looks good in Lynx, it probably sounds
good, too.

I have three criticisms, and they are all very minor - take them all
with the understanding that I think your site looks great.

(1) The description "typing pc" is very unclear.  I use Lynx as my
primary browser, and this was the only thing I didn't understand.
Maybe "cartoon PC typing on its own keyboard" would be better.

(2) This is the reason I'm posting this here instead of mailing Joyce
directly.  <img alt="purple line">.  While designing for access, it's
important to consider the sighted viewers too!  I see three audiences
for the alt text: graphic browser users with image loading turned off,
text browser users, and visually impaired users.  Those with image
loading turned off want to know whether to load the image.  For them,
an indication of whether or not a line is interesting enough to load
is worthwhile.  But for text browser users, a snippet of text doesn't
have the same effect as a rule does - it doesn't break up the page in
the same way.  Using ASCII-graphic alt text helps them.  And I think
that most screen readers skip most punctuation.  I think a combination
alt text would work well for all three audiences: maybe something like
<img alt="purple line________________________________"> and
<img alt="zig-zag line /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\"> would
work well.

(3) Change the background graphic.  It's distracting to me - I'd go
with something non-textual.  Toning it down may have prevented screen
readers from trying to read it, but now it's nearly unreadable to the
sighted, and I spent a little while trying to figure out what it was.
When it first loaded, I honestly thought it was Hebrew.
