My point is that the rule should not only provide separation for the
visually impaired users and graphical users, but *also* for the text
browser users.  The short alt text *doesn't* work for me in Lynx; it
looks almost like a heading called "purple line", not like a divider.

Moreover, ". ." is inadequate description for those who are using a
graphical browser but have image loading turned off.  They have no
idea what the graphic is - it could be a pair of eyes, a male upper
torso, a couple of pebbles, or two distant UFOs.

The ASCII graphics in alt text make a separator apparent to the Lynx
user, but this may get in the way of screen readers.  I'm looking for
a solution that will provide visual impact in a text browser, a
description for those with graphics turned off, and appropriate
behavior for an aural user.  Anyone have any other suggestions?

The text in this case is bitmapped in the background; I was a little
surprised at the suggestion that a screen reader might attempt to read
it.  I didn't think GUI screen readers relied on OCR - browsing the
Web would be a sort of dadaist hell.  I found the graphic distracting
as a sighted user.
