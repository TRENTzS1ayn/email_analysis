Messages that are purely reviews of Joyce's site probably are
inappropriate.  However, a lot of good points about general
accessibility design have been raised, and messages relating to those
should be kept on the list, IMO.

I find that a strange suggestion.  If the page is readable in Lynx (as
you note), why make yet another version?  And one without hyperlinks,
at that?  Is there anyone browsing the Web without the capability to
parse HTML?  I suppose some desparate soul may be telnet'ing to port
80 and downloading the text into a file, but that would be odd and
unusual.

More importantly, suggesting that alternate file versions are
important for accessibility damages the accessibility initiative in
two ways.  First of all, if HTML is insufficient for access, then
there's no point in designing accessible HTML.  Why not go for an all-
out, rendered into GIF with JavaScript orgy?  If I need a text-only
version any way, I might as well.  Secondly, ACCESSIBILITY MUST BE
EASY.  Most people can see.  While I want my site to be visible to as
many as possible, every extra piece of work necessary moves the border
of "possible".  Making duplicate versions of every file quickly pushes
the visually challenged into the "impossible" side, especially for
large Web sites.

Right now, Lynx renders <hr> as a series of underscores.  Does this
bother you - does your screen reader read underscores?

The best solution, it seems to me, is <hr src="...">, which will still
render as an ordinary <hr> in Lynx.  Unfortunately, this proposal
wasn't adopted for HTML 4.0.  The second best solution seems to be
<img alt="some description _______________">.  Underscores will get in
the way of a screen reader and Lynx to exactly the same degree that
other rules do, since that's how Lynx renders <hr>s.  I was hoping
with the varying ASCII graphic versions of the line to convey more of
the author's intent, but if that's detrimental, than underscores will
suffice.
