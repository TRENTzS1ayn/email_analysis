[asked about synchronized presentation of sight/sound/text of a
speech, for example]

The W3C is working on a way to do this via the Synchronized Multimedia
Integration Language (SMIL).  The WAI-PF group has been working with
the SYMM group on access-related issues, see 
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/SMIL/> for some further information.

This is being used in the next-generation talking book technology
under development by the DAISY consortium.  There was a session at
CSUN about this.  Check at
<http://www.dinf.org/csun_98/csun98.htm> for more information.
