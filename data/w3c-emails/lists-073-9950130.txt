A somewhat snide note from me -- while I don't consider Bobby to 
necessarily be the be-all, end-all evaluator of accessibility, I
find it amusing that these "experts" earned 3 stars for their
homepage, while the CGU homepage (who they sent their ad to) rates
4 stars from Bobby.

(Caveat:  The rest of the CGU site is being only very slowly
converted to better accessibility standards -- especially since
it's maintained by about 3 dozen people.)
