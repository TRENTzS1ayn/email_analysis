I'm not impressed with organizations that use fear and uncertainty to 
sell their services. I am in the process of developing a network of 
webmasters that will help run accessibility tests on websites for 
free. Working with school computer classes and sympathetic 
fellow webmasters we should be able to test, give advice, and a bit 
of consulting free of charge. 

We believe it is enough to ask other webmasters to make the small 
adjustments and in some cases sacrifices to make their websights more 
accessible. But then to shear these good hearted sheep of $100 is 
not right. Either you are in this to help, or it's just another scam.

I agree with Kynn. I don't do business with spammers. And if you do 
happen to know of someone that needs such services, maybe together we 
can supply the services free.
