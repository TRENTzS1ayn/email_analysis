You write: "as far as the laws they name, things are nebulous at best."

WL:: The laws aren't really "nebulous" just unenforced.  There is very
little obfuscation in what Titles II and III of the ADA say.  The fact
that there is little case law doesn't mean that: a) there won't be any;
b) that it's hard to tell what the case law will be when it comes down.
It is very clear that "we, the people" intend for the Web to be
accessible and it is unacceptable for government entities to buy
inaccessible software.  The fact that there as many violators of this
law's spirit and letter as there are of speed limits doesn't change the
fact that we know what the law is.
