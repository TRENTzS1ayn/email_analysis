I haven't been following this discussion closely, but this got me
to pay closer attention. As the organizer of the "Campaign for a 
Non-Browser Specific WWW", I get several messages a week requesting
that I review people's sites for accessibility. I generally don't
have time to do an indepth review, but I make sure to do at least 
a quick once over to catch the most common accessibility issues.

It sounds like there is already some sort of online accessibility
volunteer review group being put together. If this is the case,
I'd like to volunteer my help, and I'd like to do what I can
to promote this service from the campaign page. If I misunderstood
what you're doing Claude, please clarify your plans, because I'd
definitely like to see something like this come to be.

If you're unfamiliar with the campaign, you can stop by:
