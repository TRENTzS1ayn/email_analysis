SoftQuad have been working with WAI groups to get HotMetal Pro doing the 
right thing. I will try out their evaluation thing tomorrow. I uspect it 
is a step forwards from what I have seen in the past. (not that it is 
difficult to make a few, but they are to be applauded for going about the 
proces)
