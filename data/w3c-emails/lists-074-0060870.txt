Please add RDF to your toolkit for building that solution.  

It may provide a means of connecting the semantics, and the
solutions using concept graphs captured in RDF schemas may work
better or be better accepted than solutions which are limited to
other media in their defining scripts.

For scientific names, a <SPAN CLASS="botany"> can be used to wrap
"vinca minor" but it would seem that RDF could be brought to play
to capture the semantics "as used in" that binds the
CLASS="botany" name usage to, for example, a botanical dictionary
or standard text where the name is explained further.  And yes,
it can also be done in XML with namespaces as in <SPAN
terminology:domain="botany" etymology:base-lang="LA"
terminology:definitive-reference="(Dublin Core or ISBN URI for an
authoritative source)">.
