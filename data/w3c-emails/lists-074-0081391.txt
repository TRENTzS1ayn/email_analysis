Gosh, some people simply delight in being dicks.  Excuse the crudity
of my expression, but this editorial has got me riled.

When I calm down, I'll write a longer, more reasoned response to the

assuming the World Wide Web is a visual medium, which seems to be
the entire basis of his petty, mean-spirited argument.
