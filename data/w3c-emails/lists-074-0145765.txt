I agree. 

<I> has more meaning than SPAN. Span has no meaning,
<I> conveys typographical information. There is reason to exclude
typographical information. It shouldn't come instead of structure/meaning
but can come in addition. For example:
<H1><FONT face="arial">My main heading</FONT></H1>
is fine (although I wouldn't bother...). 
<FONT face="Arial" size=6>My main heading</FONT> is bad markup.
