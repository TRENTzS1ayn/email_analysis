Shawn: "...there were other means of access to
this information..."

WL:: Perhaps the Web is "already there" because in fact there are not
other means of access to this information in many places.  Try on  a
Sunday to get information from a transit company.  Increasingly the Web
is the main source.  Navigating through voice mail type messages on a
telephone is really a nightmare even when you're just trying to find out
how close your credit card is to maxed out!
