For your information.

By the way, Melbourne time is 16 hours ahead of Eastern (US) time at the 
moment, so 9am Friday is 5pm Thursday (Eastern. I don't know about the 
rest of the US, and I have a vague idea that it is about 11pm in England)

BLIND CITIZENS CONVENTION ON THE WEB.

Blind Citizens Australia will hold its 24th annual National Convention in
Melbourne this coming weekend, from Friday 20 to Sunday 22 November 1998.   

Unfortunately this year's Convention had to be postponed, from early
October, due to a major interruption to the supply of natural gas used for
cooking and the supply of hot water for bathing and laundry.   

Blind Citizens Australia is this country's representative organisation of
people who are blind or vision impaired.  

It has a proud record of achievement as Advocate, Information Provider and
as a forum for peer support and leadership development.  

Each year Blind Citizens from across Australia come together for the Blind
Citizens Convention.  

This year's Convention will be available to blind people and their
associates from across Australia and around the world, through a special
Real Audio webcast.  

This year's Convention features sessions on Information Access, Blindness
Service delivery and Access to the Built Environment.   Other Convention
sessions will review the organisation's project work in areas such as
Telecommunications for people with disabilities, access to Vocational
Education & Training and Digital Television access.
