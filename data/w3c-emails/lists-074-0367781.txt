Just a clarification -- I don't think the transit agency was sued, as this
term normally implies a lawsuit in court.  It is my understanding that an
administrative complaint was filed with the agency having ADA regulatory
authority in this area.  The first step in any such administrative process
is an investigation which seeks a voluntary resolution to the case.  In this
sense, the ADA is a way for covered entities to be asked to engage in a
resolution process that often would not occur by a simple communication from
the individual agrieved.

Regards,
Jamal

   NHello listers!
   NI, too, sympathize with Mr. Tamez's situation. Sudden blindness is
   Nenough to put anyone on edge.
   NHowever, his course of action, in my opinion, may have been a bit
   Nhasty. Without the complete picture, however, my opinion may also
   Nbe hasty. The concern I have is if he wins his case, how many other
   Nsites will be sued because their formatting isn't accessible? When
   NI encounter a site that isn't accessible, I write a detailed e-mail
   Nto the site's administrator in hopes he/she will respond and ask
   Nhow to make the site accessible. I've had a few sites respond so I
   Ndon't think suits are necessary. Granted, I've not seen any changes
   Nmade to those that I've advised, but I think a suit against every
   Ninaccessible site would take a lifetime and more to rectify.
   NIs there an amendment to the ADA that includes accessible material
   Non the Internet? Or, is it included in some other part of the law's
   Ntext? This information might glean some light onto why Mr. Tamez is
   Nsuing the Bay Transit Authority.
   NMr. Tamez, I wish you the best of luck, but be prepared for at
   Nleast a 3 year wait for your case to be brought up for a hearing.
   NConsider this when you're still locked out of this page's
   Ninformation. If, perhaps you try to work with the site
   Nadministrator to help him/her understand why the page isn't
   Naccessible rather than sue the organization, you might get a
   Nquicker result.
