I mentioned yesterday that I forwarded information regarding the Washington
Post column to another columnist at the Boston Globe. The Globe columnist,
Hiawatha Bray has, among other things, a well known weekly column called
"Plugged In" which appears each Thursday. He's willing to highlight the
Raspberry/Tamez issue in tomorrows Globe. As it turns out, he knows
Raspberry pretty well -- and was shocked by the article. 

He and I talked this morning -- we were both wondering if anyone on this
list (or others) knew how to get in touch with Randy Tamez? Preferably by
telephone, but e-mail is fine too. 

I've researched this a little bit and found that Randy has been working
diligently in recent years to ensure transportation accessibility.

If you do have contact information for Randy, please DON'T post it publicly
on the listservs. If you would be kind enough to just send me email, I can
work it from there. Send email to me at: paciello@ma.ultranet.com

Thanks much.
