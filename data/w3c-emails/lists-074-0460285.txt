Just a quick note about listserv discussions -- please try to keep your
topic of discussion consistent with the subject header. For example, the
last few notes have been discussing editors for web pages, but the Subject
titles relate to the Washington Post article. Having said that, here are my
thoughts regarding an easy-to-use editor:

A great editor that supports the complete HTML 4.0 specification, is easy
to use and, at the same time, very extensible is UltraEdit
(www.ultraedit.com). I have been working with the vendor to support
internal accessibility macros to further enhance it's capabilties. You can
download an evaluation version off the web site. It's a menu based editor
with fantastic programming support (preconfigured for HTML, C/C++, VB, Java
and Perl). Support for XML is included as well. 

UltraEdit's creator, Ian Mead, is committed to supporting accessibility
features in future versions. I have used it with a couple of screen readers
and found it pretty accessible.  

Regards,

Mike
