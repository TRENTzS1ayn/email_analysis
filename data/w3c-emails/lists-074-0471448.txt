I disagree; I think that his bigotry needs to be challenged and
refuted, especially since he's making absolutely outlandish
statements in a national (international?) forum that's likely

for the disabled comes up in Congress, for our representatives to
think back to how it's "common sense" that the blind should be 
restricted from using the web?  I sure don't fancy that idea.
