emacs psgml-mode has a keystroke sequence C-c C-v which invokes a
validator (psgml by default), as well as C-c C-o which parses the
document and jumps to the next irregularity, be it bad syntax or
implied opening/closing tags.  (It also has a "normalize" function
which inserts all implied opening/closing tags.)  It actually reads
the DTD when you first open the document, so it doesn't need to be
updated when the standard changes; just put the new DTD in the right
place, and you're ready to go.  Every "web page editor" I've heard of
can only cope with the tags known to the authors before it was
released.  Want a THEAD in that table?  Sorry, you're outta luck.
