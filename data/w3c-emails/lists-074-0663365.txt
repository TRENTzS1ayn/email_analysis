use <HTML LANG="EN">

There is an ISO reference for the Language codes, but I can't recall what 
it is. If you look for the Internationalisation (i18n) activity from the 
w3c home page <http://www.w3.org/> you should be able to find it. If 
nobody has posted a better reference than that I can give a URL Monday. 
(It's early saturday morning now. I don't much want to go to work this 
weekend)

cheers
