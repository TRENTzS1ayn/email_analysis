Sometimes when trying to explain the importance of accessibility
to web authors, and they run out of reasonable arguments against
it :), they produce something akin to the following:

   But I'm an artiste'!  My work is purely graphical and
   means nothing to someone is blind; they are not the
   target audience for my gallery of visual artwork, and
   so I don't need to be concerned with them.

What do you feel is the best response to this -- or are they
right?
