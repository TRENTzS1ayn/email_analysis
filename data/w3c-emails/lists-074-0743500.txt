Heya folks, I just came across another user agent that isn't a
traditional browser -- thought I'd share it with you.

HP makes a program that allows for printing of a web page on one
of their printers, independent of whether you've got a web
browser installed or even running.  They call it 'HP Web
PrintSmart' and it does stuff like better formatting, alignment
to the page intelligently, etc, plus you can add "stylesheets"
(in apparently a proprietary format -- not CSS, sadly) to change
the appearance.  The program itself is free.

This is relevant for this list because it's important for us to
break people out of the thinking that there are only "the big two"
[sic] browsers looking at their pages, and that they only need to
design for those visual, onscreen programs.  In the future, things
like this application -- which does everything a browser does,
just displays on a different output device -- will become more
common.

Here's the URL:

(This is not an ad; I don't work for HP.)
