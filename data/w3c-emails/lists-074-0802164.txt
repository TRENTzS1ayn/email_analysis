The demo that I got last month included the software synthesizer.

Guy,

Did you get your install key?  You have to do that by email and
yes, it involves a person at the other end.  ProdWorks is a small
business.  I believe that the entire online help is on the Web in
public, so the first [and second?] round of questions for support
can possibly be avoided if you RTFM.
