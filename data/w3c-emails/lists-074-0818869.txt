My first thought was ok know your buyers. But that is chancy, because people
with disabilities tell others about great sites so customers can be won or
lost through referrals! Just because I'm not going to buy a motorcycle
doesn't mean I'll never suggest a site to someone else, if it is Accessible.
& other things being equal that open mindedness could make the sale. Word of
mouth, & now email, can help or hinder sales. BTW I'm not suggesting
anything organized, I'm thinking family & acquaintances.
