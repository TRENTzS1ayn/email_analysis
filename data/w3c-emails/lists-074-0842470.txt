Dear Craig,

Again, please include a COMPLETE sign-off in your posts to this list, with
your e-mail and company name.

I do not want people to get the two of us confused. This could cause a great
deal of confusion as time goes on.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

I suppose what could be said varies according to the particulars,  but one
response I have is that there's a way it's easy to leave out the social
context of peoples' lives when we start talking about "disabled users,"
almost as though they live in some alien land without friends, families and
colleagues whose abilities may differ from theirs.

For example, take the case of someone who's blind who has a friend (with no
vision disabilities) who's very interested in the culture of pre-Hellenic
Greece. If that blind person found a graphically-rich site devoted to the
subject and were given enough information about the graphics to have a
sense of what was there, the site could be shared with the friend and their
interaction might provide a broadened context in which both persons could
appreciate the graphics more than either could individually.

Regards,
Craig Wilson
