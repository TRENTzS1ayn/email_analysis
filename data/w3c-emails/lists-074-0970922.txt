Sounds like they could use a good test plan and testers!  This is a possible
business opportunity for PWDs!  I could write their test plan!

When I view the page with Netscape Navigator 4.0, the graphic "ftsintro.gif"
which has alternate text of "Federal Telecommunications Service" actually
contains an entire paragraph of text, which begins:

Federal Technology Service [not "Telecommunications"!]

GSA's Federal Technology Service (FTS) has only one business: to provide its
customers with value-added information technology solutions and network
services. ...

And so on for several more sentences. If you're getting this text with
PWWebSpeak, then they must be delivering different versions of the page
based on the browser in use. If not, they've recreated exactly the problem
which led to Tamez' lawsuit.
