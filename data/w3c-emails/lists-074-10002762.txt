OKOKOK. I was going to keep silent but, regretably, I can't.

Rail all you want, but you cannot keep language and language use from
changing. Language is a living thing which grows, changes, and sometimes
dies over generations. Consider how the Anglo-Saxons protested speaking
French, or how the French still oppose other languages creeping into theirs
(Vive Le Weekend!).

For a while, I was collecting computer words which popped into the
language: cyberkiosk, e-tailing, infobahn, etc.

And, for what it's worth, the New York Times used emoticons in their
crossword puzzle two years ago. All the News That's Fit to Print, even
sideways!

See, Ma! A masters in linguistics can be used in everyday life!
