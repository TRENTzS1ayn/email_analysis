Thank you so much for responding to my inquiry.

I found your responses helpful, and I always instruct web authors who
consult with us to follow these standards. 

Now I'm wondering which of the screen reader vendors are incorporating the
recognition of the new HTML 4.0 elements into their functionality? In other
words, will future versions of JAWS For Windows, Window-Eyes, etc. be able
to render a table as desired in the guidelines?

In previous messages to the list, several authors have mentioned working
with web editors to ensure that the editors help the web author create
accessible pages. Is a similar effort underway to ensure that the assistive
technology vendors take full advantage of those pages that have included
the accessible mark-up?

A few months ago, I sent a message to Henter-Joyce asking about JAWS'
inability to recognize the id and header attributes in a table. Perhaps my
question to them was not clear, because their reply did not address it.

Any information on this topic will be most appreciated.
