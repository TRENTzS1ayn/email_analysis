If I may add, the point here is to make the internet as accessible as
possible.  Not to amputate it  in any ways.   I,  have cerebral palsy, and
my feeling is (I may be wrong here...) that most persons with disabilities
would want to have an  experience of the internet which is as complete as
possible.  I don't think that amputating the internet from its special
language (emoticons, ascii) is the right solution.  I do not think it would
hold in the long run anyway.

Thinking about avoiding emoticons or ascii art, to me, is a bit like
avoiding the verb "to see" in front of a visually impaired person!  I think
we should strive towards making "the internet experience" as rich as
possible, suitable for as many tastes as possible.  I believe that by using
our imagination, we will come up with something that will convey ascii art
to non visual browsers...

BTW: I apologize if my English is somewhat awkward.  I am a French Canadian
from Montreal!!!
