I do not know why this has not been proposed before, but can't the whole
issue be solved by defining your art with the ABR tag?

Sometimes it is built into the Text-To-Speech rules. Most synthesizers and
speech engines support what is sometimes called a "dictionary" to do just
this. Some screen readers also do - I know that the old VERT screen reader
for DOS had this capability, and I imagine that some of the Windows screen
readers have this as well. It is usually up to the user to set them up
though.

An interesting thing happened when I was working on the "Narrator" program
(a very simple MSAA-based, screen-reader like program) that is going to be
included in Windows 2000 (AKA NT5). I can't remember the exact scenario, but
it tried to read (C:) as "C smiley face", when it was just the drive "C:" in
parenthesis. The Narrator program didn't do the translation - it was the
Text-To-Speech engine.

You got my vote! I may be the one that complained but I really am all for
more accessibility not less.  If my screen reader said smile and wink
instead of gobbeldegook it would be great.
I don't know if there are screen readers that do that
