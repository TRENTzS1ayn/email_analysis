I'd use Netscape 3.x and 4.x, a version of MS Internet Explorer (as you
can't have two versions on the same machine to my knowledge), a text browser
such as lynx., PwWebSpeak for the voice browser and maybe Opera if you have
extra time and money.  Also to be considered is the use of a general screen
reader such as Jaws For Windows.  Use of tools such as bobby and HTML
validators is also essential.  It might be sensible to have disabled users
actually do the testing.

Subject:Usability testing

I need to help assemble and populate a small computer lab to examine web
usability issues. This is a very large ballpark and I need to narrow the
options we're going to explore.

I'm seeking your opinion about what tools we should test with. We have to
start someplace and picking a specific set of tools seems to be a
reasonable place. I gather that there's no such thing as a perfect list but
I need to put one together anyway.

I'd like to hear about your opinions and preferences about tools if you
care to share them. I suspect a public forum is not the best place to share
these sentiments. Please respond privately so I don't get shot for starting
another browser war.

Regards,
Joe Night
