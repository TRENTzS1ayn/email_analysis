One thing that hasn't been mentioned on this thread yet is the inherent impersonal
nature of the medium and the fact that many (I would even go so far as to say most
people) are left with a missing link in communication due to the nature of Email.
Email is most often an informal communication, even less so than a letter which
allows drawings and is usually formally to a business or informally to some one you

already know.  At present Email is not an effective tool for social communication
in
that there are no methods to communicate adequately the emotions that would be
present in the informal spoken language; no inflections of voice, facial
expressions,
body language and no pictures for the most part. Emoticons are an attempt to give
added meaning when ever possible. Communication over Email is especially difficult
when the people are not known to each other as they can not predict on interpret
their sarcasm or other quirks of personal self expression.
I have to admit that they are often misused and misunderstood but with the user of
emoticons I have seen fewer flame wars over Email and I have been using Email for
a long time.

At present Emoticons are more than a Quirk in linguistics, or an attempt to subvert

the English language it fills a gap in communication adding band width. That
doesn't
mean that screen readers and such should not have access to this quite the
contrary.

A colleague of mine was doing her masters thesis on Email communication and
essentially the amount of miscommunication with this medium was primarily due to
misinterpretation of the writers intention.

This has been a great discussion.
