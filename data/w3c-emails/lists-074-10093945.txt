Dear WAI Interest Group Members:

The WAI Authoring Tool Guidelines Working Group (AUWG) has issued a revised
charter, which is currently under review by the W3C Advisory Committee. 

At the same time, AUWG is re-opening their Call for Participation. The AUWG
is particularly seeking authoring tool manufacturers, including HTML
editors, conversion tools, image editors, multimedia editors, site
management tools, etc.

Individuals interested in joining the AUWG must read the revised charter at
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/charter-19990109>, agree to the participation
requirements, fill out the Call for Participation which follows, and send
it to <wai-au-call@w3.org>. The group expects to move at a rapid pace over
the next several months. All current AUWG members must also re-apply using
the Call for Participation. W3C non-Members must indicate their area of
technical expertise.

Please note also that there is a face-to-face meeting of the AUWG scheduled
for March 1 and 2, hosted by Lotus Development Corporation, in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, USA. This meeting is only for active members of the AUWG.
Information on the meeting is available on the W3C Events Calendar
<http://www.w3.org/Member/Eventscal> and pre-registration is required by
Friday, February 19.

If you would like further information about the working group or the
meeting, please contact the Chair, Jutta Treviranus
<jutta.treviranus@utoronto.ca>, or the W3C staff contact for AUWG, Charles
McCathieNevile <charles@w3.org>.

Thank you,

Judy Brewer
