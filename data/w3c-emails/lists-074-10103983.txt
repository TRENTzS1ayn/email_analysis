When I saw this, I thought, nope. ABBR is for abbreviations. In my
Western-mind I assumed this strictly involved letters. However, according
to the HTML 4.0 specification, I may be wrong:

"The ABBR and ACRONYM elements allow authors to clearly indicate
occurrences of abbreviations and acronyms. Western languages make extensive
use of acronyms such as "GmbH", "NATO", and "F.B.I.", as well as
abbreviations like "M.", "Inc.", "et al.", "etc.". Both Chinese and
Japanese use analogous abbreviation mechanisms, wherein a long name is
referred to subsequently with a subset of the Han characters from the
original occurrence. Marking up these constructs provides useful
information to user agents and tools such as spell checkers, speech
synthesizers, translation systems and search-engine indexers."

I am by no means an expert in language contructs. However, all the Chinese
and Japanese characters that I have ever seen certainly reflect a construct
similar to the effect of an emoticon. Maybe David's suggestion is a good one?
