I am trying to use properly nested H1, H2, tags for
accessibility and indexing reasons. The problem I keep
running into is that I would like to avoid a blank line
below the heading. In the past I have avoided these tags for
just this reason.

I have tried everything I could think of to get rid of that
blank line, but to no avail. Anyone know a way to get around
it?

I have the same problem with P tags. I've been using DIV
with BR tags to avoid P tags because I don't want the spaces
above and below. I am trying to achieve a look in which the
first paragraph has a drop cap and no indent, and subsequent
paragraphs have a first line indent, the way it is normally
done in print. The "block" format gets old.

I know that CSS CAN do it, but is there anyway to make it
work in the current browsers that "support" CSS?

Any help would be appreciated.
