You can get the indents... but it's not considered "good" html code.
Here are two different ways:

1. starting a paragraph with <DD>
2. starting the paragraph with a bunch of &nbsp;'s ... so you can do
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my second paragraph.

Of course, the third option is to try the "single-pixel" gif trick....
but, that's not good design either!

Pawan...
