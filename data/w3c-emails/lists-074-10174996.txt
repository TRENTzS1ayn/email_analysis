Here are two different ways:

1. starting a paragraph with <DD>

you can do

Of course, the third option is to try the "single-pixel" gif
trick....
but, that's not good design either!"

------------------

You can also use CSS to achieve the indent. I'm not that
worried about backwards compatibility because I can adjust
the pages dynamically based on the browser. It's the blank
lines that bother me. I can't seem to override them.

In the past I've used DIV tags to avoid the blank lines and
non-breaking spaces or CSS to indent the first line. The
single pixel gif takes a performance hit (small though it
may be), so I've preferred the non-breaking spaces. Some
browsers, however, like pwWebspeak, compress even the
non-breaking spaces, so you don't get much of an indent. I
am also curious as to why pwWebspeak, seemingly alone among
browsers, does NOT insert blank lines between P elements.
Maybe if Mark reads this he can explain.

Actually, I've had the most problem getting decent looking
text on pwWebspeak. Since the browser is clearly intended to
be used by those with low vision (thus the yellow on black
big text), why does it lay pages out in such a dense,
difficult to read (for me, anyway) manner? Another of life's
great mysteries.
