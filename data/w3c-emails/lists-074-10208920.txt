WAI Interest Group Members:

On Friday, January 15, 1999, the Page Author Guidelines Working Group
published a substantially updated Working Draft
<http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH> on the W3C technical reports page.

Thanks go to the Page Author Guidelines Working Group members and to WAI IG
members who have commented on the new version.

Changes from the previous /TR version include a reorganization of sections;
changes in how priorities are handled in the document; and the addition of
checklist of checkpoints.

The Page Author Guidelines Working Group <w3c-wai-gl@w3.org> welcomes
feedback on this version of the guidelines, and particularly seeks feedback
from those involved in page authoring and content development.

Regards,

Judy
