I am always amused by the notion of trying to emulate a print document in
html.  Usually the results are quite sad.  Since we are talking about a
regular WAI contributor I will not be so quick to judgement!

What are you doing for the drop caps?  Monochrome GIFs of the  letter with
the letter as ALT text?

I will confess that I was quite happy when I first came across a site that
ended sentences with period-non-breaking-space-space.  Finally, a legal
technique for getting that extra space the way my typing instructor taught
me!  (I was, of course, hit with that "Duh -- why didn't I think of that"
feeling.)

I instantly found my pages much more readable.  Can double-space between
sentences (but not after abbreviations) be accomplished by CSS?  Are any
browsers (or word processor for that matter) smart enough to make this
distinction?
