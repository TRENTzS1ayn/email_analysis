Hi all,

Very soon, the Web Standards Project will be posting "Bug Drive 5.0." This
is the Web developer community's way of telling Microsoft what standards
are not implemented in IE5 and currently are not working in the beta. I
have a list of Accessibility tags not implemented in IE4 that I need help
checking in IE5 but don't exactally know what they're supposed to do.
Can you help?

Please contact me ASAP so we can make sure IE5 doesn't miss any
accessibility features.

Thanks.
