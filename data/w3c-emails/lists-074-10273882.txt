FrontPage 98 (make sure you have the update patch installed) allows for the
double spaces between sentences.  HoTMetaL 4.0 does not.  The only problem
I've encountered with this technique is the old AOL proprietary browser (2.0
maybe) didn't recognize &nbsp; and showed it as such in the document.
However, it is important enough to me attempt to use proper English that I
use the technique anyway.  For the few users using the old AOL browser they
just end up with a little bit garbage.  The word to HTML conversion utility
doesn't seem to save the double spaces nor does pasting from the clipboard
to FrontPage98. I don't know about the use of CSS to achieve this.  Our user
base doesn't have full enough support for CSS to justify its use yet so I
haven't studied it.

[snip]
I will confess that I was quite happy when I first came across a site that
ended sentences with period-non-breaking-space-space.  Finally, a legal
technique for getting that extra space the way my typing instructor taught
me!  (I was, of course, hit with that "Duh -- why didn't I think of that"
feeling.)

I instantly found my pages much more readable.  Can double-space between
sentences (but not after abbreviations) be accomplished by CSS?  Are any
browsers (or word processor for that matter) smart enough to make this
distinction?
