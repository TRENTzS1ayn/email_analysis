From a design point of view, HTML documents are more like typeset
documents than like typewritten ones.  In typesetting, one usually
leaves only one space at the end of a sentence; the two spaces in
typing are to compensate for the weird look of monospaced type.

TeX applies an algorithm for finding the end of sentences, and
slightly increases the spaces there, but not to a full double space.

I'd recommend avoiding fooling with hard spaces and let the browser do
its best job.
