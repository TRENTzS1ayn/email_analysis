I had a quick look at the site using Lynx, and it made pretty good sense
to me. I also checked it in Netscape.

I think you could improve it significantly by including a copy of
the navigation material directly in the NOFRAMES area rather than just a
link to it, which would allow people straight into the content of the
site, and perhaps reducing the overall number of frames used.

One strategy to improve navigation would be to have text links to each
photo at the bottom of each photo page, so that browsing with a non-frames
browser does not require so much back and forwards navigation.

(I like the photos, too! And in Lynx I was pleased to have a description
of what was going on)

  If any of you can take a moment and give this web site your thought, I'd
  appreciate it. It changes throughout the day as the issues seem to change
  that quickly.
  
  (Some of today's issues are rethinking the need for a d-link, 
  Complexity of menuing and pages, implementation of tables for layout and
  for navigation menus, and I'm still concerned about the "back" button.)
  
  All feedback is welcome.
  
  Best regards,
