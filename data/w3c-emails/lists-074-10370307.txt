When I use the defaults in IE 3 and turn off style sheets, I get green 
letter on gray background.

For IE and NN version 4, even if the user accepts the page designer's 
colors, the issue is Green on Black can be difficult to read by some 
people.  If you are color blind, the green may appear gray.  The green's 
tone can also cause problems for people with astigmatism, like me! The 
green that is used is darker, would try for a lighter color for more 
contrast.
