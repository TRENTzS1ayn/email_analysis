Thanks. I loved taking them.

Rob's point does need some consideration. You've actually hit the nail on
the head. I do have to deal with the "new user" or "confused user" issue.
The style sheets help -- but for those who can't or won't turn them off, I
could compromise by selecting a brighter color or maybe by working with a
typeface that isn't so thin. The green on black doesn't do very good with
the "squint" test.

Yup. You got me. I'm still struggling with that issue too. If you turn off
the images or take a tour with pwWebSpeak it tends to come out as a
text-only site. I dropped out of the frames in order to give primitive
screen reader software an even chance. I think I need to completely
reconsider the "noframes / text-only" method. The other Charles also had a
good comment about just getting down to business from the main frameset
page. I'm getting a lot of good ideas here.

I can do that.

Yes, Thank you, to all of you. It all helps a lot. I did a little tinkering
this morning and was pretty much able to pass the "Bobby" test.
Still, there's really no substitute for human feedback. People are a lot
more observant. I've spent quite a bit of time looking at the "top" and
"bottom" links under Lynx and it never dawned on me that it wasn't making
perfectly good sense.

Thanks,
