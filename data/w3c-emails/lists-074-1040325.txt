Besides what Jamie metioned, I am finding that WHAT http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/what/ is an excellent tool for web pages.  I have just downloaded Explorer 5.0 with the condition of being able to still use 4.01.  I wasn't sure  they would work because Jon said 'Internet Explorer 4.0 installed on target computer (otherwise will not install correctly)'. 
 
I wasn't sure it would work with 5.0.  So far it has.  I just tested one page and made D links and LONGDESC and ALT'S easily.  Still playing with it, but at least it loaded correctly using 5.0.
