Hi. I've been lurking for a while and what I've read here has been really
helpful. I'm having a problem though, and could use some help.

I'm a contractor redesigning the STAWRS web site In general, I'm supposed
to simplify navigation, add to the content a bit, and make the site
accessible. I'm using BOBBY software on my hard drive to test each page,
and then following that up with the on-line W3C HTML validator. Everything
works great except one page.

On one of my pages, I've followed the BOBBY recommendations of using table
headers, but I'm getting the following failures on the validator  for the
table cells:
 <td headers="t1"> reference to non-existent ID "t1"

What am I doing wrong?

URL of error

.htm#6

URL of the redesigned site
http://www.vectorhome.com/stawrs/redesign/newstawrs/site_review/index.htm

URL of where this will live.

PS. I've a bit more work on the D links based upon input from a reader
here, and only the upper directory is near completion, but I would also
welcome comments on the redesign from anyone who has the time.

Thanks
Kent
