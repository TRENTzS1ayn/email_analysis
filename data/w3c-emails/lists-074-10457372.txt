Rob>Just a couple things stand out.  The image mape needs to be made with 
alt tags for each link and you should provide alterante text tags at the 
bottom.  Same goes for the graphics for DOL, IRS, SSA and SBA.

Before you put the Bobby logo, you should have approval from the 
government, because they are now endorsing a product.  I would set up a 
separate link for accessibility.  Here is how we are handling this on our 
redseign due out next week.  This may give you some ideas, see 
http://www.dol.gov/dol/esa/public/programs/dbra/
we are also considering removing the globe for NCAM.
