WAI Interest Group:

This is a call for information on two policy-related questions, to assist
the WAI Education & Outreach Working Group in compiling resources:

1) Laws, regulations, and practices directly or indirectly related to Web
accessibility: 
Please take a look at the working draft policy reference site at
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/Policy.html> and let us know about any
additional countries where there is legislation that has bearing on Web
accessibility. Send information to <wai@w3.org>.
The relevant legislation may be disability discrimination, but it could
also be information society policy, or telecommunications reform, or
government procurement regulations, etc.
Please note that the page is an incomplete draft, for instance many URL's
are not yet linked, but should be shortly and will be available as a WAI
Resource at that time.

2) Science and Technology Policies that may relate to disability:
We are also interested in Science and Technology Policies that may relate
to disability. For example, in 1976 the U.S. passed Public Law 94-282, the
National Science and Technology Policy, Organization and Priorities Act,
but disability needs were not incorporated at that time. Do you know of
countries with similar policies? Do the policies incorporate disability
within their mission? If there is not such a policy, is there a research or
priority-setting mechanism for development of science and technology?
Again, please e-mail any information to <wai@w3.org>, rather than replying
to the mailing list.

Thank you,

Judy
