>WAI Interest Group:
>
>This is a call for information on two policy-related questions, to assist
>the WAI Education & Outreach Working Group in compiling resources:
>
>1) Laws, regulations, and practices directly or indirectly related to Web
>accessibility: 
> Please take a look at the working draft policy reference site at
><http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/Policy.html> and let us know about any
>additional countries where there is legislation that has bearing on Web
>accessibility. Send information to <wai@w3.org>.
> The relevant legislation may be disability discrimination, but it could
>also be information society policy, or telecommunications reform, or
>government procurement regulations, etc.
> Please note that the page is an incomplete draft, for instance many URL's
>are not yet linked, but should be shortly and will be available as a WAI
>Resource at that time.
>
>2) Science and Technology Policies that may relate to disability:
> We are also interested in Science and Technology Policies that may relate
>to disability. For example, in 1976 the U.S. passed Public Law 94-282, the
>National Science and Technology Policy, Organization and Priorities Act,
>but disability needs were not incorporated at that time. Do you know of
>countries with similar policies? Do the policies incorporate disability
>within their mission? If there is not such a policy, is there a research or
>priority-setting mechanism for development of science and technology?
>Again, please e-mail any information to <wai@w3.org>, rather than replying
>to the mailing list.
>
>Thank you,
