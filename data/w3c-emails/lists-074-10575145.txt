In light of recent discussion in this group about trying to emulate print conventions in Web pages, I thought Jakob Nielsen's current "AlertBox" (URL http://www.useit.com/alertbox/990124.html) would be of interest.

The Alertbox for January 24 is now online at
http://www.useit.com/alertbox/990124.html

Anything that is a great print design is likely to be a lousy web design.
The big canvas size and controlled layout makes print visually superior;
Web interaction can be more engaging, if only designs would focus on the
strength of the Web rather than its weaknesses.
