"It is rare to see a web animation that has any goal besides annoying
the user."

and

"Web design is impoverished because too many sites strive for the wrong
standards of excellence that made sense in the print world but do not
make sufficient advances in interactivity."

are the "nugget bites" in a recent Jakob Nielsen item at: 
http://www.useit.com/alertbox/990124.html

The root site is tantalizing because though he is talking about
"usability" it so often equates with our goals - hence validating the
notion of Universal Design as well as "electronic curb cuts."

I've never gotten any response from him about participating in our
efforts - does anyone hereon ever deal with him?
