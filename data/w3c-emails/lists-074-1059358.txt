1. The good news is that Lynx can be compiled with SSL support.
The bad news is that you have to compile it [or a SSL-adding
proxy] yourself, due to a legal morass.

Kelly Pierce and his organization can train people to use
computers and screen readers, but getting them all up to that
point is a bit beyond what is reasonable.

2. When I read his request that the website support purchases
for people without SSL in their browser, I do not believe he
is suggesting that the consumer send credit card data in the
clear.  How _do_ CDnow and Amazon.com accomodate buyers without
SSL?
