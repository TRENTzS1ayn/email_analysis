I've talked with Jakob on a few occasions. You're not likely to get any
response from him right now because he left Sun about 3-4 months ago and
has embarked on his own business journey with Don Nelson, another usabilty

That's Donald Norman, another of my favorites, author of such classics as "The Design of Everyday Things" (published earlier as "The Psychology of Everyday Things" in hardcover), "Things That Make Us Smart" and "Turn Signals are the Facial Expressions of Automobiles." Norman's focus has been design of physical objects and environments used by people, ranging from consumer products to airplane cockpits.
