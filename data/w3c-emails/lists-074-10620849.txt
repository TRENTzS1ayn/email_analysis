Hi all,

I was doing some accessibility work today and ran across a user who's site
was "Bobby Compliant" but many of theit ALT attributes contained both the
filename and size of the graphic rather than any useful text. This has the
potential to cause some problems because such information in an ALT
attribute would be useless to the visually impared user and would just
frustrate the text-only browsing user.

I'd like to suggest that something stating that ALT attributes should
contain meaningful content and not filename or image size or it should have
nothing in it (i.e. ALT="").

Thoughts??
