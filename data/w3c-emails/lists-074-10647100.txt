To a degree....I still believe this should be an item on the checklist
rather than a technique. The corresponding checklist item to the technique
you psted is basically "all images should contain alternative text." 

The guidelines already contain a checklist point stating that links need to
be tearse but meaningful....I don't see why the ALT attribute cannot be
included. Besides, the techniques section is for people who aren't
well-versed in HTML. After I read that all of my images, client-side
imagemaps, image buttons, and applets/objects need alternative text, I'm
going to go and add it...not look at the techniques....or I'm going to
e-mail the company who produces my authoring tool and ask why they default
to the image filename and size when this is not the purpose of the ALT
attribute.

Good ideas, though Kynn :)

Thanks for your response.
