Hi there,

Whoever said that you cannot use print graphics on the net is wrong.  We
do it all the time at Netvertising.com and Easy Access.com.  There are
two important differences:

1.Print uses a much higher DPI [usually 300 or more].  The net is 
currently 72 DPI.

2.There is a more limited color palette for the net.

However, it is very easy to take print graphics and compress them or
ever so slightly change them to make them work on line.  Here we
routinely do this:  create brochures etc. for print and then recycle the
art for the net. 

If one wishes to do the reverse, i.e. use graphics from a web site and
covert them to print - that is very difficult because the the graphic
essentially has to be redone.

Regards, Joanne Dolgow
