I don't know about Amazon and CDNow, but I know that a number of sites do 
it by using a Java applet (which convinces the cusotmer that they are 
getting some secure wizardry - if you can't blind them with science...) 
and some sites do it open. Actually I have no real fear of sending my 
credit card number on an open email - there are far more serious security 
risks around, like leaving an ink-on-paper signature with my credit card 
details in a pub.
