I think you're being unfair in yopur response.  An authoring tool has three
options for providing defaults ALT values - give a null string, give a
standard chunk of text "This is an image" or provide information
automatically derived from the image file "Size =100 Kb".  Of these
alternatives, I think the latter is preferable.

What concrete suggestion would you make to vendors of authoring tools?

Thanks
