The WAI has a Working Group working on Guideliens for Authoring Tools, 
here's what they say in the latest draft (Jan 12)
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WD-WAI-AUTOOLS
  
2.5.8: [Priority 1] 
  The authoring tool must never insert rule-generated description
  text into the document (default "alt"-text) or a properties field
  (place-holder "alt"-text). Automated processes may only place
  pre-authored (by a person) text when the meaning or function of the
  described object is known with certainty. 

In other word, default alt values is a no-no, mostly because it then
makes it very hard for repair tools of all kind to do their job
effectively, since they cannot really look for missing data.
