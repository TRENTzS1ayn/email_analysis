Hi Daniel
    Thanks for the reply, and pointing out what the guidelines say.
    I must admit that I think the guidelines are wrong :-(  Forcing all
automatically generated ALT information to contain a null string means that
nobody is provided with information which can be useful in circumstances.
To be it seems intuitively wrong for an authoring / conversion tool to throw
away resource metadata.  I would argue it would be better for the
information to be provided and then filtered out if necessary.
   I'd also argue that the guidelines should at least say that authoring
tools should provide options for creating null or automatically generated
ALT text, so that an organisation has some choice in this matter (e.g. the
BBC might choice to provide this information as they have their Betsie tool
for stripping out information).
    Brian
