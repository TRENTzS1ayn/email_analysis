I'd make two suggestion:
1> do not allow an altless image or other element which requires it:
2> explain with the error message in a short para how to construct a
proper alt tag.
It's time creation tool developpers got more involved in how products of
their tools will represent them.  And before anyone asks lest I leave
something out, yes, check for all accessibility and do not allow
construction till they are done.  simple.  notes along the way for
corective messages.  it can serve as a learning tool as well.  when you
hit a wrong key or click the mouse in appropriately in windows, it lets
you know.  This is quite effective.

_I think you're being unfair in yopur response.  An authoring tool has three
_options for providing defaults ALT values - give a null string, give a
_standard chunk of text "This is an image" or provide information
_automatically derived from the image file "Size =100 Kb".  Of these
_alternatives, I think the latter is preferable.
_
_What concrete suggestion would you make to vendors of authoring tools?
