I'm replying publicly because this is an important issue which is facing 
a lot of people, not just you. (You are just the 1% prepared to put their 
hand up and ask...)

I would skip IE/Netscape, since designers worth 2c can tell you already 
how things work there by reading the code. The first thing I would do is 
validate the HTML and check with Bobby, but read the results and think 
about it rather than simply believing what you're told. 

For browsers I would look at Lynx, a screen reader (eg winvision, or 
jaws) and a proper audio browser like pwWebSpeak. If you can, use WebTV 
and a Macintosh version of things - this will generally show up the problems 
much faster.

The key is to learn where the problems arise so you can cut back the 
test/repair cycle. It is a great efficiency if you can solve the problems 
by design rather than by repair.
