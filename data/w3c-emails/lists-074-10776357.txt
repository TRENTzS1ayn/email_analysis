This is equally wrong to use the ALT attributes to store metadata that 
is not meant to be there.

But this would need more convention/syntax for the filtering to work
(how to recognize this is metadata about the image, not the
description).
This is not impossible (use ALT with some specific sugar syntax
recognized by all "FileName=foo.gif; FileSize= 100K" just it hasn't
happen yet and it's also hackery more than good design (For Metadata,
look at w3.org/Metadata, and RDF)

I agree ALT="" has some utility (for images with no function, like
decoration) but content that is meant to be served as is, in HTML,
should be correct HTML, and ALT=filesize is not right. In your
example, Betsie is just one way of accessing BBC Online, so the HTML
has to be correct in all cases.
