From the NYT this AM: "Today, e-commerce companies are still talking
about what Web advertising in general -- and rich media advertising in
particular -- can do for them. Bandwidth remains the most vexing
problem, but Web site publishers' hesitance to run ads that might slow
their site down even marginally isn't the only obstacle. A number of
merchants still remain unsold as to whether ads that are rich with     
animation, sound or video can attract enough buyers to justify the high
cost of producing them."

and: "Regardless of how rich the ads are, however, some advertisers
remain unsold. 'The user is more interested in what they'll get on the
other end of an ad than how they get it,' said Rita Belle, marketing
director for Virtual Vineyards. 'From what I've seen, rich media doesn't
seem to drive the response rate up. It's more about targeting.'"

How about that?
