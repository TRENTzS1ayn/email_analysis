You have a valid point however what about people who use "spacer" Gifs for
layout. There is one authoring tool that actually creates tons of little,
invisible GIFs in order to position things where people want them. What
you're suggesting would be completely ineffective under these circumstances
as well as many others.

Besides an authoring tool that offers a preview of the page should also
have a toggle that allows you to preview it with graphics turned off or in
text-only mode.
