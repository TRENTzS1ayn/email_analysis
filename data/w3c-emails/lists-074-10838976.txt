All,

I am trying have a text page (from the web) download into excel.  I can
get it to work, but of course no formating.  I know that I have to do some
VB in-order to make property changes.  How can I get it to work from
just sending a text file with VB code? Or is there a better way??

Thanks in advance,
Chris
