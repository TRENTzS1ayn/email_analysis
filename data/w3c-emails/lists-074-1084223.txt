A little knowledge can be dangerous.  I have a few of the basics down
when it comes to making my pages accessible (i.e. always include ALT
descriptions with images, use <STRONG> instead of <B>, etc.), and
because of this, I've been asked to explain a little about accessibility
to some web-design students. (These students, themselves, have physical
disabilities, though as far as I know, none of them are blind.)

I'm looking for a crash-course and/or a place on the Net where I can
direct the students to help them learn more about creating
web-accessible pages.  Basically, what they (I) would need is a
straight-forward list of the tags and extra info required for html.  At
this point, it isn't necessary to get into things like Java,
stylesheets, imagemaps, forms, etc.

I know many of you will direct me to the W3C site, but even that gets a
little bogged down in terminology foreign to beginners.  Is there
something simpler, a little more stripped down?

Thanks,
