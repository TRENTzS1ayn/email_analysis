OK, here's my two cents worth (going for five cents)!
I'm blind, and find it very frustrating to here "picture" or "foo.jpg" or 
"bullet" or any such nonsense. The "bullet" doesn't work because its too 
verbose; the other examples don't work because they are functionally 
inappropriate. In short, authoring tools might support two modes: strict 
accessibility checking, and relaxed accessibility checking. Strict would 
*always prompt* for an alt-text string; relaxed might use a default (null 
might be preferable here). Note that if the image is an anchore 
(clickable), relaxed mode and strict mode may be equivalent, basically 
forcing the designer to put some description on the anchor.
