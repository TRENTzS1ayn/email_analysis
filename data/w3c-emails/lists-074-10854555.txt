I don't want to belabor this point... I think null tags are fine, but I 
think the authoring tool should know when the image in question is a link, 
and if it is, refuse to put a null tag on it. Maybe I'm missing something 
here, but do designers use these spacer graphics as links? I think null is 
the best alt string for many many situations, just not for links!
