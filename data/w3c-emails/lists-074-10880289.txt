Hi!

I don't consider myself to be an expert, yet, in the field of web
accessibility, although I am making big efforts to become one!!!

So maybe everyone of you  on the list  already knew about this, but in case
some
didn't, I have decided to forward this to you.

I also would like to know how much you think it will increase web
accessibility.

I hope that this slight contribution will be of use to some of you.

Java Talks the Talk with IBM's Self-Voicing Kit 
By Scott Clark <mailto:scott@internet.com> 
Managing Editor Java Boutique 


[January 25, 1999] IBM <http://www.ibm.com>  Monday released the alpha
version of its Self-Voicing Kit (SVK) on its alphaWorks Web site
<http://www.alphaWorks.ibm.com> . 

The SVK allows developers to create Java applications which will be
accessable by millions of disabled people. The kit enables users to add,
expand or customize the many accessibility features available in their
applications, and features an audio interface which reads aloud the
information which appears on the computer screen. 

Until today's debut of the SVK technology, those computer users with
disabilities may have been unable to utilize new applications until the
product's developers could create "adaptive solutions." Now, with developers
able to use the Self-Voicing Kit, people with disabilities are able to more
successfully compete for technical jobs. 

The Self-Voicing Kit utilizes IBM Access Engine technology, and enables
developers to add an audio interface to any Java application; the Access
Engine communicates directly with the accessible components of the Java
application. Additionally, the SVK provides a method of testing and
analyzing applications for accessibility by blind users.
