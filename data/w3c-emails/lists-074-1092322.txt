You're welcome to use the course I prepared, Kristopher:

http://trevor.butler.edu/~tmccain/access

I made it precisely because the WAI guidelines are rather thick for the
folks I help. Soon, I plan to revise the site because of things I have
learned in the past few months (it needs to be even simpler and more to
the point, I think), and it would be helpful to hear your (and your
students')  reaction to it. 

Hope that helps,

- tom
