Hi

Appols if this has been answered in the past but I couldn't find a answer
searching the headers of the past years postings for accesskey...

Are there any standard access keys assignments? E.g. Alt-S for search or
whatever? And if not is there a danger that every site will have a different set
of keys for people to learn?

I have just knocked together a test site for a client and set up some access
keys:

www.webarchitects.co.uk/gcse_eng/

On reflection it was silly to set Alt-H to anything as it will prevent the Help
menu in the browser being accessed...

Anyone else have any comments - am I on the right track?

Chris
