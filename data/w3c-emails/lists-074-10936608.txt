At this point, Internet Explorer is the only browser that has some
implementation of ACCESSKEY. It appears they implemented it for elements A,
BUTTON, INPUT, LABEL and TEXTAREA in IE4.0 and elements AREA and LEGEND in
IE5.0. 

According to the HTML 4.0 recommendation, there are no "standard accesskeys."

Your best bet is to check with Microsoft and ask them for a list of all IE
Alt-key assignments. The Mozilla Project has their NGLayout/Gecko team
currently working on an implementation for accesskey:

Somewhere it would be helpful to keep an index of ALT-key functions for
some of the major browsers.

Good comments- thanks for bringing this to light.
