P.S. I can't replicate any errors viewing glassdog in Netscape 4.5 (and,
for the record, no, it was designed to work in all current browser
releases) - What error does it report?

I am using MSIE 4.01 and this is the message I get when I call up your site
and subsequent pages on it.

line:     16
char:      1
error:    'parent.ad.document' is not an object
code:     0

On Netscape 4.05 this message comes up:

JavaScript Error:  http://www.alistapart.com/stories/lance.html
line 16:  parent.ad has no properties.

I couldn't get the page to open in Opera 3.05.

On Lynx it came up okay.
