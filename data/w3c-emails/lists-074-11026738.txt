The redesign of the our web site has been moved to production.  Please see, 
 http://www.dol.gov/dol/esa/public/programs/dbra/index.html
Please send all comments Jamie and office@webspots.net, see Cc: above.

We removed all tables for formatting  and navigation.  I firmly believe 
this is the one of the more universally assessable HTML 3.2 web sites in 
the government.  Please let us know how if you run across any thing that 
may be amiss.
