Alternatively the implementation could offer a seperate view of the page,
which lists the accesskeys, explains how to use them on the specific
platform (eg CTRL+ALT+key, say "access + key", press the item you want)
and uses TITLE and LABEL to give information about the elements to which
the keys refer. This is analagous to what Amaya does with its 'link' view.

There are any number of ways to implement it in a user interface - I don't
think we need to describe them all, let alone prescribe them.

  Modifiers for Accesskeys will be dependent on the keyboard model of the

  I think one of the major issues with Accesskeys is that the accesskey
  information be rendered visually on the disaplay so people know that there
  is an accesskey he available.  This could be done by underlining the
  character in the label of the control or link associated with the
  accesskey.  If the accesskey is not a part of the label, then the user
  agent could add the letter in parenthesis after the label or link.
