Next week, along with NC AHEAD, I will be presenting to the Distance Learning
Council of the North Carolina Community College System regarding distance
learning and students with disabilities.  As part of this meeting, I would
like to present as much input as possible from students, professors, and
administrators who have been involved with course offerings at a distance,
whether via internet, video, text, or any other means.

If there is anyone out there who can offer comment, I'd be grateful.  I'm
concerned not only with access not only in terms of technology, but also
instructional design--and any other areas in which students have encountered
problems/solutions.

Thanks,

Jeff Cobb
Chapel Hill, NC
