I do not apologize to those who feel that this is off topic:

ADAPT would appreciate organizational and individual sponsorship for
"DON'T TREAD ON THE ADA" day on May 12th.  If you want to support this
day please contact ADAPT at adapt@adapt.org or bkafka@juno.com

Like it or not we are a major part of the Disability Rights Movement
(DRM) and the event mentioned could be as historic as the day of the
Martin Luther King, Jr. "I Have a Dream" speech.
