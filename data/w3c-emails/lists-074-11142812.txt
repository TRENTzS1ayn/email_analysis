> Hi all,
> 
> My name is Einat Amitay and I'm a PhD student with MRI & CSIRO,
> Macquarie University, Australia.
> 
> I would like to ask you to take part in an online experiment I'm
> conducting. It would take about 5 minutes of your time and would help me
> in further developing my system (related to search engine results,
> annotation, and collaboration on the web - you'll be able to learn more
> after completing the experiment).
> 
> All you need is to go to the URL below and answer a few questions (no
> personal questions). The results gathered would be reported in the
> context of the system and since I collect no personal data there will be
> 
> no mentioning of people or places.

> The URL:

> Thanks for participating!
