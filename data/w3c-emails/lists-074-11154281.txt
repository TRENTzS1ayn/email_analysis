Dear WAI Interest Group Participant:

This message announces the next WAI meetings, to be held in Los Angeles,
California, USA, on March 20 and 21, 1999, immediately following the CSUN
Conference at the L.A. International Airport. 

A preliminary agenda with hotel information will be available within two
days of this message. Note that W3C/WAI will have a room block available
for Saturday and Sunday nights at the Marriott. We will notify you as soon
as this room block has opened (it isn't yet).

The planned agenda is:

SATURDAY
WAI Interest Group meeting 1:30 - 4:00
WAI Education and Outreach Working Group 4:30 - 6:30

SUNDAY
WAI Protocols & Formats Working Group 9:00 - 5:00 (members and invited
experts only)

Note that the agenda may change slightly in advance of the meeting.
Pre-registration is required for all parts of the meeting. These meetings
are not for basic information about the Web Accessibility Initiative, but
for those actively working on Web accessibility activities in conjunction
with WAI. For general information on WAI and an overview of our latest
work, please attend our session during the day on Thursday or on Saturday
morning during the CSUN conference.

Additional information will be coming shortly.

Thank you, 

Judy Brewer
