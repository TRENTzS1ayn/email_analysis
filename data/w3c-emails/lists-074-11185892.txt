Actually, most of the standard authentication systems based in accessible
platforms don't cause any special problems. If you use a Java applet or
something there are problems of compatiblity, but standard user-access
controls in HTTP or via CGI can be built accessibly.

  As a relative beginner in the concept in accessibility design, I have
  been looking for a way to combine the need to protect the pages from
  unauthorized access and combine accessibility as suggested under the
  Bobby guidelines.
  
  One possibly way to accomplish this is by using a master frame set that
  links all of the membership protected pages. However, this seems to be
  an unacceptable approach under the accessibility guidelines.
  
  Has anyone encountered this design problem before? How did you solve the
  problem?  Can you recommend any sites that utilize this concept that are
  accessible under the guidelines?
  
  Your assistance would be greatly appreciated.
