I cannot speak for LERNOUT, but a word of caution when purchasing DRAGON
NATURALLYSPEAKING. Its abiltiy to function properly is dependent of the PC
and configuration.  They have a compatibility list on their website.  Pay
close attention to your PC model and especially the laptop model.  It is not
true, load and use anywhere.
