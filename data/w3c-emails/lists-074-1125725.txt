I'm fairly sure Kelly Pierce is using Lynx 2.8.
I also thought it supported SSL connections, but when my ISP (Smartnet)
upgraded to this version, I discovered SSL support is lacking.  Perhaps 
there is some configuration setting to turn it on -- if so, I'd like to 
know about it.

Jamal

   NI cannot remember what the individual was using to access the

   Nanswer that one - despite the fact that I have already asked him
   Nand forgot).  PwWebSpeak is working on a SSL compliant version.
   NCant answer for JFW or WinVision, can anyone else?
   NSSL is more secure than an open line and it offers better security
   Nthan when I give my card to the waiter who disappears into another
   Nroom.  SSL provides browser to server security.  If someone breaks
   Nthis, then they are more than a novice hacker.
   NI'd be more concerned as to how  the CTA is maintaining the data and
   Nservers.  But that is getting off the subject.
   NSSL is good and the browser manufactures need to hurry and be
   Ncomplaint.  I can't believe that their business development teams
   Nmissed this product discriminator.
