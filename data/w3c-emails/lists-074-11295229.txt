I copied the sample code for an accessible image map into Microsoft FrontPage
98. Instantly, it converted the code into a web bot component. This component
strips out the MAP, AREA, and Alt text code. Has this happend to anyone else?
Is there anyway to stop FrontPage from doing this?

Here is what I copied:
<IMG src="welcome.gif" alt="Image map of areas in the library" usemap="#map1">
    <MAP name="map1">
     <AREA shape="rect" coords="0,0,30,30" href="reference.html"
alt="Reference">
      <AREA shape="rect" coords="34,34,100,100" href="media.html" alt="Audio
visual lab">
    </MAP>

Here is what FrontPage 98 did to it:
<p><!--webbot bot="ImageMap" rectangle=" (0,0) (30,30) reference.html" 
rectangle=" (34,34) (100,100) media.html" src="welcome.gif" alt="Image map of
areas in the library" --> </p>

This conversion makes the image map inaccessible!

Does anyone have any thoughts on this? Solutions? Help! FrontPage is used
extensively by the State of Iowa, and I need to tell other State web
developers
how to make their image maps accessible.
