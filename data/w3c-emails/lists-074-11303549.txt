You HAVE to use the insert HTML part of FrontPage (Insert > FrontPage
Component... > insert HTML).  It causes FrontPage to ignore the included
HTML coding.  Not doing so causes FrontPage to "fix" the HTML code as it
sees fit.
An example implementation of this can be seen at
http://www2.dol.gov/dol/esa/public/programs/dbra/site-map.html
This is a prime example of why the WAI AG group has such an important
mission.

Subject:FrontPage 98 and Image Maps

I copied the sample code for an accessible image map into Microsoft
FrontPage
98. Instantly, it converted the code into a web bot component. This
component
strips out the MAP, AREA, and Alt text code. Has this happend to anyone
else?
Is there anyway to stop FrontPage from doing this?

Here is what I copied:
<IMG src="welcome.gif" alt="Image map of areas in the library"
usemap="#map1">
    <MAP name="map1">
     <AREA shape="rect" coords="0,0,30,30" href="reference.html"
alt="Reference">
      <AREA shape="rect" coords="34,34,100,100" href="media.html" alt="Audio
visual lab">
    </MAP>

Here is what FrontPage 98 did to it:
<p><!--webbot bot="ImageMap" rectangle=" (0,0) (30,30) reference.html"
rectangle=" (34,34) (100,100) media.html" src="welcome.gif" alt="Image map
of
areas in the library" --> </p>

This conversion makes the image map inaccessible!

Does anyone have any thoughts on this? Solutions? Help! FrontPage is used
extensively by the State of Iowa, and I need to tell other State web
developers
how to make their image maps accessible.
