Dear WAI Interest Group Participant:

Additional information on the WAI meetings following the CSUN'99 Conference
is now available at 
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/1999/03/agenda.htm>. Please note that
preregistration is required. 

We have changed the meeting format slightly by opening the first half of
Sunday's PFWG session to individuals who are not W3C members or invited
experts already participating in the Working Group, however please note the
participation requirements for this session on the registration page.

The meeting page includes information on the W3C/WAI hotel room block at
the Airport Marriott on Saturday, March 20 and Sunday, March 21. Please
identify yourself as being with the "W3C/WAI" event at the Marriott to get
a prefered room rate.

Note that information on the CSUN Conference itself -- an excellent,
international conference on "Technology and Persons with Disabilities" is
available at <http://www.csun.edu/cod/>.

Regards,

Judy
