I Apologise for any Cross-Postings

(Reading time = 5 minutes)

Hi there, I'm working at the University of 
Manchester on WWW browsing and searching 
technologies for visually impaired people. 
As part of this research I'm trying to find out 
how Sighted and Visually Impaired users navigate 
the Web such that I can design applications that 
give more appropriate feedback to a visually 
impaired person.

So now I need your help. I have a series of 
instructions and questions (below) which I'm 
hoping will enable me to see the sort of 
implicit feedback given to sighted users and not 
to visually impaired users, by web browsers that 
give visual feedback.

I'd like as many people as possible to complete 
the tasks and answer the questions. The form can 
then be emailed back to me at: 
simon.harper@mcc.ac.uk (or by using the email 
'Reply' facility). The Information will be 
summarized by me and I will post this summary to 
the group in the new year for your information.

Any help you give is greatly appreciated.



Instructions and Questions Follow 
(Approx Completion Time is 10 Minutes)

impaired?

The END

Thanks for your time and help
Simon.
