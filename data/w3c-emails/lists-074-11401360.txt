I have received inquiries as to how to build accessible web pages using
PageMill.  Does anyone have pointers for referral?  One person espcially
wants to know how to include Alt-tags in PageMill.  

Although HTML is preferred, there are people out there trying to put up
webpages using web authoring software not friendly to accessibility.  I
would appreciate hearing from anyone as to helpful tips for accessibility
when using PageMill.
