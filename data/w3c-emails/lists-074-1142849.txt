Has anyone asked Kelly Pierce if he/she has tried other browsers to use?
Does Kelly own other browsers?  I know they are costly as compared to the
free Lynx.

Seems here is an opportunity for companies like pwWebSpeak, WinVision and
JFW that do or will work with SSL to aggressively  market the Big Cities.
The purpose would be to offer either per seat or enterprise license that the
City can purchase and provide to PWDs for free!  This is great timing for
them! And a possible solution for the City and PWDs?  <Note this is a
question mark and I am already ducking to avoid the kindly flame >

Are there other avenues, such as the Social Security Administration where
PWDs can possibly obtain these browsers.  I apologize for my lack of "how
to", but once, if I heard right, David Poehlman mentioned the Social
Security Administration has helped some people in some way.  I just cant
remember.

Has anyone tried this?

In the past, I know pwWebSpeak and JFW have been on the WAI IG, can someone
please forward this message to them and please include Winvision.

Many thanks, rob

I'm fairly sure Kelly Pierce is using Lynx 2.8.
I also thought it supported SSL connections, but when my ISP (Smartnet)
upgraded to this version, I discovered SSL support is lacking.  Perhaps
there is some configuration setting to turn it on -- if so, I'd like to
know about it.

Jamal

   NI cannot remember what the individual was using to access the
   NChicago site. However, I believe Lynx 2.8 is SSL compliant (AL, can
   Nanswer that one - despite the fact that I have already asked him
   Nand forgot).  PwWebSpeak is working on a SSL compliant version.
   NCant answer for JFW or WinVision, can anyone else?
   NSSL is more secure than an open line and it offers better security
   Nthan when I give my card to the waiter who disappears into another
   Nroom.  SSL provides browser to server security.  If someone breaks
   Nthis, then they are more than a novice hacker.
   NI'd be more concerned as to how  the CTA is maintaining the data and
   Nservers.  But that is getting off the subject.
   NSSL is good and the browser manufactures need to hurry and be
   Ncomplaint.  I can't believe that their business development teams
   Nmissed this product discriminator.
