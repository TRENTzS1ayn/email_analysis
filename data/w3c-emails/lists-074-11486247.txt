Below is a forwarded message from a new list which is hosted
at a U.S. University. They are discussing E-DOCS, electronic
documents on the web and their use in education and society.
I think people on the list might want to pass on guidelines,
suggestions and ideas for inclusivity and accessibility.

wannabe?
:
:   1. XML is exactly, what i was waiting for, because it
eliminates
:   the limitations of HTML.
:
:Absolutely. But SGML can already do this, and tools are
already
:available. Look at DocZilla (www.doczilla.com) for a
browser that
:reads HTML, XML, and SGML.
:
:   2. It's absolutely important to develop common
XML-Structures and
:   DTDs for major types of documents relevant to the
humanities. TEI
:   shows the major direction but isn't sufficient for
special
:   requirements (like some types of historical source)
:
:This is already underway, I believe.
:
:   3. The main problem: how to make it work? Editors may
come within
:   half a year or a year. For fully functional browsers we
will have
:   to wait a little bit longer. One possible way to make
the material
:   accessible for the user now is to markup it according to
XML and
:   special DTDs, and then (1) to transform it into current
HTML and
:
:Much easier is to author it in existing SGML, using
existing tools,
:which are stable and known to work, and transform it into
HTML or Word
:or LaTeX or PDF or whatever is needed now; and transform it
into XML
:later when XML tools become more usable. You can then
decide if you
:want to keep the master copies in SGML or move all of it
into XML.
:
:   (2) to extract the descriptive informations of the
XML-Structure
:   into a database or data-array which can be accessed by a
:   JAVA-applet which works as a user-interface (in common
browsers)
:   administering the descriptive data and providing various
ways of
:   access (e.g. by cascading menus, or as a platform for
local search
:   engines).
:
:That would be an excellent tool.
