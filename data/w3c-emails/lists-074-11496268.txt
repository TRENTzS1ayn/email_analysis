The Feb 16 issue of the Edupage mailing (URL http://educause.unc.edu/edupage.html) contains the following item.

>>>>
ONLINE SITE AIDS VISUALLY IMPAIRED
A Purdue University research and development program has created a program
that allows visually impaired students to work with charts, graphs,
diagrams, and maps.  A drawing printed on special paper is run through a
heater that causes the black ink lines, Braille letters and markings to
bubble up in a raised image.  (AP 15 Feb 99)

The site describes techniques authors should use to produce good results with the technology, such as using broad, solid lines in diagrams. It also includes a brief description of the Nemeth Braille Code for engineering and scientific material such as chemical diagrams.
