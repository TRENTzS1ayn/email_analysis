I'm trying out a way to make tables more accessible.  The first test case
is for a web site for recycling assistive technology.  It has tables
listing assistive technology to be recycled.

The url is http://www.temple.edu/inst_disabilities/piat/reep/

The pages, which are mostly HTML tables, also have links to text versions
of the tables.  In the text version, each row consists of comma separated
values.  I was trying to serve two purposes.  One was to make it sound good
on screen readers.  The other was to allow people to import the table into
a spreadsheet (comma separated values is the standard spreadsheet csv
format).  I was thinking that would be convenient for people with
spreadsheets that work well with their screenreaders.

I didn't intend the comma separated tables to look good visually, and I
know I was successful there <grin>.  But sighted folks have the HTML.

Would you tell me what you think of this?  Especially people with
spreadsheets and screenreaders.

Thanks!

Len
