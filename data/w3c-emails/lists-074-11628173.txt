Hi,

Just a short note to let you know that the first release of the Betsie
source code is now live, online and freely downloadable from the following
page:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/betsie/tech.html

The package comes complete with all the licensing documentation you need to
start using Betsie straight away, suitably modified, on your own site, if
that is appropriate and you so wish.

Please don't hesitate to get in touch if you have any comments, criticisms
or problems with the release.

Cheers etc.,
