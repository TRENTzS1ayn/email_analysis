A pretty good job, although there is (as there usually is in life) room
for improvement. Some specific suggestions:

It seems that the seperation into a frames and a nofrmaes version is
unecessary - the only differences in content I could discover were a lack
of links to ccb from the text-only version.

Placing the content of the textonly welcome inside the noframes would be a
good way of making the impression of a 'second-class entrance' disappear.

The 'banwindow' in the navigation frame is confusing - it frustrated me
that there appeared to be a broken link until I went into the source and
read the script.

And the use of repeat framesets means that some of the framesets have no
NOFRAMES content at all, which is not very good.

I didn't find anything that requires masses of work to fix (although I
haven't checked the scorecard, which I downloaded - that takes several
steps, and a link to a plain-text version, or even better an HTML version,
would be nice.)

I checked using Lynx and Netscape - I'll have a look at it again with IE
under Jaws if I get time.

  Hello--The Federal Communications Commission would appreciate any
  feedback you may have on a new website on enforcement.  The URL is:
  http://www.fcc.gov/ccb/enforce/.  This site also has an electronic
  complaint form where any consumer can file complaints, and we expect
  a percentage of these complaints to be from consumers with disabilities. 
  The complaint form URL is:

  The web staff has gone through steps to ensure accessibility, however,
  we realize that it is hard to catch everything with a first draft. 
  Accessibility is a high priority to us.  Thank you in advance--Pam
