        Reply to:   RE>FCC website accessibility

The thing that stands out the most is that link at the top of the page-- the one that leads to the text-only page-- is a graphic.  Thus, my screen reader can't locate the text-only link and I can't get to the text-only page.  If you make this link text instead of a graphic, that would make it very easy to get to the text-only site.

Hello--The Federal Communications Commission would appreciate any
feedback you may have on a new website on enforcement.  The URL is:
http://www.fcc.gov/ccb/enforce/.  This site also has an electronic
complaint form where any consumer can file complaints, and we expect
a percentage of these complaints to be from consumers with disabilities. 
The complaint form URL is:
http://svartifoss.fcc.gov:8080/prod/ccb/enforcement/ccform.html.

The web staff has gone through steps to ensure accessibility, however,
we realize that it is hard to catch everything with a first draft. 
Accessibility is a high priority to us.  Thank you in advance--Pam
Gregory, Deputy Director, Disabilities Issues Task Force.
