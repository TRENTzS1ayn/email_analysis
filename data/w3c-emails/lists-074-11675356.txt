:> Regarding accessibility of web documents by disabled
:
:Readers may also like to note the WebMail server
(webmail@www.ucc.ie)
:which responds to the email command GET followed by a URL
and sends the
:resulting Web page back by email, uuencoded if it contains
non-ASCII.
:There's a HELP command as well, and online help at
http://www.ucc.ie/webmail
:
:It does not currently serve non-HTML files (ie no graphics,
no zips, exes,
:etc, and FTP is barred) -- I simply don't have the
bandwidth. A MIME reply
:will be added later this year. The service was originally
developed in
:1993 for network users with email-only access from
developing countries,
:but is open to anyone wishing Web access by email.
:
:The only problems are when it gets publicized in a magazine
:-) then it
:gets inundated -- as last week -- and takes a few days for
the queue to
:clear...
