I have been working on a state wide education web site for a couple of years now and have tried to make the site both appealing and accessable each term. It can be challenging to keep it accessable while keeping the appearance fresh and consistent each term. I would appreciate any comments or feedback you might have.
The site can be found at a virtual address of:  http://statewide.orst.edu/
The site can also be found at:  http://osu.orst.edu/dept/osustate/
( We realize that the virtual address is not always reached by some programs such as lynx and an additional link to the real address has been added to the web server's default web page. )

<STRONG> and <EM> has been used where the "read word" should have some emphisis. <B> and <I> is used where a change of apperance only is desired. Tables have been avoided where possible and replaced with listed information (the pages that list the undergraduate and graduate degree programs are an example). A global stylesheet has be employed to keep the text consistent and unique to the site. The pages should be equally presentable from 640x480 to 1280x1024.

Thanks, Joe
