Well, it's late at night and I am tired, so this was an extremely brief
look.

Generally I am very impressed. The only things that i found difficult
were:

* course descriptions which were buried behind https links (which my
version of Lynx doesn't do. I know it can, but I haven't bothered figuring
out how yet.) If this stuff is just course information, which is what I
wsa expecting it to be, it probably doesn't need to be behind much
security.

* Abbreviations, in the same lists. I think they were for different
campuses, but it wasn't obvious until I had followed a couple of them.

relatively trivial problems really. If the rest of it is that good, then
well done.

cheers (and good night - grin)

  appreciate any comments or feedback you might have. The site can be
  found at a virtual address of:  http://statewide.orst.edu/ The site
  can also be found at:  http://osu.orst.edu/dept/osustate/ ( We realize
  that the virtual address is not always reached by some programs such
  as lynx and an additional link to the real address has been added to
  the web server's default web page. )
  
  <STRONG> and <EM> has been used where the "read word" should have some
  emphisis. <B> and <I> is used where a change of apperance only is
  desired. Tables have been avoided where possible and replaced with
  listed information (the pages that list the undergraduate and graduate
  degree programs are an example). A global stylesheet has be employed
  to keep the text consistent and unique to the site. The pages should
  be equally presentable from 640x480 to 1280x1024.
  
  Thanks, Joe
