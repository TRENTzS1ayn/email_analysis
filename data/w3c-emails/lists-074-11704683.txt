Generally clean pages. You have clearly given thought to their
accessibility design. 

Suggestion: in long, multiline list of  anchors at bottom, end each line
but the last 
with " | " to indicate this is a terminator, even at the end of the line,
there are more
on the next line. (unnecessary when tabbing through them, but useful for
screen 
magnifiers.) 

On your distance learning page, tabbing through links misses the headings that 
categorize the following lists of anchors. With so many links that is a lot
to go through
linearly. Consider using a hierarchy first of topics, each of which is
linked to its 
dozen or so more detailed links.

 On that page the comma terminators consistently serve the purpose of the
within-line 
separators " | " in the other pages and at the bottom of that page.
However, a comma
is a small character, and may be missed for low-vision.
