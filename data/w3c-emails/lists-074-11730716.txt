Rob, a couple of critical points that were missed by the article.

The first is that if you specify a colour for a background, you should
also specify a colour for the text, and probably for links as well.

The second is that if you are specifying a background image, you ahould
specify a colour in case the image is not loaded

eg

BODY { background: #020 url(http://styles.org/blues.gif) ; color: #fff }
A :link { color: #2ff }
A :visited {color: #22f }

or something like that.

It does talk abut using tables and a sidebar. They still cause an
accessibility problem, and it is preferable not to use them. There are
alternatives which CSS provides, but it seems the article did not mention
them.

Cheers

  Ok folks, I am finally going to learn CSS.  As our standard brwoser is IE 4, I am going building an intranet from scratch and use CSS.  I have found this site to be a good resource and there is an article  at 
  http://webreview.com/wr/pub/98/05/01/style/index.html/
  This discusses how to build a CSS web site from scratch.  If I read this right it talks about using tables and a sidebar.
  
  The layout will porbably have a page header and two sections below.  The left is the navbar and the right the content.  Does anyone have any advice as to the layout and accessibility issues that I might face?
  
  The article came from http://style.webreview.com/
  
  Please suggest other resources that you may like.
  
  thanks.
