Hi, 

I'm doing some consulting for a nonprofit organization that is developing an accessible Web site. The programmer has asked me to get some feedback about two areas of accessibility:

1. The ABBR and ACRONYM elements:

If anyone has tried using them, do they work with older browsers and with screen readers and speech browsers?

If not, what alternative(s) are you using?

2. SUMMARY attribute in the <TABLE> element:

Do speech browsers support this, even though  IE4 or Nav4 don't yet support it? 
What do you use to describes a table's structure and purpose? 
Is it an acceptable alternative to link to a separate page with a text description of the table?

Thank you,

Judy
