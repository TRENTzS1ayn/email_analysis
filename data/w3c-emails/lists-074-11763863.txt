When I use the pipe as a separator between links I try to remember to end
that string with some punctuation, usually a period. If this is not done a
screen reader will generally not notice the end of the string of links. This
can cause the last link and the next line of text to be read as one and the
same. The period generates a sufficient pause before reading the next line.
