Lynx *can* use SSL, but doesn't in the default distribution.  Because
SSL can not be exported under the US's bizarre encryption laws, SSL-
enabled Lynx couldn't be placed on a public FTP server.

There are places where you can request SSL patches for Lynx (start at
<URL:http://lynx.browser.org/>), but you then have to compile Lynx
yourself.  I had some trouble doing this with Lynx 2.8.
