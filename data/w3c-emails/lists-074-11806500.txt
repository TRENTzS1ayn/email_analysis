Recently, tim Moore of the Bay Area Rapid Transit District in California
posted information about https url's and ssl support to the WAI Interest
Group mailing list and the Universal Access List.  In the interest of full
disclosure and open communication, I share this and the following messages
that provide additional context and information regarding this issue.  In
mid-February, screen saves from the BART website show missing alt tags and
use of PDF files, which in part created an accessibility barrier.
commendably, Tim Moore and BART have corrected much of this and will
complete their work soon.  One barrier that remains is providing
alternatives to purchasing fare cards online for users of browsers that do
not support https url's.  These alternatives could include an e-mail link
for unsecure ordering, the ability to fax an order, leaving one's credit
card number on a dedicated voice mail line, or mail in purchases on the
same terms that the web provides.  BART and its lawyers believe that it
has no obligation or responsibility to offer these alternatives.  

The message below is a compilation of messages from members of the Access
BART Coalition, a group of people with disabilities who have raised the
web accessibility issue with BART.
