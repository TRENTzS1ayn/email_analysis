Subject: Re: BART website feedback

Thank you for taking the time to comment on the BART website.  As you've
discovered, some pages of the website are more accessible than others
right now.  We are currently updating the entire site to meet new
accessibility standards, and our work is not yet complete. We are
literally working from page to page, section to section.  We are also
making sure that any new pages we add meet the new standards as well.

We are using guidelines established by the World Wide Web Consortium's
(W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). The W3C is the international
industry and academic group that sets Internet standards.  The WAI is
the authoritative reference for website accessibility. Their work is
further described at http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH/.  I expect
the entire BART website to conform to current WAI standards by mid
March.

Regarding the secure site for ticket sales, some browsers (especially
older ones) cannot access HTTPS.  Because of the potential for fraud and
other crime, electronic transactions must be conducted on a secure
server. For browsers that do not have this capability, we offer tickets
mail at http://www.bart.gov/riding/tickets/mail.htm .

Incidentally, your Lynx browser can be upgraded: Although it is not
distributed with built-in encryption, you can add on software that
allows it to interact with with SSL and HTTPS. Please see
http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/%7Ejeffwong/lynxstuff/SSL/index.html for
more information.

Thanks again for contacting us.
