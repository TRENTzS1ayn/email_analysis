1. Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Enter Last Call:

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (previously Page Author
Accessibility Guidelines) have entered Last Call. This is the last
opportunity to comment on the document before it is finalized. Last Call
closes on March 19. The document to review is at
<http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-19990226/> and a message
explaining the last call process is at
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/1999JanMar/0314.html>.

3. Authoring Tool WG Issues New /TR Draft; WG Currently Meeting at Lotus:

The AUWG has published, to the W3C Technical Reports page
<http://www.w3.org/TR>, the Working Draft which WAI IG reviewed from
February 16 to 23. The new version is at
<http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-WAI-AUTOOLS/>. The AUWG is currently meeting
(March 1 & 2) at Lotus Development Corporation in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
USA. The WG is making good progress on a new draft, so stay tuned for an
updated version for WAI IG review.

3. Registration for WAI Meetings at CSUN Still Open:

Registration for WAI meetings at CSUN is still open. Information is
available at <http://www.w3.org/WAI/1999/03/agenda.htm>. Meetings include
WAI Interest Group, WAI Education & Outreach Working Group, and WAI
Protocols & Formats Working Group. Please note that pre-registration is
required to attend these meetings, and permission of either of the
Co-Chairs is required to participate in Sunday's PFWG meeting.

4. Final Quick Tips Available:

The final text of the WAI Quick Tips is available at
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/QuickTips>. These will be printed as
tear-off attachments to a flyer which can be stuffed with literature at
conferences, and also printed on business-card-sized plastic reference
cards. These will be available by mid-March and can be ordered from the
Quick Tips page.

5. Two Tools to Try:

Updated versions of the Evaluation & Repair Groups' "altifier" and "table
linearizer" are available at the following URL's:
- <http://www.vorburger.ch/projects/alt>
- <http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/WG/tablin>

6. WAI Guidelines Change Names:

Following the discussion of document renaming on several WAI lists over the
past several months, as well as discussion within W3C to ensure that the
WAI Guidelines' naming is consistent with other W3C documents, the WAI
three guidelines have been renamed as follows:
- Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (previously WAI Page Author Guidelines)
- User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (previously WAI User Agent Guidelines)
- Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (previously WAI Authoring Tool
Guidelines)

7. Updated US EITAAC Information Available

For those of you following the work of the US Electronic & Information
Technology Access Advisory Committee, which is developing standards for
accessible electronic & information technology procurement by US government
agencies -- including accessible Web sites and applications -- updated
information on meetings is available at
<http://www.access-board.gov/notices/eitaacmtg.htm>.

Regards,

Judy
