I am confused why the US encryption laws would be a barrier.  Couldn't lynx
just use 64 bit encryption like the normal version of Netscape and Internet
Explorer do?  It is only the strongly encrypted (128 bit) that you have to
promise not to give to foreign drug dealers.

Lynx *can* use SSL, but doesn't in the default distribution.  Because
SSL can not be exported under the US's bizarre encryption laws, SSL-
enabled Lynx couldn't be placed on a public FTP server.

There are places where you can request SSL patches for Lynx (start at
<URL:http://lynx.browser.org/>), but you then have to compile Lynx
yourself.  I had some trouble doing this with Lynx 2.8.
