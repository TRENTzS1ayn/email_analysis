Mr. Pierce:

I appreciate your continued input on our current efforts to make the
BART website more accessible. Although there appears to be omissions in
the WAI, we are continuing to implement it's recommendations as
described in previous emails to you, Jean and initially Jim.  I include
our previous correspondence here so that everyone can benefit from the
background if they don't already have it:

Kelly, I hope other websites that don't currently follow WAI
recommendations take the same initiative BART has. We also need your
feedback in order for this to work. But please note: We're still
implementing the recommendations, including those that address
proprietary formats (like PDF and ShockWave). We will be offering
alternatives to such formats and avoid other non-standard features
(including elements, attributes, properties, etc. only supported by a
specific browser type) on the timetable I previously mentioned.

Regarding secure servers: Sorry for suggesting the SSL fix -- I didn't
have the shell access detail. I've been reviewing conversations at the
w3c-wai-ig@w3.org Mail Archives looking for more information and all
alternatives such as unsecured connections, open email, email with PGP
public key encryption, phone, dedicated voice mail boxes and fax. You
raise an important issue and I need more information to formulate an
appropriate response. We will get back to you next week with the when
and how.  I wanted to get back to you today, however, to let you know
what we're doing in the meantime.

Back to the WAI work: I initially believed it would be complete in
mid-March. Now it appears we'll be done before then.  This will resolve
many accessibility issues at the BART website, but Jean is right: We
can't operate in a vacuum. You're welcome to troubleshoot the site now. 
However, I hope you and others will take the time to visit after WAI
work is complete. This way you can help identify any issues that might
remain.

Jean, as I said a few days ago, I'll let you know when the WAI work is
done and I hope you'll pass word to the ABC. In the meantime, if anyone
has questions, please feel free to call me at the number below or email
me directly.

Thanks again.
