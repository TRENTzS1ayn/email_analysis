There are several sites that offer alternatives.  We have to be
careful though that the alternatives offered are equipped with the
same availability as the site is equipped with ie 24-7
a recording may not be sufficient because it could exclude some from
full participation.  It is possible however to send secure email and
provide a link for that purpose as an alternative. presenting a form
in much the same way as the secure server does or having that form
emailed upon request by the user to fill out and then return by email
to an appropriate address.  The email could contain a security code
that is tracked as it is returned.  this is a method that list serves
often use for verification of signatory.

I neglected to mention this in the initial posting of the quire to the
wai ig list.  Kelly, has there been a resolution of the original
complaint? ie what steps have been taken beyond our observation of
your public notice of the original filing?  In other words, is what is
happening here a result of a directive out of that process?
curious minds wish fervently to know.
