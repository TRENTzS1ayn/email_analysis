Here's a plan:
1> when developing a web site, test it against common browsers such
as:
lynx 2.7, ie 3.02, netscape 4.x or below preferably 3.x Others.  Pwweb
speak is coming into wide use by the disabled web community as well as
IBM Home Page Reader will be and it hooks into netscape.  Please be
ware that html4.0 and the accessibility guidelines are not supported
code wise by many of these browsers.  Also, please be aware that the
guidelines you are using may radically change after they are submitted
to the wai authority as they are still in draft state.  I encourage
you therefore to use bobby and other access info gathering tools as
well as people from the audience with which you are concerned to test
your pages.
Thank you.
