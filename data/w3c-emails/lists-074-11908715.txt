I'm posting this to let folks know what we are doing as Web developers to help
address accessibility issues.

On our site we have just added an accessibility section which includes a
project we are hoping will be helpful professionally to us all. It includes an
online panel and an online survey which we would like to develop as a means of
generating wider dialogue about accessibility matters, particularly involving 
the practical, day-to-day experiences of users with a wide range of computer
and Internet skills.

We are quite  interested in hearing from anyone who would like to share ideas
and opinions and help us shape this project in a public context as we go
along.
We are especially interested in hearing from colleagues who are developers to
find out what others may be doing.
