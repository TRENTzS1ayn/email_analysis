Pentium III-only sites coming 
By DAVID FLYNN | INTEL is working with several Australian content providers to
establish Web sites that are not only optimised for PCs based on the Pentium
III processor but restricted to Pentium III machines.
The program intends for each Web site to probe the PC and use the chip's
Processor Serial Number (PSN) to identify a Pentium III client.
...the common goal is to usher owners of a Pentium III into special pages
where content such as streaming media, 3D interfaces and animation have been
peak-tuned to suit Intel's latest powerhouse processor.
