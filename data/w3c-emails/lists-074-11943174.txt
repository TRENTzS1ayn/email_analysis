I don't understand the value of this. How can content be "peak-tuned to suit
Intel's latest powerhouse processor" unless they also supply every Pentium
III user with a T3 (or similar) link to the Internet? Isn't the type of
computer actually the least important factor in how a web page is viewed?

Is it just me, or does everybody else also think this is stupid?
