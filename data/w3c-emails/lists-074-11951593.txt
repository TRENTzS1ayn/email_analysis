I have to disagree (with the instant dismissal of use of the Pentium III
unique ID.)  Machine-understandable definitions of client capabilities is a
good thing.  Unfortunately transparent content negotiation hasn't really
taken off (although the W3C website does use TCN for sending PNG to
PNG-conformant browsers, otherwise it sends GIF).   With the grown in
network-aware PDAs, mobile phones, etc, there is renewed interest in
protocol solutions - as an example see the "Composite Capability/Preference
Profiles (CC/PP): A user side framework for content negotiation" Note at
<URL: http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-CCPP  >

I would argue that the accessibility community should be lobbying for such
developments to take their needs into consideration (and I think you have
much to gain) rather than dismissing it out of hand.
