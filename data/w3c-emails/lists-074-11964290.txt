Brian,

I don't want to dismiss out of hand the idea of content-negotiation and
capability negotiation as a way to improve network performance. I am just
concerned by the more common use of it, which is to send out a page
aasying "Your browser can't handle this site. Get a better browser." The
development of P-3 only sites is an example of this. Negotiating
capabilities to send a cut-down version of an image to small-screen
devices, for example, can reduce needless bandwidth load. This is good for
accessibility, although it also raises accessiblity concerns (the problem
arises when IE does the content and capability negotiation, unaware of the
fact that the user has a screen reader which changes the whole profile).

  good thing.  Unfortunately transparent content negotiation hasn't really
  taken off (although the W3C website does use TCN for sending PNG to
  PNG-conformant browsers, otherwise it sends GIF).   With the grown in
  network-aware PDAs, mobile phones, etc, there is renewed interest in
  protocol solutions - as an example see the "Composite Capability/Preference
  Profiles (CC/PP): A user side framework for content negotiation" Note at

  I would argue that the accessibility community should be lobbying for such
  developments to take their needs into consideration (and I think you have
  much to gain) rather than dismissing it out of hand.
