I read with interest today's announcement by Microsoft of a "comprehensive
e-commerce strategy to make it easier for companies and consumers to conduct
business over the internet."  The details are found at
http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/1999/03-04csbb.htm

Does anyone have any information as to whether or not access issues for
consumers with disabilities has been addressed?
