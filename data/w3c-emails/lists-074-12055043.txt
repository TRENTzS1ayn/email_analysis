I have been working through my projects web site with Bobby in order to meet access standards.
The web page counter, provided by Pagecount, keeps falling foul of Bobby, because it is a server-sided image map.

I have provided text hyperlinks to all the links contained in the image, but the <a href=....> (as shown below) keeps failing Bobby.

TAG EXAMPLE: 
< a href="http://www.pagecount.com/aa-cgi-bin/user.map2/your number"> 
< img src="http://www.pagecount.com/aa-cgi-bin/counter.gif?your number" ISMAP></a> 

The href allows the counter image to be clickable to 5 links, removing it leaves the counter image but inactive. Is there a ways to pass Bobby with this type of counter?

Obviously there has been some sort of profile built up on the counter and we would prefer to carry on using it, as long as it passes Bobby. A large part of the project has been promoting web accessibility and the Bobby checker.
