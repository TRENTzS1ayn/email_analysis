Patrick,

I don't know what the best practice is for this combo box feature that is
on the page you mentioned but I have a bit of a solution for dealing with
the interface as it is.

If you press alt-down arrow, as opposed to just a standard down arrow, when
on the list, the list will open in a fashion that allows you to then cursor
through all entries in the list and press enter on the one you want.  The
Los Angeles Times at

http://www.latimes.com

uses these sorts of combo boxes for selecting topical directories at the
top of most of their pages.

I don't know what others think, but personally I prefer navigational links
and such presented in lists like this.  It makes dealing with a lot of the
page clutter a lot less frustrating and you only have to be exposed to it
when you want to use it.

Of course the trick is figuring out whether the combo box is one that
requires the alt-down arrow or not.  My strategy is simply to press that
key sequence on all such lists.

As I said this doesn't address the best practice and maybe there's a better
appproach.
