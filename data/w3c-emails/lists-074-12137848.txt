keyboard without also selecting each option of the list in turn. Simply
moving through the list "selects" the option, which triggers the onChange
event. The only way to avoid "selecting" a state is to *scroll* through the
list by clicking the drop-down button, clicking the scroll bar to find the
state you want, then clicking the state. Notice the "click, click, click"
here. There's no way to do this action by keyboard alone, so this is an
accessibility design issue.

Try pressing alt-down arrow when on the list.  I did this on the page and
could move through the list of states without triggering the event.  If I
pressed enter on the state I wanted, again after pressing alt-down arrow
and moving through the list, I then went to my selected state.
