Patrick,

In Windows, the intuitive, easy-to-remember, universally-known hot key to
drop a combo box list is F4. It seems unlikely that this key will work in
the context you describe, but I seem to recall -- and my memory may be
playing tricks on me -- that I have used the F4 keyboard shortcut when
browsing with IE or Netscape. It's worth a try.
