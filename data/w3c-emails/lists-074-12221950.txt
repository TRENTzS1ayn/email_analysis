Well, you're between a rock and a hard place.

If you can get the number from the counter people (some counters will do
this) then you could include it using a text object, or some kind of
server-side script, as alternative content. If not, the information cannot
be accessed except through an image. Which is a pretty good solid reason
declaring it to be inaccessible.

I agree that it is a shame. Technologically it is fairly easy to put
couting into your own page. But it requires cooperation between the page
author and the service provider, which is not always forthcoming. (And the
use of one of the many server platforms which actually supports this
behaviour, but since I can't think off-hand of one that doesn't I don't
think it is an important issue)

  I have been working through my projects web site with Bobby in order to meet access standards.
  The web page counter, provided by Pagecount, keeps falling foul of Bobby, because it is a server-sided image map.
  
  I have provided text hyperlinks to all the links contained in the image, but the <a href=....> (as shown below) keeps failing Bobby.
  
  TAG EXAMPLE: 
  < a href="http://www.pagecount.com/aa-cgi-bin/user.map2/your number"> 
  < img src="http://www.pagecount.com/aa-cgi-bin/counter.gif?your number" ISMAP></a> 
  
  The href allows the counter image to be clickable to 5 links, removing it leaves the counter image but inactive. Is there a ways to pass Bobby with this type of counter?
  
  Obviously there has been some sort of profile built up on the counter and we would prefer to carry on using it, as long as it passes Bobby. A large part of the project has been promoting web accessibility and the Bobby checker.
