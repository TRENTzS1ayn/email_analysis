I think Charles McCathieNevile addresses a frequently overlooked point here:

Too often we are told "you can't do that on a web page because it's not
accessible". It is, in my opinion, perfectly reasonable to create a web page
that is inaccessible to a particular group, as long as an alternative method
of providing the information to that group is also created. To simply reject
a particular design strategy out-of-hand does a potential dis-service to the
rest of your audience.

To make a non-web analogy, consider access ramps to public building. Yes,
sure, it is important to provide them for people who cannot use stairs. But
should they replace stairs? No, they should run alongside them. If public
buildings removed their stairs and replaced them all with lifts and ramps,
then *I* would be disadvantaged, which seems a little unfair.

Just my opinion.
