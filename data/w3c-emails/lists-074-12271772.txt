Ok ... here's another non-web analogy:
What if you got to the ramp or stairway and were denied access to *either*
because you did not have a particular component (ie; tatooed id number)
embedded/stamped/burned in one of your body parts?  (YIKES!!)
The "ramps" are not at issue - it's the "stairways" that deny access to anyone
who does not play (or is it pay?).
Sorry for being silly as this whole issue... but after viewing the TV adverts
I observe that those *able* to "open the door to PIII" are all children.  (if
you've seen the TV  adverts you'll know what I mean)
The message is loud and clear - it pushes the envelope and extends the issue
of accessibility beyond those with disabilities and to a generation who have
no earthly concept of the issues discussed here. 
A generation of whom, I fear, will swallow it happily and whole.
- More food for thought:
