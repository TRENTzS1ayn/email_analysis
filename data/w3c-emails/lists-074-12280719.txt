On the WAI homepage, under Resources, there is a poorly named
link "WAI Quicktips" that leads you to the following:

http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/QuickTips

There appears to be no link on the WAI homepage to the web
content checklist, but there probably should be; the URL for
that is:

http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-19990226/full-checklist

QuickTips are a brief summary that can fit on a business-card or
credit-card sized piece of paper; the checklist is a full list
of exactly the kinds of things you were looking for.
