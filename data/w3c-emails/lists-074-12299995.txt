no, but the link to the guidelines could well be
supplimented with a link to the checklist.

In the current organization, it's not clear whether
the relationship of the guidelines to the
checklist is "part of" or "see also";
each has it's own title page (incl. status of this document)
which suggests "see also" but there's no
entry for the checklist on http://www.w3.org/TR/
nor http://www.w3.org/WAI/

Also... the link from the "How the Guidelines are organized"
http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH/#Organization
section to the checklist doesn't go thru the references
section; that again suggests "part of".

In any case, it's now clear to me that the checklist
is more what I was after; for example:

"7.1 Avoid using tables for layout.   "
http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH/wai-pageauth.html#tech-avoid-table-for-layout

The admonitions against overuse of <font size> aren't
as explicit, but there's some relevant stuff in there.
