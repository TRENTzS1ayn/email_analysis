The Royal London Society for the Blind and Eyecue Ltd. would like to

extend an invitation to you and your members to participate in a BETA

PROGRAMME for the new 'Dorton at a Distance' ECDL course.





The European Computer Driving Licence (ECDL) is the first Open and

Distance Learning Course available under the Dorton at a Distance Programme.





The course material and the delivery mechanism have both been specifically

adapted to enable access by visually impaired computer users.





The ECDL and other courses to come are being delivered using breakthrough

Internet technology using the VITA System (Visually Impaired Training

Archive).





Whilst we are confident that the VITA software is stable, there will

always be room for improvement in the accessibility and usability of the

software, and it is only through the feedback of a wide range of real

users that the optimal configuration will be achieved.





This is a real opportunity for you to be heard and for you to

get your accessibility needs met.





Details of this exciting technology can be found on our Web site. Simply

point your browser to:

http://www.dorton-coll.ac.uk





You could also send mail to info@dorton-coll.ac.uk or use the return

path to this message.





Best Regards.

Isaac Kute
