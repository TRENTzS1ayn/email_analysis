I agree with this suggestion.  The list of accessibility checkpoints ought
to have a separate and easily found link on the WAI homepage.  It does have
more information then the Quicktips, but is less intimidating than the full
Authoring guidelines page.  It already does have the links to the full
page, so if someone wants more information on why they should "Avoid any
blinking or updating of the screen that causes flicker." they can find more
information.
