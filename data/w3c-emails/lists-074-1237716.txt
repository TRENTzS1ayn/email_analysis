The choice of scripting language is up to you.  The DOM level 1
per W3C includes a "selected" boolean attribute on each OPTION in
the SELECT.  That is what you want to read to find out which of
them have this status.

Check your local browser's DOM implementation for conformance
with W3C level 1 DOM, but that it the general idea of what you
want to look for.
