Hi! Rich.

Thanks for your mail.  I personally don't believe there's anything wrong
with extending civil liberties to blind people.  Certainly, it gives me
great pleasure to be a blind driving instructor.  I mean questions have been
raised in the past about lifts in multi-storey car parks having braille
buttons.  Well! now you know why.

On a more serious note.  The driving licence is actually geared to certify a
person to drive a computer and that seems to be a perfectlly legal
certification to extend to the visually impaired.  The European computer
driving licence is just the first course of many that will be delivered
using VITA and the potential is great for visually impaired people.

Regards

Isaac Kute.
