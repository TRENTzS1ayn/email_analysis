Hello:

My name is Roz Fruchtman.  I am the owner/manager of HTML-Haven
Discussion
Group hosted at Onelist.com.

SUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION
mailto:html-haven-subscribe@onelist.com [to subscribe]
mailto:html-haven-unsubscribe@onelist.com [to UN-subscribe]

HTML-Haven is an HTML Discussion Group dedicated to accommodate the
novice
as well as the seasoned web designer.

All questions are welcome no matter how silly or trivial they may
seem.  No
question is too silly or trivial as we have all been there before and
have
gone through what the new or novice designer is experiencing now.  I
can
*vividly* remember when I had what seemed like a simple question but
for
the life of me I could not find the answer.  When I finally learned
the
answer, it was indeed simple, but to me it was very difficult to
find.  I
don't want others to have to go through the same traumas that I did. 
It is
not necessary when there are so many out there that are willing to
help and
at the least direct the person asking the question to the right
resource.

We are in existence 3 1/2 months and I have worked very hard to make
everyone feel welcome and to create a friendly atmosphere where one
can ask
whatever questions they are faced with at any given time -- providing
they
are related to web design, the Internet, email, browser
compatibility/incompatibility, web research, search engines, or
anything
else that is somehow related.

HTML Haven Discussion Group was created to provide a Haven for all to
come
when they are in need of HTML or related help.  We welcome the
experienced
web designer as well, who would like to give back some of their
knowledge
to help those that are new to the field.  Won't you join us!
