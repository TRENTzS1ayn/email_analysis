Emacspeak At CSUN-99
--------------------

As usual, Aster and I will be attending the CSUN conference
this year.  In the past, I've done informal demos and one on
one hallway conversations with Emacspeak users--
and this has in general worked pretty well. 

Given the current buzz around Linux and Open Source software
in general and the increasing number of Emacspeak users in
particular, I'd like to pull together a couple of informal
Birds Of A Feather (BOF) meetings during the time I'm at
CSUN. The purpose is to meet current and future Emacspeak
users and to allow individuals to share ideas on work
techniques that prove productive.  This will also be a good
opportunity for users who have been considering the Linux
platform to acquaint themselves with the possibilities that
Freedom affords.

I arrive the evening of Tuesday, March 16, and leave the
afternoon of Sunday, March 21.  Any evening during the
conference (except Friday --The Sun Java evening) will work
for me.  Sometime during the day Wednesday, Friday or
Saturday may also work.

Looking forward to seeing everyone at the piano bar or any
other convenient hallway that we may happen to meet--
