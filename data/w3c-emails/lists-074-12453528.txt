A few months ago, Aaron Doust and I set up four pages at Aaron's Web site using four different techniques for making the graphics on those pages accessible.

Aaron and I will be doing some fiddling with the pages and will produce a finalized version and ultimate comments shortly. In the meantime, go take a look.
