Monday, March 29, 1999 
Time:     4:30 p.m. - 6 p.m.

Accessibility of the World Wide Web may not be foremost in everyone's minds,
but it is vital to the 54 million Americans with disabilities, to enable
them to participate in educational, economic and civic dialog.  This
presentation will examine the obligations on the public and private sector
to ensure that this new technology remains barrier-free for people with
disabilities.
Judy Brewer will describe how a partnership of industry, disability
organizations, access research centers, and government is working together
to address Web accessibility. She will focus on improvements in Web
technologies to facilitate accessibility; guidelines for Web content
developers and Web-based applications manufacturers; and initiatives to
raise awareness and provide training on accessibility solutions.
Sign Language Interpreting Services Will Be Provided.
