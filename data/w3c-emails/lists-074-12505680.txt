There's a commercial PDF to HTML converter 

http://www.bcl-computers.com/contents/PDFSolutions/magellan.htm

Does anyone know how well it works for producing accessible output, and how
it compares with the free adobe conversion programs and services described
at http://access.adobe.com/

(which include a web form, plugin, and email)

there's another tool "net-it central" listed at 
http://www.pdfzone.com/products/software/tool_NetItCentral.html
but the link on the page is broken.
