Hi!  Any ideas why beta version explorer 5.0 won't recognise the coding ---   target="new window"?  ---    I downloaded 5.0 and it seems great, except it won't work on any of the url's that I use this coding above in (I sent an e-mail to MS about it.)  It freezes the current window I am in and sometimes won't let me close it out in the conventional way.  Has anyone else tried using this newest version of explorer?

Thanks for any input on this matter.   :-D
