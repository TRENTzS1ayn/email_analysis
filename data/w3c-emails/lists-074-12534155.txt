 Adobe At CSUN 99:
-----------------


The Adobe access team will be at CSUN-99 to meet with access
customers and to discuss current and future Adobe products
relevant to universal information access.

In addition to myself, we will have Liz McQuarrie from
Acrobat Engineering and John Leckrone from Acrobat server
marketing attending the conference  on Thursday, March  18, 1999.

Stop by the Adobe suite in the Marriott between 11:00am and
14:00am on March 18 to chat with us about PDF access and to
hear where we are going with our access solutions during the
coming year.

Location:
---------
 
The Adobe hospitality suite (lunch will be provided) will
take place in the Marriott hotel.  Unfortunately, I will not
have the room number until next week; you can find out by
calling my extension at Adobe 1 800 866 8006 (63945) on
Wednesday, March 17.

Look forward to seeing you there--

--Raman (and the Adobe Access team)
