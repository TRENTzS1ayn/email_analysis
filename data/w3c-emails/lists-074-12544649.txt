Look forward to seeing you at CSUN.  By the way, there will be an EASI

technology and accessibility.  The webcast will be posted tonight at 9
Eastern, 8 Central, 7 Mountain and 6 Pacific time.

> As usual, Aster and I will be attending the CSUN conference
> this year.  In the past, I've done informal demos and one on
> one hallway conversations with Emacspeak users--
> and this has in general worked pretty well. 
> 
> Given the current buzz around Linux and Open Source software
> in general and the increasing number of Emacspeak users in
> particular, I'd like to pull together a couple of informal
> Birds Of A Feather (BOF) meetings during the time I'm at
> CSUN. The purpose is to meet current and future Emacspeak
> users and to allow individuals to share ideas on work
> techniques that prove productive.  This will also be a good
> opportunity for users who have been considering the Linux
> platform to acquaint themselves with the possibilities that
> Freedom affords.
> 
> I arrive the evening of Tuesday, March 16, and leave the
> afternoon of Sunday, March 21.  Any evening during the
> conference (except Friday --The Sun Java evening) will work
> for me.  Sometime during the day Wednesday, Friday or
> Saturday may also work.

> Looking forward to seeing everyone at the piano bar or any
