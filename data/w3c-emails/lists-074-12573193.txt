attached mail follows:
In my capacity as Web Accessibility Auditor, a client has asked me to
prepare a 10-page report proposing a web design colour scheme readable
by people who are colour blind.  The report is to include:
? a section describing the 5 or 6 colour schemes for several home pages,
within a page layout to be provided by the client.  "Colour scheme"
includes the colours of the banner, navigation buttons, left sidebar
background, text and links.
? a section explaining how and why the standard was chosen.  This
rationale must be based on research, and derived from a method or an
authoritative, credible source.  The suitability of the colour schemes
for people who are colour blind must be based on more than subjective
opinion. 

I have come up with five colour schemes and welcome your comments.  They
can be found at http://www.eaglecom.bc.ca/qp_project/colours.htm .  Any
other info is also welcomed.

Thanks kindly,
Glenda
