        Subject: Ergo's Patent Publishes

The patent for the tools that create Ergo Linguistic Technologies'
software has just been published by the U.S. Patent Office.  Copies
of it can be obtained from them through the usual channels.  Many
have asked me to notify them when the patent is published.  

The patent description contains a theory of syntax that is far
simpler and far more general than current theories, and more
importantly, that makes software that individuals working with
other theories can only dream of.  For examples of the Ergo
software go to http://www.ergo-ling.com.
