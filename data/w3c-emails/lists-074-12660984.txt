Sorry, I realize I should have given you the URL for our pages. We haven't
upgraded these pages to the WebPublisher 3.0 but it will give you an idea of
what we do now and would like to keep doing in the future.

The biggest issue is the expanded record jump. Users get a list of titles
with a link for the larger record. In the new version, the link is inserted
using Javascript.

Our pages are at http://www.naric.com/naric/search

Thanks!
