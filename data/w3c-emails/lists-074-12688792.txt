A couple weeks ago we had some discussion on keyboard methods of dealing
with option lists.  Someone had mentioned that F4 might be a way to open
the lists from the keyboard.  I have always used alt-down arrow to do this
so never tried it in Internet Explorer.  I did want to mention that I
noticed in IE 5 under the keyboard shortcuts section of the help, F4 is
listed as the key to jump directly to the Address bar.  I don't know if
this was the case in previous versions but it clearly won't open the option
list in IE 5.
