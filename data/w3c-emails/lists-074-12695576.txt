My _guess_ is that you won't be able to use this approach on them.
I would suspect that an economic motive would work better rather
than a legal one -- see if you could explain to them that they
could very well be losing some business (ESPECIALLY lucrative
government contracts!) if they continue shipping a product that does
not promote accessibility.

Instead of saying, "You're in violation of the ADA", say, "Well, you
realize that we -- and other potential customers -- can't possibly
use this software without violating the law, right?"  And then see if
they're willing to change it.  If they're not going to do it with
that approach, they probably won't do it period, and you may indeed
have to change to a more accessible product.

(The HTML Writers Guild recently changed away from one web-based
messaging system to another due to accessibility -- and other --
problems.)
