I wonder,

how many of you who rail against the ADA actually have a disability?  How
many of you are unemployed because you are disabled?  How many of you are
denigrated and looked down upon?  How many of you face condescending people
who tell you it is amazing that you can do what you do?  How many of you are
disabled and have any understanding of what most people with disabilities
face in their everyday lives?  How many of you ever experienced not being
able to find an accessible restroom?

Sincerely,

Mike Burks
