Ok guys!!!   Let me summarize the problem the way I see it.  On the one 
hand, the ADA is an excellent incentive for people in the United States to
make life easier for people with disabilities and I don't think anybody
contests that fact.


The problem lies outside the U.S..  The fact is that you cannot use the ADA
outside the US as an incentive to make web sites accessible. It is where it
could have a counter-effect, making people feel that, since the law only
concerns the US, other people don't have to make any effort of making their
web sites accessible.

 What is, then, the best way to deal with it.  Point the ADA as an example?
Or, rather, leaving ADA out, finding incentives that people of every country
could relate to.

I believe that the answer lies somewhere between both extremes and through
open-minded discussions...
