Regardless of what countries other than the US are legally responsible for,
the concept of accessible websites is the right thing to do.  That is what
we need to communicate to web designers.   The ADA serves the concept; not
the other way around.

Ok guys!!!   Let me summarize the problem the way I see it.
On the one 
hand, the ADA is an excellent incentive for people in the
United States to
make life easier for people with disabilities and I don't
think anybody
contests that fact.


The problem lies outside the U.S..  The fact is that you
cannot use the ADA
outside the US as an incentive to make web sites accessible.
It is where it
could have a counter-effect, making people feel that, since
the law only
concerns the US, other people don't have to make any effort
of making their
web sites accessible.

 What is, then, the best way to deal with it.  Point the ADA
as an example?
Or, rather, leaving ADA out, finding incentives that people
of every country
could relate to.

I believe that the answer lies somewhere between both
extremes and through
open-minded discussions...
