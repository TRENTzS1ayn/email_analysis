I think my original posting has been misunderstood.  I wanted to know if
it's true that websites have been taken down as a result of the ADA - not
why they're are behaving unethically, or that we're well rid of them.

I'm still interested in hearing an answer.  I'd also be interested to know
the reasons they give - if this is the case.  Is it due to the costs (real
or perceived) in making the site accessible, worries about legal bills, or
something else.

Thanks

Brian
