All,

I have not heard of any sites being taken down....the fact is if you do
business in the US, you may well be affected by the ADA, and, just
incidentally you are still bound to provide information in an accessible
manner website or not.

The fact is that any organization that is receiving federal money is
particularly vulnerable to action.

To answer the question I have heard of none being taken down.

Sincerely,

mike burks
