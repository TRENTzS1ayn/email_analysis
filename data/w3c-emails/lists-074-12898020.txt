I would like to correct an erroneous assumption in the attached email that 
states that the Americans with Disabilities Act does not apply outside the 
US.  This is not true.
     
Under the Employment Title of the ADA, the definition of employee includes 
US citizens who work for American companies, their subsidiaries, or firms 
controlled by Americans outside the US.  Under the ADA, a US citizen working

for a US company overseas could request that a website include accessible 
design as a reasonable accommodation.  However, a company would not have to 
comply with the ADA if the action required by the ADA would violate the host

country's laws.
     
Setting US employment civil rights aside, there are also protections under 
the ADA for consumers regardless of their citizenship or status.  All 
businesses covered under the ADA are required to provide "effective 
communication" in the provision of their programs, goods and services. 
American companies, their subsidiaries or firms controlled by Americans 
outside the US must comply with the ADA.  This is similar to the case of 
American cruise lines operating in international waters.  Cruise patrons, 
regardless of citizenship, have the right to nondiscrimination in their 
access to the cruise line programs, services and facilities.
     
In summary, US businesses overseas generally cannot escape the compliance 
requirements set forth under the ADA.  Further discussion about the ADA can 
be found at "Applying the ADA to the Internet: A Web Accessibility Standard"

at http://www.rit.edu/~easi/law/weblaw1.htm as well as at "Is Your Site 
ADA-Compliant? or a Lawsuit-in-Waiting?" at The Internet Lawyer 
http://www.internetlawyer.com/ada.htm
     
The above technical assistance is intended to provide a general 
understanding of the current law relating to the Americans with Disabilities

Act.  It is not to be regarded as legal advice.  Companies or individuals 
with particular questions should seek advice of counsel.
