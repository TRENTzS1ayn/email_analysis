Here is a gotcha. Any ideas?  

Trying to use HTML 4.0 but make it backward compatible with HTML 3.2.

Trying to center a table here, and both <CENTER> and <DIV=CENTER> are
deprecated
in HTML 4.  The 4.0 spec says to use <TABLE ALIGN=CENTER>, but this is not
read
by many lower-version browsers.

So if we stay within spec, we'll lose visibility on the lower-version
browsers.

Any ideas on how to get around this?  

How about using both tags where necessary, thereby conforming to the HTML 4
spec while permitting lower-level browsers to see the format
properly.  So, the table would be:

<CENTER>
  <TABLE ALIGN=CENTER>
      etc etc etc
  </TABLE>
</CENTER>


Would this be acceptable?   Could try the <P ALIGN=CENTER> angle, which is
supported in 4.0 spec, but I seem to recall lower-version browsers having a
problem with that one too....

Thanks,rob
