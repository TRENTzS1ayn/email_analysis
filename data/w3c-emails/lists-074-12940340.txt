EXCLUSIVE: TWO INDISPENSABLE UTILITIES
Our Software Library LaunchPad has two 48-hour
exclusives you need to try. One opens your ex-
isting HTML pages, inserts metatags, and helps
you tune up your site for maximum search engine
visibility. The other is a veritable Swiss Army
Knife for graphics files. It's not a whole tool-
box, but you can fix a quick red-eye problem or
do a bunch of other handy manipulations.
