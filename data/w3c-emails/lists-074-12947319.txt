Dear WAI Interest Group Member:

We are pleased to announce that W3C released the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines as a Proposed Recommendation today, March 24, 1999. The document
will undergo review by W3C Member organizations through April 21, 1999. The
Director's decision as to the disposition of the proposal will be made
within several weeks following the close of the review period.

The Proposed Recommendation document is at
http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT. Please note that this version
supercedes all previous versions. Please update any links from your own
site to previous date-specific working drafts.

A hearty "thank you" to the document editors, Wendy Chisholm, Gregg
Vanderheiden, and Ian Jacobs, and to the Working Group members who
responded to the large number of comments sent in during Last Call. A list
of comments received and changes made during Last Call is available from
the Working Group home page at http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/.

Regards,

Judy
