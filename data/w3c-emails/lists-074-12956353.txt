Are there any windows guru's out there! Here's my problem:
We're using office-97 and outlook for e-mail. There are a few machines 
where outlook seems to be using microsoft exchange to display the messages 
when you press enter (or click) on their headings in a view. Also, the 
profile is different in these versions -- doesn't include as many options 
for configuring servers etc. Why is this? The version numbers are the same, 
but its behaving differently. Can't find anything which can help. I've 
looked in the help files for outlook and exchange and in the windows95 
resource kit. Outlook is quite capable of displaying messages on its own 
with no help from exchange! <smile>
Sorry again about the off-topic post, but this is driving me crazy. Anyone 
that can point me to a *good* resource on windows95 configuration, system 
management, and network management please please do. Maybe there isn't such 
a thing -- maybe no one understands how this pile of junk really works! 
<smile>
