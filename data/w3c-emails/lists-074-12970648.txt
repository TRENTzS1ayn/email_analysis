I think the problem is to create a calendar which makes sense and which
conveys a month of information on inspection, rather than having to skip
by days.

The way I would do it at the moment is to put the day and date at the
start of each cell.

  Any grad students looking for an interesting HTML/CGI project?  I suggest
  that devices designed for the blind as PIMs (the Blazie Braille 'n Speak
  for example) incorporate good models for calendars / day timers /
  appointment books -- and that they might translate well.
  
  I recently came across this reference from the Trace Center which discusses
  the issues at URL:
  http://www.trace.wisc.edu/docs/wings/moving/dayrat.htm
  
  Our local Tech Act project has a fairly decent calendar that is accessible.
   It can be found at URL:
