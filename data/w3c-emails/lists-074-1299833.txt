NeoPlanet is not a new browser, it's a new front end. It is based on the
Internet Explorer browser (which is notoriously slow). It's a pretty cool
looking GUI, but nothing particularly revolutionary, IMHO.

If you are looking for a fast browser (and don't want to deal with a
text-only browser like Lynx), try Opera (http://operasoftware.com). It's 35
dollars, but worth it if you need speed. And you're supporting an
alternative. Furthermore, getting back to this list, it supports (or
purports to support) accessibility.

Finally, when sending messages to this list, recommend you use plain text
format.
