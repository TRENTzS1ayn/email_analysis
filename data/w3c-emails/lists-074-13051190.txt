Hi,
As you may already know I am currently conducting a study of the WAI Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines.  The first stage investigated how a group
of page authors used the Guidelines to adapt a Web page.  The second stage
has just begun and will involve visually impaired people evaluating the
accessibility of the pages produced in the first stage.  The pages have
been put on the Web at http://phoenix.herts.ac.uk/sdru/test/ .  They
illustrate the different approaches taken by the authors in implementing
the advice of the Guidelines.

Below is a copy of the information I have sent to a variety of mailing
lists inviting visually impaired people to take part.

Regards,

Chetz.

Apologies if you receive multiple copies of this message.

As part of a study which is evaluating the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines of the Web Accessibility Initiative, people who are blind or
visually impaired are invited to test the accessibility of some web pages.

This is the second stage of the study.  In the first stage web page authors
were asked to create an accessible web page using the Guidelines.  This has
provided some insight into the ease-of-use of the Guidelines, and I now
want to evaluate the accessibility for visually impaired people of the
pages the authors created.  The pages have therefore been put on a web
site.  The evaluation mainly involves viewing different examples and
reporting which were found to be more accessible. The address of the site
is: http://phoenix.herts.ac.uk/sdru/test/

Instructions for testing the pages:
The web site contains examples of various web elements such as: images,
imagemaps, forms, frames, tables, and different approaches to the
presentation of article headers and references.  The task involves viewing
all the examples of a particular element, such as images, then answering a
few questions about which example was the most accessible for you, and why.
You can evaluate as many elements as you like, in any order.  If you do not
have time to do all of them it would be useful if you could start with the
tables, forms and frames.

The questions are listed at the end of this message, and are also available
on the web site.  For the tables there are additional questions which
require you to interrogate the tables in order to find an answer.

You can use any one of a variety of strategies for entering the answers and
sending them in, for example: create a reply to this message, or save this
message as a text file; or save the questions from the web page as a text
file.  You may wish to switch between your browser and email package to
answer the questions, or make notes and enter the answers after viewing all
the elements.  All answers will be kept confidential.

Please send the answers to Chetz Colwell <c.g.colwell@herts.ac.uk>.  If you
receive this message via a mailing list, please do not send answers to the
list (otherwise I cannot be responsible for their confidentiality).

I am a research student at the Sensory Disabilities Research Unit of the
University of Hertfordshire, UK.  Please contact me if you require any
further information, or if you need assistance with testing the pages, or
if you are interested in the results of the study.  Contact details are
provided at the end of this message.

Thank you very much for your time and effort.
