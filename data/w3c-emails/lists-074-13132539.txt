Some background for people interested in this technique:

Checkpoint 13.6 as found in 
  
  Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0

  http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#gl-facilitate-navigation

is intended to address the same need that this technique addresses.  We
need to flesh out the techniques in this area, both in terms of HTML
techniques such as the internal bypass link found at <http://www.acb.org>
and user-agent techniques such as skip-block.

Scott, can you write the script so that it edits the page, such that if the
script doesn't run one leaves in place an HTML fragment containing an
explicit skip-link and if the script does run one replaces this with an
active widget offering a minimized navbar?
