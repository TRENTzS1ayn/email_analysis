With regard to DHTML,

I've been doing some work with Microsoft InterDev recently to build a web front end for
a database. According to MS documentation, I was under the impression that DHTML is
only IE-friendly. That's why I didn't use it--*.asp seemed to be the only alternative.
I viewed your page successfully in Netscape 4.05, but I'm curious as to how
cross-browser friendly DHTML is. Is DHTML more accessible than asp?

Thanks,
