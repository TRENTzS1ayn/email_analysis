Hi, Kristine

DHTML uses a combination of scripts and element attributes to create
certain effects.  As to be expected, Netscape and Microsoft do
not offer the same features which can be used with DHTML.  However,
by keeping the DHTML within a sub-set of certain features it is
possible to have a fair amount of DHTML work with both.  The demo page
I created works for both MS and Netscape browsers, but has to do things
a little differently for each browser.
