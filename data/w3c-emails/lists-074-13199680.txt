Does anyone have any estimates of the percentage of web sites that are
accessible to people with special needs?   There are plenty of guidelines
for accessibility, but does anyone know what percentage of sites follow
the guidelines?

Please reply to me personally, as I do not subscribe to this mailing list.

Many thanks .. Nigel Bevan
