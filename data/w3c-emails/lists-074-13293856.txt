I think I should mention that "a page which uses element movement to convey
information" would be a problem for blind users.

Subject:Re: A different approach for web page accessibility

Hi,

Just a clarification.  Server-side scripting can have some limitations
depending on the application.  A very general one is that creaters
of web pages may not have access to servers which provide the
facilities needed.  For example, may ISP's won't let a user create their
own CGI scripts because of security issues, etc.

A second problem is that the changes in the display could be more
interactive
than server-side scripting can be provide.  For example, a page which
uses element movement to convey information cannot be as easily done
with server-side scripts.

Another interaction problem is that the application may require faster
response than provided by server-side scripts responding via a network.

As with many things, there are trade-offs between server-side scripting and
client-side scripting.
