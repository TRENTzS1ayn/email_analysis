please correct me if i am wrong and add your comments.

As i understand it, you cannot have simultaneous close captioning on a LIVE webcast over the internet as you can on television.  basically the technology is not there yet.  

To get the close captioning you need to take the video after it is over and use something like Adobe premiere to add the close captioning.

Is this correct?
