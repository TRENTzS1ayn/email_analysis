You can use SMIL and the RealNetworks G2 system to do this right now
using live RealVideo, (or RealAudio, MPEG, AVI, or other data streams G2
supports) along with live RealText.   Then, If you have multiple closed-
caption feeds, you can use a SMIL file switch statement to stream a
different-language text stream to each viewer depending on the language
they specified in their respective players.

Let me know if you need more details.

P.S.: I did not read any prior messages in this thread so excuse me
if my response is not in line.
