Erik,

I am copying work and could you please respond to all so i can see it there
<thanks>.

Our contractor who is videoing the LIVE webcast over the internet and
hosting it for us at www.broadcast.com are using RealNetworks G2.  We would
like to provide close captioning with via text or sign for employees who are
deaf as well as deaf viewers around the world.  Right now we only have a
text transcript going up with in two days.

We had originally asked our contractor and he said it could not be done in
real time.  Sounds like he may be wrong.  Its more likely they havent done
this before and they are a national PR firm (same poeople did  Victoria's
Secrets LIVECAST) .

Where can i find more information or get a list of events that have done
this?  Any idea how much this costs?

Cant speak much about it now, but i can say this event will have national
exposure and morning TV coverage.  We hope every classroom will be tuned in
as well as coin collectors everywhere, plus other interested parties.

If you would like to take this conversation to the phone lines, please
provide a phone number and time you would be available and I can call you.
My number is 202.216.1642 (Washington DC) and can be reached after 8AM EST.

many thanks,  rob
