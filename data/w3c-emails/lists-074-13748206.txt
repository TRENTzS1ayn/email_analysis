Does anyone know of sites (English please) that are AAA compliant (besides 
the WAI) -- and brag about it?

Kynn, why doesn't fly the AAA banner?  (It can't just be because that 
orange/yellow clashes with purple?)

And a not entirely theoretical question..

Can a site claim AA conformance without using CSS?

Checkpoint 3.6 says to "use style sheets to control layout and 
presentation" but how strict is this?  My interpretation is that a site 
would have to forgo <B> <I> <CENTER> <FONT> tags altogether and elements 
like ALIGN and BGCOLOR (I am sure I am leaving many others off this list) 
but then COULD be AA compliant without style sheets.

What do you think of this interpretation?

Thank you.
