Hello all

Yesterday (30 of June), the Portuguese Parliament approved
the Petition for the Accessibility of the Portuguese Internet
as recommendation to the Government.

Now, the Portuguese Government should adopt the necessary
measures to guarantee full accessibility of government and public
services web information.

The Web Accessibility Initiate was mentioned in the parliament report.

Next week we will prepare a press release and the English translation of
the Portuguese Parliament position concerning web accessibility.
