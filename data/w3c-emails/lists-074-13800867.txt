Netomat was released last week; has anyone taken a look at it?  I
forgot about it until today and I'm on my laptop on a trip, so it's
going to have to wait until this weekend when I'm back home.  Have
you taken a look at yet?  I'm especially curious as to what non-
textual users would think of it.  (And I have no direct access to
any.)
