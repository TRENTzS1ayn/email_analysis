Hello again

Following the Portuguese Parliament recommendations
concerning the Petition for the Accessibility of the
Portuguese Internet, the President of the Portuguese
 Mission for the Information Society (in representation
of the Minister of Science and Technology) announced
today (July, 2), in meeting held in Lisbon (Portugal) with
the representatives of the European Blind Union,
WAI (Charles McCathieNevile ), PASIG and the
Portuguese National Rehabilitation Secretary that,
during this month, the Govern will approve a
Ministry Council resolution that will make mandatory
web accessibility to online information published
by the Portuguese government and public services.

During my speech I expressed a wish that during the
Portuguese Presidencies of the European Union Council
and Western European Union, that will take place during
the first semester of the year 2000
(http://www.min-nestrangeiros.pt/min-nestrangeiros/politica/ue2000/emolp.htm
l.en),
the Portuguese government take actions to stimulate
and promote similar measures in other European Countries.

With this in mind, maybe some of you could begin a
European strategy for web accessibility.

Hello Judy,

Tomorrow, February 17, PASIG (Portuguese Accessibility Special Interest
Group) will submit to the Portuguese Parliament the Petition for the
Accessibility of the Portuguese Internet.

The web accessibility discussion will be now at the Portuguese Parliament.

During 60 days (from 1998/12/03 to 1999/01/31) we collected 8,721 individual
signatures (we needed 4,000 to submit the Petition) and the support of 149
organizations.  During this period more than 800 web sites have been linked
to our homepage.

We believe (hope) that by June 1999, Web Accessibility could be law in
Portugal.

Could you update Portuguese Information in the "Policies Related to Web
Accessibility " ?

Thanks in advance
Francisco Godinho and Ricardo Silva
