Checkpoint 5.3 should be read as qualifying the effect of checkpoint 3.6
in relation to those layout functions which, until style sheets are better
supported, may, subject to the qualifications in section 5.3, be performed
via the misuse of table markup in HTML.

Thus, one could still use CSS to control margins, borders, fonts, etc.,
thereby influencing the layout of the text to that extent, but also rely
on tables to produce a columnar presentation. I think the most natural
reading of the guidelines is that style sheets are to be used to the
extent that they are supported by user agents, but that the use of tables
for layout, under prescribed circumstances, is permitted at a priority 2
level. 

If the working group were to endorse this interpretation, it could perhaps
be clarified in the techniques document.
