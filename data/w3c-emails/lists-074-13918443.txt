My thanks go to those who assist me in working out things web.  My
gifs now appear to be working but the site is always under evolution. 
It is up now as close as it is going to get for now as I need to
concern myself with other matters for a while.  I'll be happy to take
suggestions and implement them if possible within my limitted capacity
however.

Though there are many links on the site that go outside its boundaries
and it is sometimes necessary to poke around a bit to see what my
unclear constructs are attempting to get at,  I am attempting to
provide as comprehensive a site as possible toward the end of
providing information concerning the accessibility of electronic
public access services technology for mainly implementers and
consumers.  I won't try right now to meddle with makers, but some of
that is in there too especially where the web is concerned.
