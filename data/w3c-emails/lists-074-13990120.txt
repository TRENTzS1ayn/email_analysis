I agree with Kynn.   Triple-A sites meet the 1.0 guidelines, and these are the
sites that we need to use as the bases for determining what improvements need to
become part of a subsequent version of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
(WCAG).  

The challenge for subsequent version(s) of the WCAG will be to maintain the
accessibility features already embodied while extending to additional disability
groups.  We also need to discuss how the Authoring Tools and User Agent
guidelines will become part of the solution.

A triple-AAA rating indicates a site that is close as possible to
all three levels of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0;
nothing more, nothing less.

If you feel that it's not properly accessible, then you must work
to get the guidelines updated, rather than dealing with individual
sites that claim triple-AAA compliance.
