How can you ever tell?  It's very subjective, I think.

I am beginning to think that no site will ever attain a Triple
AAA ratings; you will always be able to find some fault or say
that they haven't "done enough."  Double AA ratings look far
enough away already.

I suspect the best that the HTML Writers Guild's web site will
be able to hope for is a Single-A; the AWARE Center might be
able to wrangle a Double-AA if I can find the time to sift
through the requirements.
