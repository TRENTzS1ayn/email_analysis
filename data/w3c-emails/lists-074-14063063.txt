Kynn,

The only reason I am subscribed to this list and to the gl list is to work
towards getting the guidelines updated to include the greater number of
disabled who depend on graphics and multimedia for comprehension of text.

My thought in pointing out the lack of accessibility that comes with a web
site that supposedly "earned" a triple A rating, is to raise consciousness
on the fact that even meeting the lowest level of compliance (or the person
said they did), doesn't result in an accessible page. 

As Jason pointed out, the site doesn't meet the guidelines set out in
14.2, even tho 14.2 is a low priority, it was completely ignored on this
site, to the detriment of those who would want to access the information.
This page is (as I understand) now displaying a triple-A logo of
compliance, yet it isn't compliant. 

And I will re-interate what I've said before, that guidelines that address
the NEED to include graphics, including 14.2 and others, should be much
higher priority than level 3 because of the vast numbers of people who NEED
this compliance to access the content of a page. 

Jonathan has proposed some good specifics on the guidelines that need to
be re-written to include cognitively disabled folks. I strongly suggest
that these changes be incorporated in the next possible update.
