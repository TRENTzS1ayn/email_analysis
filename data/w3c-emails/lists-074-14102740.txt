Just for you and me rich, I've put it in place and await a piece that
is yet to bedevelopped or rather provided to me to see if it can be
used or if not how it might be made to be used.  I so far have only
been able to open and close and maximize and minimize it or rather
minimize it because I think maximize is greyed out.  I got it all yes,
the netomat and the jre.
It sure looks fun.
