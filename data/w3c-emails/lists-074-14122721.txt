It is interesting to notice the extent to which these articles tend to
focus on vision impairment, as distinct from other types of disabilities.
This is reflected in the examples cited and the choices of interviewees.
Perhaps vision impairment is the most obvious circumstance that comes to
mind when considering barriers to web access, or is it rather that there
exists an especially outward-oriented group of highly intelligent and
capable people interested in this field who happen to have vision
impairments and who are easy to find from a journalist's perspective?

Please note that no criticism whatsoever is intended here; I am simply
inquiring into an apparently consistent (though not universal) tendency in
the reporting of these issues.
