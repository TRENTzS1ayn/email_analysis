I recently discovered that ABC Radio National here in Australia
(http://www.abc.net.au/rn/) offers transcripts of certain of its
programmes via the web. I haven't checked the accessibility of the site,
and, as I understand it, the transcripts appear several days after the
programmes themselves have been broadcast. Are other radio stations with a
presence on the web adopting similar policies?
