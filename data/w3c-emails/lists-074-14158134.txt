I don't know about radio, but CNN offers transcripts.

:I recently discovered that ABC Radio National here in
Australia
:(http://www.abc.net.au/rn/) offers transcripts of certain
of its
:programmes via the web. I haven't checked the accessibility
of the site,
:and, as I understand it, the transcripts appear several
days after the
:programmes themselves have been broadcast. Are other radio
stations with a
:presence on the web adopting similar policies?
