[[Apologies for sending this to the listserv, but I have had not luck sending
messages to the mail addresses at W3C eg web-human@w3.org.]]

I receive double messages from this listserv. I think the problem is that my
email address changed (only slightly) and although I unsubscribed with my old
email address using the proper procedures and subscribed using the new
address, I keep on getting mail from both. Our mail administrator looked into
the matter and assured me the problem is not on this side.

Could someone please forward this message to the responsible party?

Thanks a lot
