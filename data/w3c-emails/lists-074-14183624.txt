Are there any accessibility issues regarding the citation of URLs, both
online and in print?

We've been having some discussion locally about the conventions for our
newsletter.

The following have been suggested:

<URL:http://www.foo.com/>
<http://www.foo.com/>
http://www.foo.com/
www.foo.com

The final alternative, with a Courier font, has been suggested as it's
shorter than the others.

Would this cause any accessibility (or other) problems?

Thanks

Brian
