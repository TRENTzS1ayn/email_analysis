Rob,

I went in with Netscape 4.0 on Solaris; the URL isn't quite right
(should be <URL:http://www1.usmint.gov/50States/fsq/main.cfm>.  In
Netscape, if you don't have Shockwave, you don't see much at all.

I went to the main Mint site with Lynx, and saw only this:

                                                         The United States Mint

I can't figure out how to get to the quarter system at all.  Turns out
the NJ State Quarter link is the right one, but comparing the content
in Netscape and Lynx, there's a lot missing.  It seems that broken
comment syntax is hiding most of the page; that's probably why Bobby
passed it (it didn't see most of it).
