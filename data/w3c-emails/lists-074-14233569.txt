These observations hold for general computer usage as well.  It is only 
recently that computers included sound cards as standard equipment, so it 
only recently that being deaf was much of an impediment to computer use. 
 Likewise, being a paraplegic was not much of an impediment once one had a 
table at the proper height.  It would be interesting to get more attention 
on how someone with quadriplegia uses the web.  It would be interesting too 
to get more attention on how non-readers use computers.
