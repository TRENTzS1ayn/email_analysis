My personal preference is for http://www.w3.org/ separated from any
punctuation by whatever means possible (including leaving a full stop off the
end of a sentence) to be unambiguous.

  Are there any accessibility issues regarding the citation of URLs, both
  online and in print?
  
  We've been having some discussion locally about the conventions for our
  newsletter.
  
  The following have been suggested:
  
  <URL:http://www.foo.com/>
  <http://www.foo.com/>
  http://www.foo.com/
  www.foo.com
  
  The final alternative, with a Courier font, has been suggested as it's
  shorter than the others.
  
  Would this cause any accessibility (or other) problems?
  
  Thanks
  
  Brian
