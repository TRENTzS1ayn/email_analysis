After much thought of trying to use the guidelines, rate my site and
understand all this, i came up with an abridged version of the checkpoints
to help.  The results are posted at
http://www.webspots.net/WCAG_Checklist-understand.htm.  There is also an
abridged rating sheet that may help.  I came very close to adding a pvot
table but came up short on time.

Some semblance of this could be helpful to others, but you can decide.
Could use a leisurely proof, i got tired of cutting and pasting and found
some fields truncated and had to go back.

Need to add the caveat, "This is not endorsed by the W3C and is something i
am tweaking"


enjoy, rob
