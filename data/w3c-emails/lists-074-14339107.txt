ACCESSIBILITY ON THE NET IN PORTUGUESE SPEAKING COUNTRIES
By Francisco Godinho, Portugal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) the agency responsible for the world 
standards related to the Web, published on May 5th its first document that 
will serve as a reference for the Accessibility on the Internet. (Ref 1)

The document's title is "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0" (Ref 2) 
and it is designed to be a tool for website creators/designers so they know 
how to make or turn web pages fully accessible, as well as for people with 
disabilities who have difficulties in getting access to the information 
available on the Internet.

This means that cyberspace (in which the Web makes up part of the structure) 
has the potential to become a privileged place to access knowledge, 
employment, interaction and leisure for those who, because of their 
disabilities, normally have to face innumerous architectural, information and 
communication barriers, which make it impossible for them to experience life 
as others do.  

However, the creation of physical or electronic barrier-free environments 
depends very much on the economic and social development of each country.  In 
this context, the USA, Canada and Australia emerge as the main countries that 
promote accessibility on the Internet. (Ref 3)

However, several initiatives are emerging worldwide that aim to facilitate 
Internet access for people with disabilities.  One example is Bradesco, one 
of the largest Banks of Brazil that has developed Bradesco Net-Internet 
Banking for their visually impaired customers (Ref 4), with the goal of 
simplifying every day life for their customers.

Also, in February of 1999, the PASIG (Portuguese Accessibility Special 
Interest Group) submitted to the Portuguese Parliament, a petition for 
Internet accessibility. (Ref 5)  This petition, organized through Internet 
and signed by 9000 people, intends to impose accessibility rules to the 
information made available on the Internet by government and public services, 
with the purpose of facilitating its access to people with special needs, 
specially people with disabilities and the elderly.

Their application should allow:

1-Interaction with computer systems without requiring vision, pointing 
devices, precise movements or simultaneous actions;
2-The ability to understand information and navigate the web through 
auditory or visual means.

On last June 30, the Portuguese Parliament, through its Commission for 
Constitutional Affairs, Rights, Freedoms and Guarantees, fully supported the 
petition approving by unanimity a recommendation to the Government to 
consider the suggestions included in the petition, and also to adopts, in the 
shortest period of time, the necessary and adequate measures to ensure full 
accessibility to information for all citizens.

In the report (Ref. 6), the Commission considered that "In a way, the 
proposals 
formulated in the petition are tributaries of the same principles of the  
existing legislation regarding the elimination of physical barriers to people 
with disabilities, specifically the Law 123/97, recently approved by the 
Government, which endorses the adoption of a set of technical rules to 
eliminate the architectonic barriers in public buildings, equipment and ways, 
in order to provide better accessibility for people conditioned mobility. In 
fact, the digital barriers which we are discussing are only  another 
dimension of the same accessibility problem faced by people with special need 
to access public services and so, it deserves consideration."

The Petition was the first official initiative of the PASIG - Portuguese 
Accessibility Special Interest Group which also joins other efforts that have 
been conducted in order to face the accessibility issue, as the "Web  
Accessibility Initiative" promoted by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at  
the international level, or even the "National Initiative for the Citizens 
with Special Needs in the Information Society" (Ref. 7) promoted by the 
Portuguese Government through the Mission for the Information Society.

Now is time for the Government to take the proposed measures, so that 
Portugal becomes the fourth country in the world officially declaring the 
elimination of digital barriers on the Internet, after the United States,  
Australia and Canada.

These initiatives are a response to the needs of a great number of citizens 
that are still marginalized socially, culturally and professionally, and will 
represent a model to be followed by other countries.
