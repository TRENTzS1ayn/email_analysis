ACCESSIBILITY VIDEO
The Royal National Institute for the Blind is due to launch a video 
next week on how to produce accessible web sites and why they 
are important for blind and visually impaired Internet users.

The RNIB will also present three organisations with awards for 
accessible sites, including Hampshire County Council. The video, 
which is free, can be ordered from Julie Howell,
