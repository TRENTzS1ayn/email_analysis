Hi,

I just re-posted the information regarding the ACCESSIBILITY
VIDEO produced by
The Royal National Institute for the Blind from another
newsletter I
receive. I should have posted the source information. I can
only suggest you try calling Julie Howell at the phone
number in England, listed at the end of the announcement -
repeated below.

I apologize for any confusion.

Greg Rice
