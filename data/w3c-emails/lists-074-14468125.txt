At the recent Web99 conference in San Francisco in one of the design 
workshops the speaker said that ASP is considered inaccessible by WAI. I 
can't image why ASP specifically would be considered inaccessible and I 
can't find anything addressing the issue on the w3.org site.

Can anyone comment on this.

Thanks,
