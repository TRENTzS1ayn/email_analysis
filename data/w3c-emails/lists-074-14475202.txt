Whoever said this was wrong.  ASP is a server-level technology that
produces web pages (HTML).  There is nothing about that which would
prevent the proper creation of accessible HTML.

This statement was really like saying "Perl is inaccessible" -- Perl,
when used for web applications, simply creates HTML as well.

Any technology that produces HTML is accessibility-neutral for the
most part; you have to look at the HTML output and judge from that.
