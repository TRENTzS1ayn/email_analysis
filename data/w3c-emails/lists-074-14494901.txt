I do not doubt the CSS's usability.  I question why I am being forced to use
CSS to obtain a Double A conformance level.  I can make a web page that is
accessible using HTML 3.2 and 4.  Before the recommendation, I had done that
at Department of Labor before CSS was widely used, see
http://www.dol.gov/dol/esa/public/programs/dbra/index.html.  I had designed
a layout without tables for formatting and in HTML 4 Transitional.  This was
the closest thing to adopting over 90% of the checkpoints.  BUT I used HTML
not  CSS.  If I were still there, I would be livid about Checkpoint 3.3.
Now all of a sudden I have to switch because another language is wanted.
CSS has design guidelines and so does HTML and both must be properly
applied.

I cannot support a recommendation that disallows other methodologies that
can be made accessible.

By the way, how does Checkpoint 3.3 apply when I want to make a HTML page
that is text only and use HTML 3.2 with no deprecated items and follow the
rest of the guidelines except Checkpoint 3.3? For example, except for
Checkpoint 3.3, I am Triple A.  This is like telling me I MUST purchase a
new car when an used one will do!

This is a note to Jamie (Are you monitoring?): Now that you are running the
Davis-Bacon site, if it wasn't for checkpoint 3.3, how close are you to
Triple A conformance?

Basically, my position is the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
should change Checkpoint 3.3 to say, "Use CSS where possible."  If you have
not read the WCAG yet, then wake-up and realize that you will be required to
use CSS to obtain a Double A conformance rating.  If you are associated with
the United States Government then expect the Federal Government to adopt the
WCAG next year.  Does anyone have any comments on this?  Your opinions do
matter.

Are there any other government efforts or other efforts to adopt Double A?
