The problem as I see it is that they are not being adopted
as "guides" but rather as "requirements"; the helpful
checkpoints that can be figured out by anyone with just a 
smidgen of common sense can be easily twisted into firm,
hard checkpoints that MUST be satisfied in order to achieve
a "Double-AA compliance" rating.

This is a big problem -- the Single-A, Double-AA, Triple-AAA
system does not have a caveat saying "you can still achieve
Double-AA rating if you do almost everything and use common
sense in what you do and don't choose to do."
