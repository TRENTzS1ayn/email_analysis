The guidelines were never intended to be requirements.  we are not
charged with writing requirements but we are charged with making sure
that those who write requirements make them sensable.  if someone
writes a requirement that is not sensable, we just simply proclaim its
inaccuracy or insensability to the world to the chagrin and
embarassment of the requiring entity.  thus far, no requirement has
been insensably written except for a handful and they erred on the
side of accessibility and have since for all but one or two been
fixed.
eo then is charged with making it quite clear that the guidelines can
not be taken as requirememts but must be used in the development of
requirements.

I would be quite happy to use the guidelines to prepair a set of
requirements for a fee.
