From a few recent communications it seems that Publisher is'nt a 
great package to use to create accessible web pages;
Can anyone suggest a good one?
I currently have access to Dreamweaver 2; Front Page 97; Word 2000; 
and Net Object Fusion 2
I have more or less decided that the best would seem to be 
Dreamweaver; and then to tweak the HTML.
I can use style sheets; BUT many of the users at the site where I am 
creating the pages for are using Netscape 3.2 on Windows 3.11

Thanks for the help.
