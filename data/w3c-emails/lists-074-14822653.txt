One of the larger sites that I have developed and maintain is getting ready 
to move to a new web server host. We have been using a free search engine 
called Swish up to this point. Even though it is free, it still needs to be 
installed and set up when we move, which is a cost.

While at the Web99 conference I learned of a new search software product 
called Searchbutton.
<http://www.searchbutton.com/>

I have read through all the data and it looks fantastic. If you are willing 
to accept flashing banner ads at the top of each search result page the 
service is free. Otherwise the fees are quite reasonable. The service is 
remote so there is no software to install, or scripting to deal with, which 
I find appealing. The user can customize the results page so it would 
appear there is no accessibility issue.

It is a new product and I am wondering if anyone has any experience with it 
and has any comments, specifically to accessibility.

Thanks,
-Nancy
