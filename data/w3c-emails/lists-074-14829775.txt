It really depends on who the page is supposed to be accessible to. If your
audience is cognitively-disabled folks, children, or the if point of the
web site is to share graphics, then Publisher 98 does a very good job of
letting you manipulate the graphics to efficiently create an effective
design. Yes, to make it more universally accessible you need to make some
additions to the html after Publisher puts the page/s into html. But with
tweaking the html, Publisher will design and do most of the work of
creating a good web page that passes Bobby.

As an example, last Christmas when I needed to put 72 edited photos up on
the web quickly and attractively (a small sample up led to EVERYONE at the
party wanting to see THEIR picture on the web!), Publisher was the tool
that got the job done. Neither Front Page nor Word could have handled the
graphics as efficiently. The text on the page was inconsequential.

I suspect a person's preferred working style has as much to do with the
selection of an authoring tool as anything.
