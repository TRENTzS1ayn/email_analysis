This is my position too; I think the guidelines are great as guidelines
but the conformance section, and the implication that you should use
ALL "shoulds" (P2) if you use ANY, is the part that is broken.

I am okay with leaving the priorities where they are; I just think
that the compliance section, which I admit I didn't pay attention
to until it was too late, is the real problem here.  It encourages
entirely the wrong approach to the Guidelines and mandates things
that were never meant to be mandated.
