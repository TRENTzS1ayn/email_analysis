The way the conformance levels are structured, Single-A, Double-AA,
Triple-AAA, people are encouraged to implement either ALL of one
priority level or NONE of that priority level.

In other words, by having a system that completely maps conformance
levels to priority levels, you risk someone saying, "Well, since I
can never get Double-AA compliance due to 14.5, I might as well
not do 16.7, 19.3, and 14.7 since they're also P2.  And I don't
think I'll even look at 18.3-5, 19.4, and 20.8 since they're P3!"

By boiling compliance with _guidelines_ graded "must", "should",
and "may" down to a three-option choice, you going to find a lot
of people will only look at Single-A and not go on to do any of the
Double-AA.

Why should they?  They get no benefits from it, at least, none that
are reflected by their compliance rating.

I agree with whoever said that the WCAG should be used by third
parties to _create their own policies_ and not simply adopted as
a strict set of standards, because that's not the spirit in which
the priority 2 and especially 3 checkpoints were written.  I don't
they they were intended as an all-or-nothing deal.
