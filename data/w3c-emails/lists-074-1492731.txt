Internet Hosting Services are another big commodity and I do not know how
accessible they are making their sites and ways to upload information and to
interact with the server.  Most have a control panel where you can interface
with the server. I thought the topic to be interesting as a way to see how
to select a good ISP for you.  I do not believe these sites are built for
accessibility.

Here is what I sent to another list.

In the recent past there has been some discussion or requests for
information on web hosting.  I found this URL to be great benefit,
http://www.webhostlist.com/
To read more,
 http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9810/28/webguild.idg/

I have found no host that meets all my needs -  just like the cell phone
companies.  This one has this and another has that!  I did find the Yellow
Pages to be interesting and there is a ranking system as based upon values.

Since the webhostlist is new, notables were not seen, such as NetNation,
PSInet, and UUNet.  Of the last two, they are not priced for small
businesses anyway.

I found HiWay to be an interesting choice as they provide a free copy of
Webtrends, excite search engine.  Plus they have a great online site that
shows their control feature and what is available.   This is not the only
discriminator, which depends on what your criteria is, for example, how do
they handle raw web files.

I was looking at Disk space, transfer, price and parking.  I did not see
anyone beating Worldwide Internet on these factors.

It's late and will do more research this week!  Does anyone have comments?
