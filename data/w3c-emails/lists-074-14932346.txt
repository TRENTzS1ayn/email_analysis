Yet the whole contention and debate about Checkpoint 3.3 is that it is NOT a
situation where accessibility is being compromised for the sake of older
browsers.  Instead, the scenarios presented are accessible pages that older
browsers can read as well, yet the Guidelines condemn as non-compliant.

I am nervous about checkpoint 3.3 and a couple of other points, because the
wording seems to mandate the use of certain methods instead of outcome.
What makes me even more nervous, is when folks counter with 'well, you have
to apply common sense to them [the Guidelines].'

Forgive me for being bold, but I find common sense lacking in many instances
especially in the government workplace.  I think what is being argued for,
is guidelines that give the IT professional the ability to make their web
site accessible  yet save them from unnecessary, arbitrary protocols.

The process which exists for requesting changes in the guidelines is to
write
