I'm trying to identify a person (or person) or office within the U.S.
Department of Energy (DOE) who would be concerned with WAI/ADA issues. 

We are having a meeting of Web administrators from U.S. National Labs at
SLAC in November and would like to invite them to participate. 

Thanks in advance for any leads or help.
