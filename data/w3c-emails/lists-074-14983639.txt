How does every one feel, if we were to make a separate checkpoint section
for all CSS relaed items?  We could even put check point 11.1 as the lead
checkpoint for this CSS.  That way, "Use W3C technologies when they are
available and appropriate for a task and use the latest versions when
supported" is up front and if someone chooses not to use CSS then this whole
section becomes "Not applicable". 

Thanks to Judy for pointing out Checkpoint 11.1 <smile>.

my difficulty now is if i am rating a site's conformance or if some one is
rating this for me, then we really have to dig and causes extra work.  We
need to streamline the review process as I am sure other people besides me
would appreciate this!

I think we can look at this from a usability focus.  Basically CSS is all
over and rightly so, but does it make sense to centralize this?
