I am closing the discussion of Checkpoint 3.3 on the WAI Interest Group
list. It will continue on the Web Content Guidelines Working Group list,
which is the appropriate place for this discussion at this point. Archives
of that mailing list and subscription information for that list are
available from the working group home page at http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL.

The Web Content Guidelines Working Group will report back to the Interest
Group once this is resolved.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Regards,

Judy
