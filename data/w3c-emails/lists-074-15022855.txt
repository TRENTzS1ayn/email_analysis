I have no idea if that will be a consistent URL, but today at
least it's on the front page of http://www.builder.com/ and 
is dated July 20, 1999, by Amy Cowen.  It references the WCAG
and gives specific examples regarding implementation in HTML.

As usual for CNet, however, it's very much "do as I say, not
as I do", to the point of having missing or blank ALT text...
sigh.  Well, at least people will get the message if they
read the article, even if it's dilluted by the mixed message
of CNet telling us (through example) that accessibility is
obviously NOT important...
