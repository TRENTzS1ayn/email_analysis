In general it is a good idea to provide metadata for all pages, as much as
possible. In practice it depends on the type of information you want to use -
there are a number of different ways of doing it.

One example is the meta elements common search engines use - 'description'
and 'keywords'. I believe these are searched on a page by page basis, and
they are commonly used to promote a page in a search engine (although they
can also play an important role in summarising briefly the purpose or content
of a page).

Another common example is PICS ratings. These are used most widely to give
content a rating for sex, violence, and other content that might not be
deemed appropriate in certain cultures, places, or situations, but it is a
general mechanism for describing features of a web page, and is also used for
labelling pages which have, for example, content appropraite for schooling,
or which is accessible.

This kind of labelling can often be done for a number of pages on a website
with a single label, which is very handy.

  Hi to all!  I wouldlike to ask a question and I do hope it isn't a silly one:
  
  Should one use Meta Tags on all the pages on a site or just the index one?
  
  Thanx!
