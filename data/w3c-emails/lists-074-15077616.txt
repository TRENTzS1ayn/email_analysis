The major browsers, Navigator, Explorer, Opera, allow you to tab through
links.  This is crucial for people who have difficulty with a mouse.

You can see where you are clearly with Opera but it's hard to see for
Navigator and Explorer, even for people with average vision.  So a person
who doesn't have access to Opera, e.g. at a public library, is out of luck.

Is there a way to make the highlight easier to see?

Putting windows in high contrast mode helps sometimes, but not always.  For
example, at least in black on white mode, it doesn't work with the blue
bordered buttons at

Also, this mode loses colors and magifies the text.

Lynx is also superb in this respect... but not usable of course with the
many pages that faill to follow accessibility guidelines.
