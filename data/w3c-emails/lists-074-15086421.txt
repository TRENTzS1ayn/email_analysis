Len,

there is another browser, braillesurf, fromm the braillenet project in
France, which provides very good highlighting not just of links but also of a
cursor used for reading of the whole document.

And are you aware that it is very easy (at least in Unix versions - I have
not tried it in Windows/Mac versions) to add audio players, image/movie
viewers, etc to Lynx? It actually inorporates a number of strategies which
are very helpful in dealing with poorly-designed web content.

Although neither of those things may answer your original question.

  The major browsers, Navigator, Explorer, Opera, allow you to tab through

  You can see where you are clearly with Opera but it's hard to see for
  Navigator and Explorer, even for people with average vision.  So a person
  who doesn't have access to Opera, e.g. at a public library, is out of luck.
  
  Is there a way to make the highlight easier to see?
  
  Putting windows in high contrast mode helps sometimes, but not always.  For
  example, at least in black on white mode, it doesn't work with the blue
  bordered buttons at
  
  http://www.research.temple.edu/
  
  Also, this mode loses colors and magifies the text.
  
  Lynx is also superb in this respect... but not usable of course with the
  many pages that faill to follow accessibility guidelines.
