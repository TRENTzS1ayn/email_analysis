Steve,

Do you have some time on your hands now for that focus enhancer you
mentioned?(smile)?

We're running a web training program, this week and next, for people with
severe motor disabilities who can't use a mouse.  Even as I write this
email, they're struggling with tabbing through web pages and seeing where
they're at.   It would be great to fix it up for them.
