I use Cox cable's @home cable modem Internet service. I update my
homepage/web site using their FTP connection.

Open the FTP Internet site with my browser

Open Explorer from START; select the files I want to copy, right mouse
click, and drag them to the FTP window.

My file uploads to my server site. Very easy and accessible. It is a
feature provided by my service provider at no extra cost.
