Priority 2.1 states "Ensure that all information conveyed with color is also
available without color, for example from context or markup."

If I use a stylesheet to set "text-decoration: none" for links, does this
violate Priority 2.1?

At first glance, it would seem that the links are now distinguished only by
text color; however, virtually every browser I know of has some way to
identify links when they are in focus or mouseovered. By this I conclude
that links are conveyed by markup and the text-color is an additional clue,
not necessarily the primary clue. Therefore, I conclude that it would be
okay on a link to do so, though not, perhaps, on other text.


Priority 2.2 deals with having sufficient contrast between foreground and
background.

If a low-contrast combination is achieved via stylesheet (and therefore
overrideable), would it still violate Priority 2.2?

My feeling is that effects achieved with stylesheets should be less
restricted so long as the page is understandable with the stylesheet turned
off. Otherwise, Priority 2.2 would seem to rule out many artistic effects.
What is the consensus on this?


Thanks,
