Thanks. I missed the explanation the first time because one must traverse
three links to get to it. I finally found it in the Techniques document
#5.6.1:

If content developers cannot use style sheets and must use invisible or
transparent images (e.g., with IMG) to lay out images on the page, they
should specify alt="" for them.

I understand that this use is deprecated, but considering how many
developers use this technique, it's too bad it's not more clearly noted.
