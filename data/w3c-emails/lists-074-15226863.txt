Costs are two fold, qualitative and quantitative.

1.  Quantitative - Cost to train the web developers. There will be a short
term cost increase realized, that is the bell curve will be i the front.
2.  Qualitative - Cost to deny PWD access to information.  PWD can  function
in society if they are provided the means that we certainly are capable of
providing.  Compare it to automobile safety requirements.
3.  Qualitative and Quantitative - Cost to have PWDs as an unproductive
members of society relying on government assistance, instead of being
productive members of society and contributing to taxes.

They will either see a net loss or net gain!
