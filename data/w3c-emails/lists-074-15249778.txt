Hello Marti,

The Portuguese law about web accessibility is based on the text of the
Petition for the Accessibility of the Portuguese Internet and could be
more or less like this (I don't know the legislation text):

It is mandatory that all administration websites ensure accessibility for
citizens with special needs namely people with disabilities and elderly.

This accessibility should allow
a) the interaction with the information system without requiring vision,
pointing devices, precise movements or simultaneous actions;
b) the understanding of information and navigation by audio, tactile and
visual means.

An international Web Accessibility Symbol should be affixed in the homepage.

There will be a grace period for full implementation perhaps as much as two
years. All new sites or sites being redeveloped will be required to comply
immediately.

[End of the legislation]

Last month the Portuguese Parliament related this issue with the physical
access law:
http://www.acessibilidade.net/petition/parliament_report.html

"In a way, the proposals formulated in this petition are followed of the
same principles that are in the base of the existing legislation regarding
the elimination of physical barriers to the people with disabilities,
specifically the law n. 123/97, of 22nd May, recently approved by the
Government, which endorses the adoption of a set of technical rules to
eliminate the architectonic barriers in public buildings, collective
equipment and ways to provide better accessibility to people with
conditioned mobility. In fact, the digital barriers which we are discussing
are only another dimension of the same accessibility problem to the public
services of people with special needs, and so it deserves an adequate
consideration."

But here they are talking about principles not  how hard/easy is to
implement this.

Two months ago I sent an email to the Minister of  Science and Technology
asking him to search the information at Ministry Science and Technology
website without images. Well, the first page was full of images without any
alternative text. In the same day he ask to the webmaster to fix this. This
was an happy and easy task and now I think that he believe that web
accessibility is not rocket science. But he is a special Minister.
I can't wait similar behavior of other Government members.

Regards and thank you for your help

Francisco,
I don't know much about accessibility law in Portugal but it is often
helpful if you relate things like this to physical access law which people
seem to understand better.  Curb-cuts are a great example! They do cost more
to install and a retrofit is even worse but the benefits have turned out to
be great, far beyond the wheelchair access it was meant for.  I don't think
we really know how far reaching accessible web design will be but I think we
can safely predict that it will be useful for other emerging technologies
such as telephone web access.
Another good point is that "retrofit" is always more expensive so the sooner
new web design meets the criteria the less retrofit, i.e. less expense.
Marti
