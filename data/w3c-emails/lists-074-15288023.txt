Hello Leornard,

I would like to stress  your suggestion.

As I said in my last email:

"Two months ago I sent an email to the Minister of  Science and Technology
asking him to search the information at Ministry Science and Technology
web site without images. Well, the first page was full of images without any
alternative text. In the same day he ask to the webmaster to fix this. This
was an happy and easy task and now I think that he believe that web
accessibility is not rocket science. "

I had luck with the key Legislator
- the Ministry of Science and Technology

Their web site (http://www.mct.pt) was easy to fix!

Regards
Francisco Godinho
