I just tried this page [http://www.pratt.lib.md.us/databases/] with IE5, and
it does handle this case as you would hope. I tabbed until I got to the ToC
"Health and Medicine" link, hit enter (which scroled me down the page to
that section) and then hit tab again - and landed on the first link in the
Health and Medicine Section.

Cool.
