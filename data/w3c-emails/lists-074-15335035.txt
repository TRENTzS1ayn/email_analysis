aloha!

it is also extremely easy to add support for multimedia players/viewers to the
Windows 9x/NT version of Lynx....

For detailed information, consult:
        <http://www.fdisk.com/doslynx/lynxport.htm>

Note that a blind/VI tailored distribution, Blynx32--which is distributed in a
recursively zipped archive, contains all of the necessary files and
instructions--is available at:
