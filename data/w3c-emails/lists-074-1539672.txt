Posted 11/20
Quote of the Week: I call it a monopoly
"Why should anyone have to write for the
tech-disadvantaged ones out there? What if I decide to
write a site that is spectacular with one or more features
that won't work on certain browsers or platforms? Why
should I have to take my valuable time to write something
boring for those that won't go with the flow?"
Why indeed.
