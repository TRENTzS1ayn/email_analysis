So we have the same problem of old browsers not being able to read it.
Folks, considering that my department is full of old PC486 machines, I can't
just pretend this is not an issue.

If you choose to use both at the same time, you create an additional
usability risk.
Assume for a moment that your choice in font size and face presents a
readability issue. For example, lets say it's Times Roman and it's set to
-3.
It is hardly reasonable to expect an average reader to use the browser
agent's font size/face changing ability to fix your screwup.
I would suggest that expecting an average reader to change the fonts and
then turn off a style would be sadistical. That would be way beyond the
ability or desire of the average surfer.

Are you asking that the author use both strategies (attributes and
style
sheet).  Otherwise, don't we return to the problem that older
browsers can't
handle CSS.

This thread is moved to the guidelines list, where itis under
discussion.

owever I don't think you have to give up those attributes, you just
have to
use a style sheet as well.

   Unfortunately, by my reading, 3.3 is stricter than this.  To
follow this
  checkpoint I would also have to give up all occurrences of
  ALIGN=CENTER/RIGHT attributes.  That is too much of a sacrifice
for me!
