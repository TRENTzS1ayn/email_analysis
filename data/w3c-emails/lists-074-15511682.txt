David,

Re your remark that ACCESSKEY would achieve purpose of jumping to link via
search

(an aspect of the web page rather than the browser)

Yes that would sure be handy, especially if there were standard names for
common links, and buttons, e.g. 

home, 
sitemap, 
search, 
webmaster, 
first form element, 
first link in main menu, 
first link to secondary (page specific) menu,
first tab in "folder tab" collection,
help,
news
help
advertising banner

Too bad the access key is only a single character.

Of course, we'd still need the search for the many pages that don't or
wouldn't have access keys.


Re your suggestion of standardized names for form element, to facilitate
form fillin,

Yes, good feature... I'd just suggest one technical change... using the id
attribute instead of the name attribute. It would simplify retrofitting
forms with fields that have already been named.
