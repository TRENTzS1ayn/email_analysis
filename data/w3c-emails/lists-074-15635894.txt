Gregory,

What do the brower sniffer segregators typically do if they encounter a
browser they don't recognize, e.g. 

Supreme-Ultimate/#.#.# libwww--XX/#.#

If the sniffer defaults to thinking "This must be a whiz bang state of the
art browser I'll send it everything I've got" then the lynx users would
avoid the text-reservation, without violating copyright.

("Supreme Ultimate" is the English translation of "T'ai Chi", which was
created during the Sung Dynasty, before copyright protection was available)
