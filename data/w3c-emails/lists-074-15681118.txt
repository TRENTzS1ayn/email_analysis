The one negative filter of which I'm aware is at
<URL:http://www.movielink.com/>.  If the string "Lynx" appears
anywhere in the user agent field, the Web server will serve out null
content.  The interface of the site has gotten better, and is now
quite accessible (at least, it seemed it, today), but I have to alter
the user agent field to "Netscape/3.0 (compatible; L_y_n_x 2.8rel.2
libwww-FM/2.14)" to get in.  Frustrating, to put it mildly.

This is pretty common.  Once upon a time, there were only Mozilla,
Lynx, and Mosaic.  When browser sniffing started, it was pretty much
just Mozilla and Lynx.  When IE came out, it had to declare as Mozilla
to avoid crappy versions of Web sites, which started a whole trademark
problem.  Now, things seem to have evened out a bit, except for that
one movielink.com site.  I suppose that they're afraid Lynx users
won't see their ads, and are too lazy to put any effort into putting
something informative in alt text.
