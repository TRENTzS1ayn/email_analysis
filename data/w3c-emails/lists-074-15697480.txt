Although I have not yet succumbed to browser sniffing I do have access to my
server log files and thought you might like a sample of what is recorded.
here are a few of last nights entries:
 "Mozilla/2.0 (compatible; MSIE 3.01; Windows 95)"
"Mozilla/2.0 (compatible; MSIE 3.01; Windows 95)"
"Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.0; Windows 98; DigExt)"
"Mozilla/4.05 [en]C-AtHome0404  (Win95; U)"
"Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.0; Windows 98; DigExt)"
"Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 4.01; MSN 2.5; Windows 95)"

If anyone wants to run some tests to see what is recorded from different
browsers you can contact me privately at
