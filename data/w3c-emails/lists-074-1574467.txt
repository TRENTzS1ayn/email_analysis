It is an analytical religion that dates back to the revolution of
Gutenberg, Newton and Leibnitz.  The computer may have upset the
apple-cart on this one -- I maybe don't want to know.  The
teachers are firmly into the paradigm that problem-solving is
based on atomization, on analysis.  The three R's are all calculi
of little code tokens.  Can you blame the teachers if there is a
lot of inertia there?

Just ask the teachers: How many people drive cars?  How many
people build cars?  Put the history they are living in the
context of the living that they recognize as history.
