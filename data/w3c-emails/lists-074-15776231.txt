Rafael,

A few clarifications here. MIT and W3C are not the same thing, as implied
in your message. MIT is a university, and is one of the three international
host sites for W3C, the World Wide Web Consortium.

With regard to W3C's site, W3C has been working through the different
sections of its site to bring the site into conformance with the Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0. First priorities include top level
pages for each W3C activity, and specifications published on the /TR
(Technical Reports) page, and technical submissions from W3C Member
organizations. Plenty of work to be done, but W3C is committed to doing this. 

With regard to MIT's various sites, some parts of MIT have already made
commitments to make their sites accessible. The MIT Laboratory for Computer
Science <http://www.lcs.mit.edu/>, which is the specific MIT host site for
North America, did an accessibility review of their site in March when they
were re-doing their Web site. This was before the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines were finalized, and we will be talking with MIT/LCS about an
updated review. We expect support for Double-AA conformance from MIT/LCS.
As for the Intelligent Engineering Systems Laboratory where Professor
Williams is based, we have not discussed their site with them, but will.

Also I should clarify that there is currently no W3C group working in
standardisation of Online Learning Materials as implied in your message,
although WAI participants and staff have been tracking and commenting on a
number of discussions in the on-line education community with regard to
accessibility and we feel that this is an important area in which people
can work together to ensure the application of all three WAI guidelines.
There are currently hundreds of on-line learning toolkits available or
under development, and almost all of these efforts have not been addressing
accessibility. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines should be a good
immediate resource for these groups; and likewise the User Agent
Accessibility Guidelines and Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines should
be useful once completed. I encourage you to consider the requirements of
on-line learning environments when you respond with comments to calls for
review on working drafts of those guidelines.

Regards,

Judy

there was a very similar situation. TB 7 is used to develop multimedia
educational software, that now is also directly exported to html and java
formats. I asked publicly to Mr Claude Ostyn, the general director of
Asymetrix, if they were considering accesibility issues in the html code
generated by their application.
