Did anyone catch the CNN.com chat yesterday?  This was the
topic, apparently:

  Computing: Guido Corona of IBM discusses 
             technology that helps sight-impaired
             people use the Internet, 8 p.m. ET

Unfortunately I didn't notice this until well after 8, so
I couldn't make it.  CNN appears to have transcripts from
previous chats on their site, so it's possible that this
will be showing up there sooner or later.
