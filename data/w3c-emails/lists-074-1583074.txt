Options like including a text description of a graphic appeals to a lot of 
people who are NOT disabled, but don't want to wait a minute or two for
a page to download.

The solution is having html authoring applications like Adobe PageMill
having the features being discussed built into the program. I still have
problems with convincing teachers that it is NOT necessary to learn how to
manually write html files for most people who are concerned with producing product
rather than the process itself.

Unfortunately, given the state of authoring tools today, authors/producers who are concerned with the accessibility of their efforts must also be concerned with the code - HTML, CSS, and so on - which underlies their "product". My experience with every visual/graphical/pseudo-WYSIWYG authoring tool I've tried to date (I have no experience with Adobe PageMill) is that none support the full range of accessibility (uh, "universal design" [g]) features available. Most, for example, will happily, plug in a useless default ALT text for an image without prompting the author that they must supply meaningful text.
