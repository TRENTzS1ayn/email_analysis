Members of the list may be interested to learn about the August 7, 1999
report on the virtual debate "Boosting the UK Digital Economy-a virtual
think-tank" published by Bull Information Systems.  This report summarizes
the discussion that took place over a three day period in June 1999
involving "a group of around 80 top-level experts from all sectors of the UK
economy." It also presents a series of 44 recommendations for action by
government, business and others to promote the development of a "fair, open
and competitive digital economy in the UK." (See Report Introduction).

As an invited participant, I provided input on the issue of overcoming
barriers to participation by people with disabilities.  As many of you know,
this was the subject of my paper commissioned for the first national
conference on the impact of the digital economy in the US convened by
President Clinton.  (See http://www.aasa.dshs.wa.gov/access/waddell.htm )

Of the 44 recommendations for action, three recommendations (31, 32 and 33)
were issued specifically addressing people with disabilities:

31:  The government must lead by example by requiring that all public
service web sites, kiosks and other electronic services are fully accessible
to people with disabilities.  The requirement should also be built into all
procurement exercises where public services are contracted out or private
services bought into the public sector.

32:  The technology industry- and in particular the digital TV and mobile
phone industries - must design all products according to the principles of
Design for All - optimising access by all by allowing the greatest possible
degree of customisation.  Physical controls should be simple and
easy-to-use.

33:  All web site developers should familiarise themselves with the
principles of accessible web site design and where possible ensure their
sites have options to be rendered in multiple ways including versions
without many different colours or images.

I understand that this report will be published online within two weeks at
http://www.iib.com and that an archive of the virtual debate is located at
