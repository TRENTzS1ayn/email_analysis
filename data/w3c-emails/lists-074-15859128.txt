Hello Jonathan

Maybe you would like to know about this project:

ALDICT - Access of Persons with Learning Disabilities to Information and
Communication Technologies
http://www2.echo.lu/telematics/disabl/aldict.html

The primary service of the Intergoal of ALDICT is to develop a computer
programme which enables persons with learning disabilities to communicate
via the electronic mail net. A specially adapted e-mail programme will allow
the user to "write" and read messages with one of three different symbol
systems which greatly enhance the communicative abilities of persons with
learning disability. On a central WWW server a translation module for the
languages German, French, English and Portuguese will be installed, thus
providing for international communication between persons with learning
disability and their self-advocacy groups.

You can find more information at
