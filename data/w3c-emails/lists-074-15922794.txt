Charles...

The User Agent accessibility guidelines working group of the W3C is looking
for some information on usage scenarios to refine requirements for
orientation capabilities in User Agents. If anybody is prepared to give real
life examples of features they use commonly, or features they really wish
were in a browser, to provide orientation within and between pages, please
send a short explanation to w3c-wai-ua@w3.org, or to me.

Sorry if this is way off topic.
