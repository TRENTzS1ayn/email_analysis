Unfortunately due to the ways of the world Chris devoted the whole of his
article today to discussing why the www is increasing the wealth gap between
the rich and the poor.

Part of his argument reproduced below is to do with being illiterate.
How much better if he had considered the opportunities the www offered to
vanquish illiteracy, an opportunity lost.

"Indeed, literacy is beyond the means of most of the world's poor, so even
if Bill Gates were to use his entire fortune to equip every world household
with, say, a new PC, it wouldn't do much good.
Billions of people wouldn't be able to read the hyperlinks on the Web pages,
or their e-mail; much less flame the newbies in the chat rooms"
