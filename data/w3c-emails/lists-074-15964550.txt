A member of the HTML Writers Guild discussion group has posted a
wonderful browser resource on the web.  This page contains a list of
all
web browsers... and is very complete and thorough.  Some of the
browsers
listed I have never heard of...

If your mail reader wraps the above URL, please note that you can cut

Enjoy!
