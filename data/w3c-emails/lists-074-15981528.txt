Oops! One last disclaimer - the site will not pass validation, because of the inclusion of RDF information in each HTML file. To quote from the RDF Model and Syntax Specification:

  "The recommended technique for embedding RDF expressions in an HTML document is simply to insert the RDF in-line as shown in Example 7.7. This will make the resulting document non-conformant to HTML specifications up to and including HTML 4.0 but the W3C expects that the HTML specification will evolve to support this."
