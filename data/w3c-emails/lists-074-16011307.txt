I am impressed, whishing the form would wrap and hoping that you use
lite html markup on the manual rather than streight text as I saw in
one of the sections if only to allow one to go through the table of
contents jumping from section and to return to the previous page or
top of the page or document?
Thanks

I think this brings it up to Level AA compliance, but I'd rather not rely entirely on my own judgement (540+ HTML documents - I might have missed something). If anyone has the time, can you please take a look at the site and see if it does meet that standard? On a more practical level, can those people on this list who use adaptive equipment also try it out?

Although there are other federal sites that got there first, this would be - I believe - the first agency-wide site to meet that standard (please correct me if I'm wrong). It would also meet the proposed Section 508 standards one year early. Not an insignificant accomplishment, and a pretty straightforward response to some of the negative press Section 508 received.

Revised versions are complete, but are sitting on someone's desk waiting approval, since the content has also changed. Also, there is basically NO use of graphics or multimedia to assist people with reading comprehension issues - I'm aware of the problem. We will be developing a great deal of new information for the site over the coming months, and that is one area that we will be seriously working on.
