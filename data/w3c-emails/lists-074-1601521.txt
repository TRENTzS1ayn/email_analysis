_At risk of starting a semantics/"politically correct" debate, I
_don't like the idea of "inclusive design" because the connotations

_people* who have special needs* in order to be included.

_will interpret what's said above.
_
_I don't think you need to _actively_ "reach out and include" people
_as part of universal design; the strength of the term universal
_design (or a similar concept) is that the web pages can be used
_by anyone or anything, not just that they're "including" some

_at least in many parts of the US -- witness Mr. Raspberry's 
_mean-spirited little tirade in the Washington Post.  If it smacks

_reactions against even simple common sense suggestions, let alone
_anything that truly is just.
_
_For these reasons I feel we get farther by emphasizing that the
_benefits of "universal design" grant "inclusion" to whatever people
_may be lacking it, PLUS it makes it easier for non-standard high-
_tech browsers to use the web, PLUS it makes it easier for search
_engines and other intelligent sifters to parse your site, PLUS
_blah blah blah.  Sell it all as a package, and we're much more
_likely to get at least ONE point that speaks to the listener.
_
_In short, people suck, and most don't care about being "inclusive",
