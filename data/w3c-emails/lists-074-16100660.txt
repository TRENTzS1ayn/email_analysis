The guidelines state that

"Movement can also cause such a distraction that the rest of the page
becomes unreadable for people with cognitive disabilities."

(http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#gl-movement)

I've heard this from enough people I trust that I personally believe it.
However, I've just been asked by someone--who I've asked to follow this
guideline--to show him published research that substantiates it.  It's a
fair question I think.

Does anyone know of such research?
