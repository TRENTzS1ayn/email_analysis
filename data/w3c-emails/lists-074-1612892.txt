We have been asked to create a website to be accessible by users with
varying degrees of visual impairment. As we examine different options
there are some questions we have.

Can anyone help us to identify any screen reader software?

Are there any websites that have been created to work with this software
that I can be directed to?

Thanks for any help I can get.
Bernard
