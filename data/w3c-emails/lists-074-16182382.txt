You may be interested to learn about the July, 1999 report on the 
virtual debate "Boosting the UK Digital Economy-a virtual think-tank" 
published by Bull Information Systems.  This report summarizes the 
discussion that took place over a three day period in June 1999 
involving "a group of around 80 top-level experts from all sectors of 
the UK economy." It also presents a series of 44 recommendations for 
action by government, business and others to promote the development 
of a "fair, open and competitive digital economy in the UK." (See 
Report Introduction)
This report is online at http://www.iib.com/reports/iib-vtt.htm

Of the 44 recommendations for UK action, three recommendations (31, 
32 and 33) were issued specifically addressing people with 
disabilities:

31:  The government must lead by example by requiring that all public 
service web sites, kiosks and other electronic services are fully 
accessible to people with disabilities.  The requirement should also 
be built into all procurement exercises where public services are 
contracted out or private services bought into the public sector.

32:  The technology industry- and in particular the digital TV and 
mobile phone industries - must design all products according to the 
principles of Design for All - optimising access by all by allowing 
the greatest possible degree of customisation.  Physical controls 
should be simple and easy-to-use.

33:  All web site developers should familiarise themselves with the 
principles of accessible web site design and where possible ensure 
their sites have options to be rendered in multiple ways including 
versions without many different colours or images.
