This comes from the advanced html list but seems appropriate here as
you will see.

Subject: QUESTION: Size of checkboxes

Dear all,

Does anyone know if it's possible to change the size of checkboxes
(e.g.
<input type="checkbox" name="name" value="value"> )? One of my users
has
difficulties clicking on them (and tabbing between them isn't
appropriate).

Cheers,
Ian
