Theoretically style sheets shouldn't affect screen readers or speech
enabled browsers, and I don't have any reason to think they would.  The
screen reader should simply ignore the style sheet while reading the HTML. 

But you never know what quirks might pop up in software, and I've been
asked if I'm absolutely, positively, definitely sure there will be no
problems.

Has anyone run into any glitches?

If you've read a lot of pages that use style sheets without any problems
please say that also.

Thanks!

Of course, I'm speaking of visual style sheets having no effect, not audio
style sheets.
