Where there is no purpose to the image, having to read the fact that they are
there is a real nusciance - particularly for people who are unable to use
images (people who are blind, etc). If an author has provided correct alt
text then it is not so difficult to assume that when they have nothing as
their explicit text it is because they explicitly meant to say nothing.

If you use alt="" to cover up the fact that you haven't bothered to make
something work without images then you deserve to get flamed.

Putting a long description onto images might also be a good practise to help
people believe that you know what you are doing.

  Just one small point .. using alt="" is something I consider an annoyance!
  It gets the page past automated checks like Bobby but leaves the user
  wondering what they are missing. If you use an alt= please put something in
  between the "", even if it only says alt="space".
