Your opinion is one train of thought and it should be so stated . However,
I've heard this discussion a million times over -- I'm not convinced there's
a conclusive answer to the alt=" " question at this point in web evolution.
Many blind people feel it's important to have a complete understanding of
the interface and environment they are working within. Others do not. To
assume otherwise is a big mistake. What might appear to be a nusciane to
you, may be important to someone else. Particularly to a blind person. What
not conduct a usability test to establish the data?
