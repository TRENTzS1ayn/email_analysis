Thanks to all for the help!  TITLE tag was tried and works well with
NS 4.5
and 4.6.

Looks like you resolved your own problem by switching to use of image
slices rather than an imagemap.  However, to answer your question, ALT
tags
on particular regions of an imagemap are very browser-dependent.  They
work
fine in MSIE 5, but don't work in (some?) versions of Netscape.

In MSIE 5, an ALT attribute on the IMG tag itself becomes the default
tip
for the map.  An ALT attribute on a particular AREA inside the
corresponding MAP is used as the tip for that area.  Just as one would
expect.

The answer may be tied to which browser you are using.  Without going
back
to confirm this, I recall that ALT tag contents in image maps display
with
Netscape, but NOT with MS Explorer.

However, I discovered that if you add an ADDITIONAL attribute
TITLE="intended ALT text" everywhere you have an ALT tag, you will
display
the text on MSIE as well.

See an example on the large imagemap at www.kinlingrover.com home
page.

All the best,

Subject:                QUESTION: image map ALT tags

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I went to <URL:http://www.io.com/~god/warhammer/warhammer.htm  > with
IE5
on Win95 and got all four Alt tags to show up when the mouse hovered.
Your
use of alt="Sallow's Homepage" and the rest is correct.

They did not show on Netscape 3.01 Gold, but do work with Netscape
Communicator 4.6.

What browser are you using?

I checked out your page and found all occurrences of ALT= text
were functioning properly.  I'm using Netscape Communicator 4.61
on a Win95 box.  I'm not really sure why you wouldn't be seeing the
ALT= text in your browser.

I used one of your links to transferring to another one of your pages:
  http://www.io.com/~god/warhammer/gallery/gallery.htm and the
link worked properly.  I did notice on this page that you referred
to some graphics that you apparently intend to put in your empty
table later.

Can you describe the problem you're encountering in a little more
detail.  For example, is it a problem with the "On Mouse Over" display
of the ALT= text or is the problem when the browser doesn't display
the image it also fails to display the text?  Sorry, I've not been
able
to help yet.

Dave,
ALT tags on image maps aren't supported in many browsers but the best
work
around is using ALT and TITLE attributes, ...ALT="foobar"
TITLE="foobar">
to cover as many browsers as possible. You can use JavaScript to give
ToolTips as well, you could try www.javascripts.com or
www.dynamicdrive.com
to find some that might be useful if you were that way inclined.
Cheers.
