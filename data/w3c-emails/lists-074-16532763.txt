Steven,

re your question about intros to XML and RDF:

The w3c home for XML is http://www.w3.org/XML/

There's an faq at http://www.ucc.ie/xml/

The w3c home for RDF is at http://www.w3.org/RDF/

The spec is at http://www.w3.org/RDF/

The spec includes a tutorial within it.  Folks using text-based browsing
should be sure to click on the D links following the diagrams for textual
descriptions.

Does anyone else have further suggestions for intros?

Len
