>      Microsoft to Award $250,000 in Grants to Non-Profit and
>       Educational Institutions Researching PC Accessibility
> 
> REDMOND, Wash., Dec. 3, 1998  - Whether they write code or use a
> PC to draft their church newsletter, few people would disagree
> that computer technology evolves at break-neck speed. This pace
> of change means that new products and technologies are
> constantly finding their way into our lives at work, home and
> school. For people with disabilities, however, new technologies
> too often are out of reach unless they are retrofitted to
> function with existing software and accessibility aids.
> 
> Microsoft's Accessibility and Disabilities Group, in concert
> with Microsoft Community Affairs, has created an international
> accessibility grant program designed to attack this problem. The
> program, "Exploring PC Accessibility: New Discoveries," was
> announced this week in conjunction with the United Nation's
> International Day of Disabled Persons. It will support
> non-profit research and product development to increase
> accessibility of PC technologies for people with disabilities.
> 
> "There is a compelling need for Microsoft and the PC industry to
> anticipate how evolving technology can be made accessible," said
> Greg Lowney, director of accessibility for Microsoft. "Microsoft
> is committed to building accessible products and fostering
> innovation in accessibility across the industry. We believe that
> the research initiatives supported by this grant will have
> near-term benefits for computer users with disabilities."
> 
> One-year grants of $10,000 and $50,000 will be awarded to
> non-profit and educational institutions for exploration of
> technology concepts and actual research and development. A total
> of $250,000 will be awarded in 1999 through the program.
> 
> Applications for Exploring PC Accessibility: New Discoveries
> grants must be submitted on or before Feb. 12, 1999. Information
> about the grant program and application process can be obtained
> from Microsoft's accessibility Web site. Award winners will be
> announced March 16 at the Technology and Persons with
> Disabilities Conference, hosted by California State University,
> Northridge, in Los Angeles.

> Exploring PC Accessibility: New Discoveries
> 
> Overview:
> The Microsoft Corporation is pleased to announce a new
> international initiative to support the research and development
> of innovative concepts and products that will contribute to
> increased accessibility to PC technology for individuals with
> disabilities.  This program will provide one-year grants of up to
> $50,000 to educational or not-for-profit organizations that are
> developing accessibility products that will be made available to
> the public.  Applicants also may apply for one-year grants of
> $10,000 to support research on an accessibility concept. 
> Microsoft software will be donated in addition to the cash grants
> in support of the proposed project.  Proposals are due on or
> before February 12, 1999.  Awards will be announced at the
> "Technology and Persons with Disabilities Conference" (aka CSUN)
> to be held in Los Angeles, California 16-20 March 1999.
> 
> 
> Background:
> Microsoft is committed to supporting the development of hardware
> and software that is fully accessible to individuals with
> disabilities and enables them to use the latest technology at
> work, at school and at home.  The company is doing this by
> building accessibility options into its operating systems (e.g.
> Windows 98, Windows NT 4.0) and including features specifically
> for individuals with disabilities in its software applications
> (e.g. captioning in Encarta '98). In addition, Microsoft is
> creating technology that can be used by software developers to
> make their products more accessible (e.g. Microsoft Active
> Accessibility MSAA).
> 
> Despite the commitment on the part of Microsoft and other
> companies, individuals with disabilities do not have equal access
> to PC (and related) technology. They can not automatically use
> state-of-the-art technology because access to technology is not
> built into these products; rather, adaptive hardware and software
> is typically retrofitted to PC products to allow their use by
> individuals with disabilities.  Given the unrelenting speed of 
> technological evolution, the disabled community is continually in
> the position of playing "catch up" instead of being able to take
> advantage of technological innovations as they occur.  The delays
> they encounter can have profound effects, including lost jobs and
> an inability to keep up with school classmates.
> In spite of the efforts already being made, there is a compelling
> need for those working on accessibility issues to look to the
> future and work to anticipate how evolving technology can be made
> accessible rather than reacting to advances that have already
> been made.  There is a need to ensure that individuals with
> disabilities will be able to benefit from the same advances in PC
> technology at the same time as other users. For example:
> ?    What implications will "hands-free, eyes-free" interfaces
> have for individuals with disabilities? 
> ?    What complications will "mobile computing" and "handheld"
> computers have for individuals who have physical disabilities? 
> ?    Will the integration of telecommunications, the Web and PC
> technology present access problems for individuals who are
> deaf/hard-of-hearing or instead, will it present marvelous new
> opportunities for individuals with disabilities to be integrated
> into the mainstream? 
> ?    What problems will the increased use of sound, animation and
> agents present for individuals with disabilities? 
> ?    What will a Web-based lifestyle mean for an individual
> dependent upon environmental control?   
> The challenge that presents itself is, how can these barriers be
> anticipated and these problems solved prior to the introduction
> of innovative products?  How can accessible hardware and software
> stay current with technological innovation so that individuals
> with disabilities are given the same opportunities to enjoy and
> benefit from these innovations as other users?
> 
> Program Goals:
> To support innovative research and/or product development to
> advance the ways in which computer technology can assist
> individuals with disabilities in their work, school and
> recreational activities.  To share the results of this work with
> the broadest possible audience to maximize its impact.
> 
> Program Objectives:
> ?    Advance research and product development targeted to
> increasing the accessibility of PC technology for individuals
> with disabilities;
> ?    Increase the knowledge-base of all groups dedicated to
> improving accessibility of PC technology;
> ?    Facilitate the dissemination of new accessibility concepts
> and products;
> ?    Provide an opportunity for the accessibility field to share
> new thinking.
> 
> Eligibility Requirements
> Grant proposals will be accepted from local, national or
> international nonprofit or educational institutions.  United
> States-based applicants must be nonprofit and tax-exempt under
> Section 501(c)3 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.  Organizations
> located outside the United States must possess charitable status
> in their country.
>
