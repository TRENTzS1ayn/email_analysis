Yes, I agree.  As long as the output of such programs are used as input to a more interactive program, then it would be a question of what program/tools are used most often.

Still, even if ALLClear's direct output is not that readable, it does show
information at a higher level that could in principle be used by a more
interactive program.

The same should be said for the proposal that Charles mentioned, to add to
SVG graphics (http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/)arrows connecting one object
to another.  That shows a bit more of the meaning of the diagram than just
a bunch of objects and lines.  And it could possibly be input to an
interactive program. Even it doesn't give all the semantics in the diagram,
it's more likely that it will be used by authors and graphics tools.

versions of AllClear) or even some higher level syntax such as control flow
words like "while" or "If...Then...".

The first question to ask when deciding how to make graphs and charts
accessible to the blind is 
>"What information am I trying to convey with this chart/diagram?"  These
chart drawing programs, text entry or drag and drop interface, seem to have
the drawing of the chart the end, and not the means.  In other words these
programs assume the user is asking the question
>"What would this process look like as a chart or diagram?"  A good
question for a sighted person, but as a blind person, my question would be
"Why do I want to know that?"  
>Since something must be in the resulting chart that is not in the text
description that gets mapped to the chart, I still think asking what that
something is should be the critical question.
