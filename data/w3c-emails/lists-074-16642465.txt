aloha, charles!

thanks for the response --  i was thinking along the same lines...  as for the
potential for redundancy, i was particularly thinking of users on machines with
limited character set support...  this is particularly the case for a lot of
lynx users, especially if they are unversed in the difference between character
sets (for, as you know, you can tell lynx which charset to use -- i myself use
7-bit approximations, so that i don't have strange ANSI blips or sudden
silences when encountering character entities that code for the extended ASCII
characters...

and, as you point out, it is helpful to markup greek letters, such as those
used in mathematical and logical equations slash formulae...

gregory.
