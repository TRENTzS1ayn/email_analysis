There's more information in the Web Access Project <http://www.wgbh.org/wgbh/pages/ncam/webaccess/> section of their site, including references to WAI.

I am not sure why this site has not come up for discussion sooner, what 
with the frequent requests for sites that are both accessible and visually 
striking.  WGBH has, of course, been in the business of accessible media 
for many years.

How would people rate the NCAM (A, AA, AAA) site?
How about the parent site at WGBH?

I was surprised to note some Lynx compatibility problems on the home page!
I was disappointed not being able to find direct links to Bobby, the W3C 
validator, nor to the WCAG compliance assurances.
