WAI Interest Group:

The Evaluation and Repair Interest Group <http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG> has
developed a beta "Web Accessibility Report Tool"
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/report/> to use when reporting accessibility
problems on a Web site. 

The tool includes a form on which to record accessibility problems, and
then generates a letter to the owner of the page reviewed and records this
information in a database for future reference. 

Please try it out and send any comments on the tool to <danield@w3.org>.
Please note that, while still in beta version, this tool sends real
messages to Web site owners, so please use it carefully.

Thank you in advance for your comments, 

Judy
