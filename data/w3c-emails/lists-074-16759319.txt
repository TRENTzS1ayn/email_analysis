Maybe, though the SGML history has come up with
the directed graph represented by a 'grove' which 
may answer lots of these questions.

In that model of a document, any node can gain
direct access to root (of the grove), parent,
sibling etc.

Using lisp like languages these are all easily 
represented and navigated.

Even if the presentational model is simple,
for the interactive world the grove is probably
a good starting point.

Robin Covers page has a fair summary of
where the world is in terms of grove based stuff.
