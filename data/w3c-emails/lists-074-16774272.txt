This has been around for at least three years I think.  Back before
programs like Netscape and Internet Explorer had direct keyboard access it
was an invaluable resource.  It was especially helpful when web sites
lacked alt tags or for finding edit boxes, again before the screen readers
and browsers had ways to get to them from the keyboard.
