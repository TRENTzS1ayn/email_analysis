In our haste to show each other our various ablitlites and abilities  it
seems we have all forgotten the admonition:

"A house divided against itself cannot stand."


Everyone with or without disabilities should think hard about this.   We are
all members of the human race.  We need to work together, all of us, all of
the time.  Otherwise there will only be wrangling and unsatisfactory
solutions at best.  If the solutions be drastic then so be it.  But we need
to
understand that we are all in this together, until we do, there will be much
grief for all concerned.

Sincerely,

Mike Burks
