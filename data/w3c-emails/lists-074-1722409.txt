Today I went to the home page of the Web Accessibility Initiative
(http://www.w3.org/wai) in search of some key reference and
proposed documents concerning accessibility.  I tried to find what
is the most accessible reading format for me and many other blind
people:  complete, plain text files with a line length less than 80
characters.  Unfortunately, I was generally not successful after
much browsing of the site.  Most of what I sought was available
only as a series of HTML pages, requiring one to produce a rendered
text version of each page and then arrange them sequentially in
order to have a complete text to read, browse or search.  

Therefore, I would appreciate it if anyone can provide web
addresses for complete, current, plain texts of the following
documents:  

HTML 4 specification

CSS2 specification

SMIL 1 specification

DOM 1 specification

Page authoring guidelines

User agent guidelines

Browser guidelines


I also encourage the W3C to regularly make complete plain text
available as a standard format option for key public documents.

Thanks,
Jamal
