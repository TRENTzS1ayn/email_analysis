A beginning or casual author would probably start by reading educational
materials which would include suggestions relevant to universal design
(E.G. documents produced by the Education and Outreach working group). The
next stage in this progression would be to look at the summary of the
guidelines which has been conveniently provided in the form of a table,
referring to the extended descriptions provided in the guidelines where
clarification is necessary. If examples and detailed discussion are
required, the techniques document would be consulted.

The page author guidelines have thus been carefully layered in such manner
as to take account of diverse reader needs. They are supplemented by the
invaluable efforts of the Education and Outreach working group.
