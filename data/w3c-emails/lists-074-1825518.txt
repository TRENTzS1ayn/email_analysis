Actually, HTML is better because it allows for embedding of
structure and meta-content that doesn't exist in plain
text.

Granted, there's a problem right now in that some of the tools
that exist now are designed only to work with plain text and
not with HTML -- but I suspect this will change soon in the
future.  (If not HTML itself, then XML or another descendant.)
