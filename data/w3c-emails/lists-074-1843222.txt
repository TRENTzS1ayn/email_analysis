Right now, the W3C document describing Technical Reports constraint
only mention the production of plain text, ps, etc, as a "may".

The "must" are things like: pass the HTML validator, bear the W3C
logo, use the correct naming scheme (AA-name-YYYYMMDD), no broken
link, etc.

Therefore, it is up to each W3C spec editor to decide what to do wrt
alternate formats.

Some (like HTML, CSS, DOM) have been using a production line that
includes automatic generation of html, ps, txt, etc, from a master
template in xml/html. Others haven't.

Somehow, given that simple tools (such as "save-as-txt" in the
browser, or the trick below) are available, I doubt I can be
successful in modifying our process so that the production of plain
text becomes a "should", instead of "may".


One neat trick Gerald Oskoboiny has added to our server (Gerald used
to run a lynx-me proxy before he joined W3C), but I think it's only
available to the W3C staff right now, is to add ",text" to the URL you
want to see as plain text.

For instance, from where I stand, if I look at
  http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DSig-label
I get the HTML version, but if I do
  http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DSig-label,text
then I get a plain text copy.

I will ask Gerald to turn it on for everybody.
