There are two sides to this coin.  Markup, in use, can become a
cover for laziness in verbalizing the message.  The tags may
siphon information out of the text, not just add new information.
Tags are a little like Cookies in creating a way for programs to
talk behind the user's back, and possibly abuse this capability.

The cross-linking between the WAI guidelines and related W3C
documents is a major benefit.  I don't mean to dispute the upside
potential of hypertext and multimedia.  But there is more to the
way people trust plain text than tool obsolescence.
