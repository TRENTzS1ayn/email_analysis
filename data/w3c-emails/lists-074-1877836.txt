I think HTML is the second most universally accessible format after plain
text.  It should generally be possible to render a literary work in 
plain text.  The format itself is not stimulating to a reader, 
but the content should be coherent without embedded markup.  
Project Gutenberg standardized on plain text for a reason!

   NThere are two sides to this coin.  Markup, in use, can become a
   Ncover for laziness in verbalizing the message.  The tags may
   Nsiphon information out of the text, not just add new information.
   NTags are a little like Cookies in creating a way for programs to
   Ntalk behind the user's back, and possibly abuse this capability.
   NThe cross-linking between the WAI guidelines and related W3C
   Ndocuments is a major benefit.  I don't mean to dispute the upside
   Npotential of hypertext and multimedia.  But there is more to the
   Nway people trust plain text than tool obsolescence.
