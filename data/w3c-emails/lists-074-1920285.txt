To clarify one point: the WAI guidelines are not, and nor are they meant
to be, instructional materials. Rather, they are proposed as a standard
from which more educationally oriented documentation can be developed (as
is presently being worked on by the Education and Outreach group).

The guidelines themselves presuppose knowledge of HTML and style
languages. They should be read by developers of large and/or complex web
sites, and those who engage in web authoring on a routine basis. The
casual author would probably find the reference card sufficient. More
importantly, the guidelines are supposed to influence educational and
training materials, and would probably be consulted as a reference in
cases where individuals wish to clarify particular issues that have not
addressed fully in the educative resources.
