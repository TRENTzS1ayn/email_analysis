It suggests a current flaw in HTML that a single page cannot serve both
the people who want highly structured navigation and those who want the
whole text.  Perhaps it needs to be enhanced or supplimented with other
XML to achieve these dual purposes.  

Let me be clear that I have not been advocating plain text instead of
HTML.  I just think, at this time, a complete plain text file (with a
line length less than 80) provides a valuable accessible format for
many, especially if the HTML is presented as a series of linked and
nested pages.  An analogy might be that whenever a Post Script or PDF
alternative is provided for maximum visual, hard copy access, a complete 
plain text version should also be provided for maximum nonvisual, online 
access.

Regards,
Jamal

This is often closer to plaintext than the Web version, the full-text of a multi-part document, or both. This is another "both/and" instead of an "either/or" situation. I want *both* the multi-part, segmented, layered and hyperlinked versoin, and the single, simple downloadable version.

Nesting and layering hide complexity until it's needed, and requested, by the reader. When I want to look up a specific datum residing within one huge document, I don't want the overhead of downloading, scrolling through and searching, and printing 100% of the information when I only need .1%.

For this purpose - offline reference, browsing and reading - the single, simple page is often the better choice. I want the text, and only the text. And since I don't have the advantages of hyperlinks in print, I need all the text.
