XML and stylesheets should make this easy to do. (Well, ok, possible to do.)
The various parts could be stored in different fragments of a document and
included in a series of web pages, but a META link could link to a page that
pulled all the fragments together into one for printing or other uses.

Also, increased options for META data could make linking all the parts of a
document together for a printing option more viable.
