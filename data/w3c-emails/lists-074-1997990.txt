Well, often they are.

Yes, but tools are not necessarily going to solve every problem.

And today's tools just won't cut it.

I hope you're not suggesting that the answer for newbie web
authors (such as, say, those working on sites for government
agency departments) is "oh, wait a year or so, and hopefully
someone will have made a better tool for you"?

In my experience, the newbies care about accessibility just as
much as the seasoned veterans (which is to say, most don't
think about it, but when they find out, they're usually very
interested); saying that there's no good solution for them at
this time seems to be conceding a battle that we should be
able to win.
