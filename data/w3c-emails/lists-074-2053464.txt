I also have watched the guidelines for accessibility grow and I appreciate
the work that has been done. But of the people on my campus, I am one of
the few who will both read and understand them. However, my job here is to
help people create web pages and since I think accessibility is important,
I provide my own tips for accessibility. Those tips rarely involve writing
HTML code because the average web author here -- and I believe we are
typical -- doesn't do HTML.

That's OK, though, because I think making web sites accessible is a whole
lot more about thinking than it is about writing code. I can help someone
make alt-text happen -- that's easy -- but what I want them to do is think
through it and have reasons why one parcel of alt-text is more helpful
than another. I can help someone make hyperlinks work -- that's easy --
but what I want them to do is think through it and know why it makes sense
for links to make sense. 

I agree with Kynn's original statement. For this to work, accessibility
needs to be accessible, and I think teaching thinking is more important
than teaching code. Even the quicktips are moderately geeky.
