1. Charles McCathieNevile joins W3C/WAI Team:

The Web Accessibility Initiative is pleased to welcome Charles
McCathieNevile who has joined the WAI team for half a year from Melbourne,
Australia. Charles will be primarily working on development of the WAI
Authoring Tool Guidelines. His email address is charles@w3.org.

2. Call for Cross-Disability review of all three WAI guidelines:

As two of the three WAI guidelines approach Proposed Recommendation status,
we would like to invite review by organizations that have not been as
involved in the WAI working groups, including organizations in the
cognitive disability communities, deaf or hard of hearing communities, and
physical disability communities. A Call for Cross-Disability Review,
available at <http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/X-Disability-Review> includes a
brief explanation of WAI and provides context for each of the guidelines
documents. Please circulate this URL broadly, noting the deadlines for
response.

3. Page Author Guidelines Working Group releases new draft:

The Page Author Guidelines Working Group has released a new internal
Working Draft, which is available at
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH>, 
and includes input & some restructuring since the September 18 release on 
the W3C Technical Reports page. A change list is available from the Working 
Group home page, <http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL>.

4. User Agent Guidelines updates issues list prior to December 11-12 meeting:

The User Agent Guidelines Working Group, in preparing for their meeting
this Friday and Saturday in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has updated their
issues list. Most W3C Working Groups maintain a list of open technical
issues to resolve before the document becomes a Proposed Recommendation.
The UA Current Issues List is linked from the UA Guidelines home page
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA>. You can comment on the UA Issues List to
<w3c-wai-ua@w3.org>. Please note that registration for this meeting has now
closed; questions about the meeting can be directed to <jbrewer@w3.org>.

5. QuickTips reference card available in pilot version:

The WAI Education & Outreach Working Group is coordinating development of a
large number of outreach and educational materials. (A list of these -- not
fully updated -- is linked from the EO home page.) One of these materials
is a business-card-sized "QuickTips" reference card giving key principles
from the Page Author Guidelines. You can find a description of this card at
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/QuickTips>. We've gotten a lot of useful
feedback already, and would appreciate additional feedback
<w3c-wai-quicktips@w3.org> before we finalize this.
