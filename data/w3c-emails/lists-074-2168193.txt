Thanks for adding your perspective to this discussion.
I agree that IE 3.02 presently provides efficient HTML access with the
Winvision 97 screen reader, though not any other reliably.  It is a
temporary niche solution, but not a generally satisfactory one.  It does not
and will not support the latest web standards including HTML 4, and 
therefore, is becoming obsolete.  We need to have browsers that are 
developed to meet evolving Internet standards, so the version to judge by
is IE4, which came out over a year ago and is still not accessible with most
screen readers.

It is unrealistic to expect the average user to do the complex setup
required of Windows Lynx 32.
It still has keyboard conflicts with most screen readers.  Lynx also does not
support and is unlikely to support the latest web standards.

I do use Unix Lynx and if shell accounts were not a dying market choice, I
would encourage more computer novices to learn it.

I agree that we should encourage computer literacy among blind people.  The
level of literacy currently required, however, to efficiently use current
graphical browsers is a bit much for a non-techie.  

Regards,
Jamal

   NI am familiar with screen readers and internet browsing.  I
   Ndisagree with Jamal's very first statement (and thus the premise he
   Nis working from).  I am hoping he will elaborate on:
   N> There is not yet a Windows based HTML browser that provides
   N>efficient access to  most screen readers.
   NWhat is wrong (i.e., non-efficient) with IE 3.02, NN 2.02 or 3.04
   Nor Lynx 2.8?
   N> People with disabilities are often economically poor and not able
   N>to keep up with  the latest
   N> hardware requirements.
   NWith Henter Joyce giving away JAWS for DOS, I think consideration
   Nof the sub $200 PC market is quite relevant.  Free dial-up
   Ntext-only access to the 'net via Lynx (running on a remote server)
   Nwould be the status quo for this market.
   N> It has been suggested that, even if one does not use a
   N>contemporary graphical  browser, it is a trivial matter to use one
   N>to produce a good plain text rendering  of the HTML page.
   NIt has been suggested that this is a trivial matter with graphical
   Nbrowsers too.
   N> Unfortunately, I have not found this to be the case.
   NThe problems Jamal describes are not consistent with my own
   Nexperience.  (Aside from desiring nested documents to be available
   Nas a single file, which is a different issue altogether.)  What is
   Nwrong with the way Lynx saves html documents as plain text on the
   Nlocal drive?
   N> This further indicates that rendering good plain text is a
   N>nontrivial matter  which should not be assumed practical for the
   Naverage user.
   NI would contend that computer literacy is a requirement for anyone
   N(for economic reasons or whatever) who is using a DOS-based machine.
   NOperation of Lynx via telnet using a telecommunications package
   N(like Procomm Plus or whatever) certainly falls within the required
   Nskill set.  Use of the the HTMLSTRIP utility Jamal recommends would
   Nnot be difficult for such users, but not required.
