In case you were wondering what the Bell Atlantic's fee structure is going
to be in the DC Metro area for ADSL service.  Here is a message from a
friend who has a cable modem from Jones Cable.  Where we say "rape or
rip-off", Bell Atlantic says "Gotcha"!!!!!

I just spoke with the (idiot) sales representative at Bell Atlantic
regarding the ADSL service in our area.  We are currently enabled up to the
full 7.1 service.  Fees for the service are:
ADSL Installation and Set-Up
$   99One time set-up fee
$   99Inside wiring charge
$ 325 ADSL Modem
---------
$ 523Total *
Current Bell Atlantic promotion (which runs through NEXT December)
if you select Bell-Atlantic.net as your ISP and sign a 1 year
contract
The following apply:
ADSL Installation and Set-Up
$   99One time set-up fee
$    0Inside wiring charge  (Charged Waved)
$   99 ADSL Modem  (with a $50 rebate after installation)
---------
$ 148Total * (After Rebate)

* Your computer will also require a NIC which you can provide yourself or
buy from Bell Atlantic.

The monthly service fees are as follows:
640 Service$   59.00 month
1.6  Service$ 109.99 month
 7.1 Service$ 189.95 month

Two hitches with the current service: (1) you can only access another ISP
(such as Concentric) via this service IF that ISP supports DSL service - not
likely, and (2) Although the DSL technology can support multiple
connections, Bell Atlantic's configuration will only support one connection
through the modem.  This means I am NO better off than we are today with
Jones Internet.  As a matter of fact, we would be worse off as the Bell
Atlantic's base service (640) is slower than Jones and costs more $$$$.
