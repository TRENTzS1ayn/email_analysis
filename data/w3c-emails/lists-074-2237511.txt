I have responded privately to Steven McCaffrey and perhaps I should repost
the urls for the articles I have written:

"Applying the ADA to the Internet:  A Web Accessibility Standard"  - written
at the request of the American Bar Association for their June 1998 national
summit on disability law and policy for the next millennium.
http://www.rit.edu/~easi/law/weblaw1.htm

"Is Your Site ADA-Compliant? ...or a Lawsuit-in-Waiting?" published November
1998 in The Internet Lawyer; available free through trial subscription at
http://www.internetlawyer.com
(I encourage everyone to request the article be available directly on-line;
to my surprise the article is not currently on-line due to the fact that
although I did not receive remuneration for it I did not confirm that it
would be posted.)

"Law Firm Homepages and the ADA" - a shorter version of  the 11/98 article
above at
http://KevinLeeThomason.com/articles/til-ada-and-homepages.html

"Electronic Curbcuts:  How to Build an Accessible Web Site" Spring 1997-
written at the request of CA Association of Postsecondary Education on
Disability and presented twice at Sixth International World Wide Web
Conference and at the International Leadership Forum for Women with
Disabilities, a follow-up to the United Nations conference in Beijing,
China.

"Electronic Curbcuts for Government Web Sites:  Making Your Web Site
Accessible"
ADA Update, Fall 1997 by the National League of Cities
