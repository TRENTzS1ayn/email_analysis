Not to throw salt on a wound but the cable modem costs me ~ $40 US per
month.  Don't remember the cost of the set-up fee.  As for a regular dial-up
account, USA pays $10-20 for unlimited service.

I would kill for that pricing to come to the UK :) I pay like 6c/min on
peak phone call rates to my LOCAL ISP! ADSL will be charged at
$50//month here at 256k upstream and 2mbps downstream and is being
released sometime next March...

Cheers,
