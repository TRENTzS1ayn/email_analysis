It's not hard: lynx -dump on any UNIX or DOS box with Lynx installed;
there are services on the 'net that will do this.  There even used to
be e-mail Web proxies; are any of them still around?

I should say not: ^L is a page break, not a line feed.  That would be
a pretty odd-looking document.  I assume you meant ^J, but the problem
with that proposal is that both ^J and ^M are in use: UNIX uses line
feeds (^J) at the end of every line; Macintosh uses carriage returns
(^M), and DOS/Windows uses CRLF (J).  Adopting any other use for
these extremely characters would cause a fair bit of chaos.
