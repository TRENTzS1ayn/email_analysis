A convention I've developed is to use a .asc extension standing for "ASCII
document" for files with carriage return/line feed delimiters at the end of
paragraphs but not lines.  I use a .txt extension to denote a text file with
such delimiters at the end of each line.  This approach is consistent with
the common convention of identifying a file format by its extension.

Jamal

   NI should say not: ^L is a page break, not a line feed.  That would
   Nbe a pretty odd-looking document.  I assume you meant ^J, but the
   Nproblem with that proposal is that both ^J and ^M are in use: UNIX
   Nuses line feeds (^J) at the end of every line; Macintosh uses
   Ncarriage returns (^M), and DOS/Windows uses CRLF (J).  Adopting
   Nany other use for these extremely characters would cause a fair bit
   Nof chaos.
