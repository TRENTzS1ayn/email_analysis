Thought some people might be interested in this local salary survey.

Did anyone catch the Washington Post's article in the Business section
of today's paper?  It's got an  survey of what local DC Techies are making.

Ever look around at the other office grunts and wonder who's getting paid
what?

Well, washingtonpost.com has started a local Technology Salary Index to help
answer that question.

More than 7,450 Washington area tech workers have taken the ongoing,
interactive salary survey that was used to create the index.

The average salary for a dozen key tech occupations rose 3.8 percent during
the past six months, the survey found.


   TECHNOLOGY JOB MEDIAN SALARY
Systems engineer $68,900
Client server administrator $64,000
Software engineer $61,900
Database administrator $60,000
Network analyst $55,000
Program analyst $55,000
Web programmer $52,000
LAN administrator $50,000
Systems administrator $50,000
Systems operator-analyst $48,000
Multimedia designer $40,000
Technical support $40,000


 The large number of respondents lends credence to its findings, which are
in line with other, similar tech wage surveys, said washingtonpost.com
database editor Hal Straus.

Like all such voluntary surveys, however, the washingtonpost.com index
relies on the accuracy of information submitted by employees about
themselves.
