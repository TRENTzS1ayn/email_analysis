Many people required to edit and create web pages and/or sites are not web
professionals and the only "WYSIWYG" tool available to them is Word.  I
daresay that most people don't know HTML and are not going to learn it so
that they can make an accessible page through a text editor.  This is
especially true if the only editing required of them is small such as
changing the grammar on a web page or correcting spelling of a word.  This
is exactly why the authoring tools aspect of the WAI is so important.

PS: *Why* would you use Word to edit an HTML document?!
