> PS: *Why* would you use Word to edit an HTML document?!

MS-Word has elegant text-editing commands that are absent from a basic
text editor, and that make editing documents a pleasure. For example, you
can quickly move entire lines or paragraphs without using the clipboard;
select words, sentences, and paragraphs by pressing a single key; and undo
and redo 100 levels. All of the above can be done using keyboard and
point-and-click techniques. So there is a lot of versatility.

Unfortunately, many of the really powerful Word commands are extremely
poorly documented.

Furthermore, savvy Word users can create special-purpose editing commands
in Visual Basic to enhance the usefulness of the word processor as a text
editor. 

Why use Word? Because it is a good tool for the job.
