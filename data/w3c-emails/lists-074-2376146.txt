"Many people required to edit and create web pages and/or sites are not web
professionals and the only "WYSIWYG" tool available to them is Word.  I
daresay that most people don't know HTML and are not going to learn it so
that they can make an accessible page through a text editor"

This is probably very true.  When I first decided to do my "homepage"  I
asked around and spoke with someone whose page I thought was awesome.  His
advice was "Learn HTML, period."  Since his page was really great, I did.  I
do not regret it.  It is the same advice I give out.  My girl friend took it
and doesn't regret it, either.  I have another friend whom I advised to take
the time to learn it, and didn't.  She is constantly having problems with
the editor (FrontPage) and she complains about it all the time, and yet
still won't learn html.

I know this sounds cliche-ish but, "If I can learn html, anyone can."  And
with all the excellent vaidators out there to 'proof' your pages and suggest
how to correct them, it is easier than ever to learn it.

I guess I am spoiled with using notepad, it just seems to be so useful in
what I need it for.

*Smile*  The word processing program I use is Student Writing Center.  It
even checks and helps with bibliographies!
