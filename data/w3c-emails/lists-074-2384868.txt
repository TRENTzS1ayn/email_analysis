I think that is exactly what needs to be tested.

  I've heard that if you create a page with alt tags and bring it into
  word to edit it and then export it back to html that the alts are
  stripped? can anyone confirm or deny this?
  Thanks!

  I'm guessing you mean the ALT= attribute on the <IMG> tag? (There's no <ALT> tag.)
  
  That's about what I'd expect to happen, with Word or any other wordprocessor.
  
  I could test this on my system if you can confirm the scenario:
  - Start with an HTML document, created by any means.
  - The doc contains an <IMG> with the ALT= attribute.
  - The HTML doc is opened in Word and some text on the page is changed or added.
  - The page is "Saved as HTML" from Word, without first saving it in Word format.
  
  PS: *Why* would you use Word to edit an HTML document?!
