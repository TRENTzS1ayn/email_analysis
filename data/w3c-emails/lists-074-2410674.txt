I'd like to have some stats which say something like:

     You have a 75% of being dependent upon assistive technology
     to access the web, at least temporarily, sometime in the
     next 20 years.

My thinking on this issue intensified when I broke my arm and
found myself unable to use my computer effectively. :)

In other words, nobody really wants to hear "hey, you're gonna
go blind when you get old", but it's easier to convince them,
"you may suffer from RSI or broken bones or eyestrain, and thus
will need this yourself someday" -- if we include temporarily
disabled people in the mix, we find there's an even LARGER
audience of folks who will, at one time or another, benefit
from accessible web design.

The TAB key was a lifesaver for me. :)
