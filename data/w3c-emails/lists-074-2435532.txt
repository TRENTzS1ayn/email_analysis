I've heard that if you create a page with alt tags and bring it into
word to edit it and then export it back to html that the alts are
stripped? can anyone confirm or deny this?
Thanks!

I'm guessing you mean the ALT= attribute on the <IMG> tag? (There's no <ALT> tag.)

That's about what I'd expect to happen, with Word or any other wordprocessor.

I could test this on my system if you can confirm the scenario:
- Start with an HTML document, created by any means.
- The doc contains an <IMG> with the ALT= attribute.
- The HTML doc is opened in Word and some text on the page is changed or added.
- The page is "Saved as HTML" from Word, without first saving it in Word format.

I could *not* re-create the problem described when I tested this on my own system using MS Word 97 for Windows. I followed the scenario with a simple test page (created in Netscape Page Composer) with a Heading, one line of text, and an image with ALT= text. I opened the HTML file in Word97, added one word to the text of the Heading, then saved the file back to HTML with a new name. The ALT= text was not affected.

MS Word 97, at least, seems to recognize HTML and preserve it. Obviously, other versions of Word may behave differently. I suspect that *any* word processor would strip the ALT= text if you first save the document in its *native* format, then try to save it back to HTML.
