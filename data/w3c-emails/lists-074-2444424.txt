When doing the presentation, have you considered mentioning that some of
the most important vistors to a web site are effectively blind?  The
various robots from search engines need accessible sites to be able to
index them.

Fun for the day, do a search on "you need a better browser" in altavista to
have a brief look at some sites that have not considered their search
engine profile at all.
