I tried that with Word 97 and there was no lost of ALT.

I even tried saving the file as .doc format, copying it under a
different name.doc, reopening it in Word and saving it in HTML, and
the ALT were still present (which proves that the ALT are somehow
stored in the doc format)

On the other hand, there was a lost of longdesc, link, and others
new HTML4 table attributes; in fact, in looks like unknown attributes
are pruned out, which shouldn't happen (unknown elements are kept,
albeit mess up with, see below)

The DOCTYPE and the STYLE I had in this test file were moved from the
top and the head to the body, which is really bad.
 
Anyway, join the WAI Authoring Tools working group if you're
interested in that kind of issue.

Because you use Windows ? (I use Unix)
