I'm just starting to play with Amaya. It looks absolutely amazing from the 
docs I've read so far. It seems to follow the windows conventions for 
window classing etc. Customizing Jaws for Windows to deal with it seems 
pretty straight forward. However, I haven't found any shortcut keys in 
Amaya to move from link to link, nor forward back in the document history 
(E.G. alt+leftArrow and alt+rightArrow in internet explorer). Anyone know 
if these are implemented? If not, how easy is it to extend Amaya in this 
regard?
Thanx much ...
