That's a job for a different organization. The Web Standards Project was
set up specifically to go after browser makers and not Web designers and
developers. The browser copanies keep us busy as it is.

The purpose of going after the browser companies is because currently
designing to standards is extremely limiting because of the poor support on
behalf of the browsers. Anyway, the way to get them to want to design using
valid HTML is not to chastize them for their choice of HTML and make them
feel stupid but to help them understand nicely why it's the right thing.
The government will then sock Title II and II organizations with ADA
requirements to do so.

On the other hand, most designers don't code by hand. They use authoring
tools. So really, someone should be going after authoring tool companies to
make sure they use techniques that create valid HTML.

That is an incorrect interpretation of the WSP's message. We are not saying
that "developers" don't have to follow standards. We have chosen to focus
on one group and not overextend the already limited time of those involved.

Hope that makes things a little more clear.
