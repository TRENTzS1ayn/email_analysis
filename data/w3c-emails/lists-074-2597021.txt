Okay, this sounds good.

Uhm, where is it?  For something that was "officially released"
in October, I'd expect to be able to find something about it on
your web page, and possibly be able to test it.

I'm not knocking your product; I've just never heard of it before
and www.inter-next.net has absolutely no information about what
it is, what it does, how I use it, how much it costs, and so on.

More information would be useful, especially if you are going to
use this communication channel as an advocacy/advertising forum.
