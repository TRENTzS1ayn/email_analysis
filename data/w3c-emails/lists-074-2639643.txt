I have previously sent this to the EO and am copying the WAI IG.  Please

I do not know if anyone has seen this, but I know TV ON THE WEB because they
taped our presentation and placed it on their web site for free.  They have
a separate section for Accessibility.  Go to
http://www.tvontheweb.com/channels/able/index.html
Select C4 Foundation was started by Berry Cuffee , see the text transcript
in the C4 area.

There are other areas here:
1.  Blind/Visually Impaired Able Online
2.  Mobility Impaired Able Online
3.  Deaf/Hard of Hearing Able Online

Happy Holidays!  Rob Neff
