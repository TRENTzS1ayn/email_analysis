Subject: NEW: PDF-Basics - a '101'-level list for newcomers to
AdobeAcrobat software & pdf files
To: NEW-LIST@HYPATIA.CS.WISC.EDU

PDF-Basics <majordomo@lists.pdfzone.com >
Hosted by PDFzone.COM <http://www.pdfzone.com/>

The PDF-Basics list is being launched by PDFzone.COM to help address the
needs of relative newcomers to Adobe Acrobat software and pdf files, a
safe
haven for questions some might be intimidated to ask on one of our other
pdf-centric lists.

Recent Internet population surveys indicate the largest growth in Net
migration is the influx of people who are less familiar with the online
world, its varied tools and computers in general. Our primary PDF list,
launched in 1995, has grown to an active and knowledgeable network
of more than 2,000 Acrobat-enabled users worldwide. Many PDF list
discussions are beyond the level most useful to pdf newcomers.

PDF-Basics is intended as an appropriate place for posting more
elementary questions -- a sort of ongoing Acrobat 101 course. A digest
version is also available, as will be a browseable, searchable Web
archive
(as list traffic builds).

To subscribe to PDF-Basics, send this one-word message:

OR, to subscribe to the digest version, send the same message:

  subscribe

instead to *this* server address:

mailto:pdf-basics-digest-request@lists.pdfzone.com

You will receive a confirmation message from the server, to which you
that
*must* 'Reply' (sent back to the server address) to verify your intent
to
subscribe. You are *not* subscribed to the list until *after* you
successfully
'Reply' to the confirmation message. Once you have done so, you'll
automatically
receive a "Welcome" message from the PDF-Basics list, along with the
list's
netiquette guidelines.
