I'm sure that many of you have already stumbled across this site, but it
was brought to my attention today by one of the theoccupational
therapists that I work with. The site contains tons of
disability-related links, included those related to web accessibility,
as well as links for more difficult-to-find resources, such as adaptive
clothing. I hope that it is helpful!

Happy Holidays,
