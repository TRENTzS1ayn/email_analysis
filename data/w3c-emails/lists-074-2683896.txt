It's interesting to note, the current design of
http://www.microsoft.com/ receives a 'Bobby Approved'
status when you test it at www.cast.org/bobby/

Any Microsoft folks out there, feel free to pass on kudos
from me to whoever put the page together.

Now, I wonder if it's safe to use Microsoft as an example
of a Bobby-compliant major website?
