While Microsoft does tout their accessibility quite loudly and publically, Kynn
does have a good point. You can get a heck of a lot more out of an organization
like Microsoft by saying "Great job! Have you thought about this?" than
criticizing this: "Your sorry attempt at making your front page accessible
isn't worth it.....try following the standards that you participated in
creating."

Through my own personal experience, I've realized that use of the "blistering
criticism" that Kynn mentioned only causes Microsoft to get defensive. However,
they did make an interesting quote in the media last week:
