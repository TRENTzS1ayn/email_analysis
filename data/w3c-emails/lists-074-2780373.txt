  Web-site Problems.  Employment Report at www.dol.gov


Please Report Transportation Web-site Problems.  

"Kelly Pierce from Chicago and I have both filed complaints 
with the Federal Transit Administration regarding access problems 
with the web-sites maintained by our local transit agencies.
We are interested in hearing from other blind and low-vision 
computer users who have had difficulty in navigating transportation 
web-sites.  These problems could include things like not being 
able to purchase products (fare cards, etc.) over the web-site, 
inability to review information on the site that is provided 
to the public, selection methods that are exclusively graphical, 
for example multiple choice combo boxes with no textual information 
on how to navigate the box.

Please send your responses to both of us, and don't forget to 
include the address of the web-site you are having problems with!

Thanks,

Kelly Pierce (kelly@irpco.com)
Randy Tamez (r_tamez@pacbell.net)"

Get Employment Report:

Several people weren't able to retrieve the Presidential 
Task Force on Employment of Adults with Disabilities Report

1. "Re-charting the Course:  First Report of the Presidential
Task Force on Employment of Adults with Disabilities"
can be found on the Department of Labor's website at:  
www.dol.gov 

Then scroll down to "President Clinton signed into law
Executive Order 13078, establishing the Presidential Task 
Force on the Employment of Adults with Disabilities to help 
remove barriers to employment opportunities faced by adults 
with disabilities." 

2. Try:
http://www.dol.gov/dol/_sec/public/programs/ptfead/rechart/index.htm

3. For those unable to obtain the Report via the web please
call 202-219-6081.

Thanks to all for their support for this important initiative.
