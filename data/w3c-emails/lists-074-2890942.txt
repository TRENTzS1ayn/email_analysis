Folks: I would like to draw your attention to a new research focus on 
the topic of UNIVERSAL ACCESS jointly sponsored by the HCI and KCS 
programs within the Information and Intelligent Systems (IIS) Division 
of CISE.
The word "access" implies the ability to find, manipulate and use 
information in an efficient and comprehensive manner. A primary objective 
of the HCI/KCS research focus on universal access is to empower people 
with disabilities so that they are able to participate as first class 
citizens in the emerging information society. But more than that, the 
research focus will benefit the nation as a whole, by advancing computer 
technology so that all people can possess the skills needed to fully 
harness the power of computing to enrich and make their lives more 
productive within a tightly knit "national family" whose members 
communicate naturally and painlessly through the sharing of (multimodal) 
information.
For more information, please point your web browser at
http://www.cise.nsf.gov/iis/index.html
then click on "IIS Programs" and from there go to either the HCI or KCS 
page, where you will find a link to Universal Access.
