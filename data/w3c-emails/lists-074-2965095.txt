I would like to let you know about a newly-developed training course at the
Trace Center.  The course was developed to address the need in the
telecommunications industry for more understanding of how to make products
and services that are increasingly usable, flexible, and compliant with the
emerging telecommunication accessibility regulations.

This first offering of the course is at the Trace Center in Madison,
Wisconsin, on February 1 - 3, 1999.  Enrollment is limited to 27
participants, so you will need to act quickly if you believe you can attend.

Detailed information is attached to this letter, and you can contact us if
you have any questions.

The focus of this workshop-style course is on practical, accessible product
design.  The objective is to show how telecommunications products can be
designed to address the access requirements in a way that appeals to the
mass market, and is profitable to develop, market, and support.  In the
three days, we will:

*Explore the needs and access issues of people with disabilities;
*Review the past, current, and emerging regulatory environment around
accessible product design;
*Lay out specific strategies for addressing current and proposed
accessibility requirements;
*Examine those things that are practical today (and not) versus those which
might be practical in the not-too-distant future; and
*Examine the issues around market analysis and marketing of products with
enhanced accessibility and usability.


Already enrolled in this course are representatives from the FCC, Department
of Justice, and the US Access Board, as well as people from information and
telecommunications companies, and several individuals working as consultants
in this area.  I hope that you can join us in what promises to be an
excellent experience.
