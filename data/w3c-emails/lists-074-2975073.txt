Internet World, www.iw.com, does not have a section or reporter devoted to
accessibility.  This is such a critical issue for People With Disabilities
(PWD) and also with the Federal, State and Local governments that are
required to maintain sites and web applications that are in compliance with
the American Disabilities Act.

As a subscriber, I also ask that when you offer opinions on web sites as is
done in InternetWorld - my apologies for not remembering the column where
two people offer advice on what they liked and disliked - that you include a
another person's input on Accessibility.

Here is a copy of an email that is pertinent to the discussion. I sent this
to InternetWeek who is sponsoring the BOTI.

TO:  Managing Editor and Debbie Rizzo

No where in the BOTI competition (article enclosed below) is there a
category for web sites OR web applications designed to be accessible to
everyone. I would like to think that for each category (one through eleven)
there could be two sub categories: one where designers and companies are not
concerned with accessibility and the second for those web sites and web
applications that are accessible to everyone to include People With
Disabilities (PWDs).

For your information, the American Disabilities Act requires Federal, State
and Local governments to be accessible to everyone.  I would hope that this
category could be included.

As a subscriber, I am interested in accessibility because my customer is a
Federal Agency.  As a matter of fact, I have not seen Accessibility
addressed.  I would hope that a leading internet magazine that covers the
internet would be concerned about the W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative
(WAI), www.w3c.org/wai and its attempts to publish page authoring guidelines
for designers and its education and outreach program.

I ask that Internet Week support a section DEDICATED to Accessibility.  I
think you could convince your sponsors of this need because PWDs are a
marketable audience that use the web to purchase products and obtain
information.  If they can't access the web site, then they cannot purchase
their product or review information!

Many of us would be more than willing to provide insight. Here are some
examples for some articles.
a. Interview a person who is blind and let him/her show you how they access
the web.
b. Interview a person who is deaf and let him/her show you how they access
the web.
c. Interview a person with low vision person and let him/her show you how
they access the web.
d. Interview a person who is quadriplegic and let him/her show you how they
access the web.
e. Interview Judy Brewer, Chair of the WAI.
f. Review the software PWDs use to access the web.
g. Review a web site for accessibility on a weekly basis.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at
