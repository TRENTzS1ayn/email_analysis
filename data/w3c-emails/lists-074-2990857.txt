We posted a working group version of the Authoring Guidelines December
18th.  We would like to take this version public in early January.  Note
that before it goes public there are a few changes that need to be made
that we are unable to make at this time (due to technical difficulties).
These changes include a few broken links, shorthand that needs to be
expanded (e.g., [+P2] should be expanded to "Priority 2"), and a few other
rough edges.  However, we do not want to delay the review process and are
looking for feedback on content before we go public.

Primarily, please notice:
1. we have removed priorities from guidelines 
2. in the guidelines document, we call the points following each rationale
"checkpoints" rather than "techniques." There are several reasons for this:
a. in discussions, people were miscommunicating about the techniques doc or
the techniques in the guidelines. b. a technique is a concrete way to
satisfy a checkpoint. 
3. The issues list has been split into two documents: one for the
guidelines document and one for the techniques document. These are far from
complete, but it's a start. 
4. we have created two "checklists." one lists only priority one
checkpoints, the other lists all three levels of priority checkpoints. Note
that these are grouped by categories (images & image maps, tables, etc.)
These are rough (notice the placeholders in the top headers), but are to
give a proposal of a direction to head. 


We look forward to discussion and feedback.
The latest version is available from the GL home page at
