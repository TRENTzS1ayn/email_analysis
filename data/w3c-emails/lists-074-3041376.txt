Hello:

I hope this doesn't seem like I'm splitting hairs, but the 
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) does not apply to the 
Federal government. Agencies of the Federal government are 
covered under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. 
Section 504 does contain requirements for communication access 
similar to those found in Title II of the ADA.

> For your information, the American Disabilities Act requires Federal, State
> and Local governments to be accessible to everyone.  I would hope that this
> category could be included.
> 
> As a subscriber, I am interested in accessibility because my customer is a
> Federal Agency. <snip>
