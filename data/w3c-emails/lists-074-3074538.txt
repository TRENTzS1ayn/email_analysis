WAI IG:

First a note of caution on the use of cc's with this list. The WAI IG is a
large list & we need to use some restraint to not generate an unnecessary
volume of mail.

When you cc a message to WAI IG & also to other addresses, any of the
subsequent discussion may end up on the IG list. That's not its purpose, &
not fair to the other subscribers. So please refrain from cc'ing mail
except where to specifically bring a comment to the attention to someone
already in the WAI IG. And if someone else does a broadcast cc, please drop
the cc's from your reply. 

If WAI IG is cc'd on a small number of replies to this exchange, please
just disregard it. If it becomes a significant problem, we will close the
list to non-subscriber mail. 

For more information on using this mailing list go to
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/#Using the WAI IG mailing list>.

If you have any comments on this message, please comment privately to me at
<jbrewer@w3.org>.

Thank you.

Judy
