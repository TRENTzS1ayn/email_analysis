Hi Mike,

No it doesn't sound like splitting hairs. 

However, the US Federal Government is very clearly covered by Section 508
of the Rehabilitation Act, which applies to all Information Technology (IT)
procurement by the Federal Government, and, by extension through the "Tech
Act," Section 508 applies to State Government IT procurement as well. So
there is no lack of obligation in the US for Federal & State entities to
have their Web sites accessible.

Robert, since Mike Muehe's message as well as yours went to the large cc
field, you may want to follow up with those folks -- separately from this
list please -- to provide further clarification as needed.

Regards,

Judy
