MM: "Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) does not apply to the 
Federal government"

WL::  SEC. 202. DISCRIMINATION.

      Subject to the provisions of this title, no qualified individual
with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from
participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or
activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any
such entity.

You aren't "splitting hairs" but you should recognize why we insist that
Title II of ADA quoted above is relevant and applicable.  As to case
law, Randy Tamez & Kelly Pierce have an action in process which has been
widely discussed on the WAI and WebWatch lists.
