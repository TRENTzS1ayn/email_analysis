William:

This is the first time I've ever heard anyone claim that 
the ADA applies to any federal government agency. Rehab Act, 
yes; ADA, no.  By the way, I have no quibble with using Title II 
of the ADA to require internet access to activities and programs 
of state and local governments.

"Public Entity" is defined in Title II of the ADA statute as:

SEC. 201. DEFINITION.
As used in this title:
(1) Public entity.--The term "public entity" means--
(A) any State or local government;
(B) any department, agency, special purpose 
district, or other instrumentality of a State or States or local 
government; and
(C) the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, and            
any commuter authority (as defined in section 103(8) of 
the Rail Passenger Service Act).

We have a perfectly servicable law (the Rehab Act) to apply to 
the federal government.  It's a waste of time to try to apply 
the ADA to the federal government.
