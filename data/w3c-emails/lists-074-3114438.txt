One person's "waste" is another person's exercise of liberty. 

The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution explciitly demands equal
protection under the law for all citizens. Though Congress has managed
to maintain certain exemptions from *enforcement* of various laws,
personal and civil liability court actions are not among them - viz.
U.S. Supreme Court decision in case Clinton v. Jones. any Accessibility
agent or agency for local, state, and federal agencies should become
aware of the larger principles of law and justice.

According to the 14th Amendment, the law which most comprehensively
provides accessibility for Americans with Disabilities would be ruled
applicable in court - whether ADA or other law.

Amendment 14
"Section 1.  All persons born or naturalized inthe United States, and
subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States
and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any
law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the
Unites States; nor shall nay State deprive any person of life, liberty,
or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within
the jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."
