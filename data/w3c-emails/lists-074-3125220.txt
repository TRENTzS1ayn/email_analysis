I am trying to test my pages on as many browsers as possible. Since it now
appears that more than half of all surfers on-line are connecting through
AOL (sigh), I need to be able to test my pages in AOL's browser. I went to
aol.com and downloaded the latest browser, but there doesn't seem to be any
way to use it without signing up for AOL. Also, there doesn't seem to be a
developer's site, or, in fact, any information at all to make my life
easier.

Interestingly, I tested the browser on local files and it seems to be using
MSIE to do it's Internet browsing. Could it be that making pages work in IE
will cover AOL also? Seems to good to be true. Besides, my parents have AOL
and they are always reporting problems with my sites. I test with everything
from Lynx to Opera to pwWebspeak and Mosaic, and I can never duplicate the
problems they report (then again, I'm on a PC and they're on a Mac, so
anything's possible).

Would really like my pages to be accessible to everyone. Anyone know how to
test in AOL without signing up? Also, are there any other browsers I can
pick up (freely or very cheaply, please... I'm not rich) that others
recommend? I am particularly interested in screen readers, but they all seem
quite expensive. Also, anything I download must work on Win95 (so emacspeak
is out). Kynn, you seem to be an expert on browsers. What say you?

Thanks.

I currently have the following:

MSIE 5.0 beta2
Netscape 4.5, 4.07, 4.05, 3.4, 3.1, 2.02
Mosaic 3.0
Lynx 2.8
pwWebspeak 2.0
Opera 3.5
WebTV viewer
AOL 4.0???

Also, any ideas for how to get around Bill Gates' dictum that thou shalt
only have one copy of IE on your system? Short of a dual boot, that is.
