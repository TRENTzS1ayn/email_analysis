When the Guidelines were first started (it only seems like a decade
ago!) the intent was for there to be the large "reference" document and
a "checklist" that was either abstracted from the GL or created
separately.  This hasn't received a lot of emphasis and perhaps now is
the time to undertake this - possibly in conjunction with the quicktips
card that Education & Outreach is printing.  

As a first stab, perhaps the table of contents itself can be the basis
for the checklist.  It is important that this sort of terseness is
maintained so as not to have too daunting a checklist.
