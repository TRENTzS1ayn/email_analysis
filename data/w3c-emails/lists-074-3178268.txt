William,

Actually if you look at the draft which Wendy Chisholm mentions in her
message
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/1998OctDec/0517.html> you
will notice there are now two draft checklists (of "checkpoints") available
for review, for just this reason.

More background on these checklist changes & a formal call for review on
the new version of the Page Author Guidelines will be coming within the
next several days. They have been held up due to some server problems here
over the holidays, which has delayed some technical corrections in the
documents needing review.
