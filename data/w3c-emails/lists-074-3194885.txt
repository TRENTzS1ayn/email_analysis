I'm testing "speechhtml"
a new phone based web browsing service now in pilot.  the number will be
an over seas call for many on this list but it connects you to:
http://www.clark.net/pub/poehlman/maryland.html

I'd appreciate assistance in the way of feedback on the service and
rendering as I make changes to the content to make it more suitable for
this environment.

Instructions: dial
country code if needed: 44
city code: 870
number: 8703032
 wait a short time and the page will begin to speak.  the voice is
clear, but a bit rough.  after a bit, you'll here: "you have the
following options".
the last option: "continue" means read more of the page.  the other
options are the list of links.  speak the option you want to select and
you will be put on hold presently with music.  I will be changing this
to something a bit more meaningful soon.  the link you have selected
will be read.  when you are finished exploring, simply hang up.  I will
be adding a special form which you can speak into and the results will
be emailed to me.  at present, I believe we only understand english but
it should be able to understand most english responses.

Thanks for any assistance.

Happy new year!
