Of course, we understand that this would not be available to all users
but it might help even those for whom reading is a problem so that
unique audation could replace the image or suplement it.  this may
play well in the easy reading and reading impaired segment.
a plug in would have to of course be developped that would
automatically process and sonify the image.
