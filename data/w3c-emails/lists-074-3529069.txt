Hi Folks,

This use of audio files begins to move into the realm of the Synchronized
Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL) This is a W3C recommendation. This
is also the technique the DAISY Consortium (http://www.daisy.org) is using
for development of Digital Talking Books.

 The .wav file is very large, but various compression techniques can reduce
the size (mpeg, Realaudio) and these files could also be streamed.

Best
George
