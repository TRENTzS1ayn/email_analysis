In fact it is possible currently to use longdesc to refer to any URI. I am
not sure if you can have multiple longdescs for a single element, but using
Xlink would allow that.

  Hi Folks,
  
  This use of audio files begins to move into the realm of the Synchronized
  Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL) This is a W3C recommendation. This
  is also the technique the DAISY Consortium (http://www.daisy.org) is using
  for development of Digital Talking Books.
  
   The .wav file is very large, but various compression techniques can reduce
  the size (mpeg, Realaudio) and these files could also be streamed.
  
  Best
