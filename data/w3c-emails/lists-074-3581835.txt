Yes, technically, the sound that is attached to the flag icon could be the
sonification of the image.  But this would be a triumph of technology over
communication.

In popular culture this image already has an associated sound.  The sound
for the image of a waving stars and stripes is that of Arthur Fiedler
conducting the Boston Pops in Sousa's "Stars and Stripes Forever" on the
Esplanade on the Fourth of July.

For inclusion of the reading-impaired, it is important to honor the
associations of sight, sound and text that already exist as cliches in the
lexicon of popular culture.
