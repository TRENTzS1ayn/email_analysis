Of course you are right.  The expanding possibilities are more important
that one arguable example.  I was impressed with the ability of first-time
users to grasp simple shapes from their vOICe sonification when we played
with this at CSUN.

I wonder if there aren't also exciting, world-expanding possibilities to be
explored for communication between people with different disabilities if a
lexicographer were to catalog the multimedia cliches that are widely
recognized today and hence already work as code because the cross-medium
associations are present and consistent for many people.
