Thank you, Al. I agree that using existing associations is a good
and attractive idea. I suppose that perhaps most US citizens would 
indeed have the association of the US flag with the particular piece
of music that you mentioned, but in the rest of the world this may 
already be different. Still, maybe my example was not a very good 
one to make a point about generality. I sincerely sympathize with 
using intuitive associations wherever possible, but I think it will
be very hard to always find associations that are culturally neutral
and unambiguous. Associations are known to work quite well with 
limited image sets, such as the relatively small number of windows
controls and event types in a computer GUI, but for arbitrary images
I expect the scheme to break down for lack of suitable "multimedia 
cliches" in the envisioned lexicographer's catalog.

This is why the attempt arose to define a completely general and
unambiguous image sonification, being semantically neutral and
amenable to automatic processing. Still, I admit it has its own 
share of disadvantages, particularly the interpretation burden on
the user. Learning a new language is never easy, so it had better
be a really powerful language to justify all the effort involved.
Lots of open issues in this area.

Partly just for fun, but the US flag image turned 90 degrees to 
the right sounds like (download the 88K .wav or the 16K MP3)

   http://www.seeingwithsound.com/extra/usflag90.wav
   http://www.seeingwithsound.com/extra/usflag90.mp3

The stripes that now run vertically sound as noise bursts, and the
stars are now in the upper right (high-pitched on the right). With
another 90 degree rotation to the right, the stars would end up in
the lower right (low-pitched on the right), and the stripes would
sound like tone bands again, because they run horizontally again. 
I wonder what the lexicographer would find, or what Sousa's "Stars
and Stripes Forever" would sound like when turned 90 degrees to the
right? And when turned another 90 degrees?

Best wishes,
