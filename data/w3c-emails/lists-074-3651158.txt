Actually the case of a national flag is relatively easy. The national
anthem of
each country is not only an associated sound within popular culture, it is a
government-approved audio sign, a sonic icon equivalent of the flag. So an
abbreviated version (a few notes maximum) should serve this purpose as well as
anything. Even here, though, it wouldn't be easy to master the associations
for
200 or so countries. Still, this wouldn't be that much different from learning
the flags visually, I wouldn't think. Text giving the name of the country
still
necessary to solidify the association.

These sonified images are certainly a strange experience for me (no vision
since 1.5 years of age). Conceptually I would say it is like learning to read,
learning that lines (or dots) on paper really can be associated with verbal
sound.

Another disadvantage of using natural sound, however, is that short sound
clips
(& they would have to be short to be used efficiently) can be easily confused.
To take a stupid example: a few crackles could be rain falling or bacon
frying.
... As for the Windows sound schemes, I can still only tell what half the
sounds are meant to be by looking at the filenames! :-)

Very interesting & fun topic,

Patrick
