The HCIBib site should be a gold mine for both researchers & general
information seekers. It puts accessibility (to the Web & otherwise) into a
broader context without demoting it to a footnote (there are 78 access-related
links, mostly to our favorite resources from what I have checked so far).

Additionally, they include an indicator of the number of sublinks contained in
each category on the home page. This gives a quick overview of the site,
similar to the way audio browsers handle tables. They are doing this by hand.
It would be great if something like this could be built in to the HTML or XML
or browser.

>Killer Usability Resource! The HCI Bibliography

>I recently had a few email interactions with Gary
>Perlman, the Director of the Human-Computer Interaction
>Bibliography. The HCI Bibliography is an excellent
>resource for HCI professionals, and other folks
>interested in human factors and usability issues. If
>you want pointers to real research, data, and scientific
>publications, this is your place. There are also links
>to articles and columns, such as Moving WebWord. There's
>not much reason for me to say any more since Gary does a
>fine job telling us what it is all about in an interview
>I conducted with him.
