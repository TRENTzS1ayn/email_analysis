Hello everyone:

I work for a national funding initiative, Open Studio: The Arts Online. We
provide awards to nonprofits to help them establish Internet and Web
training programs for artists and arts organizations across the U.S. 

We recently launched an online magazine, Digital Canvas, in which we
discuss topics of interest to our training sites and members of the
nonprofit arts community. Our current issue is dedicated to accessibility
and the Web. If you'd like to take a look, please go to:
http://www.openstudio.org/newsletter1601/newsletter.htm . Please note that
each section of the Feature article ("Building an Accessible World Wide
Web") is accompanied by a separate page of Related Links.

We welcome your comments and suggestions.  

Thanks,
Denise Koschmann
Project Associate
