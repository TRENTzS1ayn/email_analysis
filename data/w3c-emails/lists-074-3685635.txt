FYI, the "title" header of that page is hidden from me.  Lynx reads
it as:

   Welcome to the Digital Canvas, Open Studio's online magazine. In its
   pages we will respond to issues raised in our online forums and publish
   news from our community of training sites. So be sure to join in and
   let us know how we can use this tool to better serve your needs.

I'm not sure what an inline partnership is.

Will read the content now -- the formatting just struck me as hard
to understand.
