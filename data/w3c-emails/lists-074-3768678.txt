Bruce,

I'm glad someone is reading the FAQ!
http://www.w3.org/1999/05/WCAG-REC-fact  Thank you for the feedback. 

Would be nice to have research on this, but the statement in the FAQ was
based on a long history of anecdotal comments on this from many people
working in the field, rather than research. As an example from my
experience, I'd reviewed several US federal agency sites whose text-only
sites were unusable -- a brief series of outdated one-word links, which
were supposed to be equivalent to detailed blurbs on bit-mapped links on
the "real" home page, and which led right back to... very inaccessible
lower-level pages in the site.

I just checked back on those sites, they're cleaned up now, and so wouldn't
be good "bad" examples.

I get a lot of press queries about how "the additional burden of
maintaining text-only sites is a reason why accessibility is too much of
burden"... as well as confusion that text-only sites, or generally dull and
boring sites, are what we are advocating for; so this seems important to
clear up.

On your last question, whether the position that "text-only isn't
necessarily accessible" is well documented, hmmm, not sure that it is. We
are collecting additional questions for future FAQ's; this might be good to
expand on.
