Incidentally, this does _not_ have a text caption or transcript
attached to it.  Ttalk (the host streaming audio company) is
still working out the transcription issue.  Not that I'd do it
myself, but just as a discussion piece:  Do you feel that in
such a case, there's a responsibility of the guest (me) to 
provide a transcript if I want to link to it from the AWARE
Center site, or is that up to the publisher/broadcaster?
