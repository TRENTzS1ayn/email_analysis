The HTML Writers Guild recently purchased an iMac as one
part of our under-construction Assistive Web Technology
Laboratory.  As none of us have mac experience :), it would
be much appreciated if you could get me some recommendations
as to what kind of software is out there to allow people
with disabilities to use a mac and access the World Wide
Web.  Thanks in advance.
