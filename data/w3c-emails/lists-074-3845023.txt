The  Yale C/AIM Web Style Guide is a popular online resource (which inspired
a book) which provides advice on the design of website.  It's available at:
http://info.med.yale.edu/caim/manual/

It's just been pointed out on a list I subscribe to that the home page
contains 3 lines of text:

    Yale C/AIM Web Style Guide
    This page requires a browser that supports JavaScript.

    Click to continue.

I can spot problems with two of those lines (all three if I was a purist).

As this is a popular resource for people wishing to find out about web
design, I think it would be useful if accessibility issues were brought to
their attention.  Would someone over in the US, possibly someone with
contacts with the group, like to get in touch with them.

I used their search box and found one reference to accessibility, at:

http://info.med.yale.edu/caim/manual/papers/gui1.html
and this was not relevant.

There were no results for the search terms "validation".

Thanks

Brian
