One of the best lists of Macintosh stuff is this "toolkit" from trace at
URL:
http://www.tracecenter.org/world/computer_access/mac/
Among other resources, it includes links to Apple's "disabilities solution
group" and an annotated list of the best adaptive shareware.  This resource
is a little dated, but it is still very, very good.
