I agree that a text-only representation of a web site shouldn't be
automatically dismissed.  A paper at last year's WWW conference gave an
example of providing a text-only version of resources which are intended to
be indexed by robots.

Maintenance is an issue, but if this is done on-the-fly or by backend batch
processing (rather than manually - which we know is unlikely to be
maintained) this shouldn't be a major problem.

Architecturally it's a bit of a fudge, but it may be a useful pragmatic
solution.

BTW is accessibility for robot software covered by the User-agent
guidelines?
