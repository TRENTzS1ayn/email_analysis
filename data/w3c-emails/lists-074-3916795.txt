How do you design specifically _for_ people with disabilities,
and why would you design your other pages otherwise?

The cornerstones of the web are interoperability and platform
independence; why would you want to waste so much time designing
_for_ anyone in particular?  Design for everyone, to the standards
(including WCAG), and everyone can use your one site, not just
"people with disabilities".  (Especially not all people with
disabilities are the same!)
