The HTML Writers Guild is once more presenting its online
class, "Designing for Universal Accessibility with HTML 4.0."
Taught through a threaded web-based system, the class covers
topics of web users with disabilities, browser-independent
design, the newest and latest high tech web toys, and more.
Through application of the W3C's Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines and HTML 4.0/CSS, you can create web sites that
can be used by anyone.

The instructor for the course is Kynn Bartlett, HWG President
and Director of the Guild's Accessible Web Authoring Resources
and Education (AWARE) Center.

The course begins on May 31 and runs for six weeks.  Tuition
fees are $50 for HWG Trial members, and $25 for HWG Full
members.  (Trial membership is free, and Full membership is
only $40 per year; all figures in US dollars.)
