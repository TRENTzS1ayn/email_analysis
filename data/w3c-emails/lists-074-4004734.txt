Dear Jeff,

I am, understandably, following this thread closely.  You raise valid
points in this post and the one earlier.  I am sorry to say that I don't
follow what you mean by that "the argument _against_ having a text-only
version is merely furthering my point".  To which point were you referring?

Do you have the luxury, as is the case with Microsoft, to generate ALL your
pages dynamically?  If not, could you describe what policies/procedures you
will be putting in place to ensure that your "non-graphical" [Is this a
better term than "text-only"] pages will be kept up to date?

Kynn (and others) will argue that HTML is not that hard -- and that
accessible HTML is hardly more difficult to learn (nor to teach) than
inaccessible HTML.  It really just involves a paradigm shift to realize
that the Web is NOT a print medium (it's an information medium).  Of
course, these gestalt changes are very difficult for some folks.

The real challenge is with people who, for whatever reason, are not willing
to learn HTML.  Creating WCAG 1.0 compliant pages with Microsoft or
Netscape (or Corel, or just about anybody else's) products IS (currently)
difficult (or even just not possible).

I would argue (and I think others on this list would agree) that by the
time a web author is learning tricks like hand-coding "spacer" GIFs s/he
can handle writing accessible HTML!

P.S.  I looked at the source code you cited.  It seems to me that the
author is using pixel.gif as a kind of <HR> and not as spacer per se.
Also, take a look at URL:
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TECHS-19990505/#spacer-images
Which is exactly on target with your "Question #2".
