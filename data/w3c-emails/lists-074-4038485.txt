Thanks for all of your comments, everyone.  I hope I didn't come off
sounding like a prick.  It's exciting when you realize the potential for
such a better WWW in light of correct and proper coding.  I will now
reveal my true identity (I'm BATMAN!), and company Web site.  I didn't
want you all to just scoff at me and my silly comments by looking at my
poorly put-together site.  I'm working on a complete revamp right now,
and I will continue to monitor and use THIS resource as a starting point
on all my questions.

Another question, then: Is anyone actually using XML/XSL?  It looks so
cool and yet I haven't seen much widespread use.

---- WE INTERRUPT THIS MESSAGE TO BRING YOU THE TRUE IDENTITY OF A
CERTAIN E-MAIL AUTHOR...

You may all still scoff at me (for I am a mere 19 years old), but I am
the Web Developer for Centaurian Systems in Michigan. The initial Web
site I designed for our company failed the Bobby test miserably.  So
please don't email me saying the site sucks, because I already know :).

---- WE NOW RETURN YOU TO THE EPIC E-MAIL: "Accessibility is hard! Let's
perform brain surgery!"

Thanks again, everybody!
