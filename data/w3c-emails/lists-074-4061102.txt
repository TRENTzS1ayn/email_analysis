Jeff,

Scoffing at people who are trying to do the right thing is not a feature of
this list, which is nice.

With regards to XML/XSL so far as I know people are using it internally =and
generating HTML to send over the web. I use amaya which allows me to save
as XHTML - HTML written in XML, and allows for MathML to be included. SVG is
XML (a graphics format that can be written in a text editor!) and early
implementations have been demonstrated at WWW8 last week. There are browsers
such as indelv wich allow XML/XSL to be used. But I don't know of any
widespread shipping of XML/XSL to the general public yet. (I may just be
ignorant though.)

cheers

Charles

  Thanks for all of your comments, everyone.  I hope I didn't come off
  sounding like a prick.  It's exciting when you realize the potential for
  such a better WWW in light of correct and proper coding.  I will now
  reveal my true identity (I'm BATMAN!), and company Web site.  I didn't
  want you all to just scoff at me and my silly comments by looking at my
  poorly put-together site.  I'm working on a complete revamp right now,
  and I will continue to monitor and use THIS resource as a starting point
  on all my questions.
  
  Another question, then: Is anyone actually using XML/XSL?  It looks so
  cool and yet I haven't seen much widespread use.

  You may all still scoff at me (for I am a mere 19 years old), but I am
  the Web Developer for Centaurian Systems in Michigan. The initial Web
  site I designed for our company failed the Bobby test miserably.  So
  please don't email me saying the site sucks, because I already know :).

  Thanks again, everybody!
