That's one point, yes.

It's another issue, too.  I (and others) maintain that properly
done HTML means accessible HTML, and that means no need for a
text-only copy.

Three words:  "Separate. But. Equal."  You will people who very
strongly consider the idea of "ghettoization" of the disabled to
be a worse sin than inaccessible pages.  While I am not quite so
dogmatic about this, I can certainly see the point and I think
there is an implicit assumption that "disabled folks cannot use
the web as well as others can, therefore we need to make special
accomodations for them" and that is insulting when in reality,
NO SPECIAL ACCOMODATIONS ARE NEEDED, JUST PROPER APPLICATION OF
HTML IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES.

Sorry for raising my voice.
