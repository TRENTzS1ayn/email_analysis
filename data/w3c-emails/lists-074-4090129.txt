Members of the list may be interested to know that my paper "The Growing
Digital Divide in Access for People with Disabilities:  Overcoming Barriers
to Participation" is now posted at http://mitpress.mit.edu/ude.html. This
paper was commissioned by the National Science Foundation in connection with
the first US conference on the impact of the digital economy convened by
President Clinton: "Understanding the Digital Economy:  Data, Tools and
Research"  http://www.ecommerce.gov 

The paper is heavily hyperlinked to resources and includes discussion on the
W3C WAI effort as a player in removing barriers to participation.  It will
be presented on the opening day of the conference and will be further
discussed in a breakout session on the second day.  Let me express my thanks
to all of you for your participation in the accessibility effort.  Together,
we truly can make a difference!
