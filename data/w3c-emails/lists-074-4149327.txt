In this case we need to show them that graphically robust,
highly interactive, bleeding edge sites can be made accessible
to them just as easily -- or easier! -- as text-only sites.

This relies on "converting" the high end design folks to the
cause -- infecting them with the accessible web authoring
meme.  That can be tricky because most of them have heard the
myths alluded to in http://www.kynn.com/+myths -- so we need
to educate them, and then we can show the doubters in the
disabled community that we _can_ make sites usable by everyone,
and they don't have to be the second-class citizens of the
web, entering through the plain, unmarked door at the side of
the store.
