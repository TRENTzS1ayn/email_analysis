Hi. I just submitted my trial membership to hwg. Great work guys!
The form for submitting the application didn't seem to be labeled properly. 
Many of the fields had descriptive text which wasn't read when the field 
was tabbed to. Some fields when tabbed to read the label for the last field 
while that field read no label. I didn't look at the source so I'm not sure 
of the problem. Please check it out.
Thanks in advance.

Rich
