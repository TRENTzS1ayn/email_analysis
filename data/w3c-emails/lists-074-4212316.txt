[I send too much to this list, don't I?  Anyway, if you're in
Southern California and want to look at our toys and grab some
munchies, lemme know!]

The HTML Writers Guild's Accessible Web Authoring Resources and
Education (AWARE) Center is pleased to announce the grand opening
of the Guild's new Assistive Web Technology Laboratory on June
8, 1999 at 4:00 p.m.

The AWTLab is located at the Guild's Orange County offices at
Fullerton, California and features examples of computer technology
used by web surfers with disabilities to access the World Wide
Web.  The AWTLab is a resource for all Guild members wishing to
learn more about the need for accessible web design and for
testing their pages with a wide variety of unusual access methods.

Refreshments will be provided at the ribbon cutting ceremony on
Tuesday the 9th, which is organized in conjunction with Idyll
Mountain Internet and the Fullerton Chamber of Commerce.  Guild
members and the press are invited; please RSVP to aware@hwg.org
or by calling (714) 526-4963.  Demonstrations of assistive web
technology will be showcased, and members of the Internet and
business community will be able to test if their own web sites
are disability-friendly.
