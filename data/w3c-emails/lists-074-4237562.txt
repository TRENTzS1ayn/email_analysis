If you are generating your pages dynamically, then you need to consider the
performance hit to your servers.  If you get that darn unexpected spike,
then your CPU may go into saturation.  There are programs or tags that will
convert your page to cache the first time or second time it is servered.

Any solution needs to look at capacity planning and involve the network and
server folks.
