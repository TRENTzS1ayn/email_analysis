An HTML version of Cynthia Waddell's paper is available on
the HTML Writers Guild's AWARE Center web site, at:

     http://aware.hwg.org/contrib/waddell-ecommerce.html

The version posted at MIT Press is in RTF; this version was
autogenerated using rtf2html but some of the formatting and/or
links may have gotten lost in the translation process.

Thanks to Cynthia for making this available and allowing AWARE
to repost it!
