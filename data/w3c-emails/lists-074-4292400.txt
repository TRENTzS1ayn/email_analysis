Starting nowish, the HWG's AWARE Center is going to be tracking
coverage in the news media (online and offline) of web accessibility
issues.  Our new page with this information includes a summary
of the recent "508 misinformation scare", and is located at:

     http://aware.hwg.org/media/

If you have URLs of new/recent news stories relating to web
accessibility, and they haven't been mentioned on the IG group,
please send them to me at aware@hwg.org, thanks!
