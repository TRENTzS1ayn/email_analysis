Does anyone out there have any JFW scripts which work with Amaya. I want to 
test this tool, especially in regards to making style sheets and wysiwyg 
authoring in general. Any other help / advice appreciated.

Because that's just what pwWebSpeak chooses to do (and it's a
legitimate thing for a web browser to do, really; you're not
guaranteed that ANY information in your HTML will or won't be
hidden from any user).

I _believe_ (although I haven't played with it) that either you
can configure this through WebSpeak's style sheets, or else you
will be able to do so soon.  I'll check out my copy of pwWebSpeak
and get back to you on this.
