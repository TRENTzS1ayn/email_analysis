Are any of you out there using WebSpeak? If so, have you had problems 
rebinding keys? I just installed the thing last week and cannot get the 
most simple remapping to work. I find their choice of bindings very hard to 
remember. Any other comments/gatyas/bugs greatly appreciated.

Because that's just what pwWebSpeak chooses to do (and it's a
legitimate thing for a web browser to do, really; you're not
guaranteed that ANY information in your HTML will or won't be
hidden from any user).

I _believe_ (although I haven't played with it) that either you
can configure this through WebSpeak's style sheets, or else you
will be able to do so soon.  I'll check out my copy of pwWebSpeak
and get back to you on this.
