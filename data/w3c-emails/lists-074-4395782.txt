Hi,

Please see the Creative Adaptations for Learning (CAL) Web site at:

http://www.cal-s.org . 

CAL is a non-profit organization that makes tactile (embossed) illustrations for people with visual or other disabilities, that are used by children, parents, teachers,
therapists and caregivers. These illustrations are interactive and can be used for simple games. There are also an interactive workbook and notecards.

Would you be able to offer CAL free hosting, with the same conditions and features we've talked about?
