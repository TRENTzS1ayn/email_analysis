Are there interactive games for the blind online?
Connect 4, tictactoe, racing car games?
Others?
Could you please send me a link to a good list?

It occurred to me that the blind might enjoy an aural drive/walkthru. The
links would need a spatial relation and that is well outside my immediate
experience(tone deaf), so I left it.
