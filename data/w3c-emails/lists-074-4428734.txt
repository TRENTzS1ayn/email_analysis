My name is Patrick Roth, Ph.D. student on Computer Science and for my
research I'm doing visual game adaptation for blind.
Sofar, I adapted the memory game (or concentration game) and my next game
will be the " tic tac toe". For more informations, you can mail me, I will be
enjoy to give more informations about it.

Patrick.
