Not gone, just labeled differently. The font adjustment is found via: View -> Text Size
If you do not have the font button available via the Standard Button bar you can add it via: View -> Tool Bars -> Customize

  Started using IE 5 and has anyone the ability to adjust fonts from the View menu is missing?  Did they move or remove it?
