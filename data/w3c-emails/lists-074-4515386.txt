I don't know that there are any issues which exclusively affect people with
disabilities, but the ones that are likely to be most pressing are being able
to keep up with the chat especially if there are a number of people there at
once, and the obvious question of the software being accessible - if it works
in HTMl it is probably as good as you will get without using IRC, which means
people need to install a piece of software (admittedly it is wideley
available and easy to install).

This question has arisen here before - it might be worth hunting through the
archives a bit - from memory it was earlier this year.

cheers
