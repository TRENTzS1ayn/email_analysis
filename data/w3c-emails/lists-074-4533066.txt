I'm looking forward to a discussion on this matter.  In the Food and
Drug Administration, we have used Acrobat to put material online in a
timely manner.  It takes much more time to put an HTML version.  HTML is
our preferred format, but due to limited staffing and huge workloads, we
use Acrobat as a first posting.  When we get the time, we use HTML.  For
smaller and less complicated documents, we use HTML from the start.

Can any of the screen readers read PDF docs?
