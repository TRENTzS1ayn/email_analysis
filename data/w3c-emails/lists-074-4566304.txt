Can anyone speak from experience about the difficulty of converting a
poorly-structure PDF document to one that is mostly accessible?

For example, if a PDF file is basically a series of text images (from, say,
a magazine article), and a (sighted) laborer is available to do the
after-the-fact transcription, how hard is it to create a new "accessible"
PDF file?  What tools are needed?  Does the new version of Acrobat change
any of this?

Thanks.
