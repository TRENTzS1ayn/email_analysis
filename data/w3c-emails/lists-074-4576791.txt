I can't speak from experience with the new acrobat, but generally by the time
you have to do transcription from an image you are usually better off feeding
the image to Optical Character Recognition software and then making HTML out
of the result.

  Can anyone speak from experience about the difficulty of converting a
  poorly-structure PDF document to one that is mostly accessible?
  
  For example, if a PDF file is basically a series of text images (from, say,
  a magazine article), and a (sighted) laborer is available to do the
  after-the-fact transcription, how hard is it to create a new "accessible"
  PDF file?  What tools are needed?  Does the new version of Acrobat change
  any of this?
  
  Thanks.
