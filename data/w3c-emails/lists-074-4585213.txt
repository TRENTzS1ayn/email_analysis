I agree with you on this point, and I can only hope that they will see the
light and standardize on HTML.  In the meantime I am currently fighting
with a university system which might buy into this "accessible PDF"
approach.  Do the current Acrobat tools facilitate this approach?  Even if
this way is more time/labor intensive, if the burden can be put on the
bureaucracy, it is less work for the student!

How does one feed PDF files to an OCR program (without printing them)?
