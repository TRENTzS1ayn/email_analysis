I don't know. I used to feed tiff files to the OCR stuff I used (I forget the
name, but it was shareware and read about a dozen languages. It was on a
windows machine. I used a commercial piece of software on the mac, with about
the same results but not as many languages). For PDF I used to print and scan
(I didn't use a lot of PDF, so it wasn't a big issue. Most of the systems I
was working on didn't have acrobat, so I just wrote to the authors and asked
for HTML. It was horrible HTML I usually got back, but it could be fixed up.)

  this way is more time/labor intensive, if the burden can be put on the
  bureaucracy, it is less work for the student!
  
  How does one feed PDF files to an OCR program (without printing them)?
