Hi Al
   Thanks for the comments.  I included the DMU (De Montford University!)
example as an illustration of use of a "gratuitous javascript link" (which
performs a "Back to previous page" function).
   I agree that if Javascript is switched off or not available this link
would not work, and thus undesirable.  However the link could be created
dynamically using Javascript, and thus only visible if JavaScript is
available.
   I thought it might be desirable to have a Back link *within* the page (as
opposed to part of the browser) - if, for example, the browser navigational
options are disabled, or to provide additional help for a naive user.  The
404 error message could be a good place to implement this as you often want
to go back.
   Any thoughts on this - I've no experience on how browsers other than IE,
NS, Opera, Lynx, Mosaic and Viola implement the Back button.

Thanks

Brian
