We have a problem with some documents we wrote in "Microsoft Publisher", a
program that makes formatted brochures etc.  We want to publish it on the
web.  But the HTML output is basically just one big image.  In other words,
all the text and graphics are combined into an image. 

(Actually, it's a bit more complicated.  There are several images. Also, it
happens with some documents but not others.  It seems to depend on exactly
where text is placed on the page relative to the images.  I can't give too
many details since it's being done by an outside contractor, not me: but I
have seen and verified the result: a bunch of images of text).

There is a text output, but it's just plain text, no HTML, and no images.
So it's not the universal HTML output we'd really like.

Finally, there's acrobat output but, besides the other problems with
Acrobat being discussed on this list, the files are huge.  For example one
of our newsletters translates to a 15 mbyte PDF file.  The text version is
only 18 kbytes and there are 5 images and some shaded bars .  So HTML would
probably be a fraction of a MB, much smaller, in addition to being
universally accessible.


Does someone know a way around this?  For example, another page formatting
program that imports Microsoft Publisher and exports better HTML?  Or some
setting in Publisher that guarantees that all text will translate to text,
not image?

Or is there some feature of Microsoft Publisher that we are not using that
would help?  Perhaps some update somewhere?
