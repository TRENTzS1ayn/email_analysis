Dear Group,

Please provide your expert opinion on this question.

Can (or should) the W3C validator be used as a mainstream test for basic
compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines?

If one authors a document that meets the following criteria:
1)  validates as HTML 4.0 (transitional or strict); and
2)  Does NOT include applets or scripts; and
3)  Does NOT include video or sounds or other multimedia (images are okay);

does that document, by definition, meet some level of compliance with WCAG?
