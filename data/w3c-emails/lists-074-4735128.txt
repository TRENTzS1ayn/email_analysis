I thought it might be good for someone here to pick up on this?

I am a radio producer who is doing a piece for the NPR program "On the
Media" about web accessibility for the blind.  So far I've interviewed
Gregory Rosmaita about the technical aspects and Steve Mendelsohn
about the
legal aspects.  I'm desperately looking for someone who will present
the
"other side" of the issue--someone who will complain about the burden
of
making web sites accessible to the blind.  The columnist William
Raspberry,
who wrote rather cynically about the Randy Tamez case in San
Francisco,
hasn't returned my call.  Does anyone have any other quick
suggestions? 
Thanks in advance.
