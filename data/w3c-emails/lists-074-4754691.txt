I would like to express my appreciation to the State of Washington for
posting a complete, accessible version of my paper, "The Growing Digital
Divide in Access for People with Disabilities:  Overcoming Barriers to
Participation" at http://www.aasa.dshs.wa.gov/access/waddell.htm  This paper
is heavily annotated with resources and hyperlinks that should be helpful
for understanding U.S. issues, law and policy impacting access to electronic
and information technology.

This paper was presented at the first national conference convened at the
request of President Clinton on the impact of the digital economy.  The
conference website is http://www.digitaleconomy.gov .
