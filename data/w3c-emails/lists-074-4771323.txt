The AWARE Center will link to this copy as well; the problem with
our HTML version is that none of our tools converted the _footnotes_
correctly, which contain lots of very valuable information.

For those of you who might do something similar in the future, the
solution is to use Office 2000 which _does_ preserve footnotes, as
opposed to Office 97 which strips them out when converting to HTML.

Rassa frassa broken software. :)
