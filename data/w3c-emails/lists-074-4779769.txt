"Requires" is little strong, since users have some control.
MSIE5 has in its "advanced" settings
something called "show friendly HTTP error messages". When this
feature is enabled (default) the minumum bytes requirement holds.
Otherwise it always shows the server's response.

Opera has a similar feature but it has three modes: Always show
the server's response, never show the server's response, and show
the server's response when appropriate (default). The latter has
a minimum bytes requirement (I think around 1024).
