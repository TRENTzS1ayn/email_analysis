For your information, the hyperlinks of 1, 2, 3, 4 etc. are to the endnotes
cited in the body of the paper.  My paper, "The Growing Digital Divide in
Access for People with Disabilities:  Overcoming Barriers to Participation,"
is heavily annotated with 102 endnotes.  These endnotes are similar to
footnotes and contain the references, resources and relevant hyperlinks for
ready access to information supporting my statements in the body of the
paper.

I find this quite good for content and it will be valuable in the
efforts of stake holders to progress toward a universal solution
environment.  I also find that it points up the disconsonant issues of
converting print to web.  For some reason, it took me a long time to
download this document to my web browser.  also, as I tab from link to
link, I hear things like 1 2 3 4 ...
I am certain that this is a direct result of "conversion.  I suppose
as Kim Stated in an earlier message that windows front page 2,000 was
used for this but care should have been taken in the labeling of the
links in order to provide us with something more explicit.  This is no
reflection on synthia in my book, only a passing reference to what is
a deffinite devide between print and web.
