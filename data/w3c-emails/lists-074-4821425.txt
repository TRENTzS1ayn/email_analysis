Dear Kynn (et al.),

My point with posting this idea is to point out that:  If authors are
already creating straightforward pages, and they take the time to validate
(and they are not putting in stupid ALT tags -- no way to automatically
test for that) that they ARE creating accessible pages.

I did not want to suggest that <stuff> should be avoided or to suggest any
alternative "requirements" for accessibility.  The criteria was for
determining if a page could use this simple test, not a criteria for
accessibility.  This distinction might be too subtle and, as Kynn points
out, dangerous because it could easily lead to the mistaken belief that "if
you want a cool page, it can't possibly be accessible!"
