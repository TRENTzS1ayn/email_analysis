Your only sin is talking about something that is uncomfortable, like the
kid who outed the emperor's new clothes.

Don't diss the script writers.  I hear consistently from independent
sources that the Netscape dialect of JavaScript is much better for these
purposes.

The problem is that we laid this one between the lines.  This does not
violate the WCAG, per se.  It violates the whole point of the WCAG, which
is technical checks which will ensure that you don't need to standardize
the client.

The explicit WCAG violations are at a lower level; such as all those pages
that don't work with scripts turned off.  That is a clear chapter and verse
violation.

However, this is not the argument that your UberBoss needs to hear.  He
needs to understand the actual problem.  The actual problem is that for the
blind user, the browser is not the user interface, the screen reader is.
And while WIMP browsers are interchangeable with minor annoyance, screen
readers are a whole different kettle of fish.  Learning the screen reader
User Interface is a major cognitive investment and it doesn't work if you
can't do it by heart.  You can't just slide over to the screen reader that
happens to work with browser X and keep working.  That is why it is
essential for this class of disabled users that the content be standardized
in a client-neutral way at the browser input.  

We never laid that out in detail because as the W3C it is indelicate for us
to name names of products of members.  And to talk about the lack of
mix-and-match at the browser-screen-reader interface one would have to name
names of browser products from W3C members.  So the browser-neutral
principle is in the assumptions, not the letter, of the WCAG.
