Hi Bruce,

We develop, maintain, and instruct several accredited online courses at
the University of New Brunswick.  The courses are accessible with lynx and
should be with pwWebSpeak. However, they are password protected.  If you
would like temporary access email me personally and I will set you up with
an account to view them.
