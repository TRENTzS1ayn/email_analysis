>Education (AWARE) Center is pleased to announce the grand opening 
>of the Guild's new Assistive Web Technology Laboratory on June 
>8, 1999 at 4:00 p.m. PDT.

>The AWTLab is located at the Guild's Orange County offices at 
>Idyll Mountain Internet in Fullerton, California and features
>examples of computer technology used by web surfers with
>disabilities to access the World Wide Web.
>
>The AWARE Center's AWTLab is a resource for web designers
>wishing to learn more about the need for accessible web design
>and for testing their pages with a wide variety of unusual
>access methods, such as computers that read web pages aloud.
>
>"Without careful planning many web sites may be unusable by
>people with disabilities, cutting them off from participating
>in online communication and electronic commerce," noted Kynn
>Bartlett, President of the HTML Writers Guild and Director
>of the AWARE Center.  "Some web site owners may not even be
>aware that their sites shut out disabled web surfers."
>
>Demonstrations of assistive web technology will be showcased
>at the grand opening, and members of the community will be
>able to test their own web sites to see if they are
>disability-friendly.
>
>Refreshments will be provided at the ribbon cutting ceremony on 
>Tuesday the 8th, which is organized in conjunction with Idyll 
>Mountain Internet and the Fullerton Chamber of Commerce.  The 
>general public is invited; if you plan to attend, please RSVP
>to aware@hwg.org or by calling (714) 526-4963.
