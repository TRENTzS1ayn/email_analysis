Members will be aware that by far the majority of the w3c site is text
based. For non readers with cognitive disability, it comes close to being a
paradigm or inaccessability. I wish to draw  the attention of all of you to
this deficit.
The code for a(ny) site is textual and essential, however if we all had to
read and understand this before visiting a site, no one would bother.

Could we please try to demonstrate by example before explaining the method.
This system has a very ancient precedent QED. quad erat demonstrandum, or
what was to be shown.

Two examples of the problems that will occur presently,

1    Recently there was a request for information on colour, to attempt to
define
this with words is derisable. It is difficult enough to penetrate the
methods used by experts.

2    I have been asked offline to help identify games sites that are w3c
accessible. I consider this to be virtually impossible, however without
specific examples it is nonsense.

first demonstrate what you wish then explain.
W3C desperately needs to simplify its goals and practice what it is
preaching.
