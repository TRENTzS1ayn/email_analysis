After listening to this topic for a while I finally tried visiting the web
site (peepo). And now I am really confused! I have no idea what the site is
about after a lot of 'looking around' I know there are a lot of
 LINK-IMAGE and CLICK HERE but I have no idea what any of it does.
Perhaps I am really being thick, but wouldn't the use of a screen reader
help non-readers?  Why doesn't a site like this have useful tags and links?
