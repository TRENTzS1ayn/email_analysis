I saw this site a couple of months ago after receiving an initial notice
about it. I believe the designer is trying to demonstrate the use of visual
concepts more easily understood by individuals with cognitive disabilities
(exactly which cognitive disabilties, I do not know) as a means for
conveying web site links and tasks.

I won't pretend that it's easy to understand, but I have observed
demonstrations of children who learn vocabulary through images and graphics
where they could not learn via textual renditions or some other concept.

I assume that the designer is an expert in cognitive recognition and
science.
