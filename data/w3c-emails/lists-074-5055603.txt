The purpose of my letter was not as I said to plug www.peepo.com.

WAI and W3C sites are very text based, indeed I cannot state where I have
seen a graphic used.

When discussing colour, illiteracy or visual games, and accessibility it is
not
helpful to start from this base.

People who are illiterate with cognitive disability have every right to
access the www. In my experience many of our students are more knowledgeable
than most in their chosen fields of interest.

Accessing further information on the www is more than a little difficult at
present.

Any job is a fine dream for most of them,
much as it might have been for many blind people a century ago.

Our site www.peepo.com is a drive thru.
When you see a link of interest, click on it.
Move the mouse to slow down.
It is a graphical aid to browsing the www.
