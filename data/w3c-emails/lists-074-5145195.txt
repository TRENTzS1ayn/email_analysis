That's very noble, and so is voting on the gender of the class
hamster.

But requiring the impossible is impossible, and mandating the
difficult is difficult.  We can (and should) work to understand how to
accomodate those with learning disabilities or cognitive disorders on
the Web, but until we have that understanding, we can't implement
them.

I think there *is* a difference between getting information into
someone's brain, and getting it in a form that the brain can process.
They are both worthwhile goals, but they are different problems with
different solutions.  I think it would probably be better for
everyone, especially those most directly affected, to charter another
group (whether a full WG or a subcommittee) to work on ... hmm.  We
need a name for it; comprehensibility vs. accessibility?  Something,
anyway.
