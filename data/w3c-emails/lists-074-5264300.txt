Anne, please do not equate the formation of a dedicated subgroup to address
techniques to remove cognitive barriers with shunting aside your clients.

One should expect that the seamlessness of the mainstreaming of this or
that exceptional subpopulation can be increased by increasing the depth of
understanding that is brought to bear on designing the accomodations.

The role of cognitive function in the use of the Web and the possible
strategies for working around specific cognitive exceptionalities is
something which, if anyone understands it, there aren't many.  [Gross
reading level excepted.  There are mass market tools out there today whose
systematic use would definitely reduce the incidence of gratuitous barriers
in this sense.]

We need an agent with some cognitive agility (ability to change what they
understand) to tackle this problem.  While the group should contain good
representation from the stakeholders experiencing the problem, smallness in
itself is a virtue once the basic background-diversity requirements have
been met.

A small group focused on one issue can deepen their shared understanding
faster than a large group can.  This is the basic "tiger team" rationale,
perhaps in this case it fits.
