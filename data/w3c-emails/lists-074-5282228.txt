How much information will be lost, or is that kind of loss
acceptable?  Will people in Djakarta recognize where this
is taking place, what's happening, when it happened, who
the board of education is, and who the U.S. Supreme Court
are?

There are a number of subtleties lost here -- who put the
"not" symbol in place, and why?  What is the constitution
and how does it apply in this case?

What you have presented is the equivalent of watching Schoolhouse
Rock with the sound turned off [deliberate cultural reference]
but I am not convinced that it conveys the same message as an
article describing the decision without a HUGE amount of signal
lossage.  But are you saying that we really do need to dumb
everything down in order to communicate with these people?
