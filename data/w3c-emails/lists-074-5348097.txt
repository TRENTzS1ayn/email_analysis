"I don't think I have at all -- his assertion, as I read it, is that the W3C
site should explain WAI theory, how to produce CSS, and all it's other
information in so simple a manner that one not need to be able to
understand the language -- or to start at such a remedial level that it
teaches someone how to read along the way."

Demonstrate by example is what I asked for.

One posits that the sum of the angles of a triangle = 180 degrees before
prooving it.
W3C appears to like to work the other way.
Naturally I expect W3C to provide one site that is accessible and relevant
to children.
