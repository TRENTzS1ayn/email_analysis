This is not a sentence.  I am having problems understanding you
due to lack of correct English use on your behalf.  I am not
sure what obligation I have to understand you when you are not
easily understood by _me_.

Can you please provide _your_ documentation on how to make a web
site more accessible to people with disabilities?  I am getting
pretty frustrated at lack of direct information; this may be all 
a subtle attempt to show what it's like to be cognitively disabled
or something, but I would prefer some direct, cooperative examples
that I can learn from and use, rather than these repeated
accusations and demands.
