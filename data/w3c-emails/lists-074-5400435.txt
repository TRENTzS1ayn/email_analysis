I am having a comprehension disability at the moment because I
can't make heads or tails out of what you are trying to communicate

Why?  Not all sites _should_ be written to be accessible and
relevant to children.  You are making an unreasonable demand
here, and since that seems to be the sum of your response, it is
making it VERY hard to take the rest of your requests seriously,
which is a shame because this _is_ an issue that needs to be
addressed.
