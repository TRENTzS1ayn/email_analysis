Kelly,

Went to the site to see what graphics were included with the story and
found none. Not even a Packer's helmet or a football (the Packers is a
football team, isn't it?? I'm totally sports-phobic except for Winston Cup
auto racing) to clue the reader who or what the story is about. A quick
scan of the page indicates the story is a series of bits of financial data
all of which have standard graphic representations already (ask your
sighted friend to describe the information provided in charts on stock
market information pages). This whole article is a textualization of data
normally presented in numerical or graphical format, with an occasional
descriptive sentence or someone's words thrown in for color. The quotes
would be better handled as quotes, with a recording of the person speaking
or a video of same. Personally, I've no clue whether having the oldest
stadium in the league is good or bad ... and I lean towards preserving
historic sites, and against wasting tax money on new stadiums ... so I've
no idea how to make those parts of the article comprehensible. Perhaps a
'ball fan can help on that. 

But the financial data can be presented in graphs, line graphs, circle
graphs, whatever, with text limited to the titles, and the labels around
and on the graph/s. 

The readability of the article seems typical of most newspapers, somewhere
around 5/6th level. The statistical information is in two line paragraphs,
which increases readability. I would have no suggestions to reduce the
readability of the text, but I would recommending at least enough
graphics/multimedia for the reader to know what sport and team was being
discussed! (Curiously, I didn't find the sport mentioned in the text
either, but the full team name was given.) 

As to the www.peepo site, I've been to it several times, and discover more
each time I go. I have learned to remember some of the symbols for the
links I've followed, but I have to "work at" comprehending that site, as,
I'm sure, some people "work at" comprehending sites I find easy to use. I
agree it would be easier to use the site if the symbols were larger.
