anne, thank you.  I keep forgetting to publish on the list because my
reply default is to the sender the way the list is set up.  Tables are
for tabular datta according to the w3c.  does this help?  Microsoft is
often in error when it comes to the standards.  look at the use of
frames in front page for everything.  as for graphics, one of the
things  that the guidelines attempt to defer is the use of graphics
without meaningful information being made available to people who
cannot process them for what ever reason.  It is assumed and perhaps
rongly so that people are going to design graphics into their pages. 
I don't know what a meaningful graphic would be in the case of
describing a lengthy process for something say philosofical.  I know
there are charts and data flow instruments and much information can be
conveyed by images with short labels, but getting many of the verbal
constructs across with graphics seems out of reach to me.  I'd propose
this.

expand the scope to read something like:
"ensure that pages are as readable/processable as possible to
......and those with special processing needs.
guidelines:
1> illustrate pages with meaningful graphics and symbology. (this
should be done in such a way as to allow for comprehention of the page
without reading the text on the page by individuals who are totally
graphically oriented).
2> use multimedia whereever possible to either speak the text of a
page or sho a demonstration which in an animated way explains the text
on the pages. (this gets at those with limitations of atention, focus
and other types of cognative processing which may interfere with
visual processing).
Note:
Making pages comprehensible after all is what we really hope to
achieve.  providing these curbcuts and doing a good job of it may well
assist many of the rest of us as the medium and the environment evolve
to a more real time paradigm much the way tv is now or trafic flow.  I
see this as moving to a situation where we will get our information
entertainment, instructions and assistance all from one bag connected
permenantly and irrevocably to a network, we wil be exploring our
world more and more through this filter.  If in this process, we
should look away for a second, we don't want to miss something
critical.  This then that I propose will help to ensure less data
loss.
