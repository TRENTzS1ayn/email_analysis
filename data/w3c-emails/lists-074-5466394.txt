David,

This is wonderfully well said!!!

I also agree very much with your vision of the future of the Internet as
merging with the technology of TV and producing an end product that will
transcend even the best we can envision of the coming possibilities. As an
educator, I'm excited by the potential of the Internet to provide education
in an neverending array of possibilities. 

Regarding your assumptions (near the beginning of your note) about the
presumption that web authors would automatically include graphics: sadly,
it isn't happening on a lot of sites where it should be ... Your guidelines
above help make it clear that graphics and multi-media are a part of basic
good web design that is to reach the widest range of users. Thank you for
putting it together so well.

Anne
