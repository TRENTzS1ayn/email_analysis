I think that a number of things that may help have probably already been
mentioned; making better use of sound, video, pictures, the use of jargon
free and unambiguous language, clear and consistent layout...  The truth of
the matter as I see it is that different people are going to need different
things and nobody is ever going to come up with a perfect solution.  What
really needs to happen if for people who have learning difficulties to be
asked what helps.  With their involvement we stand a better chance of
getting at least some of it right for some people.
