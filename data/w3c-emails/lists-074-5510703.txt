Have a look at the Scalable Vector Graphics page for the latest news.

http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG

There is a Java program that renders SVG which is freely available, and I
think a program for converting some graphics to SVG. There is other software
that Adobe has shown people, but it isn't available yet.

If you like playing with text editors it is possible to write SVG in a text
editor. It will encourage you to re-use parts of graphics, which is a good
practice anyway.

(It isn't really my area of expertise, but it looks very promising for
accessibility)

cheers
