This is silly. 

Both the Mac and Windows interfaces use pretty little pictures to represent
programs and you click on them to make them work. 

There is nothing so inherently "hard" about Windows that could possibly
support "the best minds have not been able to figure out how to make it
otherwise!"   Platform zealousness doesn't have a place in reasonable
discussion about the issue at hand.
