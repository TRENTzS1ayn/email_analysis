Sorry for posting such a long trail of stuff, but I think it is worth reading
if you haven't yet.

A couple of points:

in the guidelines, 14.2 says "supplement text with graphic or auditory
presentations where they will facilitate comprehension of the page". But it
is priority 3 - something that may be done to improve accessibility.

Anne is suggesting that this is a priority 1 requirement - something that
must be done to remove an accessibility barrier. I will take this suggestion
to the guidelines working group.

In regards to tables, the use of them to do layout causes a number of
problems for general accessibility. (The use of Publisher causes some more
fundamental ones, like turning some text into images and therefore making it
inaccesible to screenreaders, some simple but common kinds of magnification,
text-highlighting software, etc.) The problems fall into two kinds - the fact
that current technology does not cope well with tables used to lay out text
(or anything else, but the use of them for data is less problematic), and the
fact that the use of tables for layout is a big factor blocking the use of
CSS for layout, and therefore making it much harder to get the other benefits
that wide use of CSS would bring. Table layout and CSS layout are more or
less incompatible, although a very good CSS engine and a bit of work would
mean that tables used for layout would work about as well as they do now. It
is also possible to rewrite layout tables into CSS.

  anne, thank you.  I keep forgetting to publish on the list because my
  reply default is to the sender the way the list is set up.  Tables are
  for tabular datta according to the w3c.  does this help?  Microsoft is
  often in error when it comes to the standards.  look at the use of
  frames in front page for everything.  as for graphics, one of the
  things  that the guidelines attempt to defer is the use of graphics
  without meaningful information being made available to people who
  cannot process them for what ever reason.  It is assumed and perhaps
  rongly so that people are going to design graphics into their pages. 
  I don't know what a meaningful graphic would be in the case of
  describing a lengthy process for something say philosofical.  I know
  there are charts and data flow instruments and much information can be
  conveyed by images with short labels, but getting many of the verbal
  constructs across with graphics seems out of reach to me.  I'd propose
  this.
  
  expand the scope to read something like:
  "ensure that pages are as readable/processable as possible to
  ......and those with special processing needs.
  guidelines:
  1> illustrate pages with meaningful graphics and symbology. (this
  should be done in such a way as to allow for comprehention of the page
  without reading the text on the page by individuals who are totally
  graphically oriented).
  2> use multimedia whereever possible to either speak the text of a
  page or sho a demonstration which in an animated way explains the text
  on the pages. (this gets at those with limitations of atention, focus
  and other types of cognative processing which may interfere with
  visual processing).
  Note:
  Making pages comprehensible after all is what we really hope to
  achieve.  providing these curbcuts and doing a good job of it may well
  assist many of the rest of us as the medium and the environment evolve
  to a more real time paradigm much the way tv is now or trafic flow.  I
  see this as moving to a situation where we will get our information
  entertainment, instructions and assistance all from one bag connected
  permenantly and irrevocably to a network, we wil be exploring our
  world more and more through this filter.  If in this process, we
  should look away for a second, we don't want to miss something
  critical.  This then that I propose will help to ensure less data
  loss.
