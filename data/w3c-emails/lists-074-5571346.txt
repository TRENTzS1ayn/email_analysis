Lovey, I think you have here summed up a current problem. I think it is one
of perception - the WAI certainly attempts to cater for both your children,
and for people with fine and gross motor impairments, and those with hearing
or vision disabilities, and others who experience difficulty in using the web
due to a disability.

I am hopeful that the work of the Education and Outreach Group will change
the perception that accessibility is only about access for blind people, or
deaf people, or any other single group of people, to a notion that
accessibility is about people being able to use the web, regardless of
disability.

The Interest Group plays an important role, in reviewing WAI activity, in
bringing issues to the notice of the various working groups, and in being a
forum where people with expertise in a variety of areas can discuss ideas.
This discussion has been a refreshing reminder of the value of that role.

  Many webmasters believe "designing for accessibility" refers only to people 
  with vision or hearing impairments (they do not even consider those with 
  gross or fine motor impairments)
  Yet, personally I think it would be easier/faster to click on an image of a 
  football than to have to read it or have it read to me. I am not an expert, 
  but the visual recognition seems to be processed faster than the written word.
  
  So I have a quandary. 
  My older child surfs through the internet with several windows open at a 
  lighting speed. My younger sons watches intently, but he cannot type in URL's 
  or keywords for search engines. 
  After so many years of work and reinforcement by my family, therapists and 
  educators telling my son "You CAN do it" how will I tell my "computer 
  literate" child he can't use the internet?
  He will try anyway, but "non-readers" that have higher cognitive abilities 
  know their rights and will demand them. (these could be people who have 
  suffered strokes or TBI's)
