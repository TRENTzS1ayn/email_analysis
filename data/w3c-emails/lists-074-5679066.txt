Seems to me what people are saying with regard to people with learning 
disabilities is that the content itself is what is hard to understand. 
Since I'm blind, I need to have content which is textual in nature. You can 
make a graphically rich site more accessible to me by labeling the graphics 
whith text. However, if you've got a complicated picture, such as a diagram 
of a complex integrated circuit or a painting by picaso, how can these 
images be made more understandable by me? You might say, "produce a 
raised-line drawing which I can feel," but maybe by their very nature these 
images are not understandable by me.
I see the Even a raised-line reproduction of a 3D image like a painting 
means nothing to me since I've been blind since birth and thus have no 
concept of perspective drawing.
WAI as a group whose goal is to help web users get the most out of the 
tools at their disposal. If their is something which these tools (the 
computer and its associated software etc) can do to massage content into a 
form more understandable to more users then this is good. If we are asking 
for this group to define rules/principles for content design which makes 
the content more understandable or usable (accessible), this may be outside 
of the WAI's goal.
Maybe not however! Can or should we make rules or guide lines having to do 
with content?
