I do not know this paper.

1    copyright releases on photos for responsible use, is essential.
The variety of needs makes one solution impractical at present.
Similiar needs could share production costs and news stories.

2    A clear picture with a good headline is great, provided it can be
reposted with suitable aids for a given group. These could be very personal,
might be iconic or could be a precis, picture story/animation, video, sound
file, music...

This is already done offline, the problem is it cannot be shared because of
(photo) copyright, and this is slowing development of critical mass.

One supplier of very popular icons used with special needs for many years in
the UK and worldwide is currently not happy to see them used except in a
very limited way online, mainly due to the loss of royalties. Sales of media
are an important income stream. Others have allowed limited or free use, of
icon sets.
