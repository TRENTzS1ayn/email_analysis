Anne, I disagree entirely.  I have an obligation, for example,
to make my information on the creation of web content
_accessible_ to everyone -- meaning that they can access the
content.  I don't have an obligation to make sure everyone
_understands_ it.

The AWARE Center website (http://aware.hwg.org/) would mean
nothing to my grandmother, or my mother, or my friend Dave,
or anyone else who doesn't create web pages.  They would look
at detailed explanations of web creation processes and shrug,
because it means nothing to them.

Likewise, someone living in Japan who doesn't speak a word of
English won't be able to understand my site either.

However, it is _accessible_ to them -- they can get at the
information as it was written -- just as the content is
accessible to someone with a visual disability, a motor
disability, or the like.  The information is _there_, and they
_can_ get to it.

Once I've done that, I've fulfilled my _obligation_ as a web
creator.

>Anything less, isn't "access", it's an approximation.

So if I can't understand, say, a phrase in French, then it is
the fault of the web creator for making an "inaccessible" page?
No, you are completely confusing "access" and "understanding"
here.

The main reason is that some programs used by people with disabilities
couldn't handle poorly done tables.  Well done tables can now be 
handled by recent software, although poorly done tables are a 
problem still, and there is plenty of old software out there.

The poorly done tables are a problem of the web designer, and affect
more than just the screenreader access; the old software is a software
programmer problem.

Was she able to access the information and it was just confusing,
or was it a case in which there was not information provided?  There
is a difference!

I get confused going to some websites too; however, I would not 
state this as a case of "access" but rather as a case of "understanding"
or "usability."  My father, who although retired has no physical or
mental disabilities, took a look at a site recently and couldn't
figure out how to download the program he wanted.  This is NOT a case
of "access" but of "understanding".

>A partially-sited person checked the site, found where

Well, that's all good and well, but I prefer that we not make sweeping
use of the term "accessibility" to mean "understanding" when they are
clearly different things.

Yes, web sites _should_ be "understandable" to a degree, but that
is not the same as labelling ALT text, creating tables that degrade
gracefully, captioning multimedia, and labeling form inputs.

Maybe we're speaking a different language here -- do _you_ create
web sites and do _you_ understand what specific technical factors I
speak of when I say that web authors should create "accessible"
web sites?
