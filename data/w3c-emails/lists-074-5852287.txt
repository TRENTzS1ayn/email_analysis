I think we all agree that such sites should be "accessible", we
are just differing on what is meant by that.  When you use it
above, what specifically are you thinking of?  Can you expand
on your meaning of the word "accessible"?  Such as "accessible
(understandable) to whom?"

When you start making judgment calls such as this is where you
venture into shaky ground -- I've heard many designers of highly
graphical web sites state that they don't have to make their
sites accessible to the blind, because the blind aren't their
target audience.  Before you can disqualify certain people from
"access" to a certain site, you need to be careful you're not
deciding _for them_.

It's a common misconception among even experienced professional
web designers that the "front page" of a site is the one through
which people will enter the web site.  However, it's not true;
due to the nature of the web, someone could be entering at nearly
any point on a web site, not just from the "top down."  Thus it
is important that all levels of a web site have at least minimal
functional accessibility.

There are also great benefits to people who are multilingual and
not reading in their native tongue, or to readers who are not 
even fluent in the language in question.

Do you believe that a site's "accessibility" (understandability)
should be dependent upon the intended audience, the actual audience,
or a theoretical "minimal standard" for the web, such as writing all
material for the WWW at a third grade (U.S. education system)
reading level?

Can you offer any advice to web authors that would help them
determine beforehand what comprehension level to aim for, or,
like you, will they need to continually assess their sites and
see if simplification/"dumbing down" of all content is
necessary?

Is it advisable to offer different versions of the same information,
at different reading levels?  E.g., here's one for 7th grade reading
level, here's one for 3rd?  (BTW, it occurs to me that this part
of the discussion might be opaque to those of you who are un-
familiar with the US education system.  When I was in grade N,
I was N+5 years old, if that helps for reference.)  If you chose
such a route, how would you label such levels without being
insulting?
