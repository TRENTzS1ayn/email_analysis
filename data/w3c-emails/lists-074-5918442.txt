I was trying to be a bit accommodating to those who are aghast at the idea
of providing accessibility to people they feel themselves better than.

Good point. Again, I was trying to minimize the aghastness!

Depends on the content. The actual audience should be the target, and some
information needs to comply with a "minimal standard" because the actual
audience is broad enough to include those who would need the 3rd grade level.

Again, it depends on content, but a pretty good "rule of thumb" would be to
aim for a 5/6th grade reading level for complex information and a 3/4th
grade level for basic necessary information (such as how to apply for an
SSI check or food stamps). Some book publishers stretch the limits by
including definitions, explanations, and pictures for words that go past
the limit. This is easy to do on the web, allowing the user to click on the
word for meaning either in text, or perhaps on a sound bite, would make it
possible to present a text with a higher reading level that can be used by
someone functioning on a lower level.

Kids don't usually understand such things as "reading levels", but they do
follow age levels. The hitch comes when a ten-year old needs material
written for an eight year old, and it worsens when a sixteen year old
discovers he/she can understand only the eight year old version. Perhaps
just "Easy" "Regular" and "Detailed" (with of course corresponding icons),
would work.  The idea of different versions is a very good one. Detailed
could be at an upper high school or college reading level with appropriate
maps and charts (minimum), and regular at 6-8th grade with moderate levels
of multi-media, with easy at about 2-3rd grade with maximum graphics, sound
bites, etc. [For non-US: grade = form. grade = age - five]. To accommodate
the range of needs, another level for Post Graduate may be necessary ...
I'm seeing the things I need to do to the Five Forks site on the next
update .... determine what level each page is at, and develop the other
levels ... hmmmm.... sounds like something I'd need to find a grant to
cover the development of ...  a lot of work ... (and I originally set out
to do a quick little project to show teachers how easy it is to do a web
page with content - esp. quick - but it never ends - it always needs
upgrading to the newest ideas and possibilities, plus addition of photos
from descendents of participants who e-mail me from the site!- doing the
presentation wasn't the end of the project!)

Whew, it's getting late, and I've been on this thread it seems like all
evening. I was to expect a lot of work to bring my ideas to this forum, and
I believe it! Have a good evening, or good day whenever you get this...
