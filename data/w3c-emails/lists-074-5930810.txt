Marshal McLuhan was a Canadian educator and frequently wrote on assorted
communication topics.  One of his biggest claims to fame was use of the
phrase, "The Medium is the Message," i.e. the technology you deliver your
message in has as much, if not more, of an impact on people than the
message itself.  He lived from 1911-1980.  He's regained a bit of
popularity as some are now using the concepts he wrote about with respect
to television to talk about the web.  A net search will likely turn up
dozens of sites talking about him and he published multiple books.
