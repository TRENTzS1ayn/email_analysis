And Q.E.D. is an abbreviation for the latin phrase Quod Erat Demonstandum,,
meaning "which was needing to be shown". It is what classical minded
mathematicians write at the end of a proof - a claim that they have now made
their point clearly.

  Marshal McLuhan was a Canadian educator and frequently wrote on assorted
  communication topics.  One of his biggest claims to fame was use of the
  phrase, "The Medium is the Message," i.e. the technology you deliver your
  message in has as much, if not more, of an impact on people than the
  message itself.  He lived from 1911-1980.  He's regained a bit of
  popularity as some are now using the concepts he wrote about with respect
  to television to talk about the web.  A net search will likely turn up
  dozens of sites talking about him and he published multiple books.
