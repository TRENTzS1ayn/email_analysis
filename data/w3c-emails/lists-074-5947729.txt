I knew that much, but I wanted to make sure it didn't mean
anything here in this context.  In other words, the subject
line is supposed to say "the medium is the message, end of
story"?  If so, then I'm not entirely sure what the point that
was being made was (how do you apply "the medium is the message"
to web design?  CAN you, given the nature of the medium?), nor
that it was made well.

But maybe I'm worrying too much about a subject line. :)
