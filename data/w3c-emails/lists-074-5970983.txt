This statement confuses me. I don't know what PDA accessibility is and I
have made web pages before I knew much about accessibility so certainly
didn't follow "principles of accessible web design", and it was coming up
in the first five on search engines (to my surprise, I will add).

Those who choose to use web pages other than as intended are really not a
concern. This isn't a matter of accessibility.

Aha, two very good reasons for pages to be accessible to all parents. A
cognitively impaired parent also want to know what their child is doing
online, and their needs are just as real and the number of such parents is
probably greater than the number of blind parent users.

Ditto for cognitively impaired folks. Although a flight simulator isn't
going to be a big stumbling block for such folks, their enjoyment of
something they may never to able to do in "real life" would be very good.

You have given some excellent examples FOR the requirement of
understandability. Perhaps the strongest, outside of the opportunities for
a little fun, are that parents need to be able to see what their kids are
doing online. For safety sake.
