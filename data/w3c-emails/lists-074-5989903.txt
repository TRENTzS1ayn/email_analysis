If the subject line is perplexing, perhaps read the message.  The message
that originally coined that subject line contains the paragraph:

>Could we please try to demonstrate by example before explaining the method.

PS:

QED was the teaser that had to be explained in the body of the message.
'McLuhan' is a classical allusion that makes the subject matter obvious, at
least for those who recognize the allusion.  

This vocabulary is reasonable to assume for a well-read audience dealing
with the Web.  In writing for Wired, one would avoid over-use of McLuhan's
name as a 'tired' cliche, it has been so heavily used.
