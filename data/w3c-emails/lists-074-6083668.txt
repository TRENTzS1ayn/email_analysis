looking at the issue for a week now, here is what we are up against. 
the wai guidelines as they stand, state that if you do certain things,
there must be things done that ensure that technologies other than
perhaps your high end browser can access them.  What is wished for by
non readers is that content be delivered and composed in such a way as
to make it understandable.  we've been talking about the fundamental
difference here.  My proposed guidelines do nothing really for non
readers and may even overlap what the wai already has.  I will not
write my site and don't know how to write my site because I lack the
vision to do it in such a way as to make it richly rewarding for the
non reader unless I know that the non reader is going to be a large
part of my paying audience or unless I am specifically being
contracted to do it.  I'd have to have help with this at any rate.  as
things now, with a bit of help for visual stuff, I can write good well
designed web sites that are easy to read and comprehend because I must
have easy to read and comprehend sites in order to get any thing out
of them because complex sites are tough for me personally to deal
with.  Does this help at all?  It comes down here unfortunately then
to a matter of site style.  If you choose to populate your site with
neat little dancing figures or grapfruit or singing birds, then,
follow all the other guidelines.
