One of the things which in deed may make sites easier to understand by 
people with cognative disabilities is to use talking technology (screen 
reader or self voicing browser) so that the text on the page is both spoken 
and vissible. People who have trouble reading tend to bennefit from 
information presented in multiple modalities at once. Software such as 
Kurtzweil's Omni-3000, designed specifically to help those with reading 
difficulties, highlights the word, phrase, sentence, paragraph being read 
as it speaks the text. Thus, a self voicing browser with the ability to 
highlight as it speaks might be a useful tool for some.
