Thank you Kelly!  I think you have cut the Gordian Knot here!

We have really been debating about the definition of accessibility here. 
Some are equating "accessible" with "understandable" and others with
"available".  I run into the latter frequently when I talk to other state
agencies about if their programs are accessible, and they respond with
something like, "Yes, we have locations in every county".  This is
equivalent with the argument that, "Well your computer CAN get that .GIF
file, can't it?  See, it IS accessible to you."  Accessible means more than
available.

Unfortunately, the WCAG defines what it means by "web content" but not
"accessibility".  I think we would be doing the WAI a favor by defining
this term a little more explicitly!

I'll start us out with a couple of definitions (this needs work)...

Accessible:  Available and usable with appropriate assistive technology.

Accessible:  Functional to persons with disabilities by the same means
(assistive technology) by which they routinely use their personal computer
for other mainstream information technology related activities.

I don't like either of these definitions because they are tied too strongly
to disability, and don't generically address persons who use text browsers
by choice (or for other reasons).  At least both definitions get us past
the current accessible==understandable bottleneck/misunderstanding/impasse
that we are currently at!

Both definitions are also less than satisfactory because they don't address
how "accessible" is used on the WAI site, where the broader "available"
connotation is implied.  I am not aware of any formal (dictionary)
definition of "accessible" that includes PWD or AT.

I like the reference to assistive technology because, as Kelly Ford points
out, all current working definitions of "accessibility" (with regard to
disability) require (implicitly or explicitly) compatibility with
"appropriate accommodations".  This definition also neatly gets past the
issue with learning disabilities because, as AT improves (to allow general
computer use by people with LD), web sites that follow the WCAG (even as
currently written) WILL be usable by persons with LD.

The advent of HTML marked the first (well, most significant anyway) time
that a completely competent computer user with appropriate assistive
technology (e.g., a blind person with a screen reader) could encounter
insurmountable obstacles (e.g., missing ALT tags), even though s/he had
full access to all his hardware and software (i.e., Internet browser). 
THAT is why the WCAG is needed!

Accessible means something different than usable.
Accessible means MORE than available.
Accessible means LESS than understandable.
