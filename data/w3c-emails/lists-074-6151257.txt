This seems rather a bizaare choice of topic however most greasy chips of
that I have ever seen illstrate the options, and bar 'burger king' the
options are severely limited and do not require a PHD , mathematical
notation or extensive philosophy to understand.

if Charles is right I estimate 4 illustrations would be sufficient.

Very often it is better programming practice to explicitly state the
options, rather than include a formula. especially if there are limited
options.
This much is common knowledge.
