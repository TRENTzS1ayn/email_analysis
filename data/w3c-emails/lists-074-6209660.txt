I would argue that the obligation to provide a "proof by example" is more a
burden for you than anyone else on the WAI!  Your SignBrowser site
(http://www.peepo.com/) just doesn't do it for me.

Ahh, but many here would argue that one should NOT be AUTHORING without at
least understanding HTML!  One does not need to know how to be a mechanic
before one learns to drive.  We do, however, have certain expectations for
those that would build roads...

The WAI material conforms with the "Triple-A" level of the WCAG.
The W3C material parses through the W3C validator.

If you think the WCAG can be better written to address LD, you are free to
contribute to them (as you have in the past).  If you are not satisfied
with the results, post proposed revised guideline someplace convenient to
you, and then create and/or reference sites that you find satisfactory.
