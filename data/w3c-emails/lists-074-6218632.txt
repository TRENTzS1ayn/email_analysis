I think, though I'm not sure, that you're responding to Charles and
Ann's discussion about

   <!ELEMENT sundae ...>

The point of the discussion here was *not* about building sundaes, but
about XML DTDs, using a hypothetical sundae markup language as an
example.  The question is how can (or even should) this be made
understandable to the cognitively impaired.  Illustrations will not
suffice, because the purpose of the discussion is to teach someone how
and when to type less-than exclamation E L E M E N T space [some
element type name] space [some specialized syntax for the content of
that element type].  Charles did a pretty good job of simplifying the
discussion, but at the cost of omitting key terms that are necessary
for communicating about the concept outside the scope of that
particular discourse.
