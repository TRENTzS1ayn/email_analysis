I'd like to know more about the mentioned browser. What features common to
MSIE or Netscape are not available with this browser? I can immediately see
that it could be helpful with my summer student who will be learning to
read and write, but I'm not sure it will be all that useful to adult LD
folks seeking information from the web. The last time I put a speech reader
on our computer (Zoom), specifically for my husband to use (he's LD - a
limited reader), he didn't like it and had me take it off because it kept
"taking over" the machine when it wasn't wanted.
