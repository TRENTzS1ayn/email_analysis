You still appear to be missing the point that all the precise definitions
are worthless, if they do not suit the purpose.

Clocks come in many forms, we all want ones that work, caesium might have
been the most accurate, but you wouldn't have worn one on your wrist when it
was the de facto standard.

A clock that only tells the time you want is a little dangerous, it may not
run for long.
The facility to claim that the maker told you that was how it kept the time
is a conceit.

W3C is obviously doing some fine work
It is evident that there is  a gross lack of knowledge concerning illiteracy
within WAI.
This needs to be addressed.
The writing will fall out later.
