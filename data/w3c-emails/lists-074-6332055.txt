Dear List Members:

Earlier this week, my team and I at the Enabling Technologies Lab at
Wayne State University in Detroit were awarded NSF funding for a
year-long "proof of concept" study on developing an accessible design
curriculum to be integrated into existing university curricula. As part
of this study, we will be developing "accessible design modules"--kits
for lab use that will be developed in a hierarchical format starting
with a basic awareness of the issues, principles, and resources and move
toward more detailed presentations of principles and issues leading to
the acquisition of skills necessary for a design practitioner.

We intend to include web accessibility modules into this project and are
actively seeking others to collaborate with us at that level. I thought
that with the amount of web expertise represented by the members of this
group that some of you might be interested in this project. If you are
interested in collaborating on the design of accessible web design
modules or would like more information on this project, please contact
me or the project P.I., Dr. Robert Erlandson, off of the list. Dr.
Erlandson's email is rerlands@ece.eng.wayne.edu. Or, if you are aware of
resources that you feel may help us with this project, I'd appreciate
those, too.

Thanks!
