It will be very hard to justify how the addition of alt tags effects the
getting of the content, it plainly does not.
It provides a decision or point of choice between two different contents.

It is a means of enabling understanding for 2 valuable groups, or 4 if you
prefer.
those who like/dislike pictures and those who's browsers accept/don't accept
pictures.

if someone selects the sundae or sundaes they prefer, it is the
responsibility of the authoring interface to ensure that they receive their
choice. They do not need to understand the process.

We could discuss the necessity of semantic space in constructing a
paragraph, but it has very little bearing on the topic.

Non readers are having a hard time accessing the www.
They do not have the resources that the blind have, and are further
incapacitated by rarely providing their own income stream.
However you cut it they are not well served.
