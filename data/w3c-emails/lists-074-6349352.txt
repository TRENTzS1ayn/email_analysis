What nonsense, everyone who accesses the www has an expectation of
authoring.Creating the ideal tools for accessing and authoring is a little
harder, and even more so making these tools accessible and to anable
creation of these tools by all, perhaps a stonker. Acknowledging the hole in
your bucket, is a better place to start.

Authoring was mentioned as being an original goal of the originator, as I
heard
it. In fact I understood, that it was intended to have been possible for me
to amend W3C protocols(or any other file), well it almost is, and I hardly
understand a word.
