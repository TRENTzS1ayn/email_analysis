I like to tell people that if a blind person can't access the
web page she's trying to use, the REASON is not _her_ disability,
but the disability of the _web author_ who created the page.
That web author is "disabled" because he was _not able_ to make
a correct web page.

Why should she suffer for _his_ problem or failing?  In no way
is a user with a disability "disabled" on the web -- the sites
THEMSELVES have the disability inherent in their code by not
being accessible!

We should identify the problem where it exists.  The problem is
not that there's anything "wrong with" the user, it is a problem
with the page author and his output!
