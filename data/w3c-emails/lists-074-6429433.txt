Anne,

Kurzweil 3000 is not a talking web browser.  It is a program designed to
scan printed text and read it outlout with the features that were
mentioned.  To the best of my knowledge it does not have facilities for web
browsing.  For details see:

http://www.kurzweiledu.com

The two browsers with voice capability that I regularly use are

IBM Home Page Reader, an URL for which escapes me just now and PW Webspeak,
details at

http://www.prodworks.com

Although these programs are geared primarily toward folks with visual
impairments, they may help some LD folks who benefit from audio output.
There are an increasing number of shareware utilities that I've noticed
that allow one to highlight text in different programs and have it spoken.
Searching at someplace like shareware.com might turn some of these up.  It
takes a lot of trial and error to mess with these programs but sometimes
you can find a gem that will help some folks.

Kelly
