Hi Kynn,

Thanks to Joe - I put a sticky note yesterday to send you
(Kynn) a note about this favorable coverage.

The text box on the (full page) article (with pictures) is
a quote from Judy Brewer:
"Bobby is becoming of increasing interest to
businesses and government."

Congratulations to CAST and to Bobby for generating some
positive coverage in the mainstream technical media.  I
confess to novice status on accessibility, but this article
_seems_ quite sensible and constructive.

Cheers,
- Ira McDonald
