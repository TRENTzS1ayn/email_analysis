I should like to dispell the misunderstandng that learning difficulties
equates with a requirement for simple explanations.

Television soaps are very popular with the majority of our students.
They are able to recall large parts of the stories.
Usually they are at least as clear as the staff about the current issues,
though a period of debate helps produce a single theme.

My family has no TV so in a sense I am a control, having no knowledge or
opinion on what has occured. This can be extremely complex as not all
threads are 'true' outcomes, and there are very often a very large number of
concurrent stories.

Social interactions are amongst our most complex, and many students are at
least as able as the general population. The same cannot be said for all the
members of some well educated groups. Go players for instance.
