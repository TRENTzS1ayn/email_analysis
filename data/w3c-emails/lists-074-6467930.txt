Four suggestions, first two for now, then two for later.

individual markers:
Authors that consider the content of their site to be primarily graphical,
are advised to provide an icon to be used by third parties as a link to that
site.

meta markers:
These authors are further advised that an icon (with link) of their choice,
indicating a topic area should be provided.

photos:
Could HTML incorporate an image tag indicating that the content was royalty
free?

links:
It would be helpful if links indicated whether they were to content of a
similiar type.

It is important to be aware that image producers would want to retain
copyright in case their images were used in a grossly defamatory way. To
have offending sites removed from the www where possible.
Obviously problems arise where people post the images of others as their
own. This is common to all media.

Conceiving and formulating guidlines is well beyond my normal duties as you
will be aware.
