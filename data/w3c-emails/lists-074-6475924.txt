Members who find it hard to understand how an icon could represent a site,
might like to consider the following:

In India symbols such as flowers are used to represent political parties and
representatives on voting slips, and billboards.
In the UK we use colors Red, Green and Blue are the popular ones.
I am unaware of US political marketing strategies, but I should be amazed if
you can advise me that this is not part of the strategy used there

So precis can and is taken to extremes.

Isn't voting fairly absurd in that context. ie trying to compress complex
data into a decision, information and education process.
