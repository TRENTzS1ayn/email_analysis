No, it isn't. It is _denied them because of their disability_ as surely as
information in graphics that aren't alt tagged is _denied_ to those who
can't see graphics.

Then you are an important person for me to convince. 

I would have you tell them to write clearly and simply so that it can be
understood by the widest audience, and absolutely include "meaningful
graphics" that assist the reader in understanding what is said. I would
have you tell them to spend as much or more time choosing the graphics for
a site as in writing the content so that they help convey the message of
the content. Tell them that when they use words not readily understood,
that they can include links to pictures or definitions to aid the reader.
Not only a low=level reader would be assistend, by anyone else accessing
the information new. Tell them that when they are considering their
audience, to broaden it to include all people who would be interested in
the information, and aim their writing so that it can be understood by the
widest, including those who are blind, learning disabled, and retarded.

As I recently pointed out, "readily understandable" is part of the
definition of accessibility in the first dictionary I checked out. Check
your own dictionary and see if understandability isn't part of
accessibility in your book! Your course already asks them to become
"experts" in communicating with the blind, why not include more people? I
see your distinction between "accessibility" and "understanding" to be a
strawman that is having the effect of dividing folks with disability into
groups - those who are invited to the web, and those who are to be
ghettoized from the web even though they have gained access and are alreay
here and waiting to use it. It's a cruel distinction, and you continued use
of terms such as "dumbing down" suggests discrimination is at the root of
the problem. Perhaps it's just too easy to discriminate against people if
the person doesn't know some folks in the category and have a personal
reason to include them.
