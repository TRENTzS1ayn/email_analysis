Sorry you don't like the book's example. It could read "accessible to
love", or "accessible to knowledge", for example, as well as "accessible to
bribary". The point is that "readily understandable" is part of the
definition of "accessibility". 

Dictionaries are not a "game", they are at the root of understanding the
terms we are using to define which people go to the web ghetto.
