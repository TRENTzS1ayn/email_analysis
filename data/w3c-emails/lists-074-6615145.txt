we could argue semantics till dooms day and get nowhere.  In point of
fact as I have written to jonathan and others in private, though I may
not share kim's approach entirely, I do understand his point that
there is a line between good web design making content available to
all and what is proposed which intrincicly locks out some in fact to
streight forward access.  I am not speaking here about a cognative
barrier which can be dealt with at least to some degree by making the
graphics meaningful and adding multimedia content where appropriate
but rather the assumption which states that what is there even though
there is no problem in getting at it needs to be re written in such a
way as to make it consumable by bridging almost a barrier that is in
many senses developmental.  I say again, follow good design practices,
and use any method you want within that to convey information which
you feel or know will achieve your goal.  In doing this however, be
quite aware that the road you build will never be traversable by many
for whom the original road was intended.  The site peebo.com if it is
an example of that road clearly points this out.
Thank you with respect for all.
