You just don't get it, do you?  Again, I hope that someone will
someday come along who can your point without the insults.  I
have found that in _my_ attempts to educate people on the
issues I understand, insulting them does no good at all.

I have a two-word reply to Anne, but I will spare the members
of this list the vulgarity, and try to keep on topic.  Unless
anyone else wants to play "call Kynn a bigot"?
