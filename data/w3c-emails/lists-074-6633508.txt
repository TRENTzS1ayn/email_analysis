Jakob Nielsen's AlertBox column talks about web accessibility and the
WCAG, and states the following:

"But I am not sure that single-design pages will be able to deliver 
 optimal usability in the future. For example, screen sizes will soon 
 differ so drastically between high-end office workstations and small 
 mobile devices that the same pages will not satisfy both. And I also 
 think that one can make pages much more usable for blind users and 
 users with other disabilities by designing explicitly for these groups."

Agree or disagree?  To tie into a recent thread:  how does access
for cognitively impaired users tie into this?  We've been saying that
you don't need a separate web site for blind (et al) users, but --
if content needs to be actually rewritten for a new audience in order
to make it comprehensible -- is this the end of "writing once" and
the beginning of specialized web sites for each type of disability?

Your thoughts are welcome.
