In an IDEAL world everything would be accessible to everyone all the time.
But we don't live in that world. Whether it is the web or any other media
there will be some practical considerations in the development of material.
I am sure a case can be made for extremes but is there really any serious
need to produce a drivers handbook in Braille?

Has anyone considered the needs of a cognitively disabled person who is also
blind?
If the ideal of Universal Design escapes us we should, I think, adapt in the
best way possible with the target audience in mind. Thus, that fancy
high-end system at the office shouldn't be spending a lot of time in a games
area and I would rather not think about somebody using a phone-link to
review a scientific paper while driving to work.
