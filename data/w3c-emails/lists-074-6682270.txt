One more thing.  Richard, in his attempt to attack me, quoted the
following from me:

This is EXACTLY what I have been telling people, and I stand by it.
The cause of inaccessibility is _IGNORANCE_, not a moral fault in
someone.  Web designers WILL create accessible pages if you approach
them from the standpoint of "you are ignorant (unaware) of the issue,
but here's how you can learn more."  They will NOT respond if you
walk up to them and call them morally corrupt discriminatory bigots,
and besides which, that's not even TRUE (they're not).

This is why the AWARE Center is named just that -- because once
people are AWARE of the problem, they will work to solve it.  Ignorance
can be cured, moral deficiencies are not nearly as easy, and quite
offensive to the parties you're trying to convince.

If you want to tell me I'm ignorant about something -- go ahead; I
don't claim perfect knowledge.  The compulsion is then on you to
show me the right thing to do.

I make no apologies for anything I've posted to this list, and I really
wish Richard would grow up and quit the game of "hey, we all win if
I make Kynn look like a hypocritical bastard."  Because _nobody_ wins
if we play that.
