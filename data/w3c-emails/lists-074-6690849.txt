Of Course, as I said a case can be made for almost everything.  It remains
for 'society' to decide if it worth the investment (time, money, resources)
to meet each and every individual need.  In any culture the answers are
likely to be different.  None of this should ever stop us from striving to
achieve an ideal world.
