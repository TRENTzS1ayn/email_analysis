Why should knowledge be feared?  For the most part, this "hidden
knowledge" is more dangerous in the hands of adults with hidden
personal agendas (such as the average government) than it would be
in the hands of children or learning-disabled (what's the right term?)
adults.

I knew in junior high what was necessary to create a bomb, and I
haven't blown up any countries yet (it's only been 18 years since
jr. high, gimme some time?) -- knowledge itself is not dangerous.
Can't we find out this information from libraries, anyway?
