All,

I am giving a tutorial on Web Site accessbilty for the Internet Society next
week. This has great applicability in the International arena.  I would like
people who do not speak English and those of us who do not speak all the
other languages in the world to be able to incorporate this into the web
pages we build.  Careful use of alt tags might well help those who access
these pages in an auditory manner.  In any event I am watching this with
great interest.  I will give you some feedback from a truly interational
persective in about a week and a half.  This is one of the most interesting
and productive discussions I have ever seen on this list.

Sincerely,

Mike Burks
Chairman Internet Society Special Interest Group
For Access to the Internet for People with Disabitilities

Subject: DRAFT: Designing Pages Accessible to Limited Textual
Comprehension Users


You are welcome to peruse the first draft of a page on the AWARE
Center site, entitled "Designing Pages Accessible to Limited
Textual Comprehension User".

This is still a rough document, but I've tried to incorporate some
of the suggestions made on this list, in the form of advice to
web authors.  I likely am missing several important strategies for
increasing the understandability of a web page, and if you'd be
kind enough to share them with me (via this list or private email
to kynn@hwg.org or aware@hwg.org), I can include them in a later
draft of this document.

Constructive criticism and comments are welcome.  Thanks.
