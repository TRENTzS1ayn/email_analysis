Hi Kynn
     I agree with Jakob's comments.
     I've become aware since attending the first day of the WAI meeting in
Toronto of two web accessibility communities.  One focuses on the needs to
make HTML accessible, the other is looking at developing a richer web in the
future.  The former group gives priority to education, importance of ALT
tags, etc.  The latter regards HTML as on its way out, and priority should
be given to the new stuff (XML, XLink, RDF, etc.)
    To give an example.  The ALT tag provides a simple, one-dimensional
description of an image.  Multi-lingual support is missing (an obvious
barrier to understanding).  But ALT also  fails to provide information which
may be needed to address cultural issues.
   I touched on this in my talk at the WAI meeting - see

As an example of the richer form of metadata I think is needed (e.g. for
images) see

I discussed these issues with Julie Howell of the RNIB (Royal National
Institute for the Blind) here in the UK who stated that:
"Rather than encouraging 'simplicity' in Web design ... we try to encourage
'flexibility', so that Web sites can be tailored to individual need
'simply'. Flexibility affords the personalisation which people with sight
problems require."
