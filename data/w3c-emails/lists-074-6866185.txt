But are they *necessary*?  

We seem to be crossing a line here from saying "use appropirate <foo>" to 
"we have decided that appropriate means <bar>".

While it might be nice that that person could make sense of formal
symbolisms after seeing them in pictures -- if they can never *use* those
symbolisms for their intended purposes specifically because they can't read
-- why should we mandate or even "guide" a web author to accomodate that? 

note to the quick to react: this should not be ill-equated to an assumption
that I think blind people shouldn't have access to ALT text --
intelligently appreciating a description of an artistic work is still using
the work. Someone who can't read might "enjoy" the visual representation of
a formal symbolism, but that's not the symbolisms purpose, as is the visual
enjoyment of an artistic work.
