Further to my previous posting I'd like to give two examples of why the
principles of universal design may not be applicable.

Current guidelines state that web pages should be device independent, and
that phrases such as "Click here" should be avoided (because some users may
not be using a mouse-driven interface).  On the other hand, "click here" may
be a good phrase for, say, someone with learning disabilities who does have
a mouse, but has difficulties mastering a user interface.  This was brought
to my attention recently when testing a web site designed for children - I
found it difficult differentiating between images with just ALT text and
images with ALT text which acted as links.

Similarly, "Return to home page" is a bad name for an anchor (the user may
not have been to the home page).  However it might be a good name for an
anchor generated on the fly, when the system knows the user have been to the
page.

"Click here" and "Return to home page" should be avoided in static HTML
pages.  However they *may* be desirable in other circumstances.
