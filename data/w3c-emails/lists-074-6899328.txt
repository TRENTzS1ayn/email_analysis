Alt tags materially effect content, without them a blind person does not
receive content, unless perhaps you argue that they do. Hardly then
accessible.

Similarly providing different sites for different browsers effects content.
Also screen size, frames, soundcard, directX, real audio, macromedia, VRML,
just about any difference in computer facility is catered for to some
degree, all providing substantially different content.

Even Gifs and jpegs are substantially different, even one might suggest as
different as a thesis and a child's story. the one requiring considerably
more interpretation in normal use, though providing far less information.

It is merely that having progressed beyond childish things we imagine we
have understood them. How misguided, one only has to read contemporary
authors, such as Marina Warner or Angela Carter, to realize how little we
know about storytelling.

You surely would not suggest that people with LD should be deprived their
vote, even though they have a limited capacity to understand the issues. We
all only get to make a mark in any case, hardly a sophisticated
communication.
Which person would say they understood all the issues and that
their vote is infallible, a fool perhaps.

Responsible Web builders need to enable, and providing accessible materials
for non-readers is only a start.
W3C should be setting an example.
Children need to know about these problems, they effect us all.

Bridge building might not teach one the tensile strength of materials, but
it is considered a suitable means of initiating interest.
Expressing the concern "Will a blind person enjoy visiting you site?"
communicates the intention if not the method (yet).

If this was suggested, it was not by me. I understood the WAI produced
recommendations, not requirements.
I strongly object to your comments about lowest common denominator.
In general the whole population would benefit from beng able to select
material at a level they desired, providing it was easy to do.

> the Green Bay Packers football team must have an image of a football

I would be very surprised if their site did not have a picture of a ball, in
fact most sports sites are accessible, many even having animated games
designed for them. These were never requirements, they are marketing.
W3C is missing the boat on this one, in my opinion, not worth a lot
admittedly.

The reason our site has very small gifs is that we are attempting to provide
a means of searching on the www. This precludes providing streaming (linked)
wonderful graphics and sounds, just now.  A small budget would help.

Browsers might then provide a visual history and my current site would be
redundant.
