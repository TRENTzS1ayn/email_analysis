dp materially perhaps, but not substantially.  when we talk about alt
tags, we are talking about an alternative to what you have placed on
your site because of the fact that it may not be delivered in certain
circumstances such as to a screen reader or a person using a text only
browser or with images turned off.  This then is fascilitated by the
"alternative text or whatever".

dp yes, and it is not highly endorsed.  we ask that people provide one
site so that it can be maintained in a congruent fashion.  The
sophistication that we are headed towards it seems though with the use
of css and server tricks may make it possible for that site though to
be rendered differently when it arrives at the user end and that will
not and does not effect content.

dp atain, these are all optional and a matter of choice.  in the
guidelines they are provided for in order to provide and produce the
maximum effect.  Like images, they will not be delivered to some
browsers.

dp they look the same to me <g> but perhaps a jpg might be a bit
fuller and richer the gif is certainly clear enough.

dp would it  that this were relevant to our discussion.  storytell all
you want but we still have the rest of the www to contend with.  I
agree though that childhood is best understood by a child but the
shame is that a child does not have the skills to articulate it well
enough.

dp I would be bold enough to say so.  I don't claim to understand all
the issues but the whole thing our democracy hinges on is <informed
choice> Informed means that the information has been comprehended to a
level upon which can be based a clear choice.  Would you want a barber
to remove your child's appendix?

dp Children need to be children and run and play and gro up and learn
how to do the things that they must do in order to be adults so that
they can take part in society.  Older children can begin to grasp the
broader issues and they should be provided with the mechanisms for
doing so.

dp I fail to understand the tie in between the two statements above. 
Teaching bridge building is a process that envolves teaching some
construction engineering.  Why? because the person building the bridge
needs to know that the materials selection and placement is going to
equal the desired outcome of the product which is that it actually
functions as a bridge.  This has little to do with the web.
As a blind person I don't have to enjoy what I access.

dp easy to provide or easy to access.  The lowest common denominator
is actually apt here since it implies that there are increments which
there are.  we also apply it to browsers.

dp You said it marketing.  How much money is being made on the web
anyway?  Here I say again, you don't need guidelines or requirements
for this sort of thing or even mandates.  Just education and or
instruction for web designers to follow if they want to attract a
particular audience or reach certain people.  The only reason I say
again that we have guidelines for the web coming out of the wai is
that it began to change from a medium which could be <accessed> by all
to one that was beginning to lock out more and more of the population
by virtue of it's graphical trend.  This was an across the board issue
with regard to many end points.  I fail to see the necessity or even
the wisdom of having all sites use a high degree of bandwidth to
provide a styalistic view that they may wish they had not the want to
do.  The wai guidelines are concerned with the way and method of
content presentation, you on the other hand are talking about the
content its self.  It has been said here for instance, that text is a
distraction.  well, pictures are a distraction too, red hair is a
distraction, but they are a part of life.

A small buget would help me too.  Small gifs are tough to see by the
visually impaired.

they look lots like style and litterally rewriting content to me.
We must find a way that allows the content to stay the same but have
the end result match the need.
