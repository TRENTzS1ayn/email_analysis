This is where the system of 'label' and 'description' proposed in the
Scalable Vector Graphics is easier to understand and use well than the
perplexing welter of constructs in HTML.

For others interested in continuing progress against the 'click here'
problem, review the 'fat links' notion we have talked about in the User
Agent working group.  Here the user agent would recognize that 'click here'
is not a discriminant for different link targets, and automatically back
off so that the minimal display to a screen reader or other peephole access
technology would include contextualizing material from the vicinity of the
link, such as the immediately enclosing list item or sentence.  If we put
in guardband rules for how the sensitive regions don't get too close
together, this is also beneficial for people with fine motor control problems.

PS: also fixes label-after-checkbox.  Make them a clickability atom.

But this doesn't mean the end of single-design pages.  What it means is
that the class of pages for which one can have a single design is not a
single layout but a single design of a polymorph, with an infrastructure of
semantic structure and a variety of interface incarnations.

This link should identify whose home is the page linked to.  Don't assume
that the user has this notion in their recall memory.  Any page that can be
retrieved can be started at.  People don't think to make their pages robust
against the fact that anybody can start anywhere.  Given the popularity of
search engines as portals, many hits come from out of the blue, not from
the site's carefully laid out entry paths.
