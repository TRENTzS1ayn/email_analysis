(The use of "religious" was not meant negatively, but that leads
me to my question...)

Is it _possible_ for someone from a particular culture to avoid
writing things from their perspective?  If so, is it _desirable_
that authors deliberately do this?

From a writer's standpoint (I'm not really one, but given 36
hours in a day, I'd become one), each author has a specific
"voice", a unique viewpoint from which she is writing. That
is part of the creative process -- part of what makes the
writer herself worth reading.  And a factor in that unique
viewpoint will undoubtedly be the her cultural background.

Is it desirable, in the name of "cultural correctness", to
homogenize all writings, and risk eliminating that unique
viewpoint that she's trying to present?  If it's desirable,
is it _possible_?  How does she gauge the effect her culture
has had upon her, without being an expert in every society
on Earth?  How will she know if there is someone in a far-
off country who would not understand her choice of
metaphors?

Does anyone have a reference on how to identify these things
in your own writing?  Are there any understandable, non-
academic guidelines for doing so?  Or is it all hit and
miss?
