cultural neutrality doesn't always work to "increase understanding", so you
may want to separate the two issues, Kynn. All people are part of their
culture, and folks with cognitive, sensory, or physical disabilities are no
different. (I'm a "damned Yankee living in rural southside Virginia, who
will sometimes try to tell the locals the truth about one of their sacred
beliefs....and even my husband gets mad at me!)

Cultural collisions keep life interesting, but they doesn't keep the peace.
