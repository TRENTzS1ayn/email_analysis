Your article makes the point that writing simple English and using images
will make one's site more international. I disagree. 
Even fully translating a site won't work without taking into account
cultural differences. Doing international business through the web is 
technologically easyer, but it cannot be accomplished trivially.

Indeed. I was thinking more from a business point of view.
When I try to sell my old car, I compromize my artistic freedom,
and don't argue with my customers on irrelevant issues such as 
politics. This doesn't make my car less interesting to the potential
buyer.

Why homogenize? just use the simplest and clearest language 
appropriate for the intended audiance. There is some guideline like that
in the WCAG1.0. I was thinking more of doing business (in a
commercial site) rather than any sort of "correctness".

Exactly my point. Writing simpler English and using images 
for navigation won't make one's site much more useful internationally.
Translation is not enough either. A localized version of a commercial 
site must be developed by (or at least with) people of the locality.  

Last thing, I did not claim that you presented religion negatively, 
but that you critized the position of Nielsen on images in a way that 
may be misunderstood as critizing religion.
