I am getting tired of this thread.  If you want to really argue the point,
then the cognitive society of the world should unite and come up with one
universal language or set of signs that are easily translated. If you want
designers to implement for you then yuou must help them and make it easy.
If we are going to add to the twenty plus browsers for PWDs, then lets
identify and add these for cognitive requirements.

How can you make the W3C or page authors liable for the design and content
when the cognitive society is not organized.  I recommend the cognitvie
environment organize like the groups for the blind and deaf.  For example,
NIB, NFB, etc.

The cognitve environment needs to be represented but by whom.  I do not see
how one person can push a concept without represenation.  The cognitve
environment must be organized.

This whole thread has been productive yet unproductive at the same time.
Can someone please tell me what the groups represent this environment?

If someone is using pictures to understand, then what level of education is
required for them to use the computer?

I am curious to know what the percentage of people in the world or a country
currently use this method and how many are not included?

What are the demographics and ages?

Is there an international standard for this methodology.

Seems the best way to resolve this is to have a translator for someone to
use  that translates HTML to picture.  and how complex will this be, that
is, what is the library?  Does it include math, science?

Who is your target audience or are there multiple?

I like the translator concept, like you have voice based web browsers and
screen readers.
