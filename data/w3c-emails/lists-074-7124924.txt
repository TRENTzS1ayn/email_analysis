Lately, especially when I see the nine meg of  unread mail from this group,
I've thought about sending my unsubscribe note. But the following, copied
from an e-mail I received back in '94 is more appropriate:

"Rabbit's clever," said Pooh thoughtfully.
"Yes," said Piglet. "Rabbit's clever."
"And he has Brain."
"Yes," said Piglet. "Rabbit has Brain."
There was a long silence.
"I suppose," said Pooh, "that's why he never understands anything."

CH:: "CAST also provides a basic introduction to alternative
representations for images (alt tags and long descriptions) at:

http://www.cast.org/strategies/image_barrier.html

WL: This is good for pix-to-text but much of our recent (seemingly
endless) discussions have been an effort to make text-to-pix somehow
become a part of the guidelines.  A site like the above called
text_barrier.html is IMHO very unlikely to be as clear-cut a
success. I
cannot yet imagine any way to do this because my brain just doesn't
work
that way and I've seen no evidence of anything showing how this can
be
done *WITHOUT A MAJOR CHANGE IN THE ENTIRE LANGUAGE EDUCATION
PROCESS*
and certainly nothing from a set of vague guidelines: "use
illustrations
where helpful" sort of urgings.  What illustrations?  A picture of a
rose means "rose", "spring semester schedule", "Rose", and if there
aren't a few more, I would be very surprised.  But when the picture
is
used on a Web page the author should know what she was up to and
ALT="text" becomes a proper subject for a guideline.  My guess is
that
it will be decades (if ever) before this can change and when it does
the
learning process will be just as difficult for folks with learning
disabilities as it is now for them to learn to read text.  There is
no
"intuitively obvious" reason why a circle with a diagonal should
mean
"not" or a stick figure with certain garment styling should signify
a
particular gender's rest room.  These conventions had to be learned
laboriously and are far from universal.  We have spent megabytes of
bandwidth discussing this stuff and the proposals are still so vague
as
to present authors with no clues as to which set of clip art will
become
the heiroglyphs of the future.  A football picture can be anything
from
meaningless to a depiction of a watermelon seed and associating it
with
the financial statement of the Green Bay Packers has zero
informative
value for the document in question.
