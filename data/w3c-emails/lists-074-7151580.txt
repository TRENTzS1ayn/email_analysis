Classifying Signs
Peirce[86] classified signs into three groups:
icons, indexes, and symbols.
Uzilevsky and Andreev describe the classifications by
stating that
"[s]igns were related to objects by resembling them
('icons'),
being causally connected to them ('indexes') or being
conventionally
tied to them ('symbols')." [107] By these definitions, an
icon
representing fire might be a picture of flame, an index for
fire might be
smoke or heat, and a symbol for fire might be the color red.
Signs that are created using sounds to represent a visual
item
would generally fall into the latter two classifications, so
that,
for example, the sound of paper rustling would be an index
for a document,
while an earcon that is devised and taught to the user
population
would be a symbol for the document.
While sound icons (under Peirce's definition) can exist,
by the strict definition they may only be used to represent
other sounds,
such as when a movie sound effects designer uses the sound
of coconut shells pounding on a table to simulate horse
footsteps.
