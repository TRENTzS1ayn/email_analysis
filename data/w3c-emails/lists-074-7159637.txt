Charles,

i agree that it is clear that site publishers prefer to keep control over their
graphic content.

However History is currently verbal, and their is little to indicate that this is
the preferred idiom.

If publishers provided linked images, a vastly improved searching strategy is
possible.

It is good enough for the stock exchange I commend it to you.

Jonathan
