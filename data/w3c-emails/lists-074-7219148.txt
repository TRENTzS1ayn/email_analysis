I too am growing weary of this thread, it is very disturbing. The more I read 
the scarier it gets.

The people Rob refers to are recognized and organized. All are recognized and 
organized by the ADA in the US.

An example; 

Down's Syndrome is one of the most common congenital defects resulting in 
profound to mild developmental delays. 
That's one in every 600 births,  
5,000 children are born with Downs in the US every year. 
There are 250,000 Americans with Downs Syndrome. 
Today, people with Down Syndrome live well into their 80's. 
This is just Trisomy 21 - consider all the other possibilities!

As for Organizations; The Special Olympics, the Waisman Center and the Family 
Village at the U of Wisconsin at Madison were founded by the Kennedy Family, 
one of the children (Rose Kennedy - now an Adult) has Downs and lives in a 
convent near Madison, WI. 
See the list of URL's at the bottom of this post.

You must also consider PWD's may have more than one disability and it may be 
from birth or injury or illness a combination of or from an occurrence later 
in life. 

I have more than one disability and my son does too. Within the next few 
years I may have even more.

Has the WAI been testing it's "product" with the people who will be using it? 
Have they identified who the end users are?
From this thread, obviously not.

I worked in OEM/Enginering and Design for nearly 20 years before I became 
disabled.
Every *concept* was tested with the proposed end user before it was even 
considered for development. 
Then there were endless debates and several series of prototypes were made 
before a concept was adopted.
99% went in the trash.

The WAI is a noble and IMO a wonderful achievement - but an entire section of 
the population has been left out - perhaps forgotten or never considered? 

This is why you must define disability. You need to know what you are working 
towards.

Maybe it's just too hard.

And there are thousands more DS Websites...........

Do these sites carry the Bobby Icon? Most do not because they know as much 
about the WAI and Bobby as the WAI and Bobby know of them.
