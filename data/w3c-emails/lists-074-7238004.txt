Lovey:: "The WAI is a noble and IMO a wonderful achievement - but an
entire section of  the population has been left out - perhaps forgotten
or never considered?"

WL: For some reason it keeps coming up that somebody is "left out" or
"overlooked" or in some way shorted by either the WAI or the guideline
process.  Even after specifics from the guidelines are referenced.  If
there is some general *definable* action that can be taken to make the
Web more accessible to people with, e.g. Down's Syndrome, then *bring it
on*, join in, make it known, but please don't ask people to figure out
what that might be and then imply that we're not caring, etc. I have not
yet heard anyone say how to put text into some other (graphical?) form
that would be doable and helpful but it keeps coming up.  Just saying
"provide graphical alternatives" doesn't do anything unless we know what
those might be. Once more, with feeling, HOW COULD THIS EMAIL EXCHANGE
BE MADE NON_TEXTUAL?  so that it would be accessible to or
understandable by non-readers?  Anything that would make more routes of
access to the Web  available is very important commercially, legally,
ethically, morally, spiritually, and pracitcally - but it's the how? of
it that is in the way: no *how*, no *if*.  There is no action being
taken, not because of indifference, but because we don't know
SPECIFICALLY what to do.
