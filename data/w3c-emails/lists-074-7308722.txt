There have been two serious proposals, both from David Poehlman: 1) include
guidelines that specify the inclusion of graphics as an aid to
accessibility, and 2) change the current status of the guideline for
"simple and understandable" text from "recommended" to "required". Either
would be a masterful start in the right direction. 

What is the next step towards including the needs of graphically-dependent
into the next version of the WAI Guidelines draft?
