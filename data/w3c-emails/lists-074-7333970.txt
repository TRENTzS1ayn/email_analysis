Anybody remember "Microsoft Bob"?  Did anyone here try and use the interface for addressing cognitive disabilities?

Well, it is a lot to ask today.

This is work that I have been hoping to get to for the past year but have yet
to get beyond the initial proposal writing stage.  It is clearly not
indifference -  just too many competing projects and interests.  We want to
move beyond basic sensory and physical accessibility to the more difficult
cognitive issues but it is very hard work.  Even textbook publishers and
educational software publishers have made only limited progress in this area
and they need to reach a very wide audience.  I hope to be working on "Mr.
Chips" within the next six months or so.  The work reaches beyond
accessibility to improved learning opportunities for the widest possible
audience.
