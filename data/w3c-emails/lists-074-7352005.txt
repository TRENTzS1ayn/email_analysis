Cross-posted to authoring tool group and interest group.

Although the authoring tool accessibility guidelines draft covers the issue
of structural information (such as ABBR and ACRONYM exansions) in checkpoint
2.4.2 I will use this example as one of the techniques. A useful addition to
the techniques would be a list of the relevant elements in HTML, SMIL, SVG,
the relevant features in GIF and PNG, etc

  In making that recommendation, we were following the standard print
  convention of only expanding the first occurrence of an unfamiliar
  abbreviation or acronym in a document.  There was significant discussion on
  the topic, with some members of the working group feeling strongly that all
  occurrences should be marked up.  Others felt that this was too great a
  burden on page authors, especially when the print convention was so
  universally accepted.  Anyway, a consensus was reached with the "minimum"
  requirement being to only mark up the first occurrence.  Of course, any
  author is free to code all occurrences if they so choose.
  
  One possibility is to tie this checkpoint to the  Authoring Tool working
  group (if it is not already being considered).  Perhaps an authoring tool
  could be given the "smarts" to prompt for the first expansion of an acronym
  or abbreviation, then, optionally reuse the markup whenever the same string
  is detected.
