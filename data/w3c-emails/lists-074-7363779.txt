Seems to me that being simple and understandable on highly complex issues 
is not a real possibility.  You wouldn't give the same presentation to a 
middle school science class that you would to a PHD seminar on 
astrophysics.  One must cater to a certain degree to the likely audience. 
 The only thing you can reasonably demand is that the material be 
accessible not understandable.  Demanding otherwise implies a positive 
responsibility to educate all people everywhere in everything.
