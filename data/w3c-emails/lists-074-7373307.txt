1. Heads-up: Upcoming IG Review for Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines

On Monday, June 21, the Authoring Tool Guidelines Working Group will send
their new working draft to the WAI Interest Group for two-week review. The
draft will incorporate changes from the AUWG's recent meeting in Toronto.
For a preview, visit the AUWG home page at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU

2. Translations of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines in Progress

There are several translations of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
1.0 available already or in progress. A translation coordination page
provides guidance on this topic. If you are interested in translating or
reviewing translations of the guidelines, or know of efforts to do so,
please visit http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TRANSLATIONS to ensure
your efforts are coordinated with others.

3. Web Content Guidelines WG will Report back on Thread on Limited Textual
Comprehension

The recent IG thread on limited textual comprehension has provided some
interesting perspectives on this issue. The Web Content Guidelines Working
Group has taken an action item to determine what changes or clarifications
might be needed in future versions of the guidelines, or in supporting
materials. They will then report back to the Interest Group list. The IG
list is archived at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/ and is
sortable by topic. To join the guidelines mailing list or to view that
archive, visit http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL

4. CSS Accessibility Features Note Available

A new "Note" on accessibility features in Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is
available at http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS-access. This Note is a more detailed
technical reference than the CSS accessibility resource previously
available on the WAI site, and should be of particular interest to
developers of users agents and authoring tools that want to ensure
implementation of key features in CSS that support accessibility.

5. Reminder: WAI meetings in Sophia, France, July 19 and 20

The WAI meetings in Sophia, France, on Monday and Tuesday July 19-20,
include a full day meeting of the Education and Outreach Working Group,
which will provide an opportunity to focus on outreach in Europe. Flights
and hotel space to this area will tend to fill up quickly in this season,
so please register and make your reservations soon if you are planning on
attending. Additional information is available at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/1999/07/agenda.htm

6. Reminder open review on WCAG Curriculum

Reminder that we welcome comments through today on the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines Curriculum. Information on the call for review is
at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/1999AprJun/0472.html
There will also be future opportunities to comment on the guidelines as
noted at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/1999AprJun/0516.html

7. Two positions open at WAI

The Web Accessibility Initiative has a position open for an Outreach
Coordinator and a Tools Engineer. Additional information is available at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/1999AprJun/0578.html

Regards,
