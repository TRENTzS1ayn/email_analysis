I think that while 'simple and understandable' is always going to end up
being a subjective judgement, it is still possible and reasonable to say it
is a requirement, as far as it is possible. There are a number of techniques
and approaches that can be quickly explained in plain language. After all,
saying "ensure a fleisch rating in the seventy-fifth or greater percentile"
is not very clear to most people, but "use common language, and where a
technical term or a specific meaning for a common word is necessary provide a
definition" gives most writers the information they need.

There is a difference between simplifying things and removing information,
and there is a limit to any person's ability to express something in simpler,
clearer language. The point is that accessibility to cognitively disabled
people requires us to reach for, and to extend, that limit, rather than
dismiss the problem.

  middle school science class that you would to a PHD seminar on

   The only thing you can reasonably demand is that the material be 
  accessible not understandable.  Demanding otherwise implies a positive 
  responsibility to educate all people everywhere in everything.
