Actually, given the way speech synthesizers work, even the expansion might
sometimes be difficult to understand.  As long as the acronym is not spread
out with spaces (i.e., appears as a "word" to the screen reader) the screen
reader's dictionary function can make any substitution the user wants.  

Here's an idea for the screen reader manufacturers:  Have a hot-key feature
that grabs the acronym being pointed to, inserts it into the dictionary,
then lets the user highlight the expansion text and insert and edit it as
the substitute text for the acronym.  This would be a quick and easy way to
handle acronyms that follow the print convention  and take advantage of the
screen reader's dictionary capability (assuming it has one).  It also leaves
the decision about what is to be presented verbally in the hands of the user
who probably knows better what they want in this case than the web author.
Also, it can avoid repetition of wordy expansions which can be as tedious to
listen to as they would be to read visually.
