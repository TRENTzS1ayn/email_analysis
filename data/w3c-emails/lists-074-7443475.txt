Ok, I know this isn't a particularly complex or pretty website, but I
wanted to have something a bit more concrete to talk about. I've included
the URL for a website I did for a commercial customer. They wanted some
images on the page for "visual interest." They consider their main target
audience to be construction contractors and people planning special outdoor
events that need to rent their items. I know that some of the text on the
pages is not particularly clear due to the client's wish to stick to some
euphemistic jargon particular to their industry.

My question is: are the images on the pages likely to provide enough of a
graphical alternative for a non-reader to be able to identify if this page
is worth their interest? I'm trying to understand what level of information
needs to be presented. Is it enough to show associated products or images?
is it a matter of determining if the page is worth the bother of trying to
understand what it says? what are we trying to say the implications are for
a small company that wants to establish it's presence on the web? what is
enough graphics?

Thanks,
