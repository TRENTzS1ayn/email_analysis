Mitake, I visited the website below, and think it is a very nice example of
how graphics can make it easier to understand whaat a web page is about.
The products are shown at the top of the first page, so that someone not
interested in such items can move on without wasting time. For someone
interested in the products, the pictures make it easy to select the exact
items needed from those available. The floor plans for the office trailers
and the portable restrooms make is easier to determine if the products suit
the need. The portable restrooms on the page with the standard porta-potty,
provide the shopper with illustrations of a solution that may not have been
originally considered. 

I didn't see any graphics on the site that I would say were "only" for
visual interest. Good choices of graphics were made so that the ones that
are there help to tell the story of the product line of this supplier. I
would easily label all the included graphics as "meaningful", even the
photo of the two company principals. (It's always helpful to eyeball the
people you will do business with).

For Ann Navarro and others who have been asking for examples, I think this
site is a good "first" example of how "meaningful graphics" can make the
information on a web site accessible to those who depend on graphics for
comprehension. It is a good example of what I mean by the term "meaningful
graphics".
