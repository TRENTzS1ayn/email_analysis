I think that you can find plenty of examples of sites that use
graphics effectively; that's never been in question.  The 
problems arise in defining what exactly are "meaningful
graphics" and how that applies to ALL pages.  Pointing at a site
that manages to use graphics well just tells you that some sites
can use graphics well; perhaps it's due to the nature of this
site (a very tiny catalog of services available from one
company) but it may not be generally applicable to all sites.

A better example would be to take a site that most of us would
agree is very "textual" -- such as the W3C site or Jakob Nielsen's
useit.com -- and explain what graphics are necessary there to
increase understanding for limited textual comprehension users.
