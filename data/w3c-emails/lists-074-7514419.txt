Greeking is a term from design that means "using dummy text
to represent actual text in a layout." It's called such
because the traditional way to "greek" a page is to use
nonsense Greek (or Latin) language phrases instead of the
real text.

In his 17 May 1998 AlertBox column, Jakob Nielsen mentions
the usability benefits of "greeking" a web design to see
if the layout is still usable even without the words.

Testing your design by greeking the text may be a worthwhile
way of seeing if the layout and graphics stand on their own,
and can contribute to increased understanding by limited
textual comprehension users.
