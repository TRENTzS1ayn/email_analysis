The deGRADE script (still in beta version, alas) has left its
original home at Claremont Graduate University and has moved
to the HTML Writers Guild's AWARE Center:

     http://aware.hwg.org/degrade/

What does it do?
 
When designing web pages, it's important to make sure that the
pages will "degrade gracefully". This means that the pages must
remain usable and useful when viewed on browsers that can't
handle the latest in HTML and web design -- even if they don't
look as pretty. 

This web page will let you test out your page with a variety of
different "degrading levels", ranging from a string of pure text
to the latest HTML 4.0 tags. 

Comments are welcome to aware@hwg.org.
