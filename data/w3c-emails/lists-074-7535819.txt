DESIGNING WEB PAGES FOR SIGHT IMPAIRED USERS

If you are involved in making Web pages accessible for users with sight
impairments, check out "Disabled Accessibility: The Pragmatic
Approach," by Jakob Nielsen ("The Alertbox," June 13, 1999 issue).
Nielsen includes a link to the W3 Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
1.0, the W3's prioritized list of design rules, and a very useful
checklist for Web page designers. The article is available at
http://www.useit.com/alertbox/990613.html

"The Alertbox: Current Issues in Web Usability" is a biweekly column by
Dr. Jakob Nielsen, of the Nielsen Norman Group. Back issues are
available on the Web at http://www.useit.com/alertbox/
