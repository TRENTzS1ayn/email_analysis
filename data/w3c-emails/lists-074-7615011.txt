The point about the bidge is that a child makes one out of building bricks.
Bricks have solved many of the problems an expert would be refining.
Other media will be tried, but most often this is the one that succeeds.

Science has move on, however we don't start from the end point, we allow
people to enter from many abilities. Someone will be doing a conversion Msc
perhaps. Training tools (aka bloatware) are no simpler than research tools.
Child centred solutions are not simple, though they are clear, this is due
to the huge depth of context present.


W3C in its presentation is providing a singular entry point, and it is not
accessible or pleasant, for the majority of the population.
It could be.
