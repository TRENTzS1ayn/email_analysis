I agree with David's comments -- the statement above should not
read as it does.  It should read:

   "If you are involved in making Web pages..." FULL STOP.

Well, not full stop, it should be a comma so the rest of the
sentence flows naturally.  But it needs to be recognized that
accessibility is an issue for ALL web designers, not just 
those who deal with "sight impairments".  This is a very
important part of the message!!
