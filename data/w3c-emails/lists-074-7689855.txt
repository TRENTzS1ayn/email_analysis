WAI IG CALL FOR REVIEW: "Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines" Working
Draft
          
The Authoring Tool Guidelines Working Group (AUWG) has prepared a Working
Draft which they would like the WAI Interest Group to review before
publishing on the W3C Technical Reports page. Please review the draft dated
June 21, 1999 at <http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WAI-AUTOOLS-19990621>. Comments
are due by Tuesday, July 6, 1999. Details follow.
         
TIMELINE FOR WAI IG REVIEW:
Please send comments by close of business US Eastern Standard Time,
Tuesday, July 6, 1999, at the latest. Note that this is a two-week review
to provide an opportunity for careful reading and in-depth comments. This
message may be circulated to parties you believe have an interest in
reviewing this draft.
          
WHERE TO SEND COMMENTS:
Send comments to the <w3c-wai-au@w3.org> list. The AUWG mailing list is
archived at <http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au> if you want to

CHANGES:
The list of changes to the document is available at
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/changes>. This draft incorporates discussion from
the face to face meeting of the working group in Toronto. In particular the
techniques have been substantially expanded and separated into a
"Techniques" version of the document, and the topic of accesibility of the
tool has been reduced to a single
guideline, with an extensive set of references.

REVIEW QUESTIONS:
Please address the following questions in reviewing this draft. Other
feedback is also welcome.

1. Is guideline 1 appropriate, and appropriately expressed?
2. Are there terms used in the document whose meaning is not clear?
3. Are there checkpoints which appear to be redundant, or missing?
4. Are there additional techniques or references we should include?
5. Is the document understandable and clear?
6. Does the format/structure of the document work well?
7. Other?
