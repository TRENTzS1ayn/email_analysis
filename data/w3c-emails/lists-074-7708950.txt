As many people know, the US Mint had a posted a close-captioned video after
the fact of the unveiling of the new Dollar Coin  design via a live Webcast.
This was not true close-captioning in that the audio and video controls were
turned off. This was done because of synchronization issues with the
RealPlayer.  
We are pleased to that this file has been replaced with a new file using
"better" technology, called SMIL.  You may now view the close-captioned file
at http://webevents.broadcast.com/usmint/dollarcoin/.  

this is so cool!
