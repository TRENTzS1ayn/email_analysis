Locke was pleased to thank his new friend for identifying the issue as to
whether: a blind man cured would recognise a cube and sphere from sight
alone.

Does anyone know of a later idea that disputes this?

It is pythagorean in its failure to be testable, but do you know of a better
test that differentiates the intellect from the senses?

Text according to Jonathan Ree is mostly temporal due to its intellectual
qualities, whereas the senses are spatial. If I understand him awry.
