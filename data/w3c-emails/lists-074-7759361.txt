The primary problem with Text-only versions of web sites is: they mislead
people.
First- text-only does not equal accessible. A web site can be poorly
designed using only text elements almost as easily as one that includes
sounds and images.
Second- the text-only link is usually hidden at the bottom of a page
somewhere and by the time you find it you have worked your way through the
site anyway.
Third- The practice makes people think only of visual disabilities
Fourth-It encourages poor design (you can always just create another page
instead of making the first one good)
