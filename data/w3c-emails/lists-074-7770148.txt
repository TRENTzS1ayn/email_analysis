All,

as long as we code only for the visually impaired and code text only sites,
little or no progress is going to be made in the areas of coding sites to be
accessible to the myriad of other disabilities out there.

If any one cares to flame me do it privately.  But I will tell you this.  I
was blind till I was fourteen.  I have an auditory impairment and I have at
least one other disability.  Too many people with disabilities think only of
their problem and not of the whole picture.  If true progress is to be made
this attitude has got to change.  It is nothing more than the same attitude
that those without disabilities or impairments have with thin veneer over
the top. "If it does not affect me why should I care?".  We are all human
beings if we are not to help each other, at least get out of the way of
those who would.

Sincerely,

Mike Burks
