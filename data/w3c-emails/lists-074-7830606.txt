Minor nit to pick - it looks like you have chosen your own link color and
visited-link color. For me (using IE 5) it turns out that the colors you
have chosen are the _opposite_ of the default colors (that is, your link
color is the default visited-link color, and your visited-link color is the
default link color).

Makes things kinda confusing at first, because initially it looks to me like
I've visited all the links!

I am using the latest and greatest with images off and didn't even
know there was an image.  gee, If I had wanted to bet to the links
right away, I might have been disapointed.  This is not an acess issue
but you might want to keep that in mind when designing your pages. 
some times, people will want an overview of the links on the page at
the outset like the image map provides but since you've put an
imagemap there it isn't presented to the non graphical user.
