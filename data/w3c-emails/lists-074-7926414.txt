Yeah, I noticed that too.  I never believe "exact time" posts
on the web anyway, though; a friend had me buy him some
concert tickets that went on sale "exactly at 10:00 a.m. over
the web!" and for a variety of technical mishaps they weren't
really available until 10:30 (and that was only because I
could guess at the correct URL when their links didn't work).
