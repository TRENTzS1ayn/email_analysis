Kynn,

Thanks for your thoughtful comments.

It is just one step to get past it to the content for those using readers,
rather than seven steps.

I believe there are a number of

Not all the benefits apply in this situation, as I've detailed below:

This could be an important consideration.

Access on the image map isn't necessary for all users. The links are
presented on the rest of the page loaded with glorious text.

Well, I'm the cat who does the maintenance on the web site, and it's as
easy for me to add or change an icon on the image map as to do so with a
single image on the page. In fact, I've been swapping icons on three
different versions of the page yesteday and today, getting opinions on
which graphics to use for what.

Do you mean that there should be a border around each graphic? That's easy
to do ... I hadn't done it because it would make the graphics look heavier
on the page.

I still have much to learn about style sheets, so I'm not clear what
advantage they have.

If I take out the lines, the design changes, and the icons are not coming
from the open hand. Nevertheless, taking out the lines would break up the
image map into the separate images. I can put a link on the logo, to return
to the home page (it's not used that way in the site now, but I've already
considered adding it because some people may interpret it that way anyway).
Another layout I tried put the logo in the middle with the graphic links
around it ...

I'm using Publisher 98, with a final finish in Front Page to alt tag the
large image. I can tag the smaller images in Publisher, but I can't tag an
image map, perhaps haven't discovered how yet...

It's not Front Page ... the extraneous code is done when Publisher converts
it to html (Publisher doesn't let you edit the html like Front Page does).
When I understand what the code does, and know I don't want it, I'll take
it out. How much loading time is saved? in seconds? milliseconds?

I'd thought of doing that, but not sure if it was helpful and/or would be
another stumbling block for non-graphical users. I do have the picture by
the text on another page on the site: http://www.enabling.org/staff.html
... but wanted to try this one with a simpler graphics & word content for
the opening screen.

Thanks for taking the time to study the page and make suggestions.
