Yes it is, though.  Because they don't know whether or not
they're missing something.

need to be organic and scalable.

I'm saying that by default graphics have borders around them that
are blue or purple if they are used as links.  Getting rid of those
borders (as imagemaps do) kills useful functionality.

Read up on them!  They are very important and can improve accessibility
a lot.  There's some information linked from:

Is this necessary, though?  As it is now, I'm not sure that it is
adequately conveyed that the icons are coming _from_ the open hand,
just that they _link to it_.  If you think it's an _important_ design
consideration (which I'm not personally convinced that it is), then
you may want to use arrows or something besides just a set of
straight lines.  Perhaps curved freehand lines, sorta like comic book
style "speed lines"?

[By the way, an excellent book for web designers is Understanding
 Comics, by Scott McCloud.  Serious!  Even Jakob recommends it.]

Depends on the user's link speed -- for me, it's milliseconds
(here); for users with slower computers and slower connections,
there may be sizable download time (maybe half a second extra)
and some extra processing time as well.

Why a stumbling block?
