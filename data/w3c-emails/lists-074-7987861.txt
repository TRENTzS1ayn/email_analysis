Yes, this helps! I can put the description in a text file on the site. Can
you put the above instructions into html code for me? I don't understand
how to do it from the above directions. Sorry.

Those were earlier attempts, but not everyone in the organization who
should see them had had time to yet. On Try3, I made two photos into line
art, but they don't work as well as I'd hoped (organization and research). 

And don't worry about not understanding the Investments section. It's still
in the works, and even I don't know what the guys are going to want on that
page.
