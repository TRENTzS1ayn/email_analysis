Put the description in some file name, call it navgraph_longdesc.html
(or call it fred.html, I don't care *grin*).

Then after the image insert the following:

<A HREF="navgraph_longdesc.html" TITLE="Long description for this image"
  >d</A>

In the image tag itself, add a LONGDESC attribute.  Here is your
current IMG tag:

<img width="687" height="273" border="0"
src="file:///C:/My%20Documents/ESF/New-Web/img0.gif" alt="Graphical
presentation of links available in full text in the next screen."
usemap="#FrontPageMap0">

The reason it can't be displayed is because it is referring to an
image on your hard drive, not on the web page!  Also, the ALT text
could be changed to something different.  Here is a better take
on the IMG tag:

<IMG SRC="img0.gif"
     WIDTH="687"
     HEIGHT="273"
     BORDER="0"
     ALT="Text links available below"
     USEMAP="#FrontPageMap0"
     LONGDESC="navgraph_longdesc.html">
