Interesting notice regarding the posting of specific information in an
accessible manner to comply with SB 801 described below.  It's a starting
point.

Welcome to the Noelke Texas Supreme Court Opinion Report.  This e-mail
notifies you of the latest Texas Supreme Court opinions published on the web.
To access the opinion click on the address beneath its description.

All state employees receiving this email should consider forwarding this
message to their webmaster.  SB 801, covered below, requires at least certain
portions of state agency web sites to be accessible to people with
disabilities.

Site Check:
Recently enacted legislation:

Common Cause of Texas has posted the changes to the Open Meetings Act on its
site at http://www.ccsi.com/~comcause/news/99oma.html. SB 801, effective
immediately, requires a state agency to "make available through a generally
accessible Internet site: (1) the text of its rules; and (2) any material,
such as a letter, opinion, or compliance manual, that explains or interprets
one or more of its rules and that the agency has issued for general
distribution to persons affected by one or more of its rules."  The act
further provides a state agency "shall design the generally accessible
Internet site so that it conforms to generally acceptable standards for
Internet accessibility for people with disabilities."  Does the act require
the entire site to conform?

See the bill analysis at
http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlo/76r/analysis/SB00801H.HTM.  For an example
of a site designed to address internet accessibility for people with
disabilities, see the Bobby site at http://www.cast.org/bobby/.

Please forward this to others in your office or firm.
Thank you,
