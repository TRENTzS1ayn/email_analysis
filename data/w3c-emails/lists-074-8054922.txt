Dear Guru's,

I would much appreciate (accessibility) feedback on the form/database at:
http://www.dors.state.md.us/cgi-bin/homemods.cgi

I've looked at the WCAG regarding forms, and I am a little mystified 
regarding suggestions for the LABEL attribute.  The utility of ACCESSKEY 
also excapes me for this purpose (only two parameters, and one uses radio 
buttons).

I've followed the suggestion for putting in "starter" text (using VALUE), 
but this is ugly.  Does it really help?  Is there a way to have the starter 
text "selected" so that if the user types (without clicking) the text that 
was already there would disappear?  Databases frequently work this way.

Is it desireable to avoid forms?  I read somewhere (I don't think it was 
the WCAG) that email should be maintained as an alternative to a feedback 
form -- since not every browser deals with forms gracefully.  If this is 
true, how, in general, does one generate dynamic content without using a 
form?  (I could give detailed directions for our "home modifications 
directory" since the form only generates two parameters, but is this even 
desireable?)

I am just starting with PERL and am feeling really brain dead at this 
point.  Can anyone give me the PERL script for deleting a leading period or 
space from a scalar variable?

Thanks very much.
