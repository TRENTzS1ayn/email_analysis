Hello David,

In Portugal, the new multimedia ATMs were prepared for blind people.
There is a key to activate voice instructions for blind customers.

Concerning web accessibility, we are waiting good news
from the Portuguese Parliament and Government at the end
of the next week.
 
Regards

>WELLS FARGO, CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF THE BLIND
>ANNOUNCE NATION'S FIRST PLAN FOR TALKING ATMS
>
>
>        SAN FRANCISCO, CA  June 23, 1999 - Wells Fargo and the
>California Council of the Blind announced today what they believe to
>be the first plan in the nation for developing and installing talking
>ATMs.  The plan calls for Wells Fargo to pilot 20 talking ATMs in the
>Bay Area and Los Angeles and San Diego counties.  After the successful
>completion of the pilot next year, Wells Fargo will begin to install a
>talking ATM at each of the more than 1,500 Wells Fargo ATM locations
>in California.
>
>        The technology, still in development, will give voice
>instruction to users who cannot read information on an ATM screen, on
>how to deposit money, withdraw cash, transfer funds and buy stamps. 
>The ATMs will have audio jacks to deliver voice information privately
>to protect the security of blind and low vision users.
>
>        "Wells Fargo has shown a tremendous commitment to the blind
>and low vision community, more than any other financial services
>company in the nation that we know of," said Catherine Skivers,
>president of the California Council of the Blind.  "They've worked
>hard with us to improve access to their ATMs for a very important
>segment of customers."
>
>        "Our number one priority is customer service.  We've been
>following the development of this promising technology and we look
>forward to testing and rolling out talking ATMs and to working closely
>with the California Council of the Blind to improve ATM access for
>vision impaired customers," said Terri Dial, Wells Fargo's head of
>retail banking in California.
>
>        The California Council, with 46 chapters statewide, is an
>affiliate of the American Council of the Blind.  Four blind
>individuals; the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund,
>Berkeley; the law firm of Saperstein, Goldstein, Demchak & Baller,
>Oakland; and the Law Office of Elaine B. Feingold, Berkeley; also
>participated in the planning.
>
>        In California, Wells Fargo - a diversified financial services
>company - provides banking, insurance, investments, mortgages, and
>consumer finance from more than 1,300 stores and other distribution
>channels.
