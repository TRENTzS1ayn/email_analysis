The following comments are intended both for WAI and Anne so please pick
your way.
My interests and concerns are different to Kynn's. In this instance
primarily the transparency of the graphics. (These are only
notes, the machine has already crashed once, and its late!)
www.mayer-johnson.com have a very useful American and blunt/clear/direct
set of symbols. 
Many of our students use Makaton symbols, but for copyright reasons
these are not available on the www. 
Rebus is another amongst many.
Any of these will give a list of common words, in all cases about
300-2000 in all.

It is difficult to comment on this page in isolation. Motivation is the
single most important factor in deciding the value of a piece of work.
The links are critical.

Enabling Support Foundation 
Transparent and excellent, though could be a bit 'begging' perhaps for
some.

Money
    This graphic is transparent, however it may have a different
meaning to that intended. Only ~25% of our students have access to a
significant proportion of their disposable income.

Accommodations
    Independent living is a very important issue for many, and the most
able, are often in conflict with nervous responsible persons.
A house with a bed(s) inside might be clearer, though Hospital could be
a confusion. Rooms to rent perhaps.
The plural in UK English has a different meaning.

Education
    This is rather New England for us. A chalkboard in the house is
good(though our day centre has not got one). Barthes suggested a pitcher
of water, for lecturer. Photos are a good starting point

Organisation
This word is a little unusual, and its meaning varied. Photos of the
people would be helpful, especially if recognised. Then link to details
ie boss/plumber/phone numbers... 
Punning is a serious problem this is a Jigsaw. Soap is OK with the more
able, but a coke can for 'I Can@ is a known issue and not worth the
candle.

Affiliates
Not used much in UK, colleagues, associates use Friend(s) ie (people
or) hands shaking.

Research
If a list of questions, how about a few crosses.
Seems OK could be good for those learning to read.

The Lines
personally I feel best avoided. The context of placing the images all
on a page is sufficient, perhaps surrounding the hand, with short lines. 
More likely the hand on a home page linking to the six and then onwards.


I would love to use your 'hand' or something similiar, as a link when
you have more to link to, please.
