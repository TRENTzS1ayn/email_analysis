Dear David and Kynn (et al.)

Thanks very much for the feedback.

I like how IE handles the LABEL tag, although this may lead to abuse.  Why 
not multiple LABEL tags for a single ID?  (Or is this okay anyway?)  LABEL 
could also be used this way to create "hidden" intra-document links and a 
poor man's (javascript free though) menu bars.  Using CSS, intra-document 
links could then have a very different presentation from regular text links 
(within a <A HREF>...</A>).

Do any other browsers (or screen readers) do anything with LABEL yet?

Kynn, just so I can better begin to understand reading PERL (and I 
appriciate the maxim that it is easier to write than read), how about the 
expression to delete one (and only one) leading period?

Thanks,
Bruce
