I'd be interested in seeing such sites also. I'd also like to be able to 
convince the artists I work with that it is possible... Actually, I'd like 
to convince myself that it is possible. I'd very much like to say that 
"yes, I'm blind , but I can still access this highly vissual site because 
they used X and Y features of html4 ... etc."

Subject:Highly Graphical Whiz-Bang Bells-and-Whistles Accessible Sites

I'm looking for some examples of very graphic web sites designed
by fancy artist types that contain all sorts of sophisticated
neat bells and whistles but still manage to remain *demonstrably
accessible* [i.e., they can pass Bobby] without the use of a
text-only version of the site.

As I was explaining to a friend, the "accessibility meme" spreads
very slowly among graphically oriented artist types, I suspect
because they have hear the myths (http://aware.hwg.org/why/myths.html)
that accessible web sites are visually boring web sites.  And
thus you get pages such as I design (http://www.hwg.org,
http://aware.hwg.org/, http://www.kynn.com) which are accessible
and rather "cleanly laid out" but are far from visually stimulating
or artistic.

So what are examples of sites loaded up with the newest and the
loudest technology that still degrade nicely?  I ask for sites that
can pass Bobby because I need to _show_ people that these sites
are accessible, and when you're dealing with a graphical web
designer type, it's much more impressive to _show_ them something
like Bobby compliance than to _tell_ them "a blind friend of mine
says she can use this site."  "Show, not tell" is an important
cliche!
