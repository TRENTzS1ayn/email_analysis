Is netscape really broken when it comes to changing colors and fonts etc. 
Both netscape and ie have ways of setting colors for text background links 
etc, and for fonts, different from those set by the page author. I've 
varified that this does work with ie, but can't seem to convince netscape 
to do this.

Good point -- I noticed this myself a while ago.  Link color is a
very subtle but valuable tool that web surfers rely on.

Whenever possible you should _not_ change the link colors; it's
worse to change inline link colors than to change a menubar link
color.  As an example, please see the HTML Writers Guild's web
site at:

     http://www.hwg.org/

We have deliberately chosen to use blue links and purple visited
links because this is what many users expect.  (The link colors for
the left menu bar are changed, however, since they serve a
different purpose and clearly are a navigation structure, while
inline links are a different story.)

This increases the usability of the site by taking advantage of
the fact that nearly every web user who uses a graphical browser
is familiar with "blue is unvisited, purple is visited."

If you're going to change the link colors, you need to be careful
how you do it -- make sure that the most obvious color is the
"unvisited" one, and something more subdued is the "visited".
Squint at your page or run it through the Greeker and see what
colors stand out the most.

Never, ever, ever do what was done on this page -- never use blue
and purple BUT REVERSED.  That will only serve to drive web
users insane.  If you're going to use blue and purple as link
colors, you MUST use them in the "normal" way or else you are
seriously damaging the usability of your site.
