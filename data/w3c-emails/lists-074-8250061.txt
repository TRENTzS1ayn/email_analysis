I reached the site using the suggested method below, but after using the
reformatting option of the  Jaws screen reader, IE 4.01 reported that an
error had occurred in line 476, and that the object or property was not
supported when I pressed page down to read the second page.  I don't know if
the site or screen reader caused the problem.

I could not get directly to this link (with IE nor Lynx) when I
first 
tried.  Navigator had no problems though!

If you have trouble, try following the link for "Technology" from
their 
home page.  This is URL:
http://www.msnbc.com/news/TECH_Front.asp?a
And then scroll down to the "Technology and Society" group where
"Internet 
offers freedom to disabled" is the first article.  Even going this
way, I 
could not get Lynx to bring up the article!

Good luck with linking to this one Kynn!
