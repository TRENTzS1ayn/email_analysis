Description:
   Announcing the Any-Browser Email Discussion List This list has been
   designed to fill the void left by the no longer active Netscape and
   Internet Explorer discussion lists. This list is an unmoderated
list
   which allows members to discuss web browser usage, bugs, how-to's.
   This list is a give-and-take list which will allow members to post
and
   answer questions. Any web browser may be discussed, including
Internet
   Explorer, Netscape Navigator and Communicator, Opera, Mosaic, Hot
   Java... even AOL's browser. Dont be shy! If you have a question,
ask
   it... if you know the answer to a question, give it! The whole idea
is
   to help when you can and ask when you need to...
