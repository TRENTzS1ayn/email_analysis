Kynn,

The suggestion of a stack of books, one book for lowest level, tall stack
for highest level, in-betweens with less books, would be excellent. As you
said, there currently is no clear graphic that would indicate
literary/reading level, so there must be a start somewhere. If the graphic
is intuitive enough, others will adopt it ... 

I also agree that the navigation symbols are easier to use at the bottom
of the page rather than the top. As I read each page, I had to scroll back
to the top to get to the button to go to the next page. Whatever button are
used, I think they are easier to use if they say "previous" and "next" no
matter the shape or color. This would follow the convention used in highway
signs, e.g. STOP and YIELD, which are both unique shapes and colors, but
have the word on them also.

On the beginner's page, I also liked the addition of the sound link to
read the page to the user. The voice is good, doesn't "talk down" to the
user, and is much better than a synthesized voice doing the same text. 

Anne
