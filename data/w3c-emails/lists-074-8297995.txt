Several people have requested a copy of the stylesheet serving
program at http://aware.hwg.org/ that allows the user to choose
from a set of stylesheets and saves that selection via a HTTP
cookie.  (See http://aware.hwg.org/styles/ for a demo.)

You can now download a copy of this script from my web site
at:

     http://www.kynn.com/vstyle/

Note that this is KynnWare not GuildWare; the code belongs to Kynn
the individual and co-owner of Idyll Mountain Internet, not the
HTML Writers Guild.

Enjoy!
