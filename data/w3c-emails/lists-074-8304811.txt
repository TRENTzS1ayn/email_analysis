RealSlideshow: Almost Ready for Prime Time
RealNetworks brings low-bandwidth streaming media to your Website, harnessing SMIL, the Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language. This free tool lets you synchronize video, audio, still images, text, and transitions to make compelling presentations.

Sure, you can use DHTML for sound and motion in your Website, but writing the raw code in HTML is a pain. Authoring tools such as Dreamweaver and our just-reviewed Adobe GoLive 4.0 make it easier, but RealSlideshow makes it easier still with multiple timelines, selectable resolution and data rates, and easy editing. You can choose among built-in transitions, crop, and set the desired bandwidth, and RealSlideshow does the heavy lifting of compressing the audio and video and writing the necessary HTML to produce your show.

It's not fair to expect too much from a free tool, but some capabilities could have been enhanced without a lot of additional effort. While the product has a background audio track and a voice-over track that ties into each image, that's it for audio. If you need more than that, such as transition sounds, you'll have to pre-mix them into the voice track.

We like it a lot; find out what it needs before we'd love it madly.
