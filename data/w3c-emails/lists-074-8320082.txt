All,

I need some help,

does anyone know of any courses being developed for producing accessible
distance learning ?  Particularly those that may involve using multimedia.
Actually any online courses that are accessible would be helpful as well. I
only know of one, but there may be others.


Thanks in advance.

Sincerely,

Mike Burks
