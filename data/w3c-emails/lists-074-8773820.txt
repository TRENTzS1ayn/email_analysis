I don't like the "bashing" myself, either.  This is why I'd
rather praise a site that's getting better (e.g., Microsoft)
rather than find ways to label them as "inaccessible."

Sometimes, though, there's amusement in the irony of going to
a supposed "accessibility site" and seeing an empty frameset;
I view that as less of bashing and more of bemusement.  I
usually attribute that to an oversight on someone's part
rather than on stupidity or ignorance.
