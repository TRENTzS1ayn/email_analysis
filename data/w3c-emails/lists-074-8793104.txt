My mantra is that once you learn it, it's not that hard at all
to do.

The only reason sites are inaccessible is due to ignorance on
the part of web designers; of course, overcoming ignorance is
never "easy".  Learning the "right way" is harder than just
"doing whatever seemed to work", but the benefits are many.

Once you've invested the time to learn, it's actually easier
to make an accessible site than to purposely break HTML and
make one that's inaccessible.

That's my mantra, and I'm sticking to it.
