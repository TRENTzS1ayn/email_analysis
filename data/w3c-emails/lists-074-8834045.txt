I disagree.  Nobody cares about the disabled except perhaps as
objects of pity.  This is why we have laws requiring access to
public buildings, for example -- because nobody, out of the
goodness of their hearts, will just do it because it's "right".
People only care when they're forced to care.  [Insert analogy
here regarding forced integration in the South, BTW -- except
that I don't really want to go down that tangent, since I think
it's a poor chosen analogy.]

(Of course the above is over-stated; however, as a generalization
it's true for the majority of society.  If your view on ethics
and morality were right, then there would be _no_ barriers left
for the disabled to overcome, because the able-bodied would be
eagerly going out of their way to eliminate all obstacles.  This
isn't the case, because people aren't "ethical" and "moral.")

I think you misinterpreted what I said.  (Plus, in your third on
what you don't like, you referred to "human nature" anyway.)

Why is accessibility for the blind on "higher moral ground" than
accessibility for the poor, accessibility for the users of non-
standard web browsers, or accessibility for international users?

I think you need to very carefully back up and reconsider why
you hold disabled users up on a pedestal they haven't necessarily
asked to be placed on, and are promoting their concerns as the
only "moral" ones we face.  _My_ moral high ground is "accessibility
for everyone" not "accessibility for anyone who isn't as physically
functional as the typical person."

The latter high ground sounds awful condescending -- but then, it
should be noted that I'm not a disabled person.
