How much time, on the average, has a web designer who's trying
to design web sites spent learning how to do so?

Are you asking for figures that can be accurately measured 
here? 

How much time, on the average, has a web designer who's trying
to include images on her website spent learning how to do so?

I don't know if such figures even exist.  How long does it take
to learn how to make TABLEs?  You tell me. :)

Uhm.  What is a web site, and what is an inaccessible web site,
and what does accessible mean?

None of those terms mean anything out of context.  However, I
can always come up with a figure such as:

$1000.

There, now, what did _that_ tell you? :)

Well, I said I wasn't guessing, and told you why, but you didn't
seem interested. :)

I still don't get your point.  Adding anything to a web page
takes time.  Learning how to make broken web pages takes time.
Learning how to make Shockwave movies or animated gifs takes
time.  Learning how to make an HTML page or use an FTP program
takes time.

What exactly is the point of the "time argument"?  Is it "we
shouldn't bother, this is too hard for anyone to learn, let's
give up"?  Way to claim the moral high ground!  I think it's
easy to learn enough to make a difference -- you can learn "ALWAYS
USE ALT TEXT" in five minutes! -- and I don't understand why you
insist that this is rocket science that nobody will ever be able
to do since it takes too long.

Define "entirely accessible".  I've never heard of such a
thing before.  Have you?

Okay, so let's see, now you're going to tell me that out of the
goodness of their hearts, well-meaning idealistic moral ethical
people are going to donate several hundred dollars' worth of time
because it's "good" to throw bones to the handicapped?  :)

I know, I'm crossing the streams, and that's dangerous, but I
think your objections are at odds with each other.

I'm the person who started the "AIE it's HUGE" thread.  Are you
surprised that I call it "slogging"? :)

Anyway, once more:

It's not trivial to learn this, but it's worth it, and once you
do, it's easy.
