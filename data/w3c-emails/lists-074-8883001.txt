I have only recently joined the list. I teach adults with learning
difficulties who are mostly non-readers.

I feel that the arguments about accessibility are misplaced.

One persons paradise is another's hell.
Japanese language sites have their uses and probably will do so for the
foreseeable future.
That is I suggest that my group would benefit MOST by finding sites that are
already extant and accessible.

I am looking for and researching search engines that allow one to qualify
the content.

Interactivity
Whitespace
Filesize
Number of words
Flesch reading ease

Well these are a few, and you will have your own

Why is their not a search engine that uses personal Qualia to refine the
search?
