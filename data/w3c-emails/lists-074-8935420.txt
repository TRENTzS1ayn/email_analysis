I have only been on the www 6 months so do not expect too much.

I would certainly be interested in links to interactive sites with little or
no text, please send them to me.


Links to interactive sites with little or no text:  http://www.peepo.com ~40

A word count is ~ no extra work for a spider.

ie finding the words, rather than counting them.

I have subscribed thanks for the nod.

To be sure once I have seen a little of what goes on I shall.
