Good comments Gregg. 

I've watched this conversation go on for the past couple of days; it's
quite interesting. Interesting to me because I'm in the middle of writing a
book on web accessibility. The first couple of chapters are devoted to the
theme, "Why You Should Make Your Web Site Accessible". Almost everything
that's been stated thus far I've accounted for, including the usabilty
factor which I believe to be my primary motivation. But there's also
another reason which I also believe to be important, particularly from a
historical standpoint. That is that technology created or enhanced to
benefit people with disabilities has often led to emerging and/or advanced
technology that then goes on to benefit mankind in general. I am convinced
that pushing technology to new heights hinges on this development cycle.
