  Instead of posting "Look what a bad job they did" or "Look at how
  uncaring or ignorant they are" posts we should be posting these as 
  problems we encounter  and here is a possible solution and invite
others
  to give further solutions.

to add some empirical data:

as someone who joined this list to learn where to learn about a specific
aspect of gaining access to the WWW and who stays on the list to keep
abreast of advancements and refinements in the relevant technologies,
postings of the "this site is very unaccessible" nature serve only to
reduce the listserv's signal-to-noise ratio from my perspective.

i'd much prefer that such postings be placed on a separate listserv
altogether: those who wish to receive such information could do so
without having to wade through the complaints of those who do not. 

on the other hand, constructive criticism of the type that lake suggests
would let less experienced persons like myself learn more quickly about
the fine points of accessible HTML and other relevant technologies. -jp2
