An excellent point. But misinterpretation occurs on both
ends, so I think we should say that both sender *and*
receiver should read, reread, and give the other the benefit
of the doubt (or ask for further clarification). I apologize
if any of my posts or rebuttals have been interpreted as
hostile or offensive. None were intended that way, and, in
fact, I've been reading, rereading, and testing replies on
my wife just to make sure. That some of them still appear to
have given offense simply makes the above point. I also
apologize if I have misinterpreted the posts of others. In
several cases, I have asked for clarification before
replying.

But, I must also say this: In my experience, many people
have difficulty separating disagreement from disapproval. If
I take a position opposing what another believes, that alone
may be interpreted by the other as an attack on him or her
personally. It would behoove all of us, I think, to refrain
from making these issues personal.
