WAI IG CALL FOR REVIEW: Updated Page Author Guidelines Working Draft

The WAI Page Author Guidelines Working Group would like to publish an
updated version of the Page Author Guidelines on the W3C Technical Reports
page. Please review and comment on the new draft, dated January 4th
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-19990104>. Comments are due by
January 12th. Details follow.

PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING CHANGES TO THE GUIDELINES:
1. Note that there is now a checklist of checkpoints associated with the
guidelines draft:
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-19990104/full-checklist>
These checkpoint lists are rough (notice the placeholders in the top
headers), but should indicate the direction the Working Group is heading. 
2. The techniques document has also been updated:
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-19990104/wai-pageauth-tech>
3. The Working Group has removed priorities from the guidelines.
4. The points following each rationale in the guidelines are called
"checkpoints" rather than "techniques." There are several reasons for this:
a) in discussions, people were miscommunicating about the techniques in the
techniques document, and the techniques in the guidelines. b) a technique
is a concrete way to satisfy a checkpoint. 
5. The issues list has been split into two documents: one for the
guidelines document <http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wai-gl-issues.html> and one
for the techniques document
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wai-gl-tech-issues.html>. The Working Group is
adding additional material to these lists. 
6. For more information on document status and changes, go to
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wai-gl-wd-changes.html> and see Wendy Chisholm's
note to WAI IG at
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/1998OctDec/0517.html>.

TIMELINE FOR WAI IG REVIEW: 
Please send comments by close of business US Eastern Standard Time,
Tuesday, January 12, at the latest. Earlier comments appreciated. WAI IG
comments will be incorporated before the document is posted on the W3C
Technical Reports page, to replace the current Page Author Guidelines
Working Draft (dated September 18). 

WHERE TO SEND COMMENTS:
Please send comments to the <w3c-wai-gl@w3.org> list. The GL WG mailing
list is archived from the Page Author Guidelines Working Group home page at
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL> if you would like to view other people's comments.

REVIEW QUESTIONS:
1.  Are there outstanding issues, or gaps in the content, which must be
addressed before these can become a W3C Proposed Recommendation? 
2.  Is the language clear -- keeping in mind that we assume the audience
has some knowledge of HTML, and that the WAI Education & Outreach Working
Group is producing instructional materials & simplified versions of this
for other audiences?
3.  Does the checklist help a person obtain a quick overview and
understanding of principles of accessible Web design?

THANK YOU: 
...for your time reviewing this material, and thanks to the Chairs, Editors
and Members of the Page Author Working Group who have been developing this
draft.

If you have any questions on this process, please contact Gregg
Vanderheiden (gv@trace.wisc.edu), Wendy Chisholm (chisholm@trace.wisc.edu),
