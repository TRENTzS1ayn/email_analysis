I think that's one of the more important points behind the Authoring Tools
guideline.  There are far too many tools out there that don't consider
accessibility at all.  In fact, there are too many tools out there that
create pages 'optimised' for one browser, which creates problems for
*everyone* that doesn't use that browser.

In a perfect world, you'd need to learn a bit about HTML, its history and
uses before you could put a page on the web.  In the real world, it would
just be nice if more of the tools used to create pages took care of the
accessibility issues for you.

It seems as though most of the time I spend on accessibility issues is
reminding/explaining to designers why x is inaccessible or why you need to
consider case y.  Such as using style sheets to create columns.  A series
of topics when the style sheets are turned on appear as

Topic 1   Topic 3   Topic 5
Topic 2   Topic 4   Topic 6

This way, if style sheets aren't on, the topics appear in order down the
page.  At least twice this was explained to people who wanted the columns
to appear as


Topic 1   Topic 2   Topic 3
Topic 4   Topic 5   Topic 6

Which would be a complete hash if style sheets were turned off.
