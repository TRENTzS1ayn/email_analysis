I need to find out about how well browsers and screenreaders handle
pictures with selectable areas, i.e. image maps. I have a sample image map at

http://astro.temple.edu/~kasday/web_access/image_map.html

If you have a browser and screenreader... or a browser that combines those
functions, would you take a quick look and see if it reads the text labels
attached to the selectable area?  Please email results back to me at
kasday@acm.org   .

I'll post results back to the list.

Thanks!

Len

p.s.
I currently have access to two browsers. Only one of them sees the labels.
