JAWS for Windows does. It reads, "North period. South period. East period.
West period," as you tab to each link in IE 4.01.

Lynx does. I imagine it works with a screeen reader pretty transparently.
(This is probably obvious, but once it is said people can be sure that
they don't need to repeat it, instead of just being fairly sure. *smile*)

at

  If you have a browser and screenreader... or a browser that combines those
  functions, would you take a quick look and see if it reads the text labels
  attached to the selectable area?  Please email results back to me at
  kasday@acm.org   .

  I'll post results back to the list.

  Thanks!

  p.s.
  I currently have access to two browsers. Only one of them sees the labels.
