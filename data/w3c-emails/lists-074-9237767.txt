pwWebSpeak 2.5 reads the alt text labels when stepping through the image
map.

If you have a browser and screenreader... or a browser that combines those
functions, would you take a quick look and see if it reads the text labels
attached to the selectable area?  Please email results back to me at
kasday@acm.org   .

I'll post results back to the list.

Thanks!

Len

p.s.
I currently have access to two browsers. Only one of them sees the labels.
