Designers are struggling with the concept, "How to make an electronic 
commerce website that has an on-line catalog and purchase form that is 
universally accessible, built to HTML 3.2, and attractive to sighted 
viewers."  Any suggestions of sites?  Please feel free suggest web sites 
that were done with Cascading Style Sheets and HTML 4, but please include a 
footnote.

thanks, rob
