IBM Home Page Reader (Version 2; see www.ibm.com/sns) comes to the map and
speaks: "Map, skipping four items" as it should. If you stop and review the
items in the map you hear the compass directions as you would expect.

IBM Screen Reader/2
   Netscape for OS/2 v2.02 does not render the alt text for image maps.
Screen Reader/2 v2.01 ignores the maps completely.
   Lynx for OS/2 works with Screen Reader/2, and therefore speaks the
directions in the image map.
