I need to evaluate
http://www.cityofla.org/ANGELSWALK/index.htm
for accessibility and am having trouble with the HTML. Sincle I'm blind, I
also am not sure what the intention of the author is (vissually speaking).
Here's a couple of mysteries I need help with:
Note: I'm using IE4.x and Jaws for Windows as my screen reader.

1)      When first displaying the page, I see an MAP, which seems to be an 
image
with hotspots to click on. When I clicked on one, it took me to a page with
pointers back to the homepage and seemingly nothing else. When I used the
tab key to move link to link, I started hearing what appeared to be section
numbers. Sure enough, clicking on these numbers got me to some text. What
is the intention here?
2)      NextLink, a blurb saying see page 30. Using the screen-reader 
functions
to read the page by line, this link seems to be imbeded in some text
describing the cover. The text, however, is not read when the page first
displays. It does *sometimes* appear when I use the "format page" jaws
function. I think this goes through the internet explorer internal
objective discription of the document and changes the layout to allow
easier reading. It creates single columns out of multiple ones and changes
the position of frames to make them more readable. However, this document
appears to make no use of frames, so why isn't the text spoken when the
page is loaded?
3)      There is text (which is spoken on loading) which says "choose a
section... No section numbers are spoken on loading but when using the tab
key to navigate from link to link, they are spoken. Why?

I hope at least some of this makes sense. I'm not real sure how to describe
this stuff. Again, any help is much much appreciated.
