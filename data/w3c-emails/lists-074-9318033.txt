Dear Friends and Colleagues:

I am writing to you to let you know that I am writing a book on Web
Accessibility for IDG Books World Wide. IDG Books is one of the leading
international publishers of computer and technical books in world. They are
most famous for their "For Dummies" series of books. This book, is not of
that series. It is positioned in their professional series of computer
reference publications. However, it will still enjoy wide distrbution on an
international basis.

As part of the writing effort (of which I am half-way through), I am
implementing a section of the book dedicated solely to those companies and
organizations who have their own web sites and specifically support people
with disabilities. If you would like to have your site featured in the
book, please respond to me by e-mail with the following information:

1. Name of Organization/Company
2. Web Site URL (address)
3. Description of Site and/or Mission Statement of Organization (1-2
paragraphs at most)
4. If possible, please attach a bitmap image (.BMP) of your home page. This
is not mandatory. I'll have to make decisions about how much of the page we
can display in the book. Regardless, your entry will contain a snap shot of
the web site in the book.
5. A statement granting me and the publisher the right to use this data and
image.

If you are not part of a company or organization, but your web site
provides a specific service that supports people with disabilities, please
feel free to submit your entry as well. I will be very happy t

International organizations and companys who maintain American English
versions of their web sites (even as a secondary option) are especially
encouraged to submit sites. This book will be published throughout the
world and in several different languages. 

It goes without saying that the book will be published in braille and
electronic text for the blind.

Please feel free to post this message to other disability-related e-mail
listservs 

Regarding the book, for the most part it is a technical reference guide
focusing exclusively on web accessibility. Design, programming concepts,
multimedia, tools, utilities, emerging technology  etc..etc... More
importantly, it is a book that I hope will increase awareness about
accessibility and, as a result, stimulates development of accessible
interfaces of the future.

I am quite excited about this book. IDG is putting in an incredible effort
to publicize it. If all goes well, we are timing the release of the book
with the WWW8 conference in Toronto. However, I hope to have exerpts
prepared for the 1999 CSUN Conference too.

Regards and thanks,

Mike Paciello
