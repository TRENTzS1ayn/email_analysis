I am new to CSS and am wondering if there are any example accessible templates.  Also, is it possible to create CSS in a text editor or basic word processor like Notepad?
Since tables in particular are generally difficult, though not impossible, to make accessible to people using screen reading technology which I myself use, are there any standard CSS layouts for tables 
-Thanks in advance,
