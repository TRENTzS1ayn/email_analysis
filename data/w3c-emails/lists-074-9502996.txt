When I was at Microsoft, Greg Lowney put together some CSS templates. They
are available at http://microsoft.com/enable/products/ie4.htm 

The two style sheets he put together are high contrast styles with large
text.

Subject: Example accessible CSS templates?


    
I am new to CSS and am wondering if there are any example accessible
templates.  Also, is it possible to create CSS in a text editor or basic
word processor like Notepad?
Since tables in particular are generally difficult, though not impossible,
to make accessible to people using screen reading technology which I myself
use, are there any standard CSS layouts for tables 
-Thanks in advance,
