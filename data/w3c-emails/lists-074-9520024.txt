CALL FOR PROPOSALS


The Program Committee of the conference on Computers, Freedom, and
Privacy (CFP99) is seeking proposals for the ninth annual CFP,
which will be held in Washington DC between April 6th and April 8th
1999 at the Omni Sheraton Hotel.

CFP is the leading Internet policy conference. For almost a decade,
CFP has shaped the public debate on the future of privacy and
freedom in the online world. The CFP audience is diverse with
representatives from government, business, education, non-profits
and the media. The themes are broad and forward-looking. CFP
explores what will be, not what has been. It is the place where the
future is mapped.

The theme of the 1999 CFP conference is "The Global Internet."
Proposals are welcomed on all aspects of privacy and freedom. The
1999 Program Committee is particularly interested in receiving
proposals that deal with:

        ACCESS TO THE INTERNET, particularly those relating to
        globalization and governance. Of particular interest are
        issues of privacy, censorship, free speech and access.

        INTERNATIONAL ISSUES, especially the emerging issues of global
        privacy protection, encryption policy, international
        principles of human rights, regulation, legislation, and
        copyright.

        ELECTRONIC COMMERCE, including the impact of payment systems,
        regulations, and technical standards on personal freedom and
        privacy.

        CULTURE AND LANGUAGE ON THE INTERNET, such as the significance
        of diversity, multilingualism, and cultural representation

We strongly encourage proposals that involve leading experts,
innovators, policymakers, and thinkers.

The CFP99 Program Committee will finalize the selection of
proposals by February 1, 1999, and all proposals must be received
by January 15, 1999 Please follow the submission guidelines below.
