Hi,

Just a short note to say that Betsie is now live on the following URL:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/betsie/

Betsie is a CGI gateway script that (hopefully) can make a large
inaccessible site accessible in one fell swoop. Or at least more
accessible - the gap between the legacy code and code that, together
with Betsie, *is* accessible, is smaller than the gap between the legacy
code and code that is accessible in and of itself.

All comments / criticism / suggestions etc will be gratefully received.

Cheers etc.,

Wayne Myers
