Hi Larry,  I received your request for assistance via the list that Lake
mentioned.  I may be able to assist.  I am a blind individual who has
been using and working with screenreaders for several years.  If I can
answer questions for you, I'd be happy to do so.  I noticed you
mentioned a new system.  what are you working with?  most screen reading
software available today can directly voice windows 3.x and 9.x systems
and a couple work with nt.
unix even has some stuff but the x-windows stuff is not quite there yet.
I use Jaws for windows with all flavors of windows and have used the mac
as well.  I train and otherwise work with several of the screen readers
also.
Please let me know how I can help.
Thanks!
