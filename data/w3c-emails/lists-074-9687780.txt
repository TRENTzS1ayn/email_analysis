The Evaluation and Repair Interest Group mailing list with archives at
<http://lists.w3.org/w3c-wai-er-ig/> has discussed this issue sporadically.
 That is the group whose charter relates directly to this issue.  An

far down the road toward a pass/fail designation without an adequate backup
for the criterion.
