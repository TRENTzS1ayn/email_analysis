I had the same experience.  I use JFW 3.2 with IE 4.01.  specifically the 404 file not found came up when I tried "BBC Online", "BBC News Online", "BBC World Service".  The main Betsie page cam up fine as well as the About Betsies page.

Maybe it would be worth listing what browsers/readers "404" users are
using, because it worked fine for me, but then I'm just using plain old
netscape.

*very interested in how this goes.
