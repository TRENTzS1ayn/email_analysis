There is a mailing list for blind linux users which is a good place to
find screen reading programs for linux. THere are a number of them around
- svlpro, ultrasonix, screader are the ones that spring immediately to my
memory. If anyone is interested I will dig out the URI for the list
archive.

  Hi Larry,  I received your request for assistance via the list that Lake
  mentioned.  I may be able to assist.  I am a blind individual who has
  been using and working with screenreaders for several years.  If I can
  answer questions for you, I'd be happy to do so.  I noticed you
  mentioned a new system.  what are you working with?  most screen reading
  software available today can directly voice windows 3.x and 9.x systems
  and a couple work with nt.
  unix even has some stuff but the x-windows stuff is not quite there yet.
  I use Jaws for windows with all flavors of windows and have used the mac
  as well.  I train and otherwise work with several of the screen readers
  also.
  Please let me know how I can help.
  Thanks!
