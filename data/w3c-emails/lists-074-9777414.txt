I have just returned from the BETT Exhibition (Technology in Education) in
London where, upon arrival I made straight to the BBC Education stand to see
Betsie after reading about its launch in today's Times newspaper.
Unfortunately the staff on the stand weren't too sure about Betsie and in
fact informed be the launch was to be on Saturday! However thay were
extremely helpful and polite and were were able to pull up the site from the
show stand. I understand that Betsie will only work succesfully with sites
built specifically designed for it. I'd be grateful for feedback on this
Wayne.

I am to do a brief presentation on the subject of "Universal Internet
Access - Selling the Idea to Business" this Thursday. I am considering the
principle design of a Univesal Access Document Object Model (DOM) as a
platform for future Web page designs, The core principle being that web
pages should be designed with accessibility built in rather that employing a
retrofitting process of stripping-out inaccessible coding or graphics. I am
considering utlising XML and Cascading Style Sheets as a basis for the model
and I would be most grateful if any in the mailing group know of, or have
had any experince in the design of Internet and Intranet sites using XML.

Many thanks in advanced anticipation


Mike Marshall


P.S.

I have just been to the Betsie site on my machine at home and have had no
problem accessing the site and links from either Internet Explorer 4.01 or
Netscape. Well done to Wayne and the team at the BBC for their efforts, it's
nice to know that the motivation to make the Intenet accessible to all
exists in a country where we do not have a Law such as the ADA snapping at
our heels.
