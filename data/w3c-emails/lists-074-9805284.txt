Probably not, it's a theoritical example of what a browser, a proxy or
a screen reader could to, provided the additional TABLE markup was
there.

There's a chicken&egg issue here. If user agents do not support a
functionality, is it worth asking author to support it ? (if it can't
be read, should I write it ?).

Since the things we're asking for TABLE are part of HMLT4.0, which is
a standard the industry has endorsed (but has not yet fully
implemented), I think it's fine that we ask people to use it if it's
good for accessibility.
