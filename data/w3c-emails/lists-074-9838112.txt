LK: "IMO this forum NOT to define what or when a website is accessible
but *how* to make a website accessible. Please correct me if I am
wrong."

WL:: Actually IMO this forum and the associated Working Groups are
multi-faceted.  The Guidelines Group defines what needs doing, and to
some extent how to do it; the Authoring Tools Group tries to get those
who design such tools how to help their products produce accessible
sites; the Evaluation & Repair Group tries to design tools that will be
useful both in defining when a site is accessible and perhaps even
furnish aids in achieving that goal; the Education & Outreach Group
tries to get all this information widely disseminated; the Interest
Group tries to get a feeling from those with an interest for how to go
about all these tasks.

In addition we have a User Agent Group who try to influence such things
as browsers, etc. and a Coordination Group that tries to keep all these
efforts synchronized.  If we cannot adequately define what we mean by
accessible, we will be ignored and ridiculed - as we should!
