I wonder what preferences they used when they check the site?  This is a 
big short coming for policy types when they try to implement ADA for the 
government.  I have seen it here where they tell you to use Bobby, but do 
not specify the preferences.  So developers are left to design their own 
quality assurance and tests!  That is a problem.
