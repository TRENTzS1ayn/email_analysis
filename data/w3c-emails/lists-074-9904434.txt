Rob,

Good point.  We generally suggest using the HTML 4.0 setting for the on-line
version of Bobby and we have been thinking that it may be necessary to expand
upon why the settings are important when using either the on-line version or
the downloadable application.  We would welcome suggestions from anyone on the
list with regard to settings and language.

Of course no combination of settings will provide ADA compliance since no
authentic standard has been established.

I was surprised to see that "policy types" were telling people to use Bobby.

Chuck

I wonder what preferences they used when they check the site?  This is a
big short coming for policy types when they try to implement ADA for the
government.  I have seen it here where they tell you to use Bobby, but do
not specify the preferences.  So developers are left to design their own
quality assurance and tests!  That is a problem.
