I disagree.  I enjoy emoticons and find them to be a part of life.  Its a 
perspective, one that I find to be humorous or to apply a point.  I do also 
appreciate emotional communications that is well written.  However, an <air 
hug> is not a serious or deeply moving message.  Rather i find them to be a 
humorous and a part of communication or expression, like slang or an idiom.

Some people will like to use emoticons and some people do not like to use 
emoticons.  I can write a moving letter and i can also write a humorous 
one.  Therefore, I am one that likes to use emoticons.  But we can agree to 
disagree.

Rob Neff, and <air hug>
