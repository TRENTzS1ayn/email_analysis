should we tell users to get with it?  I think not since they are using
in many cases a browser whose latest itteration was just built last
month.  now, we can tell them to get that but that might not even be
under their controll.
thoughts please?

Unfortunately, the site uses javascript to submit the form, without
any alternative for non-javascript browsers. Try writing to them,
letting them know that this is unnecessary and causing them to lose
customers. They will need to change the site to make it accessible to
lynx.
