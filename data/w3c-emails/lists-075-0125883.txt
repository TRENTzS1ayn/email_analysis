Perhaps you remeber the days when snooker was in black and white on
television?

It was not very satisfactory, nor accessible.

without a commentary, almost useless.

So perhaps you could answer my question as to whether your screen has a

Answers from any and all members would be appreciated.
Color is a complex problem, words, perhaps not the best examplars.

Perhaps someone out there can make my oranges sing.
