An alternative opinion (and one consistent with views I've seen
expressed on the W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative Interest Group
mailing list) would be that excluding non-graphical browsers in the
first place may be a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act,
since it denies access to blind users using Lynx with a screen reader.
