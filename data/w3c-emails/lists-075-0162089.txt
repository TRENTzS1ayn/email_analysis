Is there a list of formats that would fall under the category of "graphical representations of text" or tools/software packages (e.g. PowerPoint) that produce such formats?  There is probably a growing number of such formats, so perhaps it would be useful to maintain a list linked off of where this phrase is first introduced or in the Glossary of the WCAG?  It is often difficult for a sighted developer to remember that what looks like text may not be text and therefore may be inaccessible to users of screen readers.
   
-Thanks in advance,
-Steve
