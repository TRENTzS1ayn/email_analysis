Hello Judy,

I've been asked to give a talk on the "state of the art" on
web accessibility to the ICTA on 4th September. 
Thus I've been thinking about the guidelines, and also the 
reaction of the chi-web group to ideas on accessibility.  
I think most sites could be simplified a lot, and 
that will be the greatest boost to accessibility, hence 
the provocative claims and suggestions in forwarded message below.  
I'd be interested in your reaction.  I'm copying to the wai-ig as well.
(For their information, the abovementioned chi-web group is 
concerned with computer-human-interface aspects of the web.)

Cheers,

John

>Hello,

>A few weeks ago we had a thread about the importance of building

>yourself again).
>
>Now, during your navigation of the web, the browser builds up a

>and forward buttons, and also when the colour of links change.

>I believe many problems that users have with web applications are

>A.  It is possible to present almost all information in a tree hierarchy,  
>where the nodes are pages and the branches are hypertext links.
>(Help information, glossary of terms and dictionaries are exceptions,

>B.  Most navigation buttons introduced to make it faster or simpler

>Some implications:
>
>1.  Searching
>
>The search engine should present results on a single page.
>It should not break the results into a number of pages and have
>"next" and "previous" buttons.  Instead the user should be allowed
>to scroll.  The browser back button will then take the user straight
>back to where they started with the search form, no messing.
>Search refinement should be from this same point.
>
>2.  Back buttons
>
>The application should never supply its own back, forward
>or home buttons.
>
>3.  Internal links
>
>There should be no links between different points of the same
>page.  All links should point down the hierarchy.  (Exceptions
>are for cross-referencing in help files and dictionaries.)
>Applications should never have "top of the page" buttons.
>
>4.  Site entry
>
>Users should be encouraged to visit the site starting at the
>top.    Then the tree of the site will map directly onto the
>browser tree as it creates it.
>
>5.  Table of contents or index
>
>This should be on a separate page at a level above the contents
>itself.
>
>6.  References
>
>These should generally be in a page by themselves at the lowest
>level.
