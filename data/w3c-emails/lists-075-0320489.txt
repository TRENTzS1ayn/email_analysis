Standards body translates Web for devices 
By Paul Festa
Staff Writer, CNET News.com

The basic language of the Web is due for an overhaul--one that
proponents
say will make it easier for an array of Web browsing devices to read
Web
pages. 

Standards body the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) today released a
proposed recommendation--the penultimate stage in the W3C
recommendation
process--of Extensible Hypertext Markup Language 
(XHTML http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/). 

The proposed recommendation would rewrite Hypertext Markup Language
(HTML), commonly referred to as the Web's lingua franca, in Extensible
Markup Language 
(XML http://www.cnet.com/Resources/Info/Glossary/Terms/xml.html), a
newer
technology for creating Web languages.
