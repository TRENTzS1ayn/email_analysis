Interesting article, although i don't see anything about
accessibility/disability.  It would be great if access was included in some
sort of label - perhaps it could include compliance with WAI guidelines if
applicable (i.e. if a Web product).

 "Right now, corporate
 information technology managers and
 purchasers have no standard way to
 assess the usability of the software they
 buy, but within a few years it may be a
 matter of simply looking at the box."
