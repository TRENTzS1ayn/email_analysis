Judy,

I got a reply from Toby on chi-web, to which I've responded, see below.

Cheers,

John

>>>Hello,
>>>
>>>A few weeks ago we had a thread about the importance of building
>>>up a coherent mental model, so you know where you are when you
>>>are navigating a site (but, if you get lost, you can quickly find
>>>yourself again).
>>>
>>>Now, during your navigation of the web, the browser builds up a
>>>tree of visitations.  You are aware of this when you use the back
>>>and forward buttons, and also when the colour of links change.
>>>
>>>I believe many problems that users have with web applications are
>>>due to the applications messing up the browser's tree.  Sites should
>>>have all information in a hierarchy, so that the model of the site
>>>maps onto the browser model.  And sites should avoid "short cut" buttons,
>>>instead leaving the user to use the browser to do the navigation.
>>>
>>>I claim:
>>>
>>>A.  It is possible to present almost all information in a tree hierarchy,
>>>where the nodes are pages and the branches are hypertext links.
>>>(Help information, glossary of terms and dictionaries are exceptions,
>>>since cross-linking is inevitable.)
>>>
>>>B.  Most navigation buttons introduced to make it faster or simpler
>>>for the user actually have the opposite effect, because they
>>>subvert the browser's own controls.
>>>
>>>Some implications:
>>>
>>>1.  Searching
>>>
>>>The search engine should present results on a single page.
>>>It should not break the results into a number of pages and have
>>>"next" and "previous" buttons.  Instead the user should be allowed
>>>to scroll.  The browser back button will then take the user straight
>>>back to where they started with the search form, no messing.
>>>Search refinement should be from this same point.
>>>
>>>2.  Back buttons
>>>
>>>The application should never supply its own back, forward
>>>or home buttons.
>>>
>>>3.  Internal links
>>>
>>>There should be no links between different points of the same
>>>page.  All links should point down the hierarchy.  (Exceptions
>>>are for cross-referencing in help files and dictionaries.)
>>>Applications should never have "top of the page" buttons.
>>>
>>>4.  Site entry
>>>
>>>Users should be encouraged to visit the site starting at the
>>>top.    Then the tree of the site will map directly onto the
>>>browser tree as it creates it.
>>>
>>>5.  Table of contents or index
>>>
>>>This should be on a separate page at a level above the contents
>>>itself.
>>>
>>>6.  References
>>>
>>>These should generally be in a page by themselves at the lowest
>>>level.
