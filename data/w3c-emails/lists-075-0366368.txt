Hello,
I am teaching a class called "Web Authoring: Improving Accessibility." In
collecting materials, I have come across two Web documents with similar
titles, both authored/edited by Judy Brewer and Ian Jacobs.  They are:
Accessibility Features of CSS, A W3C Note 16 June 1999 at:
http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS-access
and
WAI Resource: CSS 2 Accessibility Improvements at:
www.w3.org/WAI/References/CSS2-access
Are these just different approaches to the same subject or does one
supercede the other?  The second one listed here has an older "last
modified" date.  I find it confusing to have two so similar documents on
the www.w3.org site.

Can anyone shed any light?
