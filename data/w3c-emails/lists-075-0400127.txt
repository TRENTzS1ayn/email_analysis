What is the nature of information gained by the eyes when viewing a chart
diagram?

If you are seeking one simple answer that works for all problems, probably
this is a little tenuous to be a thread.

However if you at first accept that a subjective view, possibly within a
context has a value then, we no longer need to worry too deeply for the
present (about the semantics).

In a recent copy of wired (september?) I was stunned that all the graph
projections for internet stock growth were displayed as continouos growth,
whereas the history was saw tooth.

Describing the nature of the saw tooth is evidently of benefit to the blind.
However, this is bound to be subjective, and always will be, forecasting is
a dodgy area.

The first step is to notice the valid description, and this may not always
be available.

I saw a childs smiley face drawing, however in reality it was a house upside
down.

The artist Bridget Riley in the forward to her recent book positively
stated, and it is a commonplace amongst many artists that an attempt to
describe what she is attempting to create saps the energy from the creative
process.

This approach will not suit everyone
