Good point on need to support collaboration.  

For example, if a sighted and a blind individual are sitting at the same
comptuter, they need simultaneous access.  So if you have a
browser/screenreader setup that forces the user to turn off images to get
the ALT text, that's a problem when a blind and a sighted person are
working together in front of a computer.

That's a pretty simple example.  What other types of collaboration barriers
are there that specifically affect people with disabilities?
