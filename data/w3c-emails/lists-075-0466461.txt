Hi Jonathan, Len:
Yes, I agree, a worthwhile question.
I'll have to check to make sure images are turned on - I didn't even think about it.
Is it the case in general that if I hear an alt description, the images are turned off?  I'm fairly sure Lynx excludes pictures but Iin Internet Explorer you have to check or uncheck an images box.  Do I have this right?

-Steve
