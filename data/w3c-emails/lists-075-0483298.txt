Has anyone else been noticing that author names are often no longer
included in postings to the list?   It does seem to be by person, so my
first guess would be that some people must have upgraded to a new mail
package within the past couple of weeks that isn't supporting
interoperability standards.  If would be helpful if people could at least
put their name at the bottom of their messages.
