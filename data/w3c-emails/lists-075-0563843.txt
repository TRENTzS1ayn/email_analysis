Hi,

Regarding description of _A Clockwork Orange_ and audio
description, reading from the original text (since the film
is an adaptation of the original book - and one of the
finest films) would be appropriate. The author, Anthony
Burgess, was a linguist and included a glossary at the end
of his book for the strange vocabulary he created for his
characters - of neo-Elizabethan English slang mixed with
Russian terms. Glossary could be made available at beginning
or end of presentation and/or independently in Braille/print
form.

Greg
