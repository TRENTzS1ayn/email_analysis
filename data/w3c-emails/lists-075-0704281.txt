Hi everyone,

Our Web team are currently working on a set of standards for uploading
lecture notes to the Web. They are taking the issue of accessibility
very
seriously as a way of reducing the expenditure on employing notetakers
in
lectures as well as making the notes accessible to as many students as
possible.

Just wondering if people on this list who are involved with Tertiary
education have gone down this road already. If so it would be much
appreciated if you could point me towards any relevant info that is
available or any inside tips. We are applying the general web access
guidelines as per WAI etc.

Also  I have seen some information related to the accessibility of
mainstream software packages. I think it was in a checklist type of
format.
Any info on either of these subjects would be much appreciated.

Thanks in advance
Trevor
