Hello,

Hereby I'd like to welcome you all to the revived ISdAC forumlist, which I
hope will turn into an active forum, where there's room for questions,
suggestions, discussions and exchanging experiences concerning modern IT as
well as Assistive  Technologies, and how they can be of benefit to People
with Disabilities (PwD) on their way towards integration within the
Information Society. ISdAC is convinced that in time this will also benefit
integration in mainstream society, since succesful examples lead to
recognition by society.

We regret the fact that due to economic reasons we had to close down the
previous forumlist, and decided to provide a solid basis first, before
starting up a new one. Therefor we founded ISdAC International Association
to safeguard our ideas and make sure that we can operate within a legal
framework. Furthermore, we put together a new website:
     http://www.isdac.org/
which will be updated frequently with articles, experiences, FAQ's, news and
interesting links to all what's happening in the IS and which might concern
PwD. Any suggestions or references to interesting sites or events is
welcome.

I hope you will find this discussion list interesting and refreshing,
and am looking forward to your input.

Kind regards,

Tony Verelst
