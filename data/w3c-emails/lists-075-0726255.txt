Hope this is not too off topic...
I have a file with a bunch of bios of staff members here. I want to link 
from another file to the persons blurb in the bio list. I can do
<a href = "people.html#rich">Richard Caloggero</a>
which works fine. However, it puts the last line of the previous paragraph 
(previous person's bio) at the top of the window, and the next person's bio 
right after.
Is there a way of doing this so each entry appears on a separate "page" 
(i.e. <br> does a line break -- <page> does a page break). At the very 
least, is there a way of eliminating the last line of the previous bio from 
the display?

Sorry for the dummy question...


Rich
