Here's the main problem I've run into with accessible lecture notes.

Powerpoint is a popular package for lecture notes.  It exports to HTML, but
there are problems.

1. The default output is just one big image per slide with no alt text,
completely unreadable.

2. There is a text version of the page, but

   It only shows text of original, no images, no ALT text 

   Text that isn't part of the outline view shows up in scrambled order.

As an example see the power point side at

http://astro.temple.edu/~kasday/talks/dt-web/ppt_test/test/sld001.htm

Click on the "text" button (the button with image of A on it with ALT text
"text".

It will show the effects mentioned above. 

You can get around this if

a. All text is in the outline
b. All info in the images are part of the outline.  One trick is to have
the text equivalent in the outline and then put the image on top of it so
it's hidden in the graphic view.

You could also edit the text result by hand, but remember that you have to
re-edit the text view every time you change the pictorial view or it will
overwrite everything you've done. So this isn't really very practical.

By the way, one good thing about Powerpoint output is that, unlike other
packages, it produces HTML with proper heading tags <H1> <H2> etc.

P.S. The above slide is part of a simplfied talk on web accessibility that
was aimed at people doing on line notes here at Temple.  The URL is
