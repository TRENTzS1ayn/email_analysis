There is also a slidemaker that w3c produces as an open source product which
works in Windows and Unix. It is written in Perl, currently maintained by
Masayasu Ishikawa, available from http://www.w3.org/Talks/YYMMsub

To use the tool you edit your presentation as a single HTML page. It
generates HTML pages which include the images, with alt, londesc, and
whatever you have put in the page. It also generates a table of contents,
gives ACCESSKEY control to navigation elements, etc.

There are new versions produced from time to time - the next version is
coming shortly and includes more options about icons and presentation, and a
few other handy features.

If you know somebody with any skill at all in PERL they will be ableto
customise it pretty easily - I have customised my own version a couple of
times. It is covered by the W3C copyright, which means you can distribute
modified versions (see http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/ipr-notice for
details).

The address given is a set of slides on how to get and use the tool.

  Here's the main problem I've run into with accessible lecture notes.
  
  Powerpoint is a popular package for lecture notes.  It exports to HTML, but
  there are problems.
  
  1. The default output is just one big image per slide with no alt text,
  completely unreadable.
  
  2. There is a text version of the page, but
  
     It only shows text of original, no images, no ALT text 
  
     Text that isn't part of the outline view shows up in scrambled order.
  
  As an example see the power point side at
  
  http://astro.temple.edu/~kasday/talks/dt-web/ppt_test/test/sld001.htm
  
  Click on the "text" button (the button with image of A on it with ALT text
  "text".
  
  It will show the effects mentioned above. 
  
  You can get around this if
  
  a. All text is in the outline
  b. All info in the images are part of the outline.  One trick is to have
  the text equivalent in the outline and then put the image on top of it so
  it's hidden in the graphic view.
  
  You could also edit the text result by hand, but remember that you have to
  re-edit the text view every time you change the pictorial view or it will
  overwrite everything you've done. So this isn't really very practical.
  
  By the way, one good thing about Powerpoint output is that, unlike other
  packages, it produces HTML with proper heading tags <H1> <H2> etc.

  P.S. The above slide is part of a simplfied talk on web accessibility that
  was aimed at people doing on line notes here at Temple.  The URL is
