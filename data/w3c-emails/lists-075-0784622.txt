This is kind of off-topic for this list - there are a lot of other resources
for learning or discussin general html coding. But anyway:

All caveats about browsers doing things differently and your milage varying
taken into consideration (that means something else in an english court
actually)...

The usual behaviour is to put the <a name="xxx"> element at the top of the
browser window (if there is enough to fill the page. Otherwise some browsers
fill the page, others just show what comes afterwards).

So the answer would be to use the <a name="xxx"> element to wrap some inline
content for the first line. Example:

<h2><a name="charles">Charles McCathieNevile</a></h2>
<p>Charles writes html and is playing around with the idea of using <abbr
title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</abbr> metadata to increase the
accessibility of object-based images.</p>

<h2><a name="rich" href="mailto:rich@accessexpressed.net">Rich
Caloggero</a></h2>
<p>Rich does smething else...</p>


If you want the things on separate pages make each one a separate document...

  Hope this is not too off topic...
  I have a file with a bunch of bios of staff members here. I want to link 
  from another file to the persons blurb in the bio list. I can do
  <a href = "people.html#rich">Richard Caloggero</a>
  which works fine. However, it puts the last line of the previous paragraph 
  (previous person's bio) at the top of the window, and the next person's bio 
  right after.
  Is there a way of doing this so each entry appears on a separate "page" 
  (i.e. <br> does a line break -- <page> does a page break). At the very 
  least, is there a way of eliminating the last line of the previous bio from 
  the display?
  
  Sorry for the dummy question...
