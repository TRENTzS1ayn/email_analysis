I dunno about the "rest of us" but it's very encouraging to see this
kind of progress being touted as Important in an age when still most
web designers are completely unaware that It Matters.

So while we could certainly find reason to be critical of what they
might or might not have done, I do applaud the idea behind the
news story and the fact that it is considered Important Enough to
be news.  Now I'm looking forward to the day when this is NOT news
and accessibility is taken for granted...someday, I promise you,
we WILL get there.
