Target Linux. There is no braille engine available for that OS.
Hopefully, another one will be ported from DOS soon.
Help wanted on the project if anyone is C++ compenent???
(Or Scheme, or willing to work on a generic grade two braille
contraction engine, to enable UBC, or any other locale based processing)
Can we tempt you?

See the site, Peter will fill you in with the detail.
