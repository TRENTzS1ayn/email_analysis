Chris,

Thanks for the tips on using the notes feature for extra text.  A good
place for the equivalent of a LONGDESC.

I think though that the trick of hiding text is still useful if you want
the text equivalent of an image to appear in the same place of the image.

For example if you have a page that says

The hydrogen atom consists of

[image] with a positive charge

and

[image] with a negative charge

Where the first image is a picture of a proton, and the second image is a
picture of an electron.

You can create a slide with the following text:

The hydrogen atom consists of

a proton with a positive charge

and

an electron  with a negative charge

The put the images over the words "a proton" and "an electron"
respectively.  That way the graphical version of the page shows the desired
graphic effect with the words "proton" and "electron" hidden.  But a person
seeing the text version sees the words in their proper place.  In other
ways, it's a way to simulate alt text.

Also, the image has to be a bitmap image if there's any text in it, or the
text will appear in some random place.

Also like I mentioned your notes idea is a good place to put extended
descriptions of the image, i.e. the equivalent of the LONGDESC, e.g. the
following could appear in the notes:

"The proton is represented by a red sphere with a plus sign and the
electron is represented by a much smaller black sphere with a minus sign."

text-only page. You don't have to play tricks with "hiding" text in the
Outline. This doesn't correct the lack of ALT text, but at least you can
have a full "text-equivalent" right on the same page.
