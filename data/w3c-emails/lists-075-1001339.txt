Heads up: Last Call for Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines

The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines will be entering "Last Call"
status within the next day. Within W3C, "Last Call" status signifies a
final review period before Proposed Recommendation. Assuming no critical
issues arise during Last Call, the document then goes to W3C Member
organizations for review regarding whether or not it can become a W3C
Recommendation. 

This will therefore be the last opportunity for public comment on the
Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines. I urge you to do a comprehensive
review of the document, and to forward your comments to <w3c-wai-au@w3.org>
as described in the "Last Call" message which will follow shortly from the
Authoring Tool Guidelines Working Group. ss

Please note the Last Call closing date in their message. The Authoring Tool
Guidelines Working Group will not be able to incorporate Last Call comments
received after that date.

You may forward the Last Call review request to other organizations that
have an interest
in the Web Accessibility Initiative <http://www.w3.org/WAI>. If you do so,
please cc <jbrewer@w3.org> on the forwards and include this "heads up"
message which gives background about the Last Call process. 

Thank you,

Judy
