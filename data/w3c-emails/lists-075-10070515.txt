Dear Jerry,

I am delighted to hear that FP is accessible, even if the pages it produces
leave something to be desired.

One problem FP shares with most other graphical editors is that it will,
without warning, delete and/or reformat code you put in by hand.  There is
no satisfactory way to defeat this behavior.

Of course, a the whole point of such a tool is that one should NOT need to
know HTML!  I don't think it unreasonable that such a package be accessible,
nor is it unreasonable to expect such a tool to produce valid and minimally
accessible code!

It will probably be a few years before Microsoft offers such a product.

Have you tried Amaya?
