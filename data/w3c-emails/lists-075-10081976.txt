Adobe Golive 5 is purported to conform to the WAI. It is slated for 
release any time now. Check it out at <http://www.adobe.com>. They 
are also implementing accessibility in Acrobat and PDF.

Currently, I use Golive 4, and then run the output through HTML Tidy 
for Mac, using the XHTML 1.0 spec. Works well. I'm not sure how 
accessible the interface would be to the visually impaired, though. 
It has good source and "outline" editing modes.
