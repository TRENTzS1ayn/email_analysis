So how many years have we been hearing that Adobe is committed to 
accessibility now?  Sorry folks but we should be seeing results from this 
company not more talk that's likely as not devoted to convincing the U.S. 
federal government that PDF files will be accessible as anything else.

I'm sure that people will call me Mr. Negative for saying this but PDF 
files have been one of the worst things for accessibility and if I had a 
dollar for every person who's blind who's had trouble reading the results 
of a supposedly converted PDF file, I'd certainly be able to take a nice 
vacation.

It is time that people with disabilities stand up and tell the government 
to quit using PDF until the company demonstrates 100 percent accessibility, 
not the sham they continue to portray as such.
