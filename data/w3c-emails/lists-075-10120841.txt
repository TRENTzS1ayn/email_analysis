Hi Bruce.  I think I saw mention of Amaya on the W3C web site, but I was
amused that I couldn't seem to find information on just what an Amaya was or
what it was supposed to do -- just some stuff about bug fixes.

Really, I'm pretty happy with FrontPage, and I'm glad I am since it ain't
exactly cheap.  Still, I'm interested in what's out there and what might be
effective tools for the future.  Is Amaya a full-fledged
authoring/publishing/maintenance tool? and what makes this particular mouse
trap different from the others <grin>?

Thanks,
Jerry
