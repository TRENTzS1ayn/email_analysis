Amaya is the W3C's test-bed authoring tool / browser. It is designed to be a
browser that lets you edit (like the original WWW tool). It is an open source
project, with a small team (about 3) of W3C staff working on it. It
implements HTML, much of CSS1, XHTML, a fair amount of MathML, an
experimental version of an XML vector graphics language, and a few other
things. We are working on the accessibility of AMaya - there is still a way
to go, and anyone who wants to work on programming is welcome to help...

  Hi Bruce.  I think I saw mention of Amaya on the W3C web site, but I was
  amused that I couldn't seem to find information on just what an Amaya was or
  what it was supposed to do -- just some stuff about bug fixes.
  
  Really, I'm pretty happy with FrontPage, and I'm glad I am since it ain't
  exactly cheap.  Still, I'm interested in what's out there and what might be
  effective tools for the future.  Is Amaya a full-fledged
  authoring/publishing/maintenance tool? and what makes this particular mouse
  trap different from the others <grin>?
  
  Thanks,
  Jerry
