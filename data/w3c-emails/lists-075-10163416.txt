Just wanted to say thanks to everybody for all the comment on
accessible/output-accessible tools.  I'll have a look at some of the reviews
and try to become more current on what's out there.  I'm on a web team at
work along with my "hobbyist" interest in all of this, so I don't think it
can but help for me to be as knowledgeable on all this stuff as possible.

While I'm boning up on editors, I wonder if the HTML 4 documentation at the
W3C web site is a good way to come up to speed on some of the newer
extensions of HTML or if I should look in another area.  I learned HTML from
the HTML Primer put out by the University of Illinois, and I find it's kind
of difficult to figure out what's a good source of information to extend my
knowledge from there.  If anybody has good suggestions, I'd appreciate it.
As it is, it's sometimes hard for me to even understand some of the newer
issues in accessibility when my building blocks are incomplete.

Thanks,
Jerry
