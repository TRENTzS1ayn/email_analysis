here is my prob : i have alot of files that are in 3 languages 

ex: 
<cfif lang = english>
    vwlurblwyufqulv
<cfif lang = spanish>
    sk;ufhsk;fhber
<cfif lang = french>
    aejhtyjld
</cfif>

bu the files are alot bigger than this!!!!

i created a few collections and indexed them ...my problem  is when i use ths search and output it in html page :the #summary# does not return the proper language all the time
