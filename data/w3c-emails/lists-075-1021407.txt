Here's the one I know -- other people may have better numbers.

http://www.cc.gatech.edu/gvu/user_surveys/survey-1998-10/graphs/general/q12.htm

GVU does regular surveys of internet users.

http://www.cc.gatech.edu/gvu/user_surveys/

These may or may not be representative samples, but of those who
completed THIS particular survey, about 4% identify themselves as
users with visual disabilities.
