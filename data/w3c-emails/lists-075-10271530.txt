Hi anyone trying to access one of the sites mentioned in this article will
get a 404 not found due to a tiny error.  the uri is listed as:

www.access-board.gov/RULES/ 508nprm.htm

and it should be

http://www.access-board.gov/RULES/508nprm.htm

Because of a space between the front slash and 508, it renders a 404, not
found.  I thought you might like to know this if you are using the uri from
this article.  *Smile*  I tried and that's how I found out.
