I would like the members of the W3C interest group list to know that the
City of San Jose accessible web policy at
http://www.ci.san-jose.ca.us/oaacc/disacces.html has been updated to include
the W3C WAI page as a resource for accessible web design.  It was pointed
out that one of our resource links was outdated, hence the change to include
the W3C WAI resource.
