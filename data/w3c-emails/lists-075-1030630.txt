aloha, kynn!

perhaps the WAI (the EO WG?) should keep a list of active internet/web use
surveys, so that more people (particularly those with disabilities) can be
encouraged to participate in them -- i know that had i been aware of the
survey, i certainly would have participated, and would have encouraged everyone
i know to do so as well...

oh, and a note to joel:  you might want to contact some of the major blindness
organizations, in particular:
        American Council of the Blind <http://www.acb.org/>
        American Foundation for the Blind <http://www.afb.org/>
        National Federation of the Blind <http://www.nfb.org/>
to ask if they have any statistics...  the American Foundation for the Blind
maintains the Career Technology Information Bank, a database which (amongst
other things) keeps track of what technology participants use to conduct their
work, and a major concern of recent pollings of the data pool is the use of web
based technology by blind and visually impaired persons, both at work and at
home...  you can email the maintainer of the Career Technology Information
Bank, Jay Leventhal, using the following eddress:
        <techctr@afb.net>

you can also find out more about the Career Technology Information Bank at:
        <http://www.afb.org/technology/ctibbroch.html>
as well as some (unfortunately old) statistics (which don't include any
information about internet use) at:
        <http://www.afb.org/tc_1900.html>
