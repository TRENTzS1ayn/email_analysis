I found this, relating to Microsoft's implementation of XML:

http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/xmlMicrosoft.html

>scriplets: "Scriptlets are based on XML and script, and are 
>general-purpose components, useful anywhere COM components are. 
>Initially [IE 4.0] called server scriptlets (they were aimed at the 
>server), scriptlets are components written in Extensible Markup 
>Language (XML) and script. XML is used to define the object, 
>methods, properties, etc., and script to provide the functionality. 
>Once the initial development began on these new scriptlets, it 
>became clear that they are not just useful on the server but also on 
>the client. As a result, Internet Explorer 5.0 Developer Preview 
>release covers the needs not only of ASP/server developers, but also 
>of client developers." The <scriptlet> elements contain a 
><registration> element to register the scriptlet as a COM component, 
>an <implements> element to specify the COM interface hanbdler for 
>the scriptlet, and a <script> element to implement the logic of the 
>scriptlet.

Now this sounds like they're trying to do a Java/Active-X, and 
sabotage XML as an open standard for their own purposes. This worries 
me, because I believe XML is one of the last chances we have of 
getting back to an accessible, content driven web. IE has already 
ruined HTML/Java web authoring process for many, now it looks like it 
will do the same to the XML process.

Surely the addition of proprietary code inhibits accessibility, 
because this will only run on certain hardware/software combinations.

Add the that the security risk. Hopefully the ILOVEYOU virus has made 
people a bit more wary of the damage that prevalent scripting can 
cause, when implemented in the typical insecure MS fashion. However, 
the company seems intent on pushing vulnerability into every corner 
of the web.

Anyway, that's a (relevant) side issue. The big question is how much 
are MS going to hijack XML and plant their COM and ASP rubbish in it? 
Enough to make life difficult for accessible content developers?
