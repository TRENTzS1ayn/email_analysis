The work to be carried out under this contract will assist the Board in
developing and implementing the technical assistance program required by
section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments and the training program
required by the Assistive Technology Act for access to electronic and
information technology. Electronic and information technology includes, but
is not limited to: telecommunications equipment, information kiosks and
transaction machines, web sites, multimedia, and office equipment, such as
computers, software, copiers, and fax machines.

The contractor shall be required to develop training modules, which contain
materials such as fact sheets, general information brochures, quick
reference documents, frequently asked questions and answers, Board
standards, multimedia presentations, "how to" tips, narrated slide shows,
and listings of reference materials. Each module shall contain basic
material on Section 508 and the Board's standards, as well as material aimed
at specific audiences. Four potential audiences are Federal managers,
end-users with disabilities, the procurement community, and producers of
technology.
