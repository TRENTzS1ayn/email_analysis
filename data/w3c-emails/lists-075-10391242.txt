I originally wanted to leave tech politics out of this. I certainly 
see the need to work constructively with Microsoft. Which is kinda 
why I blew my top when I saw the plan to incorporate scripts which 
are only compatible with Microsoft products (Explorer yet again), 
after seeing Microsoft blow their own trumpet over XML and 
accessibility.

I'm sorry for ranting. I just thought it seemed hypocritical the way 
Adobe was attacked unthinkingly, while Microsoft get kudos for doing 
very little for accessibility.
