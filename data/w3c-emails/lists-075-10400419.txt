I agree with Al. As our tools evolve we need to continue our analysis of
functionality and impact so that "accessibility by construction" can remain
in place.

Subject: RE: Microsoft threat to XML? (no, script is defacto disaster,
not threat)


The genie is out of the bottle.  People are writing web applications in a
mix
of declarative HTML or XML quasi-static stuff and imperative-language (i.e.
not
adequately declarative) overlays that change all that.  The result is not
safe
for disability access adapted modes of interaction.

The threat to accessibility is the fact that if we try to say "don't use
scripts" we stand about the same chance as when King Canute decreed to the
sea
that the tide should not rise.

Wrapping the script stuff in XML may be hostile, neutral, or friendly to the
objective of making the script stuff civil as far as disability access is
concerned.  We don't know.  We need to take the initiative to analyze the
functions performed by the scripts, assert what is needed in terms of
declarative meta-function so that this functionality can be morphed
appropriately in adaptive UI variants, and steer our commentary on
script-in-XML etc. based on that analysis.  Only then will we actually be
useful in steering technology into a "accessible by construction" place. 
Scripting is already the de_facto norm or standard, and it is presently not
civil, in the sense that it provides enough morphing support to serve
disability access modes successfully and effectively.

Don't blame scripting on Microsoft.  They have encouraged this development,
but
only because they listened to their customers.  And they are only the
biggest
fish in the school encouraging this development.  Not a unique voice making
it
happen.

If we can point the way to accessible scripting practices, including how it
gets blended or connected with XML, Microsoft will be there among others
bringing resources to bear to examine the proposals and if they make sense,
implement them.

Whatever you personally think of Sun, Adobe, Microsoft, et_al., to be
effective
advocates of the disability interest we cannot affort to demonize any of
them
or fail to constructively engage with them in the search for an objective,
all-are-winners solution to this puzzle.

All the same reasons that make Microsoft the biggest imaginable pain when
they
are being a pain, make them the biggest imaginable help when they are being
a
help.  Whether they are being pain or help, is, mirabile_dictu, to some
degree
under the control of the professional attitude we exhibit as we approach the
dialog.
