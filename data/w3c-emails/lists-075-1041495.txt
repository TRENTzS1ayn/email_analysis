Thanks for the quick responses. I have been doing a lot of research on 
accessible web design for my company, and was just saying how I bet there 
are more blind and visually impaired users than Mac users on the Internet - 
according to the OS and browser stats at http://www.StatMarket.com.

Well...I was asked to back that assertion up by a manager. <GULP> I don't 
know how accurate the self-reported figures at GVU are, but they the only 
ones I've seen so far.

It sure would be a boost to accessible web design efforts if we had a good 
source of these figures!

Again, thanks for the quick replies.

Regards;

Joel Sanda
