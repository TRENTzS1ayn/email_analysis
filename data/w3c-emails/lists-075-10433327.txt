I'm very sorry for the attack.

Can you please explain why it is acceptable to attack Adobe in the 
same way though? It just seems there are probably too many Microsoft 
people around here to have a balanced, honest discussion.


Let's talk issues. When are Microsoft going to stop trying to use 
Explorer-specific extensions to open standards as a means of 
monopolising the market?

That is a real issue. Any takers?
