Yes, the list is still functional. There are a number of conferences going
on now that may have drawn off some of the usual dialog. 

One of these was the WWW9 Conference in Amsterdam last week
<http://www.WWW9.org> -- a conference of the International World Wide Web
Conference Committee (IW3C2). It was good to hear accessibility coming up
spontaneously in so many of the sessions -- not just the W3C sessions, but
almost all sessions having to do with mobile devices, Web standards, etc.
Seems to be at least one indicator of increasing awareness of accessibility
in the Web industry.

A reminder on list use <http://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/Overview.html#Uselist>.
Kindly treat other list members with the respect that enables different
communities to work together on developing accessibility solutions for the
Web.

Thank you for your cooperation,

- Judy
