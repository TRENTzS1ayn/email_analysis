Kathleen, Steven,

Please look at 
<http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/Process-19991111/submission.html>
for a clearer portrayal of what "acknowledgement of a submission" by W3C
means. 

General information on work that the W3C has already been doing in the area
of voice browsing is available at 
<http://www.w3.org/Voice/>

Any work on this topic must go through the same consensus-development
process as other W3C work, including W3C working drafts, last call,
candidate recommendation, proposed recommendation, etc., before becoming a
W3C Recommendation. Information on W3C process in general is available at 
<http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process>.

Regards,

- Judy
