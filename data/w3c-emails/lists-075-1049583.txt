I saw no one to whom to address technical faults in your site and your
methods so I'm writing you instead and hope that it will be received
appropriately.

I will not buy this product or service untill and unless it recognises
the needs of all browsers.  There are errors in the construction of
the site that make it dificult and in many cases impossible for many
people to navigate.  This is quite off putting since it is a site that
promotes site correction.  The correction methods are flawed as well
because they do not take into account many elements and atributes of
html 4.0 that are designed to enhance web browsing and access.

You will no doubt receive other messages like this since the reported
rendered of the Html Writers Guild site was termed to have failed many
checks for which complience would have ment a broken site.
Thanks for your attention.
