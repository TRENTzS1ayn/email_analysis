This morning I was listening to The "Radio One" service of the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation (CBC).  At 5:45 a.m. local time they have a program
called the Business Network.  The program covers investment trends, economic
conditions, what's hot in business, and so on.  In discussing up-coming
topics on tomorrow's (Thursday, 25 May's) program, they mentioned that
they'd have an item about successful and not-so-successful web sites.  The
blurb was something like, "Ever visited a web site that left you dazed and
confused?".  I thought members of this list might want to tune in on this
feature and send the Business Network folks some feedback on it from the
perspective of users who may not use the "conventional" approaches to
browsing the web and who might find themselves "dazed and confused" for
reasons other than the ones the commentators have thought of.

The Business Network web site is at <http://calgary.cbc.ca/biznet/>.  The
feedback e-mail address is businessnetwork@calgary.cbc.ca.  In the Eastern
time zone (GMT-4 hours) in Canada and the U.S. the program seems to air at
5:45 a.m., though not all stations on the Radio One service may carry it.  I
don't know what time the program airs in other time zones.  Interested
members who aren't within listening range of a CBC station carrying the
program may be able to find a RealAudio feed from the CBC's web site at
<http://www.radio.cbc.ca/>.

Cheers,
Jerry
