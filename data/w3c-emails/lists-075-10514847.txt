Today's focus: Speak up
--------------------------------------------- 
By Mark Gibbs
     
When I occasionally talk to my Web browser, it is usually along the 
lines of  you *$@* piece of $%&@.  I just found another way: Conversa 
Wen from Conversational Computing.
     
This utility works with Windows Internet Explorer 4 or above only, and 
it provides complete voice control of the browser. Users can activate 
dropdown boxes, pulldown menus, radio buttons and check boxes; enter 
URLs and text fields; and gain access to a voice-activated history list. 
Also, the software can read links aloud using text-to-speech technology.
     
An interesting aspect of the product is that training is not required, 
implying a degree of speaker independence that is useful in a number of 
environments. In particular, the product may be a real boon to visually 
or physically impaired users.
     
The product has received a number of favorable reviews, and with street 
prices as low as $24, Conversa Web is worth checking out.
     
Conversational Computing is at 8522 154th Avenue NE, Redmond, Wash.; 
425-895-1800; http://www.conversa.com/Products/Web.asp.
