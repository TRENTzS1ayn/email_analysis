Reston, Va. - AbleTV.net, the first web-based global TV network for the
disabled, and a network affiliate of TVWorldwide.com, announced today that
tonight?s monthly AbleTV,net Town Meeting Webcast would address the question
of
ADA jurisdiction over internet web sites with the Chief of Information
Technology for the US Mint, Mr. Robert Neff. Tonight?s event, slated for
7:30
PM EDT, live, from the Internet TV studios of TVWorldwide.com is sponsored
by
Microsoft Corp., and is another in a monthly series of interactive
AbleTV.net
webcasts that attract extensive participation from the disabled community
worldwide. 
?This is obviously a hot topic for all concerned, ? commented Jeff Pledger,
founder and President of AbleTV.net. ?There are many issues affecting the
disabled involving accessibility on the Internet and we?re anxious to foster
communication on this as it relates to the ADA.? 
In addition to Mr. Neff, the town meeting webcast will feature
representatives
from Alderson Reporting who will be providing the text of the event for the
live AbleTV.net closed captioned video streaming.  ?We?re pleased to pioneer
this closed-captioned streaming for a live event, just like we?ve done for
all
our archived events, ? remarked Pledger. ?Its an example of how we employ
accessibility technology for our own site.?



The show will be co-hosted by Pledger and Dave Gardy, Chairman and CEO of
TVWorldwide.com. ?This will be a very interesting show, with diversity of
opinions on this subject,? commented Gardy. ?Even Jeff and I don?t always
agree, primarily because I?m against regulation on the Internet. But then
Jeff
is blind and I?m not. I agree that communication is the key.? 
During this webcast, AbleTV.net will also announce that it has been selected
as
the media Award Recipient for the Year 2000, by the Metro New York Chapter
of
the National rehabilitation Association. The awards ceremony will be held
June
9 at the New York University spring conference for the organization.  

The webcast will be accessible at http://www.abletv.net , and interactive
through chat, e-mail and phone direct to the studio. The program will be
archived and closed-captioned for later viewing after the webcast at the
same
event site link.
