Dear WAI Interest Group Members

The WAI Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines has now gone into "Last
Call". This is the final opportunity for public comments to be taken into
account by the working group. The current working draft at
http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-AUTOOLS will remain stable throughout the last call
period which ends on 4 October. Comments are invited on the document, and
should be sent to the mailing list w3c-wai-au@w3.org All issues raised on or
before 4 October will be addressed by the working group before the document
becomes a W3C proposed recommendation.

This is the second of three major sets of guidelines being developed by WAI.
These guidelines are intended to cover tools which are used to develop
content for the Web, including HTML and XML editing tools, applications which
have a Web publishing or "save as HTML/XML" option, multimedia tools used for
making web graphics, sound, and video, and applications which dynamically
generate websites from databases.

For further information on the working group, including previous working
drafts, minutes of group meetings, and history of changes between drafts
please see the working group page at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU

Please note that as well as the guidelines themselves teh Working Group has
produced a techniques document, which describes example strategies and
further information on how the checkpoints in the guidelines may be met.
Although this is not in last call (it is not intended for publication as a
W3C recommendation, but may become an informative Note, and is publicly
available in working draft form), the group also welcomes comments or
suggestions. The techniques document is at
http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-AUTOOLS-TECHS

We look forward to your review comments

Charles McCathieNevile (W3C Staff contact) and
Jutta Treviranus (chair)
for the Authoring Tool Guidelines Working Group

  Heads up: Last Call for Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines
  
  The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines will be entering "Last Call"
  status within the next day. Within W3C, "Last Call" status signifies a
  final review period before Proposed Recommendation. Assuming no critical
  issues arise during Last Call, the document then goes to W3C Member
  organizations for review regarding whether or not it can become a W3C
  Recommendation. 
  
  This will therefore be the last opportunity for public comment on the
  Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines. I urge you to do a comprehensive
  review of the document, and to forward your comments to <w3c-wai-au@w3.org>
  as described in the "Last Call" message which will follow shortly from the
  Authoring Tool Guidelines Working Group. ss
  
  Please note the Last Call closing date in their message. The Authoring Tool
  Guidelines Working Group will not be able to incorporate Last Call comments
  received after that date.
  
  You may forward the Last Call review request to other organizations that
  have an interest
  in the Web Accessibility Initiative <http://www.w3.org/WAI>. If you do so,
  please cc <jbrewer@w3.org> on the forwards and include this "heads up"
  message which gives background about the Last Call process. 
  
  Thank you,
  
  Judy
