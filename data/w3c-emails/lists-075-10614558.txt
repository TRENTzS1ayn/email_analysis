~~In theory I think the limit for the size of an element including all
attribute content is 32k (i.e. very big) but in practise I would suggest
keeping it shorter. Given that the summary attribute isn't available on many
of the current generation of browsers, you might also consider using a
caption element instead - that is rendered by nearly everything.

I agree.  I am not sure how long you can make it, but I have always found it
good practice to keep it short and to the point.  I'd certainly keep it to a
small to medium sized sentence.
