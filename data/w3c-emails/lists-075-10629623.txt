One of the people quoted in this article, from the general services
administration branch of the US government, is quoted as saying that all
disabled people want to know is what is going on. Actually, I suspect that in
a lot of cases they would like to be able to influence what is going on, at
least to the same degree as everyone else. This is not just about access to
information, it is about access to the opportunities which are available to
the authors of that information.

(But in general, I thought the article was pretty good).

just my personal thoughts
