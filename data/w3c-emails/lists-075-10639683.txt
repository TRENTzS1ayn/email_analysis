The approach I use in commercial design is to rely on basic CSS (the stuff
that either works on browsers or doesn't cause problems when it doesn't) to
provide what I call "flow and float" layout. In other words, given the huge
range of possible visual rendering devices, I aim for something that will
make reasonable use of the available space, and at the same time make sense
in browsers where CSS is not supported (pre-1998 versions) or where it may be
turned off or otherwise adjusted (mobile devices, audio interfaces such as
telephone browsing services, TV based web services, etc).

  I just read the San Jose design standards document. Item 10 states that
  frames and tables should be avoided because screen readers can't decipher
  them. How are you supposed to deal with page layout without tables?
