I was told AltaVista had released a super-lean search service, along the
lines of google. So I tried it. Annd this is what I got:

We're sorry. Raging.com does not support text-only browsers. For a superior
text-only search, please visit [link]AltaVista.

I faked my user agent string, and got a perfectly usable (nice, clean,
simple) search engine.

Anyone have a constructive approach to the problem?
