the full text of the Bank of America ATM settlement agreement is online
via FTP at the following url:

ftp://poehlman.clark.net/atm64.txt

It can be downloaded as an ASCII text file or viewed online.  This is the
first nation-wide agreement by any bank to install talking atm's.  The
agreement requires thousands of machines to be installed in California and
Florida in the next three years.  A schedule for other states will be
worked out next year.  Additionally, this if the first binding,
enforceable agreement by a corporation to agree to make its services on
the World Wide Web Accessible to people with disabilities.  The agreement
requires compliance with a measurable standards and delineates a process
for achieving the standard.

It is wonderful to see that the strategy of negotiation has created
consensus among the parties and a comprehensive approach to accessing
financial services, including web access, documents in alternative
formats, waiver of discriminatory fees, raised line checks, and  a trained
staff in addition to talking atm's.  The Bank of America is the nation's
biggest bank and largest atm deployer.  It has branches in 30 of the 50
states and has more than 14,000 atm's.
