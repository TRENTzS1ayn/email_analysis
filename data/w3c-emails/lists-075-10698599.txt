Not to be the dark cloud in this silver lining, but these wonder phones rank
right up there with the touch-screen (and to a lesser extent pretty much
every other kind of) automatic teller machines.  A blind person can't even
figure out where or how to stick the credit card let alone what to do from
there.  It's the same old story as the new menu-driven smart appliances.
One can hope that the new FCC regs in the U.S. will help with such issues
here.  Not so sure about other countries.
