Thanks - I did prefer it. However, I am also interested in whether anyone has
a constructive suggestion for how to approach the people who make Raging and
fix it...

Cheers

  I believe you will be pleased with the interface to
  AltaVista that is available
  with the SETI-search search engine at
  http://www.seti-search.com. It is a
  not-for-profit search engine interface designed for blind
  and low-vision users.
  
  AltaVista is the default search engine, so you only need to
  enter your search
  term or phrase into the form and submit it. There are also
  interfaces to AOLsearch,
  Excite, Google, HotBot, MetaCrawler, CNET, Dictionary.com,
  DiscoveryHealth.com,
  AllRecipes.com and Voila.com (just recently added).
  
  Since the major engines are constantly changing/fine tuning
  their algorithms, it
  is a struggle to keep up with them...but we try, and user
  feedback helps us a lot.
  
  It was our frustration with AltaVista and the other major
  search engines that
  caused us to develop this speech-friendly search engine
  interface.
  
  It works well with text-only browsers. (If you have any sort
  of problem using
  the tool, please use the on-site form to email us!)
  
  Everyone's feedback and suggestions are most welcome.
  
  Regards,
  The SETI-search Editors

  I was told AltaVista had released a super-lean search
  service, along the
  lines of google. So I tried it. Annd this is what I got:
  
  We're sorry. Raging.com does not support text-only browsers.
  For a superior
  text-only search, please visit [link]AltaVista.
  
  I faked my user agent string, and got a perfectly usable
  (nice, clean,
  simple) search engine.
  
  Anyone have a constructive approach to the problem?
