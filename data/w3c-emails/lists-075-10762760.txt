It may not be an example of excellence as far as universality, 
but for accessibility it covers many of the holes in the WAI site.

The homepage offers a choice of nine languages.
It has a a limited number of links, each with a great graphic.
It loads quickly.

It does not use alt tags
The topics and text labels are less well chosen than they could be.
The coding is lengthy......

A student & fan found it easy and exciting to navigate.
