I just went there and clicked on English and waited for the into.  I chose
Flash 4.0 and when it came up, it was flashing red and then short clips and
then lots of flashing red, etc.  Isn't this just slightly unaccessible to a
person who has epilepsy?  Flashing red like that can put some epileptics
into a seizure.  If this is the case I would consider this site totally
unaccessible.  When I tried to go back to main page, it wouldn't send me
there, it just kept flashing the scenes on the browser.
