I don't think Jonathan was saying it is universally accessible (he
effectively points this out), just that for a particular group of people (I
am assuming he is talking about people with severe reading difficulties in
particular - jonathan?) it is actually good.

I think what we need to do is try to work out what it is that is good about
this, and how we can explain how to do it, and combine that with what we
already have and think we know.

  unaccessible.  When I tried to go back to main page, it wouldn't send me
  there, it just kept flashing the scenes on the browser.
