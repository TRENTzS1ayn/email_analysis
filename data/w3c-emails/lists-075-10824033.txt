As far as I know, anchor names are not read by anything except machines. If
you want a meaningful title for a section anchor you should use the title

  Did "use meaningful labels for internal document anchors" not make it into

  If so, where is it?
  If not, isn't this a P2 or at least P3 usability issue?
  Aren't anchor names vocalized by screen readers?
