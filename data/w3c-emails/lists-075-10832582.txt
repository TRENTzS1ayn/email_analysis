I am very glad to see that the separation of universality and accessibility
seems to be continuing appace.

I should perhaps apologise for only testing the non-flash version.
Most of the student's computers at colleges I teach, in have not had sound
cards, or any plug-ins.

I should perhaps add that it seems to work fine in linux navigator and KDE,
though it probably is not very useful within lynx unfortunately.
