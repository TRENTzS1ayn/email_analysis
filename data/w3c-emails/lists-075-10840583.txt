"I am very glad to see that the separation of universality and accessibility
seems to be continuing appace."
- Jonathan Chetwynd

This is an interesting comment.  Where is the line between making web sites
accessible and universal?  I suppose there is no harsh line, but how can I
learn to make my sites accessible without going to extremes?  I'm looking
for a source to help me better understand this separation.
