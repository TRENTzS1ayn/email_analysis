If this is based on my comments, then I am probably being misinterpreted.

Jonathan had pointed to a site that, as I understood it, was good at
providing accessibility to a specific group of people (at the expense of
certain others). I was not suggesting that this is a good way forward, just
that we need to understand who (if anyone) is not well served by the current
work we are doing, and how to ensure that they will be in the future.

Looking at what is good about a site that helps people more than the current
WAI work, and learning how to do that, is not the same as accepting what is
clearly not accessible in some way about it. I do not believe that
accessibility requires that we divide the world into different groups, and
target our "accessibilty" to one or the other - I think that if we cannot do
better than that then we will have failed.

cheers

  This is an interesting comment.  Where is the line between making web sites
  accessible and universal?  I suppose there is no harsh line, but how can I
  learn to make my sites accessible without going to extremes?  I'm looking
  for a source to help me better understand this separation.
