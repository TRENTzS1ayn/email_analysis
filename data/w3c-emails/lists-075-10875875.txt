I appreciate the thorough and detailed comments WAI submitted. I find
interesting the 508 generalizations and omissions that you have so
carefully expressed.

Your identification that the W3C work has copyright implications poses
an interesting dilemma to the access board, as they pick and choose,
and rephrase without W3C permission.

The W3C WAI guidelines do refer to W3C recommendations, which do not
always generalize to new means to convey information. A concern of the
Access Board is to avoid locking into old and aging technology. Some of
the W3C enthusiasm for developing consistency among their various, and
rapidly evolving technical recommendations

I hope you are right; the deadline was May 30.

Minor typo in mis-transcribing from 508:
In (b)(7) "carat" (a gemstone measure) should be "caret" (a pointer).
