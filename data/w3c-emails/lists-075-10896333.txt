I can't seem to get JAWS to read my pdf document.  It converts as well as
can be expected using the Adobe conversion tool.  What am I missing that I
can't get JAWS to read it to me.  Is it me, JAWS or PDF that is the problem?
The document is at http://www.usmint.gov/reading_room/stratplan99.pdf
<http://www.usmint.gov/reading_room/stratplan99.pdf>  if that helps.
Thanks.
