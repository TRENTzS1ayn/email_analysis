Hi,

How are you trying to read it?  If inside the PDF reader with the access 
plugin, make sure you've selected the Access View with ctrl-4 or from the 
View menu.

I sent the URL you provided to pdf2txt@adobe.com and received back a text 
translation.  I didn't read through the entire file but what I did read had 
text I could understand.

Kelly
