Hello all,

I am cross-posting this to a few lists.  I apologize if you receive this 
more than once.

I am trying to get a feel for how many people use browsers that support 
scripting of some sort, such as JavaScript.  Could you please respond to 
the following six questions?  Send your response to me at wendy@w3.org by 
Monday, 12 June 2000.  Please respond with the subject "User Survey: 
Browsers and scripts". Thank you!

--wendy

1. Do you use a Web browser that supports scripting (such as 
JavaScript)?  yes/no

2. If your browser supports scripts, do you allow scripts to be run on your 
browser? Some people do not run scripts for security reasons.  If you allow 
scripts to be run, please respond yes.  If not, respond no.  yes/no

3. If you do run scripts, do you use an assistive technology such as 
scanning software, a screen reader, a screen magnifier, etc?  yes/no

4. If you do use an assistive technology, do you run into problems with 
pages that use scripts?  yes/no

5.  If you do run into problems, could you tell me more about them?

6.  Please provide information about which browser(s) you use and with 
which assistive technologies.

Thank you for your time!
