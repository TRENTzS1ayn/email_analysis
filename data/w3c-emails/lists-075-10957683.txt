I run lynx and amaya (no javascript) and netscape, opera and windows
(javascript).

I leave scripts on where applicable, but I only run pages on those browsers
if they are unusable on lynx. I do not normally use an assistive techology.

  Hello all,
  
  I am cross-posting this to a few lists.  I apologize if you receive this 
  more than once.
  
  I am trying to get a feel for how many people use browsers that support 
  scripting of some sort, such as JavaScript.  Could you please respond to 
  the following six questions?  Send your response to me at wendy@w3.org by 
  Monday, 12 June 2000.  Please respond with the subject "User Survey: 
  Browsers and scripts". Thank you!
  
  --wendy
  
  1. Do you use a Web browser that supports scripting (such as 
  JavaScript)?  yes/no
  
  2. If your browser supports scripts, do you allow scripts to be run on your 
  browser? Some people do not run scripts for security reasons.  If you allow 
  scripts to be run, please respond yes.  If not, respond no.  yes/no
  
  3. If you do run scripts, do you use an assistive technology such as 
  scanning software, a screen reader, a screen magnifier, etc?  yes/no
  
  4. If you do use an assistive technology, do you run into problems with 
  pages that use scripts?  yes/no
  
  5.  If you do run into problems, could you tell me more about them?
  
  6.  Please provide information about which browser(s) you use and with 
  which assistive technologies.
  
  Thank you for your time!
