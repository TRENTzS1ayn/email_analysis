Using sensible file names is not a requirement nor should it be.
The URI scheme is not meant to convey information or data -- it is
meant to be an almost-entirely arbitrary system (once past the
protocol and hostname identifiers) that associate arbitrary content
with a unique identifier.  There is no requirement that the
unique identifier be human readable, human readable, human
parsable, or convey any information at all apart from uniqueness.
