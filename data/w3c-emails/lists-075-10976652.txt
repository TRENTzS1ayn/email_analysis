If these objects (the files) were always accessed by clicking on links, we
could say that safely.  But that is not true.  Mnemonic file names are
valuable because the resource is accessed through the local file system as
well as through URIs.

And a basic requirement on URIs is that they be able to pass via a cocktail
napkin to the "go to location" manual input of the broser User Interface.
Read the RFC.
