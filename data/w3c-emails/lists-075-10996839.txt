No, this is not always true either.  It's very common to have a URI
scheme on a site that has no consistent relationship to the local
file system -- and with increasing use of database-backed web sites,
this trend will continue.  In many cases, there may not be a file
system at all!  The URI, however, may look much like a file system
in a way that is opaque to the site user (but not the site programmer).

Yes, I'm familiar with that scenario in the RFC, but that's not what's
being discussed here -- transcribability simply means that the URI can
be written down on paper and reproduced in the browser location
window, it doesn't require that the URI _make sense_ to any arbitrary
set of users.  There's no requirement in the RFC that URIs contain
human-readable content.
