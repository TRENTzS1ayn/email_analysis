BTW, this is why frequent readers of my (other, longer) sig will have
noticed that I use "plus links" -- such as http://kynn.com/+koosh
(warning: picture content, no text description) -- when I am giving
out link references in my signature file.  These addresses don't
correspond to filenames on the kynn.com server at all, but rather are
server-level redirects that send people on to another destination.
The +koosh URI, for example, redirects to one of my favorite pictures
from the Virtual Dog Show.

http://kynn.com/+myths is another example, and one that's more text
friendly.

The .htaccess configuration file for kynn.com contains redirect
statements that produce HTTP redirect responses, and your browser
will automatically take you to the right location.

http://kynn.com/+edaptamap is a map and directions from Idyll Mountain
Internet's office to Edapta HQ in San Diego.  The actual URI for that
page is:

Which would -you- rather write on a napkin? :)
