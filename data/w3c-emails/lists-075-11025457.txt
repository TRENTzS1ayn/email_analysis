Clearly the short one.  If you wanted to send someone one to the middle of
the page will the server correctly handle <.../+foo#middle>?

But on Bruce's original question, anchor names appear in the UI in the
status line in various browsers, and are relevant if you have to hand-enter
the URL, and in that case mnemonic quality is a plus.

As Kynn says, it is not a hard requirement; and at times it is hard to do
with the rest of the URI.  But all parts of a URI-reference including the
anchor name or #fragment part are better to the extent that they can be
made mnemonic.
