This sounds like a reasonable way to write URIs, especially on napkins.  I'd
like to understand more about the advantages and disadvantages of doing
this.  Have you encountered anything interesting?

I think that http://kynn.com/+koosh involves more than a good way to
remember the location of a resource.  What your doing is giving a URI to a
URI.  What kinds of characteristics does this imply?  What if I put a link
on my page, http://ben.com/+hairball, that points to http://kynn.com/+koosh?

When alls said and done, the effect of following one of these links is that
I go to http://www.dogshow.com/spring96/pictures/he0661-4.jpg

You went a little further and put additional naming characteristics into
your link " (warning: picture content, no text description) ", and this
brings up issues with URI identity. You control the identity and
significance of your URI, but you do not control the resource it points to.
Your URI has a name with meaning, but the resouce
(http://www.ma...etc...y=128) does not.

This brings up controll of accessibility.  Your sight can be less or more
accessible depending on what URI's you generate, and what resources you
point to.  So my site's accessibility is dependant on your site. What kind
of effects does this interdependance have?

On an offshoot of this - when a person follows that link
(http://kynn.com/+koosh) or any other like it, they are sent to an outside
site - but perhaps expecting to stay within your site.  Suddenly the formats
and layouts all change and different browser requirements are created.  This
might be tough, for example, for screenreaders to handle.
