Would a web site that has 'entirely accessible internal content' be
considered accessible if it had links to non-accesible, external resources?

Especially if those links to external resources add to the value of the
site. For example, an accessible page of "The Top 10 Movie Sites", with
links to movie sites that are non-accessible.
