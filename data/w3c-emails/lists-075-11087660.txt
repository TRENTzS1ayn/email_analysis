Hi All!
As I understand it, while we don't have controll of sites outside our own,
sending people to a site that is not accessible for the purposes of
remuneration may not be doing things accessably.  In the case described
below however, the linking is acceptable.  It would be good though if you
would inform the site to which you are linking that this has occured and
inform them of the issues.
