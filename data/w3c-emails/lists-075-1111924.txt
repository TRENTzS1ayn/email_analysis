The problem is that, given a site which requires frames and javascript for
basic navigation, it is a bit difficult to make an assessment of what they
say...

Fortuntely for me I can run a frames and javascript capable browser when i
get back to the office, since i can see what it is doing. But it makes an
interesting ilustration of the problem.

  Thanks for the quick responses. I have been doing a lot of research on 
  accessible web design for my company, and was just saying how I bet there 
  are more blind and visually impaired users than Mac users on the Internet - 
  according to the OS and browser stats at http://www.StatMarket.com.
  
  Well...I was asked to back that assertion up by a manager. <GULP> I don't 
  know how accurate the self-reported figures at GVU are, but they the only 
  ones I've seen so far.
  
  It sure would be a boost to accessible web design efforts if we had a good 
  source of these figures!
  
  Again, thanks for the quick replies.
  
  Regards;
