Providing information on the accessibility (as far as it is known) of the
things at the other ends of the links would be helpful. With wide deployment
of RDF and the so-called semantic web this will actually become easy, as
well.

But I agree that you cannot be held responsible for the things you point to
(with some exceptions that are not especially relevant to the question).

  Define "accessible."

  Yes, or else you can't allow links to -anywhere- that you can't
  control, in the name of "accessibility."
