Charles,

A full on-line curriculum for teaching the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines is at 
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/wcag-curric>. This curriculum includes extensive
examples of HTML markup, which could be helpful in your course. 

Also some good HTML-related material in the Techniques document at
<http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-TECHS> although that's not in curriculum format.
