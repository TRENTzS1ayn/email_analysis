If you don't provide some knd of alt (text, or empty quotes) then you cannot
create valid HTML for any version since 3.2

My preference is for empty quotes when there is nothing useful to say about
the image (in terms of its function - if you want to add a title or longdesc,
then feel free).

  I've heard two schools of thought on alt tagging images. I'd appreciate a
  definitive answer, if one exists on this issue.
  
  1st school: Alt tag every image, no matter how insignificant.
  2nd school: If the image is a spacer gif or decorate bullet-type element, use ""
  (empty quotes).
  
  I was told by a user of screen readers that hearing the description of redundant
  elements was annoying, so I'm seeking clarification. Additionally, how does
  Bobby or any of the verification applications handle the empty tags?
  
  Thanks to the list for answering these very basic questions.
