As Charles indicates, this discussion keeps reappearing.  I just want to 
try again to make a point which I guess I didn't get across in earlier 
discussions.  The point is this:

"focus" cannot logically be made the same as "mouseover"

That's because "focus" is keyboard focus:  the object with keyboard focus 
is the object that will get keyboard events.
wherease
"mouseover"  is MOUSE BUTTON focus: the object with mouse button focus is 
the object that will get mouse click events.

For example, if my text cursor is in a text field, that text field has 
keyboard focus, but I can move the mouse over a link.  e.g. for purposes of 
clicking on that link.  When I move the mouse over that link, I'm giving 
the link mouse focus without disturbing the keyboard focus.

Thus, any solution which to make focus and mouseover the same will deny 
full functionality to people who are not using a mouse (or mouse 
equivalent).  This is because if the user has just one focus, s/he will 
lose his/er keyboard focus when moving the single focus to where mouse 
focus is needed.  And visa versa.

Whats really needed is separate keyboard control of mouse focus, either in 
the user agent, or in the assistive technology attached to the user agent.
