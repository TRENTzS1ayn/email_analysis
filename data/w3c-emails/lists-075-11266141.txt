Bobby passes null ALT tags.  Missing ALT tags is valid for HTML 3.2.  Null ALT is valid
HTML 4x.

Alan Flavell is brilliant and occasional contributes to this list.  The article in
question, however, is NOT strongly oriented towards consideration of the blind.  For
bullets and rules, use * and --- which have the advantage of not usually being spoken

http://ppewww.ph.gla.ac.uk/~flavell/alt/alt-table.html which summarizes things up
nicely.
