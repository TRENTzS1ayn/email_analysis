I agree with Karl.

Where markup exists, use it. That's an important part of writing in a markup
language. Using a punctuation convention is the same as creating a new markup
language, but one that is less-well understood...

  I disagree. If you use bullets, you should use the 'li' element (in 'ul'
  of course). If you want a rule, you should use the 'hr' element,
  specifically designed for this.
