Whether section 508 will have much of an impact is still out to the jury in 
my mind.  But I think it is one of the first right things the feds have 
done for accessibility in a long time.

In the physical world I firmly believe that standards on what's meant by 
"accessible" have had a very positive effect.  Now we have some clearly 
delineated standards that one can point to in the information technology 
sector.

The conservative and libertarian claptrap that it is unconstitutional and 
such is pure bunk.  I can't go out and build a factory polluting the 
environment and simply say tough luck for the people who have to suffer.

We live in the information age and need standards and guidelines to ensure 
everyone has access.

Quite frankly education and appealing to corporate good will only go so far 
and thus far I'd say that hasn't been far at all.  I say good for the 
feds,I'm tired of my tax dollars continuing to support inaccessibility and 
am glad that some level of change will happen because of 508.

If businesses close because of 508, then it is their own fault.  Here the 
government is spelling out exactly what they want a business to do.  Any 
business person worth a penny will grab the chance to get a customer to be 
this specific.
