No offense was meant, mostly I was just trying to be funny.  Guess I failed
at that!

Preaching to the choir is one thing.  And I certainly would not be a regular
here if I was bothered by constantly being reminded that I was not doing
things quite the RIGHT way!

I would just point that the original question was very simple.  The thread
generated has been very illuminative, but NOT entirely on topic.

Which is the more compelling (and easier to sell) message:

(1) Your pages can look pretty much just like they do now, you just have to
do a few relatively easy things to make them accessible.  You can pretty
much keep working the way you have been, just be mindful of few more
details.

or

(2) Your pages suck.  You SHOULD be writing using strict HTML 4.01 (or even
better, XHTML 1.0) and CSS.  Redo everything you've got, and learn to author
new pages differently.

Cheers,
Bruce Bailey
