>New Workshop Opens the Internet to More People in More Situations
>Optavia Corporation Announces Web Accessibility Workshop Debuting June 2000
>
>MADISON, WI (May 24, 2000) - Optavia Corporation today announced the first
>public offering of a new web accessibility workshop. The workshop helps
>developers, designers, and managers design web sites that can be used by
>more people in more situations.
>
>?Web Accessibility: More People, More Situations. More Business.? is part of
>a series of tutorials to be held with the HFWeb conference at the University
>of Texas Thompson Conference Center in Austin, TX, on June 19-21, 2000.
>Optavia Corporation also offers the workshop at clients? sites.
>
>?Web site accessibility is getting more attention with recent regulative and
>legal activities. It is also becoming more visible because of the growing
>number of older Internet shoppers,? says Shawn Henry, director of R&D at
>Optavia Corporation. ?There are strong motivations for organizations to
>follow web accessibility guidelines in developing their web sites.?
>
>Henry created the web accessibility workshop with Wendy Chisholm. Chisholm
>is a web accessibility engineer for the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web
>Accessibility Initiative (WAI) (http://www.w3.org/WAI/), and coeditor of the
>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
>
>?A primary goal is to make web sites accessible to people with disabilities.
>The beauty of it is that in making web sites more accessible, companies also
>make their web sites better for everybody,? says Henry, an accessibility
>specialist. ?The techniques are similar whether the limitation is functional
>or situational, such as listening to a voicing browser read a web page while
>driving a car, or getting instructions from a web site on how to fix
>machinery while in a dark factory.?
>
>For more information about the HFWeb 2000 conference tutorials and to
