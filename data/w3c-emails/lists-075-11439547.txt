  No offense was meant, mostly I was just trying to be funny.  Guess I failed
  at that!
  
  Preaching to the choir is one thing.  And I certainly would not be a regular
  here if I was bothered by constantly being reminded that I was not doing
  things quite the RIGHT way!
  
  I would just point that the original question was very simple.  The thread
  generated has been very illuminative, but NOT entirely on topic.
  
  Which is the more compelling (and easier to sell) message:
  
  (1) Your pages can look pretty much just like they do now, you just have to
  do a few relatively easy things to make them accessible.  You can pretty
  much keep working the way you have been, just be mindful of few more
  details.
  
  or
  
  (2) Your pages suck.  You SHOULD be writing using strict HTML 4.01 (or even
  better, XHTML 1.0) and CSS.  Redo everything you've got, and learn to author
  new pages differently.
  
  Cheers,
  Bruce Bailey
