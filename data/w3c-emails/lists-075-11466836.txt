Hi to All on this List!

 I have a question about PDFfiles.  If I have posted to the wrong list,
please forgive me.  If anyone wants to answer me privately, please feel free
to do so.  taymade@home.com

I host, as well as design, sites.  I have a potential client who asked me:


~~I need to put up a 1-page web site for a client, the purpose of which is
to make available certain commonly requested information.  The site will
consist of 3 Adobe PDF files and 4 Word files.  Obviously the Adobe
files are for printing and the Word files for downloading.~~


I as told by the server that I put my clients on that everything would be
okay as long as none of the files were in the root (directory.)  How does
one go about FTP'ing PDF files and Word Files that can be downloaded by
viewers?

I hate to sound stupid about this, but I honestly don't know anything about
PDF files.  I have seen it done on many sites I have been to, but I was
wondering what protocol is used to ftp them correctly so they work properly
when called up.

I thank everyone in advance for their help.

Regards,
