| I think that's the Unicode Technical Report #7 "Plane 14 Characters
for
| Language Tags".  It's available from:
|
|     http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr7/
|

Thank you for the information.

Well, I think making it *impossible* to specify the language of parts of
an attribute value is vary bad idea, especially in a ?new? technology
like XML is.

This is of course not just a problem with (X)HTML; it makes it
impossible to specifiy language information in attribute values in *all*
XML applications. This is very unfortunate.

Well, I can do this already by using the 'object' element, but there's
still problems. You can't use 'lang' or 'xml:lang' inside the 'title' or
'summary' attribute. It's often unavoidable to use words from several
languages as attribute values (e.g. proper names).
