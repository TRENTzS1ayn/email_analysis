Comments are preferred as part of the body of email rather than attachments,
for ease of use and archiving. In any case please do not use a word processor
format, since many members of the list will not be able to read your comments
at all.

  Charles,
  
  May comments be made in an attachment to a message to the list?  If so, is
  there a preferred format, i.e., text, Microsoft Word, whatever?
