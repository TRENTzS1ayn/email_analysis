CM:: "Education will produce content creators that understand the 
tangible benefits of accessibility...I think that the work on
legislation is counterproductive"

WL: Work on legislation has produced 100X the effect on "education" in
these matters than all the other press releases, guideline
announcements, plenary speeches, etc. combined. The effect on MicroSoft
of Massachusetts' refusal to buy products a few years back was followed
closely (according to MS, coincidentally rather than as a result of <g>)
by major steps towards improved accessibility of their products. The
same thing is happening due to Section 508. As to the impossibility of
enforcement - so what? If the feds won't buy Web services from companies
that don't produce compliant sites, the companies will trumpet their
conformance. If ADA is invoked at any level it's more significant that
compliance increases, not that prosecutions result. 
Legislative/regulatory efforts are educational. It's a shame that Chris
doesn't feel a part of the "government", but some of us do and hold that
unless these entities provide guidance in these matters the results will
be meager from other means of communicating any of these issues.

The metaphor of curb cuts will be remarked upon by media much more
prominently after legislative notoriety calls it to their attention
better than a gaggle of press releases from some obscure standards
setting consortium. As Chris Maden says "This is the message that really
needs to get out."
