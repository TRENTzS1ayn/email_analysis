Well,  one way to get more information about what a page is doing is to use a
WYSIWYG editor as a user agent - some of the better ones have enough
functionality to rival more "traditional" browsers.

  yes, use of the div element in conjunction with the title attribute is a 
  far superior method of marking a block of text thank is the horizontal 
  rule, as it marks all child blocks as part of that page -- which can be an 
  important consideration when one is using web-based material which was 
  converted from print, and where knowledge of the print conventions used in 
  the original can be extremely important to the end user, something which is 
  especially important when web-based content is being used in an academic 
  setting...
  
  of course, getting the title from a div is even harder than obtaining it 
  from a horizontal rule, even if you are using a user agent that exposes the 
  content of the title attribute as a ToolTip OnMouseOver -- especially if 
  you are incapable of using (or don't even own) a pointing device...   it 
  also doesn't help that those UAs that do support exposition of the title 
  attribute do so spottily (expansion of title for ACRONYM but not ABBR in 
  MSIE 5.01, for example), and that support for the tooltip method of 
  exposing the title attribute changes drastically from release to release 
  (i've been told that IE4, for example, exposed titles appended to 
  horizontal rules OnMouseOver...
  
  hopefully, uniform (and universal) implementation of the W3C DOM in 
  mainstream UAs will fix that, though, for it is from the DOM that a 
  DOM-aware adaptive technology could extract such extended semantic 
  information, and make it available to the user either on-demand, as a 
  default, or not at all, depending upon the users' preference...  and strict 
  adherence to the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines will ensure that, if 
  the user so desires, such extended semantic information will be available 
  to users regardless of modality...
