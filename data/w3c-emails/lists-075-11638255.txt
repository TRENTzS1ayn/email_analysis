The Boosting the Net 2000 Report is online at http://www.netecon2000.com/.
As a participant in the online think-tank debate, I am pleased to report
selected recommendations addressing accessible web:

Recommendation 44:  Online elections should always be accompanied by a
well-publicised and easy-to-use postal voting option, to ensure access for
all.  Election web sites must also be thoroughly checked against
accessibility standards to allow access by the blind and visually impaired
people, disabled people, those with early versions of browser software and
others.(Page 28)

Recommendation 46:  There is a need to increase awareness among
decision-makers at all levels about what new technologies are and what they
can be used for, including within local communities where development must
be rooted.(Page 29)

Recommendation 60:  Governments should adopt accessible web design policies
across all their sites without delay. (Page 34

Recommendation 61:  Lobby groups and others should develop portfolios of
example web sites that are both highly accessible and highly attractive, to
show people what is possible.  (Page 35)

There were 66 recommendations in total and I recommend that members view the
entire report since there are many interesting issues addressed.

Best regards,

Cynthia D. Waddell
