I imagine that when it comes time for the HTML group to redesign object (and
other parts of XHTML perhaps, by and by) they will be more inclined to use
full elements insterad of attributes. This is certainly the apparent trend
among similar groups like SVG and SMIL.

I agree that it is a problem not being able to internationalise
attributes. The two approaches are to redesign the elements so they have
content (like object does in general, although not for title) that can be
real XML, and therefore can be internationalised, or to add attributes that
describe the properties of other attributes. Either case means buidling new
tools, but in teh second one it gets messy much more quickly.

Cheers

  Thank you for the information.

  Well, I think making it *impossible* to specify the language of parts of
  an attribute value is vary bad idea, especially in a ?new? technology
  like XML is.
  
  This is of course not just a problem with (X)HTML; it makes it
  impossible to specifiy language information in attribute values in *all*
  XML applications. This is very unfortunate.

  | language in the middle of alt text using the "xml:lang" attribute
  | via "span" or whatever appropriate element.
  
  Well, I can do this already by using the 'object' element, but there's
  still problems. You can't use 'lang' or 'xml:lang' inside the 'title' or
  'summary' attribute. It's often unavoidable to use words from several
  languages as attribute values (e.g. proper names).
