Well put Michael Burks,

If you are lucky enough to find a restroom large enough for disabled 
people, the odds are it is being used as extra storage space.

I make this point, as it seems to me having followed this group for more 
than 6 months now, there are a few people that make valid points but too 
many times they get lost in the techno babble. To coin a well worn phrase 
"when up to your butt in alligators, it is difficult to remember the 
original objective was to clear the swamp"

I would respectfully ask when did the list members last read the mission 
statement?

Perhaps a better way is not to treat the symptoms, but attempt to cure the 
disease. To force an issue in law is to antagonize, however to educate is 
to enlighten. The people that should be targeted for building accessible 
sites are the young and next generation of web builders. Not the ' I love 
rotating gifs, Java and big images built in frames' brigade.

Has anyone asked the question what is the average life span of a web page? 
To force a company to change a site by law is expensive for everyone and 
will be resisted. The extra costs will be added to the products or 
services. But to educate and have new or updated pages accessible as they 
go up, I believe is the way forward.



err........is that me off the list now?
