The changes that JFW makes to Internet Explorer settings are no longer 
really necessary for performance of the screen reader.  Since the company 
introduced a virtual cursor mode, I've found that I can leave all the IE 
settings in any fashion I want with no negative impact on JFW 
performance.  I'm not entirely sure why the company still makes the 
adjustments they have.
