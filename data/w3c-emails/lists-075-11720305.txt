Yes, the second one sounds real messy. If elements are used in stead of
attributes ('alt', 'title', 'summary' and 'label'), how would this work?
Should the attributes be turned into a child elements, like this:

<p><title>foo</title>Dorem ipsum dolor</p>

BTW, there's currently no problems if the a attribute contains *only*
words from another language:

<p lang="nn"><abbr lang="en" title="HyperText Markup Language"><span
lang="nn">HTML</span></abbr> er ein interessant standard.</p>

Here, 'HyperText Markup Language' should be pronouced in an English
voice, while 'HTML' should be pronouced like the these letters are in
Norwegian Nynorsk.
