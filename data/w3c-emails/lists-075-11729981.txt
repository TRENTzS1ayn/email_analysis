I just launched a new version of my website and have several emails
commenting on font size. I specified the font size in my stylesheet as 9 pt.
As I'm sure many of you know, when trying to change that size using the
browser (through View --> Text Size), the user is unable to change the size
at all.

My question is this: What is the best way to specify font sizes in a
stylesheet so that the user is still able to adjust the size if necessary?
Should I be using pts, ems, pixels, percentages? Or should I not specify
size at all and just rely on user defaults?

Thanks in advance,
Sarah Kuehnle
