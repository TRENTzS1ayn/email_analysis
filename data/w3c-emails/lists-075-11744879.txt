I would suggest using em, or percentage, rather than points, pixels, or other
measures of size. However, you should be aware that there are some bugs in
old implementations, and some size declarations will not be captured. More
importantly, the actual rendered size of a 9pt font varies tremendously
across platforms - what may look fine on Macintosh may be enormous on Windows
and unreadably small on linux, for example. In general, therefore, I would
suggest staying away from specifying font sizes where possible.

  As I'm sure many of you know, when trying to change that size using the

  at all.

  My question is this: What is the best way to specify font sizes in a
  stylesheet so that the user is still able to adjust the size if necessary?
  Should I be using pts, ems, pixels, percentages? Or should I not specify
  size at all and just rely on user defaults?
  
  Thanks in advance,
