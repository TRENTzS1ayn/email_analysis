You have this about right. Another possiblity is to have several children:

<section>
<title xml:lang="en">the section</title>
<title xml:lang="fr">la section</title>
<text
xml:lang="x-rubbish">uhonvurogv8wnhvp5gos8herlimhcl45789eynglsve8mhgc5lexy5gvl8nvm5sl7n4iz7ewnvlzerhguv</text>
</section>

...

cheers

  Yes, the second one sounds real messy. If elements are used in stead of
  attributes ('alt', 'title', 'summary' and 'label'), how would this work?
  Should the attributes be turned into a child elements, like this:
  
  <p><title>foo</title>Dorem ipsum dolor</p>
  
  BTW, there's currently no problems if the a attribute contains *only*
  words from another language:
  
  <p lang="nn"><abbr lang="en" title="HyperText Markup Language"><span
  lang="nn">HTML</span></abbr> er ein interessant standard.</p>
  
  Here, 'HyperText Markup Language' should be pronouced in an English
  voice, while 'HTML' should be pronouced like the these letters are in
  Norwegian Nynorsk.
