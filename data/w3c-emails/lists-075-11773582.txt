There are a lot of tools and resources available to make understanding web
pages easier.  Assistive techonologies are fairly easy for me to locate and
identify.

What tools/resources are there that specifically gear themselves towards
creating an accessible HTML page?

I see three categories:
Guidelines        - the WAI guidlines and the section 508 requirements
Philosophy        - common sense and specific design issues (this forum is a
good example of a source)
Testing equipment    - using various technologies (ie low-res screens, old
browsers, screenreaders) to see first-hand what your page is like.

Are there any other categories that specifically relate to creating an
accessible HTML page? or tools that perhaps are not apparent in the above
categories?

thanks,
