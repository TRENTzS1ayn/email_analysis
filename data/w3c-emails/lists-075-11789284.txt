Benjamin,

There's the "Evaluation and Repair Tool" list at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/existingtools.html
which has some tools that might be relevant, in that they'd help with part
of the task of creating an accessible page. 

We're hoping that within the next half-year or so there will be some
commercial-grade authoring tools that will support the Authoring Tool
Accessibility Guidelines 1.0. Then those tools would have some built-in
assistance on creating accessible Web pages. (You can ask your favorite
software developer when they'll be supporting ATAG 1.0...)

You might also find the "Getting Started: Making a Web Site Accessible"
page at 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/gettingstarted
to be useful for thinking through how to use various WAI resources, or
perhaps you are already familiar with what's listed there.

Regards,

- Judy
