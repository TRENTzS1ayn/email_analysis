Pixel-width specifications in CSS have the potential to 
decrease accessibility to people with low vision, who may
have specified a larger font size.  Designs that are based
on "absolute units" such as pixels do not scale up well when
the user changes the font size -- a better approach would 
be to use "relative units" such as ems (the width of a
capital letter M) or exes (the height of lowercase x).

These scale relative to the base font, and thus if you change
the size of that, the rest of the page should stay in
proportion.

Is this what you meant?

PS:  Hey, David, since when do you have an address at the
usmint?
