aloha, charles!

as a strategy for experiencing HTML 4x the way it was intended to work [1], 
charles suggested:

one way to get more information about what a page is doing is to use a 
WYSIWYG editor as a user agent - some of the better ones have enough 
functionality to rival more "traditional" browsers.
unquote

unfortunately, the user interface (UI) -- or significant parts thereof -- 
of most WYSIWYG editors are themselves inaccessible, and even the browser 
emulation modes of several popular extended text editors aren't useful to 
anyone who can't see the screen [2] -- but thanks to ATAG [3] this is 
beginning to change -- or, at least, the developers are now aware of the 
full extent of the problems that need to be fixed, but for now, using an 
authoring tool to render content isn't a viable solution for a large number 
of users ...
