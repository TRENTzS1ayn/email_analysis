Indeed, not only is it completely incomprehensible with Lynx, but also with Internet Explorer 4.01.  (Caveat: At leastt, with my screen reader JFW 3.2).  In fact, this is such a good example of what not to do in termes of accessible design, perhaps I'll use it in one of my presentations.
When I use Lynx, I hear many many occurrences of "left bracket link right bracket" and "left bracket INLINE right bracket".  Apparently these are image map links with no alt text and images of some kind.
When I use Internet Explorer, my screen reader says many many  times just "link".  

I find it ironic (at first humorously so) that more and more articles are being written about accessible design (a  good thing of course) that are not accessible themselves, or are placed on a site in such a way that, although the article itself may be accessible, the path to get to it is not.

But through Lynx the site is incomprehensible. I'll try it with something
else at work tomorrow.
