PJ:
Kynn, good explanation, but do you have any information on which browsers
support ems and exes?

The resource I use at
http://webreview.com/wr/pub/guides/style/mastergrid.html is somewhat
detailed and lists Nav4 -partial, IE3- partial, IE4- yes, IE5- yes, Opr3-
yes on the Windows platform, but is also confusing when listing exes as
quirky on all browsers because exes are not technically one half of ems per
the note?
[See the last section on the page at  6.1  Length Units ]
They also have a nice test suite at
http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/current/sec61.htm
