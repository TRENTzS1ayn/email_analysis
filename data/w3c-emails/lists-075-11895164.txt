As far as I know, the only discussion of accessiblity of Electronic
signatures has been initiated by Cynthia Waddell.  She is the only one who
has seen the implications.

This is serious and it will be voted on today in the US.  Congressmen and
Senators need to be made aware.  I sent the same message to each of them who
has an email id, but I doubt that they have read it.

Sincerely,

I think I also heard an item on the radio this morning to the effect that
the Ontario House of Commons has passed legislation to give electronic
signatures the weight of law similar to that previously only given to paper
signatures.  Has there been similar discussion of accessibility in the
Canadian context?
