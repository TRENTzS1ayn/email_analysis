Frequently it is bruted about herein that items relating to overall
usability without regard to disability status is/isn't fair game for our
attentions.

On Webwatch list Patrick Burke addresses this: "So on one level, our
efforts are part of the ever-continuing uphill battle to get designers
to think about what users need & want, rather than what the latest
authoring gadget can do."

After wrestling with this since WAI started, I come down on the side
that if usability/universal design considerations are about things that
make a site impossible/difficult to use *regardless of whether this is
true for everybody or just PWDs* it is a priority1/priority2 issue.
