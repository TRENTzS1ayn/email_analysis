I received a flyer in the (snail) mail for a product called WebKing by
ParaSoft.
I won't bore you with ALL the details, <details> but - the flyer starts
off by saying "At last there's an end to the browser wars. WebKing
automatically checks your HTML against World Wide Web Consortium
standards to make sure your site will display perfectly in any browser."

<my comments> doesn't say what standards </my comments>

I went to their site http://www.thewebking.com/wars.htm and found the
following:

The first thing that happens is that you get redirected to:
http://thewebking.com/products/webking/download.htm

So, I go digging. 

On their Quick Overview Page 
http://thewebking.com/products/webking/quick/about.htm "WebKing's
CodeWizard feature enforces the most important HTML, Cascading Style
Sheet (CSS), and JavaScript coding standards."
On their White Paper Page
http://thewebking.com/products/webking/papers/webkingwp0.htm  In the
section about White Box testing "After triggering each page, WebKing
thoroughly tests whether each page's links (including links to and from
dynamic pages) and HTML, JavaScript, and Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)
code will operate correctly. By creating pages as a part of its testing
process, WebKing solves one of the greatest problems of testing dynamic
sites: how to test pages that don't exist as physical HTML pages. And by
applying the most sophisticated tests available to the pages, it exposes
a large number and variety of errors. The types of problems that these
tests can find include: 
<snip>
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript problems, including: 
<snip>
Errors that affect localization (for those doing business across the
globe in a wide array of languages). 
<snip>
Presentation errors that can affect the way your page looks. 
<snip>
and last, but not least (my words, not theirs) 
Accessibility issues for users with special needs. 

<my comments> doesn't say what special needs </my comments>

In the Coding Standards Enforcement section on the same page, "WebKing
automatically applies a default set of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS coding
standards to both static and dynamic pages as it performs white-box,
black-box, regression, and Web-Box testing. You can customize and expand
the default coding standards with the RuleWizard feature introduced in
the Black-Box Testing section. In addition to letting you create rules
that check whether invariable elements are included in certain types of
pages, RuleWizard also lets you customize existing CodeWizard rules, or
create your own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript coding standards."

</details>

I didn't find anywhere on their site where they repeated the claim made
in the flyer (about the W3C standards).

<my questions>Has anyone used this product?  Is it worth trying the
download?  Does it live up to its claims?  If not, here's their e-mail
address:  mailto:info@thewebking.com   </my questions>
