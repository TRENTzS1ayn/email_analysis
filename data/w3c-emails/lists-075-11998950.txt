I'd feel sorrier for the "poor, suffering" web designers if I felt
any large number of them actually CARED about the standards and
were actively trying to implement them.  I feel this is not the
case at all -- most web designers are woefully ignorant of even
the HTML 4 spec, let alone accessibility considerations -- and
articles such as these (and many of the Web Standards Project's
efforts) unfairly place the entirely of the blame on the browser
makers.

Sure, they've failed -- but the web design community, as a whole,
has done little to promote validity and accessibility as noble
goals, and I think it's a bit two-faced to paint the browser makers
as the bad guys.  It's much less a "popular" stance to say that
web designers, in their (often willful) ignorance, share the
blame; it's easy to rail against the villains, as long as they're
not "us."
