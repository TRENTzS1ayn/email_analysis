I agree that it's very important to have people monitoring policy
development around technology and accessibility issues. But the main
purpose of the WAI Interest Group list is not to monitor the development of
U.S. policy or that of any other country, nor to berate people about policy
actions taken or not in specific countries. Some non-W3C lists provide
options to do that, and I think that there needs to be more people
participating in technology policy monitoring and response on such lists.

It's still useful to exchange information on this list about policy
developments that may be informative for parallel developments in different
countries or that others may want to look into, and yes, you (Mike) shared
Cynthia's list of questions & concerns on this list on Tuesday evening U.S.
Eastern Time -- for a Wednesday vote in the U.S. House and a Thursday vote
in the Senate, apparently, which doesn't give the people who are in a
position to respond on policy issues in the U.S. much time to do so -- but
that can sometimes still be accomplished with targeted calls or emails to
policy advocates and others.

W3C does not typically participate directly in policy development, nor does
it monitor the language of such bills as they are in development. It does
develop technologies that are sometimes referenced in such legislation.
It's important that various networks of people monitor how the technology
and the policy intersect, ask questions, and help develop a technical and a
policy analysis and a timely response to particular problems. 

In looking at Cynthia's questions, one of the questions that I have is
whether the US Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) wouldn't supercede the
bill's apparent failure to address the need for accessible formats in
completing electronic transactions, and whether this couldn't be clarified
in a regulatory process. That's probably too detailed of a policy debate to
get into on this list, but for those pursuing some follow-up on this issue
it might be a question worth looking into.

Regards,

- Judy
