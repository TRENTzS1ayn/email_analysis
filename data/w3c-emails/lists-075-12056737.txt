Mike, keep in mind that on an international list, not everyone here
is going to be responsible for the laws in any given country.

Also, in my opinion, there is not much that I -- as an American
citizen in this case -- could do to affect such a law passing or not;
in many cases (as with the CDA a few years ago) we just have to hope
that the courts will be fairer than the legislature, especially
during an election year.
