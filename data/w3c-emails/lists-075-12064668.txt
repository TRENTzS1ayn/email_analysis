Hi Phillip,

If you are not too busy road testing software, could you fit in another 
program?

Brookes University of Oxford have developed a talking browser that is still 
in beta format. Called B/Talk they need it tested and feed back from the 
testers. There is a CD ROM available or it can be downloaded from their web 
site here is the link.

I only mention it in passing, I hope you find it interesting.

regards
Paul Davis
