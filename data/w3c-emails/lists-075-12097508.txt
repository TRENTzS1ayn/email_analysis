Has anyone tried this? Comments?

How does one tab through the controls and links?

I liked it, it installed easily in Linux, and feels stable.

It appears to produce our homepages in much the same format as ie5.

It looks as though it might not be an horrendous amount of work to correct
my coding errors.

I'm looking forward to the release.
