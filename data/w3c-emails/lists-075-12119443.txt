I have designed my site to meet with the Bobby approval. I have been an avid
voyeur of your conversations over the past year and recognize that my site
may not be as good as I hope.  Please spend some time around our site and
offer any comments to me at:

lbrockbank@uta.cog.ut.us

The URL is www.rideuta.com.

I strongly believe in the importance of designing information that is
accessible by all.  I hope to eventually see more transit agencies hop on
board.
