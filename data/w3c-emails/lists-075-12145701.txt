Thomas is right - problem one is that there are users who are completely
excluded (like me, when I first tried to get to the site - I don't have
javascript on Lynx).

A couple of comments about the content inside the site:

Grouping things in red by using a font element instead of either a class, or
div/table grouping markup, violates checkpoints of WCAG.

Although it is not trivial to do, it is not very complex to  to provide an
interface through a database system that allows the user to customise the
presentation - a sort of wizard-based stylesheet generator can apply ACSS,
colours, different fonts, or whatever. Since you use cookies it is not hard
to track that and provide an approproiate stylesheet link.

The tables that specify the actual times should be laid out horizontally
insted of vertically - that way the reader gets

Stop x   9am  10am  11am  12.15pm
stop y  9.02  10.02 11.15  1pm

read out instead of

stop x stop y stop z
               9am
               902am
               905am
               10am
               1002am
               1011am
               1100am
              1110am
               1115am
               12am
               1209am

etc.

Alternatively, you could provide a link to the tablin service at
http://jigsaw.w3.org:8000/tablin or download it and use it to test /
linearise tables yourself - http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/tablin

(Note that thesee comments apply to the noshock version - I ahve not looked
at the other yet.

cheers

  You should check the site with Javascript turned off.  This doesn't bode
  well for many users:
  
      <body onLoad="CheckBrowser()">
      </body>
      </html>
