Another one (still on the noshock version):

For people who are tabbing through links, the fewer they have to tab through
the better. So rather than have images, and then a seperate row of text links
that say the same, try using a single row of links, each of which has both
the image and the text in it (here you might think about different alt text,
such as "link: "

Then you get (in a text browser or screenreader)

link: different stuff

as the text for the link. (or you could have alt="")
