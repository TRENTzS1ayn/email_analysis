The templates provided in the latest version of "techniques for Authoring
Tool Accessibility" - http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG10-TECHS with the stylesheet
at http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG10-TECHS/templates/cmnStyle.css

This stylesheet relies on floats (and uses block display as well) to provide
columnar display, and contains a few margins. Words of caution: the float
propoerty doesn't work in IE 5.0 for the Macintosh (it did for IE4.5 on the
Mac - version 5.0 wasn't available when these were tested :-( so it looks a
little funny on that browser. There is also a bug in IE 3's interpretation of
margin-bottom (I think) that makes a big mess if it is less than 1em.

You might like to check the CSS page as well - that has a number of useful
resources listed - http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS

  Hi All,
  
  If anyone has an example handy of a stylesheet used for indentation or 
  multi-column layout, etc., could you please point me to it? Ideally where I 
  can examine the css along with the result.
  
  Huge thanks,
  Patrick
