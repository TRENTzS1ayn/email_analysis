Bobby is good for what it is. It will, however, approve a completely useless
Flash site.

Hi Leslie,

I visited rideuta.com using pwWebSpeak32 last night and greeted with a blank
page. I guess Bobby was sleeping on this job. I suggest you take a look at
this
http://www-3.ibm.com/able/accessweb.html. Phill Jenkins, IBM Accessibility
Center - Special Needs Systems, recommended it to me on Monday and I found
it
very informative. Thanks Phil. Take a look at my site located at
http://members.colis.com/~jamaican/. Please note I have not done any
enhancements or updates since I discovered WAI but pwWebSpeak32 is still
able to
read about 80%. of each page.

I am happy to see you and the UTA are taking the initiative to be PWD
friendly
not only in the real world but also in cyber world. Keep up the good work. I
know you will improve your PWD friendly web authoring skills.

Philip
