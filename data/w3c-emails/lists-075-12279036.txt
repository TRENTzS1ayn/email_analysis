Paul, 

yes, PWWebSpeak is a good, inexpensive option.  So is IBM's Home Page
Reader.  But concerning the costs of the screen reader packages, why not
just get a demo copy of the pacage, such as JFW, Window eyes, Dolphin's
Super Nova, Artic's WinVision and SyntheVoice's Window Bridge.  I believe
the only one that costs any $is JFW for $30 for a full version of the
software that times out after 30 days.  The other pakages have free demo
packages which usually timout after 20 minutes.  Hope this helps.
