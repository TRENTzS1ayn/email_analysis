Hi Leslie,

One suggestion I have is to make the home page (index.htm or start page for the
site) mostly text with no Flash or Shockwave. This will allow PWD to be able to get
their bearings of the site. Form there you can link to pages with Flash, Shockwave
and other multimedia. Remember to put alternative text links for the shockwave
links.
