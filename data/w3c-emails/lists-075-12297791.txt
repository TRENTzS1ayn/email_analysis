Philip,

I may not be fair to say that Bobby was sleeping on the job.  Phil Jenkins
covered most of the issues in his response to the original email.  I do want
to mention three things:

1. Bobby is not perfect.
2. CAST requires that the page author conduct a number of manual checks.
They do not always comply and we do notify sites when we are alerted of a
problem.
3. We note that the growing Bobby Approved database (currently at 921)
available at

http://dev.cast.org/bobby/approved_database.cfm

is not monitored and we hope that those who use it will notify Webmasters or
developers who enter sites that have not passed both the electronic and
manual checks for WAI priority one conformance.

Many thousands of sites are tested with Bobby.  Some use the icon but many
do not.  Of the thousands that do, CAST does not have the resources to
police compliance so we depend on you to help identify and perhaps even
notify those who use the icon improperly.

By the way, we do have someone who scans the database sites for material
that we feel may not be appropriate for all viewing audiences and have
removed quite a few from the list.

Finally, we do welcome your comments and strive to continuously improve
Bobby.

Chuck
