Subject: accessibility survey


Hello.  My name is Andrea Kerzner and I am with Complete Media Group
in
Cleveland, OH.  We are an internet design and development company that
specializes in website accessibility.  It is our goal to make all of
the
websites we design easy to use for people with disabilities.  I have
been
distributing a survey to a large variety of foundations and services
for the
blind and disabled.  The survey is about making the internet more
accessible
for the disabled community, and your answers will directly affect how
we
design websites and will help influence others in the internet
community and
beyond.

I've received much feedback from other foundations and services, and I
was
hoping to obtain some participants from GUISpeak.  The survey is
simple and
brief and can be sent through email for time convenience.  If you
would be
interested in assisting us with our endeavors, we would greatly
appreciate
it.  Please let me know if the survey is something you would be
willing to
participate in.   If you have any questions or comments, please feel
free to
email me or call me at 216-901-1212.  Again, thank you very much and I
look
forward to hearing from you.

Respectfully,
Andrea Kerzner
