Hi All,

Before you know it, they'll be wiring public bathrooms with Internet
service...and it still won't be fully accessible. <sigh>

NEWS CORP. GOES AIRBORNE WITH WEB SERVICE
News Corp. is teaming up with Globalstar and Qualcomm to offer air travelers
e-mail and Internet connections while aloft. The announcement comes less
than two months after Boeing announced it was forming a similar venture with
Loral Space and Mitsubishi. Some analysts estimate this fast-growing segment
of airborne communications could produce more than $50 billion in worldwide
revenue over the next decade. The News Corp. group hopes that by using
Globalstar's constellation of low-Earth-orbit satellites, it will be able to
roll out services more quickly than the Boeing system, which is based on
much higher-orbit satellites. (Wall Street Journal 22 Jun 2000)
