Pertinent excerpt:

Adoption of the Web Accessibility Initiative

This is both a *good thing* and "wonderful news". It is particularly
nice because of its non-UScentric flavor. Since the monetary cost of
using the Web is expected to drop sharply, the interconnections should
proliferate.

The emphases placed on access for PWDs and "digital divide" matters
speaks well of the efforts of this group and all the Working Groups of
WAI. There is hope after all!
