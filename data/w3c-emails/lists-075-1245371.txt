Hi David,

The Netshift Kiosk that's the subject of the Kiosk Conference you found is
described at

http://www.internet-kiosk.com/

It runs on top of navigator or explorer, under windows 95 or NT, and has
keyboard and mouse access (cf. http://www.netshift.com/faq-03.html )

There is no mention of speech output or any other accessibility issues.

However, perhaps  pwKiosk, which is Productivity Works' implementation of
Trace's EZ Access, could be ported to the hardware (it adds a button via
the USB port). (cf http://www.prodworks.com/productsindex.htm#pwkiosk )
