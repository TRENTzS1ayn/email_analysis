While working on a site that has over 700 documents, I encountered this 
problem about the same time that Chris posted this message. Except for this 
one issue the site I am working on can achieve AA status. This is also a 
problem when using the validator.w3.org. The site will not validate at HTML 
4.01 - can not use two or more id's with the same name.

So I ask the question again, has anyone been able to solve this problem?

thanks,
