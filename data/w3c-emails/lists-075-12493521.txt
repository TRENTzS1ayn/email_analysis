Yep, that was my first idea of how to fix it... but the implication is
that radio buttons then cannot be used for forms which need AA?

The problem here is that the label then does not have a corresponding
form element...

I've just had another idea, nest the label tags?

  <label for="role1"><label for="role2">Choice of role</label>i</label>
  <input name="role" id="role1" value="Mentor only" type="radio">
       a Mentor only
  <input name="role" id="role2" value="Mentor or a Lead Mentor"
  type="radio">
       a Mentor or a lead Mentor

Or is this just a daft hack?
