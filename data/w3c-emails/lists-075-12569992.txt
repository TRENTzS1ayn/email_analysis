Hi,

I was just wondering what programs everyone uses to author their web 
sites.  I have used a number over the years including notepad, 
HomeSite, FrontPage, and my current favorite NoteTab Pro.  With the 
exception of my brief stint with FrontPage I have always hand-coded 
my sites, I like the control it gives me over the site, but mostly I 
just prefer the hands-on approach, learning all the new tags & tricks 
as I go along...

Kate

Also, I've created a new e group for anyone interested in accessible

tools, html, accessible web pages and just about anything else.  To
