Hi folks, just a quick note to let you know about the next session
of my online course on accessible web design.  (Feel free to pass
this note along to anyone who might be interested.)

Designing for Universal Accessibility
HWG Online Education Course D201

Starting Date:  24 July 2000  (6 week course)

Course Description:

The days of designing for only one or two web browsers are long gone;
today's Web surfers use anything from non-visual screen readers to the
latest version of Netscape Navigator, and the future will bring even more
Internet-enabled 'Net appliances -- televisions, phones, watches,
toasters, cars, and more. Designing for universal accessibility is
vitally important to ensure that the sites you create today will continue
to work tomorrow and beyond, into the 21st century. Instructor Kynn
Bartlett will show you how to make your pages accessible to everyone.
