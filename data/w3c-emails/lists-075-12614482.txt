I think that this list (the WAI interest group list) isn't really
meant to be a list for the "front line" web designer; this is
really something else and while from time to time it serves as a
resource for accessible web design tips, it's really more for
communication about web accessibility issues in general, and
about the WAI in specific.

There are a number of other mailing lists out there that might
give a neophyte or even a veteran designer some good tips on
accessible web design, and I'm always glad to see more of them
appear. :)

As an obligatory plug, questions about web accessibility are
welcomed on -any- of the HTML Writers Guild's discussion lists,
described at:

      http://www.hwg.org/services/lists/

Trial membership in the Guild is free (for a year or more), so
I encourage you to check them out if you haven't before...
