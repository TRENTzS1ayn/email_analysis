I don't want someone to do the coding for me. I would however appreciate
tips on better ways to do things, tutorials someone might recommend,
referrals to references, and practical pointers. My response to David's post
was intended to point out that this list does not by itself meet the needs
of the average web designer in the trenches so to speak. His post seemed to
me to imply that there was no reason for another list to do with
accessibility issues, a position that I must strongly disagree with. This
list is fine as far as it goes, but it is not the only reference one needs
to implement accessible web design. The WC3 site is not alot of help with
the actual techniques to use either. I looked all over the web for
information on how to alter tables for use by screen readers and have yet to
find anything except the WC3 saying I should do it. Fine, I want to do it,
but I need to know how. Is that unreasonable?
