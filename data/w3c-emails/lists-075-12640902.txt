LF:: "I looked all over the web for information on how to alter tables
for use by screen readers and have yet to find anything except the WC3
saying I should do it. Fine, I want to do it, but I need to know how. Is
that unreasonable?"

WL: Not at all, hence the technique at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WCAG10-HTML-TECHS-20000623/#wrapped-text
which your search apparently missed. Although the techniques documents
is, well, ponderous, it still contains most of what you seek. 

IF IT DOESN'T we would really appreciate any help you can give about
what is not included that needs to be. The techniques are a perpetual
work-in-progress organized for exactly the purpose you bring up. They
are well-indexed and as complete as we've been able to make them -
largely because of the kind of help you will provide. Unfortunately this
set of techniques is, as was pointed out about the guidelines in general
"huuuuuuggggge" but once you've mastered use of the table of contents
and indexing features, it is quite accessible - in both senses of that
now overworked word.

If this doesn't satisfy what you're seeking, please bring it to our
attention either through this list or, in cases where the techniques
come up short on the GL list at w3c-wai-gl@w3.org.

Love.
