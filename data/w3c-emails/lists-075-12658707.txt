William:
Thank you very much for the information! I had tried searching with Alta
Vista, Yahoo, Google and ODP. I looked at Web Resources and other tutorial
sites. You have saved me more frustration! I really appreciate it, thank
you! And thank you Larry as well who also referred me to this resource! I
apologize for the tone of my post, I wasn't trying to be mean toward this
list, and I wasn't angry as it may have appeared. I was simply frustrated at
not being able to find the information I sought and it colored the tone of
my response to David's post. David, I didn't mean any of my post personally
about you, I was speaking of the list in general terms, categorizing the
usual types of posts I've seen. I realize that was unfair. This list was
never intended to provide the sort of information I was seeking. But that
simply points up the fact that there is more than room for another list on
the topic, don't you think? Thank you again, William and Larry, for the
referral! I promise to go back to lurking now! LOL!!

Leah
