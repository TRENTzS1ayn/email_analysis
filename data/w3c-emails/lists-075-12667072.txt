Dear Bobby Users,

CAST is launching Bobby V3.2 very shortly, and is looking for experienced Bobby users who want to participate in the beta testing of Version 3.2. Beta testing is scheduled to begin on June 30th and will run for one week. You can access the beta of the server at http://dev.cast.org/bobby3.2/, and you can also download the beta of the GUI application from that site, using the "Download Bobby" link.  The Bobby V3.2 Beta Test Questionnaire is included at the bottom of this email. You may complete and return it to cramos@cast.org.

Bobby V3.2 contains major changes that support improved analysis and advancement in testing functions.  Specifically:

SERVER
* On the server, the Bobby Report no longer displays in the color of the original page, so it's readable.
* When testing certain pages using Netscape as your browser, you get a "Forbidden" message instead of a report. We have created a workaround for this problem.

GUI
* Accessibility improvements
* Ability to export reports to XML for database analysis
* Problems with URL drop-down list

BOTH
* Support for web pages in multiple-byte character sets (internationalization)
* HTTPS (Secure Socket Layer, or SSL) support - can now access secure web sites
* Improved support for guidelines (list of changes are found in the documentation)
* Redesign of report for readability and comprehension


There are improvements in progress as the beta testing continues:

* HTTPS slow - will be fixed in release
* Extra hats - more hats appear in the server report than in 3.1; will be addressed in release.


If you have any questions, please contact Michael Cooper at mcooper@cast.org. CAST appreciates any and all involvement in this process.  Thank you!
