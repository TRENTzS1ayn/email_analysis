Can someone give me some background on the "U.S. Internet Industry
Association"?  Obviously an impressive name for an organization, but
I don't know who they are, who they represent, or what their web
site is.

Can anyone identify the other people involved?  Obviously we all
know Judy Brewer, but who are the rest?
