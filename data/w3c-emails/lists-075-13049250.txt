Answering my own question, I've done a little web searching...

>PANEL I
>Dennis Hayes, Chairman, U.S. Internet Industry Association

Mr. Hayes is the creator of the "Hayes modems" which some long-time
computer users may be familiar with.

The USIIA web site is http://www.usiia.org/ -- in late November of
last year they changed their name from the "Association of 
Online Professionals."  According to their web site, "If you're not
part of the USIIA, You're not part of the Internet."

Now -that's- inclusion at work.

>Gary Wunder, Programer Analyst-Expert, ITS - Hosp Business Apps, The University of Missouri

Gary is a blind programmer -- searching for his name produces
a number of hits on news stories about disabled computer
professionals, such as:

http://www.idg.net/crd_blind_32436.html

He also seems to be involved with the NFB.

>Dr. Steven Lucas, CIO and Sr. Vice President, Privaseek, Inc.

Dr. Lucas is obviously a privacy expert, and the Privaseek web site
is, unsurprisingly, http://www.privaseek.com/ -- I'm not sure what
the privacy angle on this is about.

Dr. Lucas is also on the USIIA board, so presumably he is part of
the Internet.

>Judy Brewer, Director, Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) International Program Office
>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)

We know Judy. :)  The W3C does not appear to be part of the USIIA,
so therefore Judy is not part of the Internet.

>Susyn Conway, Reston, Virginia

I couldn't find this name very frequently on the web, but from a
letter to The Standard, Ms. Conway seems to be someone who started
AOL's research department:

      http://www.thestandard.net/article/display/0,1151,2734,00.html

I wonder what AOL's research shows about users with disabilities?

(BTW, America OnLine is not part of the Internet either.)

>PANEL II
>Elizabeth K. Dorminey, Wimberly, Lawson, Steckel, Nelson & Schneider, P.C.
>Peter D. Blanck, Professor of Law, The University of Iowa College of Law
>Walter Olson, Wilton, CT
>Charles J. Cooper, Cooper, Carvin & Rosenthal

I dunno from lawyers.  Panel I seems to be "industry experts" (although
only 2 of them are actually part of the Internet!) and Panel II
looks like lawyers.
