More to the point, are there still jobs out there for people who don't kow
anything about accessible web design? (I guess there are, but it seems like a
bad idea to me - kind of like an architect who doesn't know how to put doors
into a building, and doesn't really think they're that important...)

There are a couple of places where people try to track accessibility-aware
web designers, but I don't have a URI off the top of my head.

  etc).
  
  Beyond those, is there much market for an accessibility-trained
  webmaster?  (I've had some questions from some of my students.)
