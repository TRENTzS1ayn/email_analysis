aloha, madeleine!

it's crashed my WIn95B box thrice, i've connected to a steady stream of 
static four times, and MediaPlayer has reported that it can't find the 
server six or seven times...

as i pointed out in a post a couple of days ago, there isn't any contact 
info listed on any of the pages concerning the audio feed, so i sent my 
problem report to webmaster@house.gov and sysadmin@house.gov

no bounce-backs -- or replies -- yet...

gregory.
