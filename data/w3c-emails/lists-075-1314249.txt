Scott,

By selection box I'm guessing what screen readers term a list box where
several of the selections are visible and one can cursor through them or a
combo box where one choice is presented and the up and down arrow open the
list to show more.  Either of these options is much more desirable than
radio buttons in my opinion.  Screen readers accurately read the pointed to
item in both cases and avoid the hit and miss of radio buttons.
