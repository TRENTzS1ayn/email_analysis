I hope the private sector is doing better. But I am not sure if they are. I
realise that there are not too many webmasters out there who understand
accessibility, but there is some call for them. I know in Australia that it
is now a feature in some fairly big contracts, although by no means all of
them.

  I've participated in a couple of recent candidate interviews for positions
  that involve web design.  None of the candidates has shown an awareness of
  accessibility as an issue to be addressed, let alone how to go about it.
  This is in higher education, with candidates mostly just out of school;
  should I hope the private sector is doing things better?
