All,

I think that the intelligent reasoned responses to Paul Taylor's memo speak
for themselve.  I don t dare express my thoughts on this subject in this
forum! :-)

Sincerely,

Mike Burks

Subject: Statements are now up


The witness statements are now available at:

      http://www.house.gov/judiciary/2.htm

I can't really express, in a public forum, as a representative
of the HTML Writers Guild, what I think of Mr. Walter Olson's
post which is full of "Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt" mixed
in with broad generalities and blatant falsehoods in the service
of scare tactics.
