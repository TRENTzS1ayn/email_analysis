Hi Kynn,

I am sure my knowledge of the Accessibility Guidelines was a determining
factor when I was hired as a webmaster in May '99. From what I understand,
it is  what gave  me the edge over the competition.

Subject: Jobs in Web Accessibility


Not that I'm looking for a job myself, but which companies are out
there who specifically look for experts in accessible web design or
related technologies?  I know some of the big computer companies do
-- IBM, Sun, Microsoft -- and some research groups (universities,
etc).

Beyond those, is there much market for an accessibility-trained
webmaster?  (I've had some questions from some of my students.)
