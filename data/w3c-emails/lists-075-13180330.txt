Hi,

I've been in contact with the technical person for the Judiciary Committee.
She says the stream is ready, but they are not getting the audio from
the hearing room.  She suspects that problem is in the audio box for
the room and has paged the people responsible for the audio.
No estimated time of problem resolution.

She commented that this was the first time this problem has happened.
Also, she mentioned that very few other committees have provide this
type of service.

The witness statements are now available at:

    http://www.house.gov/judiciary/2.htm


I also believe it might be appropriate to send messages to Congressman Hyde
who is the chair of the Judiciary Committee.  Some points to include are:

    1.  the poor impression that this problem has given of
the Judiciary Committee and of this hearing.  the hearing
is about the importance of the internet and yet one of the most
important committees in the House is unable to manage its
own internet needs.

    2.  request that the audio recording of the hearing be made available
on the internet as means of compensating for this lapse of service.

    3.  request that the process of developing the transcript be expedited
and the transcript be made available on the web

    4.  recommend that in the future the audio link to the internet
be checked at least a half an hour before the hearing


Chairman Henry Hyde's contact info is:

    House Office Bldg.
    Washington, DC 20515
    (202) 225-4561


He doesn't seem to have an e-mail address.  He probably can be contacted by
writing to him at the email address for the Judiciary Committee at:

   judiciary@mail.house.gov
