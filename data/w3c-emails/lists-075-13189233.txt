aloha, scott!

i wouldn't be surprised if congressman hyde's eddress, as well as any 
direct method of contacting him, were removeved from his web site during 
the impeachment hearings, due to an overload of spam...

to reach congressman hyde via email, try:

<Rep.Henry.Hyde@house.gov>

a formulation that is consistent with other representatives' official 
eddresses...

there is also a general "Write Your Representative" form located at:
http://www.house.gov/writerep/
