On balance, I believe that those testifying on behalf of accessibility did a
very good job. 
I am still absorbing the witness statements available online.  What does
everyone think of the testimony entitled "The Unsuitability of the ADA for
an Organic Medium" by Susyn Conway.  I understand she used to work as a
Director for AOL.

Removing my professional cap for a moment...after reading Olson's
statement, why do I have this undeniable urge to blindfold and stick
this "expert" in a wheelchair, and say "go for it, buddy!"

Replacing my cap...as serious professionals and business people, how do
we best respond to these types of comments?
