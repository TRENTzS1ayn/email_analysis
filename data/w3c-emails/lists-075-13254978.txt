The best way to "respond" is to ignore them. The worst thing you can do is
give them credibility by responding. They will not listen and just further
twist your words.

Removing my professional cap for a moment...after reading Olson's
statement, why do I have this undeniable urge to blindfold and stick
this "expert" in a wheelchair, and say "go for it, buddy!"

Replacing my cap...as serious professionals and business people, how do
we best respond to these types of comments?
