I am pleased to announce that the Chancellor's Office of the State of
California Community Colleges has adopted and posted accessible
long-distance learning guidelines at the above url. The California Community
Colleges is the largest higher education system in the US serving a
population of over 4.1 million students. 

These guidelines are in response to the US Department of Education Office
for Civil Rights enforcement efforts for compliance with the Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Rehabilitation Act.  Further background
legal information about the long-distance guidelines can be found in my
paper "The Growing Digital Divide in Access for People with Disabilities:
Overcoming Barriers to Participation" found at
