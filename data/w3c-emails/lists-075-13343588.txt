Audio files to accompany text?  Lies, lies, lies.

Yes.

Lies, lies, lies.  Color is -not- restricted for displaying
information; color is only restricted as the -only- means of
conveying information.

That is to say, "text format."

Huh?  Ban touch screens?

Yeah, don't be silly, web sites aren't for the public!  It's
not like e-commerce sites are CONTINUALLY spoken about as "in
competition with brick-and-mortar" stores!  Clearly, brick-and-
mortar stores are for those handicapped people, while the web
is only for us "fully functional" folks.

Excuse me.  I need to spit rudely.  And that's not polite to
do here, so I'll sign off--
