aloha, charles!

you observed:

This article repeats a common myth that the use o colour will be restricted 
by accesibility requirements. This is "more or less bunk", based as far as 
I can tell on a failure to understand a very simple sentence in a W3C 
recommendation: "Do not use colour alone to convey information". Note the 
use of the word "Alone" in that sentence.

it is the product of accepting on faith that something is proscribed simply 
because someone told you that it is...  in journalistic circles there once 
existed a quaint custom called checking one's facts, which has, apparently, 
died out...  sloppy reporting isn't anything new, but the failure of the 
technological press to understand the true issues is pretty damn 
depressing...  one would think that, especially in a technological setting, 
checking one's facts would be as fundamental as validating pages before 
exposing them to the world, but, then...

oh, well,
