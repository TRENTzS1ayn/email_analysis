Program Manager - Oracle Accessibility Initiative
Redwood Shores, California

RESPONSIBILITIES

Oracle is currently looking for a Program Manager to oversee and 
coordinate the modification of Oracle products and services to provide 
accessibility for disabled users.    This work is predicated on 
successful completion of the first phase of the project by August 2000 
at which time accessibility will become an official procurement 
condition for both State and Federal government technology purchases. 
This effects many aspects of Oracle business.   The program manager will 
drive the overall plan to completion by coordinating activities in the 
following areas:

 - Product development
 - Partners
 - Testing
 - Standards
 - Sales
 - Support
 - Branding

Representatives from each of these areas will be responsible for the 
technical implementation in their respective divisions.   The program 
manager will be responsible for overall corporate standards in the area 
of accessibility as well as working with upper management to set policy 
direction,  priorities and report monthly progress towards meeting this 
goal.

Additional responsibilities will include representing Oracle at meetings 
dealing with accessibility issues of industry standards committees, 
industry lobbying organizations, the federal access board and government 
procurement departments.    In this capacity the Program Manager will be 
responsible for both presenting Oracles accessibility approach to the 
public and helping to define and shape public policy in this area.  In 
addition they will all help define additional accessibility requirements 
that need to be met in future releases particularly in Europe and Japan 
as they begin to address the accessibility issue.

QUALIFICATIONS

Qualifications for this position include 5+ years experience in the
coordination of cross-divisional activities in a large company.  One
example of this kind of work would be managing a companies Y2K
compliance program.    Excellent communication and teamwork skills are
required.   Knowledge of the Oracle product lines and Oracles internal
business organization is highly desirable.

Familiarity with the Electronic and Information Technology (E&IT) 
requirements for the disabled is not required but would be of great 
value.    Typical educational background would be graduate level in 
engineering or business with an emphasis in technology issues.

POSITION is located in Redwood Shores (at Oracle head quarters) 
reporting to Edward Screven Oracles chief software architect.    This 
position will require significant travel between Oracle development 
sites as well as Washington DC.   Some overseas travel may also be 
required.
