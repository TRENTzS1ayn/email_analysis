To anyone inconvenienced by my well-intentioned but ultimately incorrect posting of my letter to Walter Olson, please accept my apologies.

It was not my intent to cause inconvenience to list members. I honestly thought that the discussion would be relevant to the list and didn't realize how long my comments had become. Worse, I forgot the prohibition about cross-posting.

It won't happen again.

Sincerely,
Charles F. Munat,
