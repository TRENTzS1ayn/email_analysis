Scott, I don't understand why you say:
"... the use of text-only versions means that the NY Times is out of
compliance with the guidelines."

I can't find any checkpoint in the content guidelines that prohibits
text-only sites. 

The pertinent checkpoint seems to be 11.4:
"If, after best efforts, you cannot create an accessible page, provide a
link to an alternative page that uses W3C technologies, is accessible, has
equivalent information (or functionality), and is updated as often as the
inaccessible (original) page."

Would you please elaborate?

Thanks,

Hi, Gregory

Your response is kind of unexpected.  First, the use of text-only versions
means that the NY Times is out of compliance with the guidelines.

Another interesting aspect is that your comment supports what I've been
saying about the usefulness of multiple versions of dynamically
generated web pages.  It also points out that the guidelines may need
to have different requirements depending on whether the web pages are
created dynamically or not.
