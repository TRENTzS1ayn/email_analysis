...   
A few interacting questions need to be asked:
a) what degree of "accessible" do you mean?  Specifically, what do you want someone's screen reader to say?  The question itself?  Only the options when using the down arrow?  Both the question and the option when using the down arrow?
...
For example if 
a) I want to hear both the option and question each time I hit the down arrow and
b) I am using JFW 3.2 and 
c) I am using Lynx 2.8.1

I find, in order to meet a) above, I need to repeat the question and the option associated with the label as the example below shows.
...
<INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="Bread" VALUE="Wheat" SELECTED > 
2. Please choose the 
type of bread you would like. Wheat.<BR>
...
<<<

Where would the prompt text "Please choose the type of bread you would like." come from?
