I think one of the best things to come from all this was the near-
universal agreement on both sides of the issue that accessible web
design -does- matter and -should- be a priority in order to ensure
the growth of e-commerce.  Informed minds may differ on the specifics
of how best to implement that (I feel that the ADA, sadly, -will- be
necessary in some cases), but I am glad there is common ground we
can all stand on to get the message before the lawmakers and other
powers-that-be.
