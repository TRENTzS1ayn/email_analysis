Hi, Gregory

I believe that you may have mis-interpreted my statements.  I was referring
to dynamically generated web pages which could be created in a text-only
format or in a graphic format.  I wasn't referring to static web sites.

One thing I hear you saying is:

    (b) is an example of a well-thought-out alternative to the full-blown
graphical version of the site

which gives the impression that you approve of well thought out
alternatives to graphical versions of web pages on web sites which
are frequently updated.  Am I correct in my understanding?


If the web site were updated ever 15 seconds, it would seem that you
would approve of that.  So, it would seem reasonable to assume that you
would approve of text-only pages which were generated on demand.


I think you are getting to understand a point I've been making.
Dynamically generated web pages can share the same content from
the same source, but present it in different formats.


I question an assumption you are making that all accessibility needs are
usability needs.  This is very faulty.  For example, when I get
on an airplane, I need to use a special narrow aisle chair.  I have never
seen it used by a non-disabled person.  I believe a more accurate perception
is that there are some accessibility needs which also help with usability.
There are other accessibility needs which are very specialized and
do not contribute to usability.  I believe that some disabled people
don't want to see their needs as special because they don't want
to be seen as having special needs.  They sometimes stretch their
accessibility needs into usability needs in order to feel better
about not having special needs.


What is universal design?  It is based on needs.  However, there really has not
been a study about what needs do blind people have when using web
pages.  The only investigations are more along the line of what do
blind people need when they share web pages with sighted people.
The result is that various needs of blind people when using web pages
have been ignored or over-looked.  If needs of a user group are ignored or
over-looked, can a design truly be called universal?
