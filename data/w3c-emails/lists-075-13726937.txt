"Yes, it's bad reporting.  I had a talk with the reporter yesterday
and hopefully managed to clear up some of his misconceptions."


That's great, but are they going to print another article clearing it up? A lot of web designers are going to see that article and be alarmed by it. I'm glad that the reporter now has his head on straight, but that's of little consequence compared to clearing up the misconceptions of the readers. I would hope that they would do a full length article on exactly what the standards do require. Did he give any hint of this? Do you think that they would accept an article written by an outside source (like someone on this list)?
