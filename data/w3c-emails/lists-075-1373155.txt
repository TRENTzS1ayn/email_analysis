Description:
   The purpose of this list is to provide a forum to discuss Selena
   Sol's, WebWare Suite of web applications, which are found at;
   http://www.extropia.com/ It provides a place for people to look for
   help, or share their knowledge/snippets of code with others, all in
   keeping with Selena's basic philosophy that if we use and benefit
from
   the applications, we then should in turn try to help someone else
do
   the same :)
