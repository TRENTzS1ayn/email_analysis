The reporter is aware of the problems, and is following up. We've talked
with him yesterday and again just now today.

A lot of web designers are going to see that article and be alarmed by it.
I'm glad that the reporter now has his head on straight, but that's of
little consequence compared to clearing up the misconceptions of the
readers. I would hope that they would do a full length article on exactly
what the standards do require. Did he give any hint of this? Do you think
that they would accept an article written by an outside source (like
someone on this list)?
