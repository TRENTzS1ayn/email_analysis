Charles, you draw an interesting and accurate picture here.  I'd like
to add some detail to that picture however.  When we talk about a
ramp, we are not talking just about any ramp.  there are specific
measures in the building codes that the ramp and other access nodes
must meet.  It is my contention that a well defined set of regulatory
standards can just as wel be applied to the ada.  We may not be there
yet, but we have come a long way towards determining what the access
needs of those who have functional limitations are.  To put it another
way, we have a fairly good idea of how to mittigate functional
limitations.  It can be said as one of the witnesses claims that most
of us can't use the web or to put it another way that the web is not
useable meaning in this case that even though we can get on it, we may
either make lots of errors or get totally lost in trying to use it. 
Accessability is an achievement.  I don't think we can actually define
access or accessability in this context except to describe what it
circumscribes.
