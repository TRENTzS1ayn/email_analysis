sorry message should have read:

Accessibility has yet to be defined successfuly by WAI.

It has 2 main barbs technology and people.

When WAI and its members agree to make an effort to define these aspects
please include me.
By this I mean that we need to start constructing the details into a site,
as well as loosely discussing.
