I have sent you Joe Clark's full message to which Richard Chimera
replied, see appended below.

Addressing Joe Clark's first point, Richard Chimera responded that
DHTML supports such things as drop-down navigation boxes and:

"Internet Explorer 5.0 supports Microsoft's DHTML (Dynamic HTML,
 which has been submitted to W3C and will almost certainly be accepted as
 major advances in the next version of HTML)."

What does WAI have to say about this DHTML proposal?

Cheers,

John
