Hello Martin,

I'm copying this reply to WAI people, because your point about
labelling frames is important.   From an accessibility point of
view, if you are going to have frames, at least label them clearly
and sensibly.  This should go in the WAI content guidelines.

BTW, couldn't the assistive technology (user agent) treat frames
as separate pages?   I would assert that frames are essentially pages
that can be simultaneously displayed on the screen.  If they
were treated like pages, there'd be no problem with the back button!

Cheers,

John
