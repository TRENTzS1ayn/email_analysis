Actually, HTML already supports drop-down boxes, although activation of them
is primarily through form submission for server side processing (although it
is possible to provide an optional client-side process as well, for the sake
of speed). Reading the public drafts coming from the HTML working group does
not lead me to the conclusion that "MS DHTML will almost certainly be
accepted as major advances in the next version".

  Addressing Joe Clark's first point, Richard Chimera responded that
  DHTML supports such things as drop-down navigation boxes and:
  
  "Internet Explorer 5.0 supports Microsoft's DHTML (Dynamic HTML,
   which has been submitted to W3C and will almost certainly be accepted as
   major advances in the next version of HTML)."
  
  What does WAI have to say about this DHTML proposal?
  
  Cheers,
