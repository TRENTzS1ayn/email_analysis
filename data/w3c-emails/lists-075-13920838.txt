The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines require that Frames have meaningful
names/titles, and should also have alternative navigation mechanisms provided
by use of the NOFRAMES element - in many cases access to individual frames
causes a significant loss of context and proper use of NOFRAMES is much
better. (In addition, it provides the ability to make a "deep link" -
bookmark a relevant part of a framed site.)

  Hello Martin,
  
  I'm copying this reply to WAI people, because your point about
  labelling frames is important.   From an accessibility point of
  view, if you are going to have frames, at least label them clearly
  and sensibly.  This should go in the WAI content guidelines.
  
  BTW, couldn't the assistive technology (user agent) treat frames
  as separate pages?   I would assert that frames are essentially pages
  that can be simultaneously displayed on the screen.  If they
  were treated like pages, there'd be no problem with the back button!
  
  Cheers,
  
  John
