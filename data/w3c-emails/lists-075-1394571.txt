The Australian Human Rights & Equal Opportunity Commission has announced a
directive from the Attorney General to address Internet accessibility.  See
http://www.hreoc.gov.au/disability_rights/current_inquiries/ecom/ecom.html

As part of the effort, the Human Rights & Equal Opporunity Commission has
released an Issues Paper that cites to my American Bar Association paper
"Applying the ADA to the Internet:  A Web Accessibility Standard" under
their discussion of "World Wide Web Page Accessibility Audit."  See 
http://www.hreoc.gov.au/disability_rights/current_inquiries/ecom/ecommerce_i
ssues_paper.htm  The  url for the American Bar paper is found at
http://www.rit.edu/~easi/law/weblaw1.htm 

The mission of the Commission is "to investigate the implications for older
Australians and Australians with a disability of new technologies in
electronic commerce and the provision of government and other services, and
outline their specific needs in accessing services which utilise these
technologies.  The Commission is to provide an interim report by 1 December
1999 and a final report by 31 March 2000."
