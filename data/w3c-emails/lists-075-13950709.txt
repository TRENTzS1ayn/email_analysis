As a semi-tangent, is there a way to force IE or Netscape to display a
NOFRAMES
section of a site? If you turn off script support you get the noscript
(Presumably, I haven't actually tried it lately), but is there any way to
"turn
off" frames?

I'm asking out of theoretical curiosity. If someone designed a functional
NOFRAMES section conveying all the information of the frames page, would an
IE/Nets user be stuck with the framey version?
