SO far as I know the answer is that neither Netscape nor IE current versions
allow support for frames to be turned off.

  "turn
  off" frames?
  
  I'm asking out of theoretical curiosity. If someone designed a functional
  NOFRAMES section conveying all the information of the frames page, would an
  IE/Nets user be stuck with the framey version?
