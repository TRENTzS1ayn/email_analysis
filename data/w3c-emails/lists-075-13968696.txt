aloha, patrick!

you asked:

quote
As a semi-tangent, is there a way to force IE or Netscape to display a
NOFRAMES section of a site?
unquote

no, as far as i am aware, the only GUI browser that will allow you turn off 
support for frames, so as to expose the content of the NOFRAMES is Opera-- 
i'd recommend you download a copy from:
http://www.operasoft.com/download.html

and try it....

you also asked:

quote
I'm asking out of theoretical curiosity. If someone designed a functional 
NOFRAMES section conveying all the information of the frames page, would an 
IE/Nets user be stuck with the framey version?
unquote

unfortunately, the way things stand today, the IE or NS user would have no 
choice but to use the FRAMESET
