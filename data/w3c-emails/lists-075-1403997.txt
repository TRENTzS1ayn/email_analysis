I agree.  I've also found that navigating a list or combo box is reliably done 
with the up and down arrow keys, whereas radio buttons sometimes use left and right arrow and 
other times up and down arrow.  If I guess wrong, then I may move to another control and have 
to navigate back to the set of radio buttons.  Also, some screen readers mistakenly identify 
checkboxes as radio buttons, apparently because the graphic indicators are not standard.

Regards,
Jamal
