Has anyone made a purchase from the US Mint's catalog using Lynx with SSL?
The URL is http://www.usmint.gov/catalog <http://www.usmint.gov/catalog>
Would like to know how it works?

This is one of the things that we have to do. We are building a test room
and need to get the testers up to speed on the JAWS, pwWebSpeak, and Lynx
with SSL.
