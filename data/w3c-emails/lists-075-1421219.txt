Subject: Advice needed for designer of government web site

 A person who is designing web sites for the U.S. House of
Representatives
contacted me today seeking advice and input in helping to design House
web
sites so that they are accessible and usable for the blind. She seems
very
interested and genuine but had no real concept of how blind people
interact
with the Internet. I am asking for resources and informed people that
I can
refer her to so that we keep access to an important government site.
Please
send me any ideas or information by private e-mail if possible to
dchapp@aol.com.

Thanks

Damon
