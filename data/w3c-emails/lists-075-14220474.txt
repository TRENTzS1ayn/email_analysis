Could someone please explain to me how a web page with frames "sounds"
to someone using voice assistive technologies? A web developer asked me
this question.

Additionally, I'd appreciate a response that fully explains why frames
are not a good accessibility solution. Links to online documentation
would also suffice. I dislike frames for reasons separate from
accessibility, but want more ammo to rid them from existence! :)
