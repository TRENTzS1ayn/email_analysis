Hi,

My observation from looking at a lot of   sties that discuss Web design is that almost none of them use frames. I while ago I compiled this list of reasons to avoid frames and the list below that of Web pages that discuss frames. I've just updated the list. Some of the articles are older, but I think that the same concerns still exist, especially concerning search engines,   people using older browsers, the reduction of the usable screen apace, as well as other problems mentioned here and discussed in the  Web pages.


Problems with frames:
1. Some search engines can't index them without extra programming work.
As of February 2, 2000, on the Search Engine Features For Webmasters page at http://searchenginewatch.com/webmasters/features.html, which is part of the Search Engine Watch Web site (http://searchenginewatch.com/), of AltaVista, Google, Northern Light, Excite, FAST,                                       Inktomi, Go, and Lycos, ONLY AltaVista, Google, and Northern Light support frames.

2. Frames increase load time. Users want speed.

3. Older and text-based browsers can't handle them.

4. Frames "disable" the URL. The browser doesn't show a unique URL for each frame of text (what would be called a page in a non-frames version). This often makes it difficult for visitors to return to specific a page, for their own use or to show someone else.

5. This will prevent search engines from listing more than the home page.

6. When printing, unless the visitor has IE 4.0 or N 4 or higher, s/he can print only one frame at a time. If someone wants to print the text on a page, they wouldn't have the company name and logo or navigation bar, unless they printed each frame separately.

7. Many users don't like frames.

8. Much less of the text shows at one time, making it harder and more frustrating for someone to see what you?re offering. You can emphasize more what you offer the customer by showing more text.


The following pages discuss frames:

"8. . . . TIP: Avoid using frames. Some of the major search engines are unable to follow frame links, so they won't be able to index your entire site. (Currently only Excite, Lycos and infoSeek support frames.)"
