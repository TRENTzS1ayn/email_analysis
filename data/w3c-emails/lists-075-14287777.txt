Being sited  (I wear glasses and have a set made just for using with PC), I
do not like frames because they give me a headache.  Not so much the simple
left-hand side frame, but when you get into the 3 or more frames, content
seems to have lost its impact and it really is an eye strain trying to read
a teeny, tiny square of information.  Plus, sometimes you have to scroll
down just to finish one sentence!

This is only my opinion. . .
