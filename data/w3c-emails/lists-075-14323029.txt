If not frames what are the options?

An alternative that is being tried offline is to include the navigation in
its own table.

Unfortunately this means that, for the moment it has to be included in every
page, increasing download marginally.
(Else javascript, to include it but not every browser can use that)
'Object' is supposed to allow the use of external html,
but is difficult to get the results desired
