HomeSite and ColdFusion Studio are products of Allaire Corp. They are code-based development environments for creating web sites; Studio is an extension of HomeSite with extra support for Allaire's server-side language and application server ColdFusion.

During my "free" time one of the things I do is work as a consultant for Allaire. The tag definitions for HTML and VTML that are included with the product since version 4.01 are mine; I also wrote much of the documentation for VTML (reworked and extended for the current version 4.5)

Writing tag definitions in VTML (Allaire's Visual Tool Markup Language) means that I am specifying the content for such tools als Tag Chooser, Tag Editors, Tag Inspector, Tag Insight and Tag Tips.  I have no control over what controls are used by the development environment to implement the controls I specify; for instance I can specify that tab pages are used and label each of the pages; I do not determine which control is used to implement the tabs.

Still, there may be things I could do to make using these editing tools that are driven by VTML easier for those who use HomeSite in combination with screen reader software. But for this I'll need some input from people who can tell me what they (don't) see or what their screen reader tells them or doesn't tell them.

Please react by private email instead of on the list.

Thanks,
