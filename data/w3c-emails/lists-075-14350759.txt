Opera 6.3 allows not showing frames, and stop pages opening in new windows.

Quote from Opera Help:

Enable Frames
Unchecking this disables frame support. Frames will not display for new documents. Opera will not - as you may have seen it in other browsers - show the URLs for the frame elements, but rather use the <noframes> tags as part of the frame definition document.

Always Show Active Frame Border
Checking this option is useful for those who navigate with the keyboard. It shows the the currently active frame border, simplifying frame and document navigation.

Allow Window Create From Documents
If you uncheck this, the <A HREF="abc.htm" target="..."> attribute will be ignored. This means 'target' links will always be displayed in the current window.

End of quote.
