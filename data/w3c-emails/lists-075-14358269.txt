Hello Charles etal :
I visited the site you gave as an example and I too found it fairly accessible.
However, the MainStage frame seemed to be empty.  Is that right?
I note that in the WCAG there is the phrase "Side-by-side frames".
Is this meant to distinguish two categories of frames, the other being, I would guess, "vertically aligned frames " (i.e. the negation of side-by-side)?
This leads to my general question.
In conclusion, you said, 

But overall I agree with Jim - used properly (and sadly they almost never
are) frames can provide good accessibility.
This is very good.  Now, our task is to refine the meaning "used properly".
If quantity of content in a frame is a major variable, we need to quantify the quantity.
