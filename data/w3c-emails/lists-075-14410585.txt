Concerning the topic of frames, I should have been more clear. What I really
need to know about are users "experiences" when encountering frames in a
website.

The exact question I was asked by our web developer was "Does it read the first
frame in the frameset, then the rest in succession or what?", the it being
Jaws.

I've used Home Page Reader to go through sites, but wasn't sure if other
assistive technologies read frames pages in the same fashion. Is that indeed
the case? It is my understanding that most visually impaired individuals use
system applications, like Jaws. All you assistive technology users (not just
the visually impaired), please share your experiences! I want to give a
designer an informed idea of what comes out on your end. Thanks in advance.
