Hi Steve,

yes, the mainstage frame comes up with a "splash" page - a picture of some
words, with a simplified version of alt. ot a sparkling example of how to do
it (and I hate splash pages anyway) but not really to do with the frames per
se.

To suggest some ideas of what is required: 

Human-readable titles for each frame as the "name" (and better ones as
"title"):
This is just a hack based on the fact that most browsers that do not render
frames directly provide a hack that links to each frame by its "name" or
"title".

Content in the noframes section, linking to the important pages: 
How detailed this needs to be depends on the possibilty of navigating around
the rest of the site - whether there are links in the pages or whether they
are only available from a navigation frame (or two).

thoughtful use of the frames themselves - too many can cause problems, as has
been pointed out. And the relative size of them should be considered.

  Hello Charles etal :
  I visited the site you gave as an example and I too found it fairly accessible.
  However, the MainStage frame seemed to be empty.  Is that right?
  I note that in the WCAG there is the phrase "Side-by-side frames".
  Is this meant to distinguish two categories of frames, the other being, I would guess, "vertically aligned frames " (i.e. the negation of side-by-side)?
  This leads to my general question.
  In conclusion, you said, 
  
  But overall I agree with Jim - used properly (and sadly they almost never
  are) frames can provide good accessibility.
  This is very good.  Now, our task is to refine the meaning "used properly".
  If quantity of content in a frame is a major variable, we need to quantify the quantity.
