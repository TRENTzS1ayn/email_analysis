aloha, again, melinda!

i should have stressed in my earlier response to your request for an 
example of what a FRAMESET sounds like when accessed using a screen reader, 
that the options that i describe are not only specific to a specific 
version of a specific screen reader (JFW 3.5), but are also specific to a 
certain browser,.MSIE 4.x or 5.x

i should have also noted that the latest releases of Window-Eyes, which is 
manufactured by GW-Micro (http://www.gwmicro.com), also handles FRAMESETS 
rather well, at least according to the hardcore W-E users in the visually 
impaired computer users' group for which i serve as webmaster and minister 
of propaganda...  i don't use W-E regularly enough to comment upon how it 
handles FRAMESETS, but perhaps someone else on this list can provide you 
with more detailed information concerning how W-E exposes frames to the user...

i should also have included a pointer to a more detailed description of 
JFW's HTML Options and default actions -- from which the main part of my 
previous emessage was excerpted -- which can be found in the User Agent 
Working Group's mail archives, at:
