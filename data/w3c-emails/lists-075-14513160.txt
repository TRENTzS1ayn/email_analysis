A recent webreview.com survey (11 February 2000 
http://webreview.com/pub/2000/02/11/poll//results.html) asked the following 
question:  "The W3C has established accessibility standards (WAI) to help 
people with disabilities access information on the Web. Are you paying 
attention to those standards on your site?"

The results:
44% of respondents replied "Yes, we are trying to follow those standards 
the best we can."
55% replied "No, we haven't looked into the accessibility standards."

wow.  better than i thought.
