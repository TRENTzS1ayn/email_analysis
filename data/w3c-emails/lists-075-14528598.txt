Hi, Gregory

I'm afraid you seem very stuck on structured content.  While that is useful,
in many ways, it ignores the interactive aspects.  There is a big difference
between a magazine page and a web page.  Both have structure, but it is the
interaction that is a significant difference.  Blind users interact
with web pages very differently than sighted people.  If you think the
interactive needs of blind users and sighted users are the same, I have
various experiments which can show differences.

Second, while all blind people are not the same, many of them often
share similar needs.  Again, I have experiments which have indicated
there are frequently shared needs.  If you would like, I can show them
to you.  Which experiments have you done to show that there are no
over-lapping needs among many blind users?  I would direct you to the
documentation on user-centered design.  A fundamental assumption is that
group of users can have some traits in common which is a key principle
of this design process.  Why would the user-centered design work
for a wide variety of groups of people and not groups of blind users?
What is so special about blind people that none of the user-center
design would apply to them?

Actually, many of my comments come from watching and conversing with
blind users rather than just intellectualizing.

In a way, you are making assumptions which may have no basis.
You are intellectualizing without doing observations, experiments or
tests.

What is it that a blind user wants?  I would agree he wants access to the
information provided on a page.  I would argue that getting the information
with efficiency and accuracy is also important.  I don't see many
blind people going around demanding structured content.  Structured content
may be a way to achieve these other more important goals, but in truth
it is not as important.  I have not had the experience of having a blind
person complain to me over coffee about a web page being without structured
content.  They were ticked off because they were having problems understanding
the page or using the page easily.


With regards to the demo web pages, most of the feedback I've gotten from
blind users is that it made using the web page easier for many of them.
I believe the core design principles would benefit many blind users,
though not all.  It is an example of many members of a user groups sharing
some common needs.

Actually, the revenue issue is probably not that important to the
provider in this case.  If they really were concerned, they would have
much better descriptions in the ALT tags to attract the blind users'
attention.  I believe you might be confusing what is more important and
what is less important.  For example, for web sites where revenuse from
advertising is not important, the issue you brought up about revenue
does not impact the application of the design principles for these web pages.
For web pages where advertising revenue is important, the advertising
links could be moved more to the beginning of the page or some other
approach.

The problem with restructuring is that it puts much too great of a burden
on the user.  I believe we have already gone around about this.  Most blind
users probably do not want to learn how to restructure web pages.
As I have said before, for many blind users restructuring is a very
bad alternative.  Given a choice between learning to restructure
web pages or winning money at poker, which do you think most blind users
would prefer to do?  Personally, I've never restructured a web page.
If most sighted people don't have to do that, why should blind
people be forced into it.

In a way, you remind me of some of the graduate students I work with.
They come up with various ideas and they don't understand why the
people in the real world with families, jobs, etc, would not want
to put in the time and effort to learning the complexities of something.


Actually, I've had three different companies approach me about how easy
would it be to implement my approach to dynamically generated web pages.
I've also written the software in both Java and Perl which does it.
The basic code was done in a day.  It ain't that hard.
