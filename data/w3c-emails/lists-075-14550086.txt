Hello!

I'm putting together information to present to my peers, and wonder if
anyone is aware of current/recent initiatives being undertaken by
organisations/companies in the UK, particularly with reference to the
Disability Discrimination Act (DDA)?
This is acting as a starting point for further research.

Very many thanks


Emma Easton
