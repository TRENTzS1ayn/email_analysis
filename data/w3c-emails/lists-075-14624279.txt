Based on Steven and Gregory's experiences at the Duke Ellington site,  http://duke.fuse.net/essence/index_ie.html  it is
glaringly evident that the Javascript rollovers in the navigation are confusing to a JFW user. What it reads does not reflect
what the graphical text says..

Here's a question for the developers/Javascripters on the list. If you look at the source of the Ellington navigation frame,
what could have been done to prevent this? I'm always looking for real solutions to give  developers. Many want to get there,
they just don't know the way!

By the way, a public "thank you" to everyone for their responses thus far. Very valuable info.
