In a recent discussion on another list I'm on, someone offered the
excuse that any inaccessible sites he'd designed were the fault of
his cheap and short-sighted clients who refused to pay the extra
cost necessary to make the site accessible.

I countered by explaining Idyll Mountain Internet's philosophy --
web accessibility is a natural and integral part of doing a site,
and not an optional add-on; in fact, we'd probably charge more if
someone DEMANDED that we make the site INaccessible.  ("No alt text
on your images?  Well, you're the customer.  We'll charge $50 per
image to remove alt text.")

I think that if you say "and of course we'll make sure your page is
accessible to as broad an audience as possible" a design client will
buy that; if you say "well, for an extra cost, I can go to all the
trouble of making sure that small percentage of people who are
blind are able to access your site -- if you REALLY want me to,"
then it's no surprise that the cheaper, budget-conscious folks would
resist.

We have an education problem here -- we have to change the mindset
of web designers who view accessibility as an optional plug-in and
not an integral part of the process.
