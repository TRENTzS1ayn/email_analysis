current Limitations on accessibility.

'Blind people' are not the only people having trouble accessing the web.

Whilst I am keen to encourage members to improve accessibility,
it is important to recognise that no site is fully accessible.
Rules have exceptions, and we have not even formalised the 'rules' that
concern cognitive disability. Let alone met their needs
To claim that a site is accessible is an exaggeration.
We are only beginning to touch on the possibilities.
