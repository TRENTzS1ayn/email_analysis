Since you're responding to me, I'm assuming this is addressed to
me -- please note that the reference to "blind people" was a 
_HYPOTHETICAL ARGUMENT_ of the type advanced by ignorant web
designers, not a statement of my beliefs.

Thank you for restating something I've stated myself many times.
Obviously it's important to remember this and keep in mind.

When, exactly, do you plan to start?  I'd like to see some
progress on this -- it's been over a year since you made loud
noises about this on the WAI mailing list, and I have yet to
see anything from you personally, or anyone else who is an
expert on this, that can be used constructively by web developers
and web educators to improve awareness on this issue.

I'd -love- to see some guidelines for doing this.  I've tried
myself -- and posted the URL here -- but this isn't my area of
expertise.  I'd like those of you who -are- experts in this area
to PLEASE give us some concrete guidance -- and not glib, vague
assertions -- so that we can actually get some work done toward
this goal.  As it stands, all I've seen can be summed up as
"waaah, this isn't accessible to *our* special interest group,
but no, we're *not* going to tell you how to make it so!"

And that's very frustrating.  I can only work with people who
are willing to do some work themselves.
