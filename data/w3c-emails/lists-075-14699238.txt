I try to talk my clients out of using JavaScript links and I have only used
them  on 2 sites of all the sights I have done.  I also tell them, if I do
use JS links, then somewhere on the page will be text links as a menu bar.

I think people (whether they have a business site or a homepage) like the
pizzazz that JS can do.  Some impress me (cause I like splash, too *Smile*,)
but I get very disappointed when a javascript error comes up on a page.  I
wonder what I am missing or will page work correctly.
