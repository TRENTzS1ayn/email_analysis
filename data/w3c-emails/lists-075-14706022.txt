I have been reading the comments for some time now and I would greatly
appreciate some feedback on a paper I have been working on.  Please note
that I am an extreme novice on this topic but it is a topic that interests
me nonetheless.  

I have attached the document, it is in Word, if anyone has problems
accessing it please feel free to let me know.

P.S.  I hope this is not an inappropriate use of this forum, if it is I
apologize.
