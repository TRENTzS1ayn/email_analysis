Charles,
It is actually 12 pages.  Much to long for a text attachment at the end of
my message.  I could convert it to HTML but I am not sure what that would do
for the download process?

It is part of my Masters Thesis.  I work for the Transit Agency here is SLC
and have noticed that not much emphasis was being placed on information
accessibility, only on transit accessibility.  So in my trade I am trying to
make the rest stand up and notice.  Once the paper is presentable, I plan on
making every effort possible to get the transit agencies on board as well.

Hi Leslie,

Yes, Word format is a problem. Putting it on the web in HTML is good (means
much faster email downloads), and sending it to the list in text or HTML
format (if it isn't too long) may also be an option.

It would also be helpful if you included a short note saying what the paper
was about.

Cheers

  I have been reading the comments for some time now and I would greatly
  appreciate some feedback on a paper I have been working on.  Please note
  that I am an extreme novice on this topic but it is a topic that interests
  me nonetheless.  
  
  I have attached the document, it is in Word, if anyone has problems
  accessing it please feel free to let me know.
  
  P.S.  I hope this is not an inappropriate use of this forum, if it is I
  apologize.
