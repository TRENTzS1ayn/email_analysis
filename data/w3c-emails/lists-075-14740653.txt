How do you know if either will work if no user agents support it?  I
understand passing a validator is helpful to determine the approach, but
until someone implements it, who knows if it will work?

I don't know of any product that supports either changing languages
mid-stream nor picking up the title attribute on the ABBR element.  And, in
this simple case it doesn't make a difference anyway does it?  LEADER
pronounced in English or Spanish is about the same. I hope somewhere else
on the page it is explained in plain Spanish that LEADER is the
abbreviation for "Programa Europeo de Desarrollo Rural"

I'm taking the developer's pratical view on this.

on the WAI-IG list, Ricardo Sanchez asked,

Hola,

I would like that the screen readers read the text for title ABBR in
Spanish and the abbreviation in english.

Which is the correct way?

Example 1

<HTML lang="es">

<ABBR title="Programa Europeo de Desarrollo Rural" lang="en">LEADER</ABBR>

Example 2

<HTML lang="es">

<ABBR title="Programa Europeo de Desarrollo Rural"><SPAN
lang="en>LEADER</SPAN></ABBR>

Thank in advance.
Ricardo S?nchez






aloha, ricardo!

interesting question...

declaring HTML 4.0 Transitional, you might try the following, which passes
muster on both the W3C Validator and the WDG Validator (via the "direct
input" form located at:
http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/validator/direct.html)

<ABBR LANG="sp" TITLE="Estados Unidos"><span lang="en">U.S.</span></ABBR>

hope this answers your question,
gregory
