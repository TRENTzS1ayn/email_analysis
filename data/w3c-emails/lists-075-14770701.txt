Leslie,

This is a good place to ask, because the Interest Group is to find out how
the organization works and what we are working on.

Since you are working to write an article which will raise awareness, it
will likely be used as a reference by people who first learn about
accessibility when they read it.  Thus it would be good for you to work
with the Education and Outreach Working Group of the WAI.  That is our
group that deals specifically with public information and training
resources.  Check their home page at <http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/> or write
to Judy Brewer <jbrewer@w3.org>, who chairs that group, to ask if they
would review your paper or how you can best work with them in spreading the
word.
