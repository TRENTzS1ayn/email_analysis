I disagree. 

Accessible design is not different, nor difficult. Sites can be single-A
compliant without even trying if they use valid HTML and even marginal
design sense. 

If it's *costing money* to do that, then we should be looking at the skills
of those hired, not at whether or not one should design accessibly.
