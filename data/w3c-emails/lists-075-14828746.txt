Ann, you're arguing a different point with "Accessible design is not
different, nor difficult." Things don't have to be difficult to take time.
And adding accessibility features does take time. Not a lot!! But the
discussion was about ABBR. The point was that ABBR does take some
time to include. ABBR has zero payoff to the content provider. Doesn't
make her site one bit more accessible.

I disagree.

Accessible design is not different, nor difficult. Sites can be single-A
compliant without even trying if they use valid HTML and even marginal
design sense.

If it's *costing money* to do that, then we should be looking at the skills
of those hired, not at whether or not one should design accessibly.
