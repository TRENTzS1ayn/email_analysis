Ann, I respectfully disagree.

I think Web site owners *should* devote whatever resources and money are
necessary to make their sites accessible. But it is simplistic to say that
sites can be Single-A compliant just by using valid HTML and "even marginal
design sense." There are all sorts of goals to consider when designing a
site, and accessibililty is just one of them. Other goals include making
money, appealing to diverse audiences, being visually appealing, and fitting
in with a corporate image. Web developers are not magicians - they have to
work hard to balance the design requirements of those various goals.

I disagree. 

Accessible design is not different, nor difficult. Sites can be single-A
compliant without even trying if they use valid HTML and even marginal
design sense. 

If it's *costing money* to do that, then we should be looking at the skills
of those hired, not at whether or not one should design accessibly.
