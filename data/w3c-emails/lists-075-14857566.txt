Without any disrespect to Dick or Lakespur, this is pretty disheartening
coming from usability and program manager staff at the major browser vendors. 

Web designers are not magicians, but nor is fitting accessibility in with
those goals a magic act. 

I'll happily hold up the HTML Writers Guild site as a site that a: makes
money (and we're not talking pennies here), appeals to a diverse audience,
is visually appealing, and fits in with our corporate image. It's valid, it
has some fun design elements (a few that work better currently in IE than
NN (though that's not an endorsement :) )), and it's single-A compliant. 

It *cost us* no more to produce the site in that manner than it would have
to leave off ALT attributes, not include a doctype, and rely on color alone
for meaning, etc (see the checkpoints for priority 1 guidelines). 

If *we*, as people who are interested in accessible design, and as people
who are in a position to influence other designers say 'well, it can cost
money, and often that's just asking too much', we've skewered our own
efforts before even beginning. Lead by example.
