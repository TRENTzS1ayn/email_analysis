So far all we have as guidelines for making sites accessible are some
validators (excellent ones!) and what we learn from each other on these
eMail list and the W3C guidelines (WAI) for making sites viewable to as
large an audience as possible.   I listen to what everyone has to say and if
I learn something new I test it on my page and then validate it.  I use
Cast/Bobby, W3C Validator, W3C CSS Validation and I put it through several
browsers.  If it passes and looks good in the browsers, I feel I have done a
good job and will use it.

But, I have never felt that designing accessibly was harder than not nor
that it really took more time.  I made up my mind (when I learned about the
accessibility issue) to design all my sites this way from that day forward.
I am choosing to go back over my older sites and start updating them (and it
is going to take quite a while).  I hand code and am at the point where
coding for accessbility seems to come naturally.  When I tell  my clients
how I design their pages, this pleases them.

If one chooses to charge more for designing this way, then that is one's
choice.  I don't because I feel it should be intergrated in with the design
from the beginning.

This is only my opinion.
