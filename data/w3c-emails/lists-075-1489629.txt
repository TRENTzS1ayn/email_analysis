On the 1st of december the Australian Government's enquiry, being conducted
by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission in Australia should be
able to give some examples - the interim report is due then.

A couple of specific cases which I think are problems are the registration
sites for Domain names, which are inaccessible (do not meet level-A of the
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). In the one case where I ahve followed
up on this the site in question has responded that they are planning to
overhaul the site and make it accessible, and I am hoping to follow up on the
other instance this weekend.

I just wandered through Amazon.com (since I recalled using it before) and
although I didn't actually do the transaction (since I don't want to buy
anything today) I put stuff in my shopping cart and went as far as
registering my details without encountering any WCAG P1 failures. Then I
realised there was a book I wanted to send. Turned out it was not in print in
the US, but I found it in the UK and registered, bought a book, and sent it
overseas.

I knew the title I want, and got it by a search. This is not a complete test
by any means, but Amazon is a pretty large and well-known site. I guess there
are only about a zillion other ecmmerce sites I should test, but...

  Hi,
  
  Sorry if this question has been asked before...
  
  I am interested to know if anyone on this list knows of any
  e-commerce/e-business sites that are judged to be accessible?  I making a pitch
  to my group about designing accessibility into the e-business sites we develop
  for clients.  It would be great to tell people, look at these e-commerce sites
  that are accessible - we should be doing this!
  
  In my searching have come across mostly academic and non-profit organization's
  web sites that are accessible, e.g., passed Bobby, follows the WAI guidelines,
  however, I don't remember  coming across anything with a more business or
  corporate focus.
  
  Thanks for any help you can give me!
