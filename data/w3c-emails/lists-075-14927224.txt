quote same argument that has traditionally kept ALT

aloha, thatch!

as someone who has designed, constructed, and maintained web sites for
educational, non-profit, and for-profit entities, i couldn't disagree
more...  what is the extra expense entailed in adding ABBR or ACRONYM to
page content?  this is the same argument that has traditionally kept ALT
from being routinely deployed, despite the fact that it is a required
attribute of IMG in HTML 4.0/4.01

your caution about being selective in what we ask for from content
developers because of cost simply doesn't wash...  what we are actually
doing is two-fold -- 1) asking content developers to design and implement
with accessibility in mind, and 2) to compensate for the shortcomings of
the existing technology upon which they are umbilically reliant, in
particular, the well-documented shortcomings of authoring tools...

that is where the true expense lies -- in evaluation and repair, not in
education and implementation...  what do most web content providers learn
when they take courses on web design/construction?  even at the most
prestigious of educational institutions, they very rarely learn the grammar
and syntax, they almost never learn the why behind the how, but are merely
given an expensive introduction to a particular authoring tool's
interface...

my argument isn't the only argument for implementing the accessibility
features that PF has worked so diligently to get integrated into W3C
promulgated markup languages, but it is one aspect of the broader solution
-- endowing the greatest possible number of individuals with equivalent
read AND write access to the web...
