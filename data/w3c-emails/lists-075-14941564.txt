Hi,

I just noticed that NIDRR's Abledata website has a version marked as being
accessibility and a version without an accessibility focus.
(There's accessible version is labeled as being appropriate for
people using screen readers.)

It would seem that labeling a version as being useful for people
with certain disabilities is perceived by some people to have some value.
