The same reason that has kept people from using the ABBR or ACRONYM tag is
the same reason ALT was not routinely used.  And that is page authoring
tools have not incorporated this feature.  

Once ALT , Height and Width were put into page authoring tools, it became
easy to use.  So until page authoring tools allow a box for ABBR and
Acronym, it will not gain wide acceptance.  

This is part of the implementation side of design and management.  We need
tools that make us more productive and efficient.  Until then, there may not
be much acceptance out side people that are bound by ADA and Section 508.
