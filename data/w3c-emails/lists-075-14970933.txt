If the page authoring tools had this functionality to highlight a word,
right click and add ABBR or acronym, then it would be easy to implement with
reduced cost for rework.  This would permit a huge time savings for the
future!

So to advance the accept and use of any function, the honous is on the page
authoring tools to provide this!

My point here, which the Guild has discussed both internally
and in other
fora such as these, is that the "cost" -- be that volunteer
labor, paid
staff, or paid consultants, does not have to changed based
on whether
someone uses an ALT attribute, ABBR, or any other
accessibility checkpoint
in the markup of a site. The expertise put into use on the
Guild site has
been developed over the years through our participation in
W3C activities,
and the learning of our volunteers and staff. 

No one, least of all myself, is arguing that there isn't a
learning curve.
However, the argument that the learning curve is so unique
or special that
even professional web designers shouldn't be expected to
undertake it, or
have it already as a part of their skill-set is untenable. 

It's ironic that the voices proclaiming 'it would cost too
much' are the
voices of larger companies who spend far more on their Web
presence than
the average IMI client, or WebGeek client, or the colleges
and universities
or governmental agencies who's sites are accessible today. 

Judy's testimony before the House subcommittee last week
reminded us that
the ADA doesn't necessarily allow "it would cost too much to
fix it" as
defense for not having done it right in the first place. 

Doing it right in the first place, of course, is far less
costly than
hiring consultants to retrofit something. Why someone should
do it right in
the first place is a discussion that, for this forum, would
be preaching to
the choir.
