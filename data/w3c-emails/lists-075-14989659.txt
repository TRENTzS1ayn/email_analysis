I'll politely disagree here...

Maybe I didn't dig deep enough, but I didn't see any Java. What I did see was JavaScript rollovers on navigation buttons. No problem with those that I could see - but you don't need Java support for that, only JavaScript support.  (never mind that in at least one browser you have to enable Java to get JavaScript, I think - the two are complete different things).

I looked at this version (with my able but spectacled eyes) and found them much more usable than the "graphics" version.
The "graphics heavy" version not only uses graphics but also sets some font faces (like "Book Antiqua") which happen to be present on my system but are really not suited for the web but more designed for print. With my preferred default font size (!) I found the body text quite illegible; to get reasonable legibility I had to step up font size setting in my browser. (I could of course even override font face but wouldn't that be a bit much to ask?) The same problem (different fonts) on the home page where the choice is given and explained.

I think the idea *may* be sound. But it falls flat on its face by providing a page that is hard to read for those who think they can deal with Java (actually JavaScript) and graphics. The chosen font faces make it hard, the graphics background makes it harder. Not to mention that the code is not valid either; it seems to be produced with some version of Front Page without validating or repairing the code it produced.

Um - I'm not impressed at all. A really good design for the content (at least the content I've seen) would be accessible to all and not even necessitate two versions.
