Hi, Marjolein

I believe the first page said that the full graphic web page used Java,
though I didn't try to confirm it independently.


I found the graphic version to be much more interesting to use.  I loved
the coloring.  The Welcome image had a nice leather texture to it.  The
images for the buttons made them little easier to a identify rather than
just pure text.  I liked having buttons to select because it was easier
to move my cursor to instead of having to go for a smaller text The page
uses a lot of the capability of web pages to provide a rich
presentation.  The low graphics web pages were pretty boring visually.
For those who use more graphic cuing, they may not be as prefereable.

While I would agree that some of the cosmetic points you bring up need
to be addressed, they are minor details and readily fixed.  The key
point is you can get the format you prefer to work with and I can get
the graphic-rich form I like with which could include special
Javascript/Java features.  Would you want to deny sighted users of
graphically-rich web pages?  What would that accomplish?  I'm sure that
sighted people would not see that it is to their benefit.

At one time I brought up the question of whether access to a page is
important or access to information.  Note that the web site points out
that the information is the same.

Your statement is that a good design would not necessitate two versions.
How would you do that without impinging on a form that would be visually
appealing for many sighted users?  How would you let me still get the
format that Abledata presents which I like?

Scott

No problem with those that I could see - but you don't need Java support for that, only JavaScript support.  (never mind that in at least one browser you have to enable Java to get JavaScript, I think - the two are complete different things).

With my preferred default font size (!) I found the body text quite illegible; to get reasonable legibility I had to step up font size setting in my browser. (I could of course even override font face but wouldn't that be a bit much to ask?) The same problem (different fonts) on the home page where the choice is given and explained.

The chosen font faces make it hard, the graphics background makes it harder. Not to mention that the code is not valid either; it seems to be produced with some version of Front Page without validating or repairing the code it produced.
