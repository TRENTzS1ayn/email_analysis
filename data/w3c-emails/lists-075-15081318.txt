Scott, this is an excellent point -- and I don't think it's true
just for people with disabilities, either! :)  Many times all of us
look at what we ask of people, and if it makes OUR lives easier, we
are for it -- but we might not think of the effect it has on _their_
lives.

If it saves you $1.00 but costs me $2.00, is that a fair trade-off?

There are no easy answers here, and clearly the best path is one 
down the middle and not on either extreme.  Thanks for your
insight!
