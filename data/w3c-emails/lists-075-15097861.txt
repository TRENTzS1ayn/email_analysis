Joyce, we have to make a distinction between "designing
accessibly" -- which is a mindset, a method, a general
way you do things -- and specific accessible web design
techniques.

The mindset in which one designs accessibly, with a concern
for those who may not access the web in the manner that we
-- or the majority of current users -- access the web, does
not put a burden on the creator.  In fact, it's liberating once
you realize the potential of the web and how you utilize the
full power of the world wide web concept.

However, there are specific techniques for -doing- accessible
web design that may take time, and sometimes may take
considerable time (or cost).

So it's important to make a distinction between the philosophy
of accessible web design, and the practice of accessible web
techniques.
