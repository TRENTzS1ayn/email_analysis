I have to disagree -- the support for HEIGHT, WIDTH, and ALT came
about when browsers started supporting them, not when authoring tools
started supporting them.  People began using HEIGHT and WIDTH because
it made pages "load faster" in Netscape, not because some group of
tools supported them.

ALT has been supported in most authoring tools (but not prominently)
for years now.  However, the use of ALT text as "tool tips" by
major browsers has had a *much* greater effect on the acceptance of
ALT than anything done by any page authoring tools.
