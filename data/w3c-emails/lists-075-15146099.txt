aloha, kynn!

with all due respect, terms such as HTML, WAI, W3C, MIT, HWG, and other 
similar conflations cited in your reply to ann on the WAI-IG list are 
acronyms, not abbreviations, and should be marked up accordingly...

ACRONYM is supported by MSIE 4x and greater (at least in the PC flavors), 
and is -- as i have argued in this and other fora -- an indispensable 
accessibility as well as usability aid...  moreover, ACRONYMs are currently 
expanded by MSIE much in the manner that ALT is -- as ToolTips (which, 
unfortunately, don't help a speech output user, such as myself)

and, as much as i would like to have ACRONYMs and abbreviations expanded by 
my screen reader, i am glad to know that -- for those with cognitive 
disabilities and certain forms of dyslexia -- there are mechanisms to 
assist individuals make sense out of content which is often rife with 
acronyms...

feeling the love,
gregory.
