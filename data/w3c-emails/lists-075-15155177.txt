aloha, wayne!

i respect your honesty and forthrightness, so let me respond in kind...

in any other medium, it would be considered a sign not of sloppiness, but 
rank incompetence and indifference, for an author NOT to expand an acronym 
the first time it is introduced to the reader...  why then, should the web 
be exempt from this rule of thumb, simply because it takes a few calories 
on the part of the author to (1) think of the correct expansion and (2) a 
few keystrokes to enclose the term in an ACRONYM?

i don't know from whence you drew your conclusion that i am indulging in 
such fallacious rhetoric that it threatens to undermine the work of the 
WAI, either...  all i have done is (a) encourage others to use ACRONYM and 
ABBR, (b) asked that the priority level accorded ACRONYM and ABBR be raised 
in WCAG, and (c) asked authoring tool and user agent developers to support 
it...

so how exactly am i undermining the web accessibility initiative, 
wayne?  by asking too much?  is it really asking too much to expect 
authoring tools to support ALL of the elements and attributes defined for 
the markup languages they claim to support?  is it too much to ask that 
user agents to support their expansion?

what is being asked for here isn't something esoteric, but basic -- and 
elemental to the broadest possible dissemination of information...   in 
that light, failure to use ACRONYM is not only poor design, it is poor 
implementation...

and yes, while i realize that this is a forum specifically oriented towards 
questions of accessibility, the expansion of acronyms and abbreviations is 
not merely an accessibility issue, but an internationalization and general 
usability issue...

so, if tying all 3 together undermines the work of the WAI, damn the 
torpedos, full speed ahead!
