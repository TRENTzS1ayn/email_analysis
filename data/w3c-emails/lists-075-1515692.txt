Just to give a little independent verification from a totally blind screen 
reader user:

Yes, Amazon is one of my favorite shopping sites. For a large site with 
dozens of options it is relatively easy to navigate. Switch to their 
text-only version (generated on the fly) to avoid getting trapped in 97 
imagemap links.

Other sites (e.g., CDNOW, as of 6 weeks ago or so) have constant blurbs at 
the top of each page, so you hear them numerous times, even when trying to 
concentrate on entering credit card details, which is very distracting. 
Other sites make you enter your password each time you add something to the 
Shopping Cart. Still other sites make use of graphical buttons for the 
items to be purchased. Amazon avoids all these pitfalls.

Amazon may be getting too big for its own good, though. If I'm trying to 
buy books I don't want to hear about auctions, & if I'm trying to buy 
electronics I don't want to hear about the top 10 CDs.

Not Amazon stockholder, but did get a free plastic coffee mug from them 
last year
