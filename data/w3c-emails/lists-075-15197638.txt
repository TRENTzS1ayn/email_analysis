What an interesting thread...

The point is well proclaimed.  Why, then, can we not do/request/require
both and call it a compromise?

One can easily prove that the first is more accessible.  The first
example sets a precedence for the entire document.  It even eludes that
parantheses are used to indicate manually expanded acronyms in this
author's culture.  The first points out blatantly that we are dealing
with an acronym here.  No assumptions must be made as it's clear and
concise.  Who does it say this to?  Anyone intelligent enough to
question it.  They cannot be considered equally accessible without
blatant disregard to wide-spread comprehension.

Right here, right now, the accessibility of this is questionable.  I
would likely (and often do) avoid this in favor of a combination of
manual expansion and inclusion of acronym markup on, at least, the first
instance of a term.
