I have always been under the impression that HTML is normalized to the
English language.  I believe the HTML spec references this, as well.  As
such, Merriam Webster (http://www.m-w.com/) defines those two terms as
such:

ac?ro?nym
    : a word (as NATO, radar, or snafu) formed from the initial letter
or letters of each of the successive parts or major parts of a compound
term.

ab?bre?vi?a?tion
  1 : the act or result of abbreviating : ABRIDGMENT
  2 : a shortened form of a written word or phrase used in place of the
whole <amt is an abbreviation for amount>

Neither of those definitions make reference to pronunciation.  The
examples cited by Merriam Webster are in direct conflict with your
examples cited previously.
