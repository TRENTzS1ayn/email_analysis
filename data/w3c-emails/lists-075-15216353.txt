Hi,

There probably is no simple solution given current access technology.
It would be helpful if the access technology could use just one
acronym/abbreviation reference in a page and then apply it each time the
technology encounters the same text.  Perhaps, putting the tag in the
definition of the HTML head element might be helpful.

There are also conflicting needs.  Various blind user's have commented
that it is helpful to keep down the number of words down which increases
the speed of reading.  However, they also need to know the meaning of
the abbreviation or acronym.  Another problem is that a user can start
using the web page any place on the page.  This is a little different
than printed material.  A possible access technological solution would
be to keep track of the first occurence on a page when access technology
encounters an abbreviation/acronym.  The technology would then give the
full text followed by the acronym/abbreviation.  The access technology
could provide a configuration option which would specify if the acronym
or the full text could be used when the acronym/abbreviation is
encountered at subsequent times.
