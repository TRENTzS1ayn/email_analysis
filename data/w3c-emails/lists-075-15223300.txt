No, it doesn't -- only if you have some sort of reference BACK to
the acronym can you be certain that it is a reference.

You cannot assume that every occurence of WAI on the same page 
should be expanded to Web Accessibility Initiative, unless you
have something like the following:

      There are at least two things that the letters "W" "A" "I"
      can refer to when speaking of web design.  One is the
      W3C's <ACRONYM ID="waiw3c" TITLE="Web Accessibility
      Initiative">WAI</ACRONYM> and the other is Netscape's
      <ACRONYM ID="wainscp">Web Application Interface</ACRONYM>.

You could then use something similar to LABEL's FOR attribute to
reference those IDs later in the text.

(Note:  This is not current part of the HTML spec.)

Points it out to whom?

Which browsers will treat these two differently, and who exactly will
gain additional access to the information?

We may be dealing with different terms here -- my definition of
accessibility (or "more accessible" in this case) relies upon the
concept that the number of people who have access to the information
is increased.  What people, theoretical or otherwise, would be
able to access the first version but not the second?
