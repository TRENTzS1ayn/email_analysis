I find site specific  back and home links to be extremely useful and
important when my initial introduction to a website is a page other than
the main page of the hierarchy, i.e. when I am using a search engine or a
reference page. It often gives me an easy way to understand the larger
context of a given page. I am generally frustrated by pages which don't
give me a way to get up to their parents.
