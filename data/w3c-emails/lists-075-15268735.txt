aloha, my dear fellow goofball, kynn!

actually, i too double-checked the HTML spec before posting to the list 
earlier this evening, and found its examples extremely unenlightening, 
which is why i didn't reference it in my earlier post...

for example, it lists both GmbH and F.B.I. as acronyms, but i've never 
heard anyone speak either as a word...

the rule of thumb which i was taught by the nuns at notre dame elementary 
school is that an abbreviation is a shortening of a single word, whilst an 
acronym is a new word composed of parts of more than one (usually several) 
words (or, in linguist-speak, a compound term), and need not be 
pronounceable in order to merit designation as an acronym...

World Wide Web is a compound term, therefore, it is logical to call WWW 
(that's 3 double-ewes without spaces) an ACRONYM, and i would therefore 
submit that, in using WWW as an example of an abbreviation, the HTML 4x 
spec is in error...

and, i think that the following paragraph, taken from the HTML4 spec, 
supports that contention:

quote
The ABBR and ACRONYM elements allow authors to clearly indicate occurrences 
of abbreviations and acronyms. Western languages make extensive use of 
acronyms such as "GmbH", "NATO", and "F.B.I.", as well as abbreviations 
like "M.", "Inc.", "et al.", "etc.". Both Chinese and Japanese use 
analogous abbreviation mechanisms, wherein a long name is referred to 
subsequently with a subset of the Han characters from the original 
occurrence. Marking up these constructs provides useful information to user 
agents and tools such as spell checkers, speech synthesizers, translation 
systems and search-engine indexers.
unquote

it is this paragraph (coupled with linguistic usage) which justifies the 
usage contained in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

and, as the GmbH and F.B.I. examples cited above indicate, there is no 
expectation (linguistically or in the HTML4x spec) that an ACRONYM _must_ 
be pronounceable as a word,

as a matter of fact, i'd like to hear anyone (other than my screen-reader) 
attempt to pronounce what is listed in the guinness book of world records 
as the longest valid acronym:

NIIOMTPLABOPARMBETZHELBETRABSBOMONIMONKONOTDTEKHSTROMONT

which is quote short unquote for the transliteration of the initial letters 
of the name of the quote Laboratory for Shuttering, Reinforcement, Concrete 
and Ferroconcrete Operations for Composite-monolithic and Monolithic 
Constructions of the Department of Technology of Building Assembly 
Operations of the Scientific Research Institute of the Organization for 
Building Mechanization and Technical Aid of the Academy of Building and 
Architecture of the USSR unquote

yours acronymoniously,
         GJR
