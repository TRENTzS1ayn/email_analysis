Hi Robert,

Then I think about how implement ACCESSKEYs:

I avoid the ACCESSKEYs that can create problems in English and 
the language of the pages -a lot of people use the last version
of the browsers (in english) before it has been translated
to another languages-.

For example:

I avoid the ACCESSKEYs: 
F:file, H:help, E:edit
and 
A:archivo, V:ayuda E:edicion 
for Spanish version of a site.


ACCESSKEYs don?t work with very much browsers and
operating systems but I think that these are very
useful for very much people.

Regards

Ricardo S?nchez
