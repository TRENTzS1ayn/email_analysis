Hi Gregory and All,

The problem with languages and ACRONYMS or ABBR is very hard.
For example in Spain very much people pronunce MIT how a word,
but I don?t know how french people pronunce MIT. When I have this
problem I use ABBR tag and wait that the users can understand it.

Another example is in HTML 4.0 Specification:


Here are some sample uses of ABBR:

  <P>
  <ABBR title="World Wide Web">WWW</ABBR>
  <ABBR lang="fr"
        title="Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Nationale des Chemins de Fer">
     SNCF
  </ABBR>
  <ABBR lang="es" title="Do&ntilde;a">Do&ntilde;a</ABBR>
  <ABBR title="Abbreviation">abbr.</ABBR>


Do&ntilde;a in Spanish isn't a abbr. Do&ntilde;a is a 
courtesy title.

Regards

Ricardo S?nchez
