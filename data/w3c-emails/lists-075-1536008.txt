Try explaining that to your average elderly, non-techie, person, who thinks
home is where they are sitting.

OK, you and I understand that "home" means different things.  It's using
the same term which causes the real confusion.  Calling it, say, "Front page" 
on the site would avoid this confusion.  We're stuck with the Home button
on the browser, and the semantics of this.

BTW, if visitors enter the site at the top, they can always get back to
the top using the browser's back button.  This should be encouraged -
as I say in one of my other points.

Cheers,

John
