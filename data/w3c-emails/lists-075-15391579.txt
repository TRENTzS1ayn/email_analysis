Hi all,

An abbreviation and an acronym are not the same thing and they should not
made a mistake neither they can be used in the same way in HTML.

As Charles has explained: "Basically, Acronym is greek, and means
something made from initial letters and abbreviation is french and means
something that has been shortened."

With the exception that in Spanish the word " abreviatura" comes from Latin:
"abbreviatura".

Their purpose is that the screen reader makes a correct reading of the
sentence in which is included the acronym or the abbreviation, for example:

NATO is an acronym and I understand that in HTML it should appear this way:
<ACRONYM lang = it is TITLE = " NATO ">OTAN </ACRONYM> or, <ACRONYM lang =
it is TITLE = efe be i: Brigada de Investigaci?n Criminal">FBI </ACRONYM> as
it is wanted that it is pronounced by the screen reader, that which will
depend from the culture to which goes the page.

But " Mr." it is an abbreviation so, it can only be used in a way:
<ABBR TITLE = Mister">Mr.</ABBR>
