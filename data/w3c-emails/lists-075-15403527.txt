Hola folks,

Acronym and abbreviation add something very important that is completely
lacking in span - information about what kind of information is being marked
out (specifically, something that is an abbreviation or an acronym).

If the two things are equivalent in HTML then there are a few
possiblities. One is to remove one of them, and in this case I would suggest
abbr, as the one less supported. A second possibility is to ask the editors
of the HTML / XHTML to specify more clearly which is intended for what. A
third possiblity is to ask tem to completely revamp that markup, and have it
work along the lines of the ruby element proposed from the i18n group, for
example, or some other new form.

The big question, which has no doubt not been answered to the satisfaction of
everybody, is still whether it is important to mark up acronyms and
abbreviations as such. And that is a question which I think should be taken
to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Group.
