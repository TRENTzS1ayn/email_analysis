I actually think removing acronym, as an acronym really *is* a type of abreviation. And if we (people on the WAI-IG list) can't agree on acronyms are and what's just abbreviations, I very much doubt "ordinary" people will understand the difference. Since abbr and acroynm will be rendered the same on all UAs, I really see no reason to keep both in the HTML specification, especially since noone seems to know the difference (and the definition is not the same in various languages/countries).
