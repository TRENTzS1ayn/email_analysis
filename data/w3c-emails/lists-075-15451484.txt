There is a video on foxnews called Accessing Cyberspace, released 5:21 p.m.
ET (2221 GMT) February 17, 2000, the caption is "The federal government is
looking to help people with disabilities use the Internet"

I do not have a URL on how to get there, but go to www.foxnews.com, click on
video and you get a pop-up web page. Here is an option to select the video
format and you need to scroll to Sci-Tech and click on the link for surfing
the web with disabilities.

Interesting comments,  For one it talks about the captioning but this video
does not have any!

I sent an email comment but not sure where it will go!
