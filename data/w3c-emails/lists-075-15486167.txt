Hi Kelly,

the document that collects the information is at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources/WAI-UA-Support - in the case that you
mention, the issues are described but there is not yet anything specific
about which browsers are there.

That page asks for extra comments and feedback to be sent to
wai-wcag-editors@w3.org

Cheers

Charles McCN

  Hi All,
  
  I won't claim to have a complete knowledge of all the documents on the WAI
  pages so perhaps what I'm asking about is covered someplace.  I was talking
  with someone who's putting together a workshop for people on designing
  accessible web pages and our conversation brought up a question which I
  didn't know the answer to.
  
  Many of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines talk about not doing
  something until another something happens i.e don't do X until Y is
  supported or works correctly.  Is there some sort of reference document
  that a person can consult to know when the conditions of Y doing what it
  should correctly have been met and now doing X is acceptable?
  
  As an example under priority 3 guidelines, 10.4 says:
  
  10.4
  Until user agents handle empty controls correctly, include default,
  place-holding characters in edit boxes and text areas. 
  
  My understanding of the definitions of until" as indicated by various WAI
  documents and my experience with various browsers and assistive
  technologies lead me to the conclusion that in this case the "until"
  conditions have been met.
  
  1. Is there a general agreement that this is indeed the case?
  
  2. Is there a reference document that people can use in general to
  determine when these types of conditions have been met?
  
  3. If such a document exists, what are the criteria for determining that a
  condition has been satisfied and how can people give input into that process?
