aloha, bruce!

in the PC environment, i know from testing with sighted and low-vision 
users that TITLE takes precedence over ALT as a ToolTip when both are 
defined for a graphical hyperlink...  when one mouses over a hyperlink for 
which a TITLE has been defined, that, too, is exposed as a ToolTip in MSIE 
4x and 5x

JFW 3.5 (the screen-reader produced by henter-joyce, http://www.hj.com/) 
allows one to choose whether one wants the hyperlink text spoken, the TITLE 
or ALT (with TITLE taking precedence over ALT), or whichever is longest...

the default setting, as described in:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JanMar/0123.html
is "speak TITLE or ALT"

the removal of ALT text from a site because of ToolTip action, however, is 
indefensible, especially since the decision was apparently taken based on a 
browser-specific implementation slash exposition...
