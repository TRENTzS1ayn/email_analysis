BB:: "Does anyone know the circumstances that causes IE to display TITLE
versus ALT as "tool tips"?"

WL: At a face2face the then MS rep, Chuck Opperman listed the order of
attributes from which IE decided what to put in the tool tips. I don't
remember the sequence but maybe TITLE came before ALT? This of course
does not excuse removal of ALT.
