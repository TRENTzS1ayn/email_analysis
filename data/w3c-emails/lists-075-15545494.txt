Dear Gregory <span lang="la">et <abbr title="alia">al.</abbr></span> :)

I recognize that Tool Tip behavior ALT vs TITLE is an old question.  For
example, see <acronym title="Was not that funny the first time, knock it off
already!">URL</acronym>:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/1997OctDec/0131.html

I am glad to hear you say that IE is following our (?) recommended behavior
of using TITLE over ALT.  This IS how it works for me with IE 4.5 and a Mac.

Does this means that one could "defeat tooltips" by using code like:
<IMG SRC="foo.gif" ALT="Foo U!" TITLE=""> ?

I am NOT getting this behavior out of IE 5 under Windows 95.  I am ONLY
getting ALT as the tool tip.  Could someone speculate if there is trouble
with my browser configuration or with my code?  Did IE change behavior
between ver 4 and 5?  The page I am testing with is my own home page at URL:
http://www.dors.state.md.us/

Thank you.
