WL: I think this should be emblazoned on all our foreheads! 

I think that the currently raging discourse on this whole subject is:
divisive; ill-considered; important beyond the instant issue. I propose
that it form a locus (nexus? focus?) for discussions at the CSUN
face2face. I would suggest a moratorium on the list (glut/overload is
long passed) for this thread/discussion as we aren't really getting
anywhere but it wouldn't do any good -  but that's a major IMHO thing we
should do. LEAVE IT ALONE FOR A MONTH!
