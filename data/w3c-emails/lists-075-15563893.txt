aloha, emmanuelle!

i couldn't agree with you more -- there is a definite need for _both_ ABBR 
and ACRONYM, as well as a definite need to clarify, in the HTML 4x spec, 
what exactly is meant by an abbreviation and what is meant by an acronym in 
the context of HTML...

as i wrote in an earlier post, i believe that the distinction meant by the 
authors of the HTML 4x spec is that an abbreviation is a shortened form of 
a _single_ word, whilst an acronym is a compound contraction of more than 
one word, and that it is _not_ necessary for that compound contraction to 
be pronounceable as a word in order for it to earn designation as an acronym...

why is there a need for the distinction?  aside from the linguistic 
argument that acronyms and abbreviations are quite different animals, there 
is the question of user-configurability...

as a speech user, i personally would probably choose to have the TITLE for 
any ABBR defined for a page spoken, while leaving anything marked up as an 
ACRONYM in its compact form, so that, if i were confused as to what a 
particular acronym meant, i could use a screen review command to have the 
TITLE associated with the ACRONYM announced...  others might configure 
their systems in the opposite manner (ignore ABBR but expand ACRONYM) while 
others might prefer that both be automatically expanded or that both be 
read in their compact form...

in any event, the choice of whether to expand or not expand should be the 
end-user's; authors should be encouraged to use ABBR and ACRONYM; and the 
editors of the HTML spec should be advised of the internal inconsistencies 
in the spec's definition of ABBR and ACRONYM, and asked to provide a 
clarification...

gregory.
