Actually, this is a topic of discussion at the moment in the Protocols and
Formats group, and it needs to be taking place in that group over the next
month. But the discussion on the interest group list is very helpful in
getting a broader perspective on the problem.

I agree that we need to remember there are many different languages on the
Web, as well as people facing many differnt barriers to access.

cheers

  I think that the currently raging discourse on this whole subject is:
  divisive; ill-considered; important beyond the instant issue. I propose
  that it form a locus (nexus? focus?) for discussions at the CSUN
  face2face. I would suggest a moratorium on the list (glut/overload is
  long passed) for this thread/discussion as we aren't really getting
  anywhere but it wouldn't do any good -  but that's a major IMHO thing we
  should do. LEAVE IT ALONE FOR A MONTH!
