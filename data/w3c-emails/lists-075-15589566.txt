aloha, bruce!

<a href="http://www.mdtap.org/"
         title="Maryland Technology Assistance Project"><img
         src="images/tap-logo.gif"
         alt="Jump to MD TAP."
         border="0" width="88" height="31"></a>

JFW 3.5 (in conjunction with MSIE 5.01) reads the TITLE defined for the 
buttons, and not the ALT text, so that when i tab-to the tap-logo button, i 
hear:

Maryland Technology Assistance Project

but the document source reveals that the ALT text is defined as "Jump to MD 
TAP", which i personally find less informative than the TITLE defined for 
the link...

don't have sighted assistance at hand to tell you the ToolTip behavior, 
though...
