aloha, marjolein!

thank you for expanding my provincial horizons!

since i'm not sure what the expansion for IOW is, i can't comment upon 
where something such as m.a.w. might fall into a classification schema for 
abbreviations...  i do, however, think that any compound term that is 
abbreviated (whether or not periods are used -- especially since, at least 
in english -- it is possible to discard the periods and still have a usable 
acronym, such as FBI, which is considered as valid a spelling (at least 
according to the 3 spell-checkers i have at my disposal) as F.B.I.), could 
-- and should -- be marked up using ACRONYM, a point on which, i fear, i 
have been less than clear in past posts...

my convoluted sentence structure probably isn't helping advance my point 
either, so let me try again...

leaving linguistics out of the equation for the moment, _any_ abbreviated 
compound term could be considered an ACRONYM from a markup standpoint, 
whether it is pronounceable as a word or only as a string of 
characters...  this definition would cover both letterwoords (such as 
RADAR) as well as compound abbreviations (such as FBI, DVS, GmbH, or a.d.h.v.)

again, from a markup standpoint, any single-word abbreviation would be 
encoded using ABBR

where this distinction may well fall apart, as you pointed out, is in 
languages, in which it is possible to form an abbreviated form of a 
compound term using parts of words or a mixture of syllables and initial 
letters

which is something that needs to be investigated by the W3C's 
internationalization working group, as well as the WAI's protocols and 
formats working group...

as for your question:

indicating pronunciation is the sort of functionality that Ruby is intended 
to provide -- consult:
http://www.w3.org/TR/ruby/

quoting from the Ruby working draft's "Abstract"

quote
"Ruby" are short runs of text alongside the base text, typically used in 
East Asian documents to indicate pronunciation or to provide a short 
annotation. This specification defines markup for ruby. The specification 
is written so that this markup for ruby can be included as a module of 
XHTML 1.1
