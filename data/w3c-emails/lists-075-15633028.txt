For the record, HPR speaks and tooltips in Netscape 4.5 and IE 5 all use
the alt-text, not title, in the Gregory's example below.

aloha, bruce!

<a href="http://www.mdtap.org/"
         title="Maryland Technology Assistance Project"><img
         src="images/tap-logo.gif"
         alt="Jump to MD TAP."
         border="0" width="88" height="31"></a>

JFW 3.5 (in conjunction with MSIE 5.01) reads the TITLE defined for the
buttons, and not the ALT text, so that when i tab-to the tap-logo button, i
hear:

Maryland Technology Assistance Project

but the document source reveals that the ALT text is defined as "Jump to MD
TAP", which i personally find less informative than the TITLE defined for
the link...

don't have sighted assistance at hand to tell you the ToolTip behavior,
though...
