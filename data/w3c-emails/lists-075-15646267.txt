I agree with Charles in that the discussion inside the list is useful, among
other things because not all those that participate in this list will attend
the CSUN. And I agree with you in that the discussion goes beyond the topic
and in that a meeting face to face would be productive. Personally I won't
attend the CSUN, but in representation of the SIDAR will go Enrique Varela,
to who I will take charge him that he contacts you and attend that possible
meeting, in case it is taken to effect.

cheers,
