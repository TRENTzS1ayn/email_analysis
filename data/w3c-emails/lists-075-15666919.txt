Sigh.  I am somebody who cares and _I_ can't keep the advice straight!

It sounds like things worked for you well.  Are you saying I should my code
in deference to browsers which don't handle TITLE correctly?  I had ALT and
TITLE reversed before, but changed it based on discussions from the WAI
list!

The last "rule" I remember consensus (?!) on is that A HREF TITLE attribute
should be what is used by TITLE in the HEAD section of the referenced page
(logical enough).

I have also gotten the advice (also from someone on this list, my apologies
for forgetting who) that ALT associated with a link should use a verb.  The
IMG in question is a take on their logo that incorporates the letters "M D"
and "T A P".  The graphic gives no clue as to what "MD TAP" might be, so
"Jump to MD TAP" seems like very appropriate ALT tag content to me.  Should
ALT contain _more_ information than is contained by the image?

I sincerely hope we don't get into discussing ABBR and ACRONYM for GIFs...
