PJ: where does W3C / WAI recommend TITLE over ALT for tool tips? I searched
WCAG, ATAG, UAAG, and their respective Techniques and only found a mention
in the HTML 4.01 spec:
http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/global.html#idx-title-1
and the HTML 4 Accessibility Note.
http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/HTML4-access
"The new "title" attribute gives a short description of an image, etc.
Graphical browsers frequently pop-up this information when a user pauses
over an element with the mouse (tool-tips), but it is equally useful to
non-visual browsers"

PJ: neither reference recommends a preference order of TITLE over ALT. The
UA guideline 2 Ensure that users have access to all content, but not the
order.  Perhaps this should be made explicit in the UA guidelines? It may
make sense in a visual browser that the title= be render as a tool tip
since the user may have access to the visual image.  But I would recommend
a screen reader and text browser to render the alt=text first by default
and provide access to the title= some other way. After all, in HTML title=
attribute is not a WCAG P1 except for FRAME [WCAG 12.1], is a P2 for
navigation [WCAG 13.1],  and a P3 for ABBR [WCAG 4.2].

PJ:
It is also important to note that the visual image only has the text "MD
TAP" on it, so I was confused with the alt="Jump to MD TAP".  I would have
put the "jump to" in the title= if anywhere.  The user agent tells me it is
a link, not the author.  I instruct others to only include in the
alt="text" the text from the image and occasionally the word "logo".  This
example is visually an image link of a red logo with the text MD TAP on it.
I would recommend alt="MD TAP logo".

Why does JFW 3.5 render the title="Maryland Technology Assistance Project"
instead of the alt="text"?  Is this a user JFW setting, a feature of DOM or
MSAA, or what?
