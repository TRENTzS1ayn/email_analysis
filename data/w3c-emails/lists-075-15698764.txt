Hi Phill and all,

A reason to maintain the difference between the acronym and the abbreviation
has already given it Gregory J. Rosmaita:

"as a speech user, i personally would probably choose to have the TITLE for
any ABBR defined for a page spoken, while leaving anything marked up as an
ACRONYM in its compact form, so that, if i were confused as to what a
particular acronym meant, i could use a screen review command to have the
TITLE associated with the ACRONYM announced...  others might configure
their systems in the opposite manner (ignore ABBR but expand ACRONYM) while
others might prefer that both be automatically expanded or that both be
read in their compact form... "

And as for the users that don't use a screen reader it is useful that when
they placing the pointer of the mouse on the acronym they can read their
definition (Like it happens with IE). Would it be convenient that it
happened the same thing with the abbreviations? Maybe, mainly for the
readers that don't have a deep knowledge of the language in that the page is
edited, for example.

regards,
Emmanuelle
