We are trying at James Cook University to develop a very accessible web
site.  The target clients are those who may have cognitive problems after
an accident.  

So far, only a few pages have been developed, we are interested in comments
about what is right and wrong about the design so far.

http://www.tsd.jcu.edu.au/develop/conrod/ed1421/modules.html

Only the Module 1 and unit 1 links work as yet.
