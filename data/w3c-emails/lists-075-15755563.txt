Gregory, Kynn, Charles, et al....

I have tried to sit back and be patient,  but this thread has gone far
enough. You are discussing a Priority *3* checkpoint, and I cannot (read:
will not) believe that there are not more critical issues that we need to
come to consensus on.

This thread makes me feels as if I am in the faculty club of (***insert
favorite elite university****) sipping my favorite Port discussing how many
angels can dance on the head of a pin.

The WCAG are about providing equal access to information. If an acronym is
not understandable in its context, it is equally as inaccessible to
everybody. Why should we be any different?

If I was new to Web Access, and I subscribed to this list to get practical
tips on web accessibility, this thread would turn me off completely.
Admittedly, it does provide some intellectual fodder for us web access
junkies, but it also makes a mockery out of our mission.

Thanks,

dc

Subject: RE: ABBR vs. ACRONYM

aloha, phil!

i'm extremely troubled when i hear representatives of developers say things
such as:

quote
If nothing does or nothing should happen with ABBR, then why mark it up?
unquote

the quote it isn't supported so why do it unquote approach is the very
mind-set that the WAI exists to change...  when you advocate ignoring any
markup which isn't currently supported by a quote mainstream unquote user
agent, you are throwing the baby out with the bathwater...

why should we forego using markup that isn't supported in mainstream user
agents?  by such logic, no one should bother using LONGDESC, SCOPE, AXIS,
and any of the other elements and attributes that are defined for HTML 4x,
but which are either supported spottily, incompletely, inconsistently, or
not at all...

your point about the application of stylesheets to demarcate (visually or
aurally) that (a) this is an abbreviation, (b) this is an acronym, and (c)
that an expansion is available, is, however, well taken, and is a
compelling argument against jettisoning one or the other...

one might --  based on a visual or aural stylesheet, or via the use of
inline pseudo-elements -- care to expand or not expand text enclosed in
either the ACRONYM or ABBR tags, or allow one's user agent or adaptive
technology to do so either by default or when queried, or to compile a list
of abbreviations and/or acronyms and their expansions, but in order to
perform (or have one's software) perform any one (or any combination) of
the actions listed above, one first needs to _know_ that expansions have
been defined for the document currently being rendered...

finally, what constitutes an abbreviation and what constitutes an acronym
_is_ germane to the discussion, as they are not only very different things,
but pose different sets of problems for different groups of users...  the
number of potential users affected by use of ACRONYM and ABBR is quite
large, as they not only enhance accessibility, but are aids to non-native
speakers of the natural language declared for the page being rendered, as
well as general usability aids...
