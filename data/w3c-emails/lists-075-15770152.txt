From John Williams' column today at
http://www.BusinessWeek.Com/today.htm
about U.S. Senator Max Cleland (Dem - GA):

"Cleland is a strong proponent of Internet access for disabled people
and believes the federal government has a role in funding programs that
will assist in this cause."

Ending with a nice Helen Keller quote: Helen Keller was once asked, "Can
there be anything worse than losing your sight?" She replied, "Yes.
Losing your vision."

I'm sure all on this list will keep theirs.
