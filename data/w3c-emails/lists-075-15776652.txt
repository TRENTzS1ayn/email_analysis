Dear Gregory (et al.),

I am pleased to have my pages critiqued on this list.  It would be pretty
hypocritical of me to take insult!  This is just a rather long and somewhat
rambling defense slash explanation of choices made for the graphics.  I
welcome further comments.

I am greatly relieved that your graphic artist friend was not harder on my
page.  I am definitely NOT an artist, but did create the buttons in question
by hand.  Actually, I am more concerned with the quality of our main
"DORS/MSDE Seal", but that one was given to me!

The sites I link to did not give me the graphics, so I attempted to create
something using their established logos and color schemes.  I further
limited myself to the 216 "browser safe" color palette.  The standard button
size (88x31 pixel) does not give one much room to work, but I did my best.

The "Online Public Information Network" button has black text on a deep
blue/green, with something that could be imagined to be a sail boat up
against the A in SAILOR.  There is a much lighter 1-pixel outline around the
letters, so I think it is acceptable.  The color "teal" is not well
represented by Netscape's 216 6x6x6 model -- I only had two shades that I
thought were close.

MEC has a goldenrod (on white) cursive "Maryland" over (and in places, on
top of) "Electronic Capital".  MEC does not otherwise have a logo.  All
lettering is one-pixel wide, so it is admittedly a tough read.

There is no way text like "Maryland Technology Assistance Program" would fit
spelled out on a graphic of this size.  In truth, I don't think those four
words are very illuminating.  One still has to visit their site to figure
out what they are about.

Philosophically, I think the ALT content should parallel the IMG content.
If the graphic is a little cryptic, so should be the ALT text!  I am
grateful that TITLE gives me an appropriate place to add a little more
content.  Is it my fault that the current crop of browsers don't implement
this well?  Visually, the IMGs line up nicely and look like buttons.  I
wanted to try and convey this with the ALT content, hence my use of "Jump
to".  I will sometimes use ALT like "DORS Logo", but that is NOT what is
pictured in this case!

I think it is bad advice that TITLE content should be the same as ALT
content.  In that case, why not just argue to drop TITLE?

One could make the case that if I bother to link off site, I should endeavor
to provide some illumination about those links.  In truth, I snuck those
links onto our homepage out of respect to those programs, mostly as
courtesy.  The linked sites are programs that are only tangentially related
to our own.  They are barely mentioned elsewhere on our site (if at all) and
there is no discussion of them on the home page.  The linked sites are all
larger than us and Maryland-oriented -- probably visitors to our site know
of them already.  We do not have the "obligatory list of suggested links"
page, but I wanted to pay some homage to those programs.  The buttons on
bottom of the home page seems like the most attractive and least intrusive
(to our content) way to do this.  The bosses liked how the buttons dressed
up our page.  In short, if the MD TAP button graphic isn't sufficient, is a
better choice not to have the link at all?  We are not about to give them
MORE real-estate on OUR page!

Sincerely,
Bruce Bailey
