Greetings,

Here's another fun topic:

The International Lyrics Server is back, offering tens of thousands, soon 
to be hundreds of thousands of song lyrics to the world ... If you can 
access the Java applet used to display them.

Apparently to get around previous objections of copyright infringement, 
they have the lyric text appear in such a way that it refreshes 
periodically & cannot be printed out. This also means that I can only get 
the occasional scrap using JAWS3.5 and IE5.

Another version of the old problem of proprietary formats, publisher 
control, etc., but I would be interested if anyone has any comments on the 
site.

Btw, the light-dependent folks who alerted me to the new site also hate the 
applet.

Patrick
