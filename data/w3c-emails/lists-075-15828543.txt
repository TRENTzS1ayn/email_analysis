why?  the important piece of information to be conveyed here is the
destination of the hyperlink, not the actual content of the graphic --
that's what LONGDESC is for...  what would i gain from a hyperlink whose
hyperlink text is "MD TAP logo"?  that is extremely uninformative, from the
point of view of anyone accessing this page using a non-visual user agent,
regardless of their visual acuity...

PJ:
The visual image link is just as uninformative as alt="MD TAP logo".  So,
are you arguing that BOTH the visual image link and the alt=text should be
more informative?  That's fine, but they are equally accessible and equally
uninformative as is.  Beside improving the visual image and the alt=text to
be equally informative, the author also has the title=attribute and the
longdesc=attribute.
