Another possibility:

The alt for the image should be "MD TAP" (or spell out the acronym - but
that's a separate question). The title should be "MD TAP logo". The title of
the link element (the <a href...) should be the destination.

There is a question of whether or not that clearly identifies the target of
the link (to use current WCAG language). And a part of that might be whether
the logo alone, if it is not very informative, or obvious in the context,
satisfies the requirement for visual users.

  PJ:
  The visual image link is just as uninformative as alt="MD TAP logo".  So,
  are you arguing that BOTH the visual image link and the alt=text should be
  more informative?  That's fine, but they are equally accessible and equally
  uninformative as is.  Beside improving the visual image and the alt=text to
  be equally informative, the author also has the title=attribute and the
  longdesc=attribute.
