aloha, david!

with all due respect, i think it a worthy and worthwhile exchange, as 
evinced not only by the length of the threads, but by the spirited debate...

yes, dave, currently ABBR and ACRONYM are only accorded a P3 in the Web 
Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), but one of my particular bones of 
contention is that they have been accorded far too low a priority...

this thread started with a specific question about specific markup and with 
a response providing a validated example of how one might implement 
it...  yes, it is a P3, but don't P3 checkpoints deserve the same attention 
-- if an author is attempting to implement them -- that other, higher 
priority, checkpoints merit?

just because this issue bleeds over into questions of internationalization 
and general usability, does not mean that it ceases to become an 
accessibility issue...  what truly makes a mockery out of our mission, to 
borrow your term, is unwillingness to admit, accept, and exploit the 
inter-related nature of accessibility, internationalization, and 
usability...  our goal is ensuring the widest possible audience with access 
to content, and if an individual asks for clarification of a specific 
checkpoint that request should be honored...  what would truly undermine 
our efforts would be the banishing of  discussion of the implications of a 
P3 checkpoint that a number of posters to this list firmly believe _is_ an 
accessibility issue..
