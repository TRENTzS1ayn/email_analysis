Dear Group,

I would like to repeat my earlier request as to under what circumstances
(versions) does IE displays TITLE attributes for IMG.  IE 4.5 on the Mac is
one.  Is the problem that my TITLE is part of the A HREF and not the IMG?
(IE has displayed TITLE for the _text_ portion of an Anchor since at least
ver. 4.01).

I am hoping to get from this discussion advice to give a content provider
who decided to remove ALT content (from a graphically rich site) because she
was annoyed by the pop-up tool-tips behavior of IE.


Dear Gregory (and anyone else who wants to contribute),

Please give more concrete advice for my home page
(http://www.dors.state.md.us/).  Generally, you and I agree on what makes
good ALT content.  I believe you found most of my IMG code (including
several graphical links in the "This site has been designed... section) to
be acceptable.  It is the series of five "buttons" at the bottom of the page
that we disagree upon.  With all due respect, I don't think the comparison
with using "Magnifying Glass" instead of "Search" (for a search/find icon
that happened to look like a magnifying glass) is appropriate here.  That is
NOT my philosophy (and I think you know me well enough that you understand
that to be the case).

1)I expressed an intent that my ALT convey something similar to the visual
impression of button slash navigation bar.  Is this legitimate or should I
just give up that idea?

2)I think we agree that the ALT in question is no less (but no more)
helpful than the graphic.  Do you think that in general it is a good rule of
thumb to forego equivalence when ALT can be used instead to supplement
and/or improve upon the content of the graphic?

3)Please suggest specific TITLE and ALT content.  Do not tell me to make
them the same because I do not agree with that idea!  Do you think I should
use what I have for TITLE as ALT content, and _delete_ the TITLE attribute?

Thank you!
Bruce
