Lynn

what sorts of problems in particular do your target audience have - can you
give some examples?

I wondered if simplifying the language a bit and using styles in the text to
highlight would be helpful. The light blue on dark blue also seemed like a
choice that doesn't give a lot of contrast.

I like the use of CSS for layout. The page linearises well in a text-only
browser.

I'm looking forward to seeing it develop.

cheers

  So far, only a few pages have been developed, we are interested in comments
  about what is right and wrong about the design so far.

  Only the Module 1 and unit 1 links work as yet.
