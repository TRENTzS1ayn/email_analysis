You asked:

Well, I remember that being the consensus reached on the general IG list.
Perhaps my memory is faulty.  I could not find the old thread when I looked
for it.  I did not mean to imply that this piece of advice made its way into
any formal guidelines.

Should this distinction get kicked over to the GL list or is a general UA
issue that does not have much to do with accessibility?
