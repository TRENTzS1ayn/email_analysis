This behavior of MSIE/JFW, that it reads the title, not ALT,  is 
undesirable, right?

My understanding is that Title is what's supposed to pop up for sighted 
folks.  Therefore it should add to--not be redundant to the image.

For example, if there's a "contact us" button, it would be silly to 
redundantly pop up "contact us" for a sighted person.  It's more reasonable 
to pop up something that adds to what they are already reading, e.g.  "and 
we'll listen".

On the other hand, a blind user needs to hear what was on the button in the 
first place, not just the added info.  The blind user needs alt text saying 
"contact us", plus access to what's popped up to the sighted user, vx. "and 
we'll listen".

So JFW/ MSIE needs to give access to both ALT and title, not just what the 
sighted user sees.
