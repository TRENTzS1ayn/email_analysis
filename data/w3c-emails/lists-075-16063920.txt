Kynn,

What are you saying the purpose of a title other than the circular 
explanation that it's to

 > provide -- ta da -- a "title."

The HTML 4.01 spec http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/global.html#h-7.4.3 
doesn't define it.

I'm saying now matter how titles are rendered, it's frequently poor  style, 
for the title of an image to redundantly express what's in that 
image.  Therefore, it's not enough to make only the title available to a 
blind user.  You've got to make both ALT text and the Title 
available.  Does your definition of Title contradict that?

If  you agree with the bottom line, that both pieces of info need to 
available, then I'd consider that for all practical purposes we're in 
agreement.

However, you're right. I should have been more careful wording
"My understanding is that Title is what's supposed to pop up for sighted 
folks. "

I should have said

          visual browsers frequently display the title as a "tool tip" (a 
short message that appears when the pointing device pauses over an object).

That's a quote from the HTML 4.01 spec BTW.   <grin>
