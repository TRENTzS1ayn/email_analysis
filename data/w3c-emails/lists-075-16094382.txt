aloha, kynn!

in response to len, you wrote, quote:
Proper titling should be done despite whatever the user agents decide to 
do.  If there needs to be a specific TOOLTIP attribute,that might be the 
best approach for certain user agents, using extensible additions to XHTML.

or via an extension to CSS -- if you can define a cursor, why not a 
tooltip?  after all, they do have their uses -- even i can "see" that -- 
and it would be beneficial for them, and other mouse-over slash hovering 
events and alerts be promulgated uniformly and consistently, in whatever 
GUI environment the UA happens to be running, whenever the user cares to 
expose them -- especially if exposure is achievable in a device independent 
manner!

great idea, though, kynn!
