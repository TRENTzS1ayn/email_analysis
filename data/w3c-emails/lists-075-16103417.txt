This is an even better idea than what I suggested. :)

I think a combination of both -- CSS and XHTML -- can give a more
powerful set of tools for making tooltips than relying on the poor
"title" attribute which should be used, in my opinion, only to
provide something that someone would call a "reasonable" title
for the element in question!
