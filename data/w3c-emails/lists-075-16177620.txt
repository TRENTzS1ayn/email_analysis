I think the mechanism you are seeking is the one provided by the ruby
annotation element,a proposal being developed by the internationalisation
group, and in particular Masayasu Ishikawa. details at
http://www.w3.org/TR/ruby/

As for tooltip being a presentation method, it requires a very specific
interface to work, and should probably be an option that such a user agent
can set what things are presented as a tooltip.

  Yes, that sounds like a great idea. 'display: tooltip' perhaps? But there has to be a way to define *which* element it should be a tooltip for ...
  
  Hmm, perhaps using the parent element would work?
  
  <p>Neque porro quisquam est qui <em>dolorem <span class="footnote">(Ut aliquid ex ea commodi consequatur?)</span></em> ipsum quia dolor sit amet.
  
  with span.footnote { display: tooltip; width: 10em; height: auto; background: #F3F3BE; color: black; }
  
  "Ut aliquid ex ea commodi consequatur?" could now be displayed as a tooltip for the 'em' element (dolorem). This would of course not work with *empty* elements, e.g. 'img'.
