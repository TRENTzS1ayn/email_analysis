aloha, christopher!

you asked, quote
(b) if I include roman numerals in my text, will commonly used voice 
browsers/screen readers read them as the associated number or as the 
component letters? For example would a listener hear "Bogislav XIV" as 
"Bogislav the Fourteenth" or as "Bogislav EX-EYE-VEE"?
unquote

JFW 3.50.25 reads Bogislav XIV as "Bogislav ZIV"

Ivan IV is Ivan Eye Vee

in the past, when i have had to encode roman numerals, i have done so using 
something similar to:

George <ABBR title="the Second" lang="la">II</ABBR>
or
George <ABBR lang="la" title="the Third">III</ABBR>

but, with the state of today's technology, i still hear "George Two" and 
"George Three", as JFW does interpret double capital eyes as "two", and 
triple capital eyes as "three", but that's the extent of it's knowledge of 
roman numerals...

you also asked, quote:
Is there any difference in reading among:
Bogislav XIV
Bogislav XIVth
unquote

JFW reads them as:
Bogislav ZIV
Bogislav Zi V t h

you also asked, quote
Would <SPAN TITLE="the Fourteenth"> do anybody any good? Or even <ACRONYM 
TITLE="the Fourteenth">? (Yes, <ABBR> is actually correct, but I'm not even 
going to go there.)
unquote

for those using Graphical User Agents that expose titles as ToolTips, the 
supplemental information should be exposed when a user mouses-over the 
titled element...

and, when screen reader manufacturers allow users to pick and choose what 
sort of information they want exposed when reading web based documents, it 
will definitely help those speech users who care to avail themselves of the 
functionality...

i know i will,
gregory.
