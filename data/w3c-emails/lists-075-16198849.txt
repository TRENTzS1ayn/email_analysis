Just as a footnote, if someone really wanted Roman numerals spoken
correctly it
would be what the math books like to call a "trivial exercise" (i.e.,
conceptually easy but tedious) to define entries for most of them in the
screen-reader's pronunciation dictionary. Thus "XIV" = "fourteen", "LXIII" =
"sixty-three" etc.

The system would break down though for single Roman numerals, since no screen
reader alive can figure out if the I in "After Leopold I came to power" is a
pronoun or a numeral. ... So the markup could be handy if implemented.
