Good Day,

             My assistive technology column appears today under Daily 
Briefing on http://www.businessweek.com/today.htm. Its a review of a book 
written by great friend, former boss and mentor Frank G. Bowe. I would 
appreciate your comments.
              Last week's column on Senator Max Cleland produced more than 
450 e-mails. Thanks for your response.
              If you have any questions on assistive technology please e-mail 
them to me.
              John Williams
