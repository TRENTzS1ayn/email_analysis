Hi,

I can't remember if I ever sent this out.  It's an example of a form
with error messages.  The trick is that there are links between the
errors.  It actually is an example of an "electronic curb cut"
where the design was originally to help blind users to more
quickly correct errors on a form, but sighted users have also found
it helpful too.  The URL is:
