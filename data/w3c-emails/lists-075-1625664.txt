WAI Interest Group:

(September 20, 1999) W3C today published the "Accessibility Features of
SMIL" as a technical reference Note. It is available at
<http://www.w3.org/TR/SMIL-access>.

This note describes how to make multimedia presentations such as newscasts,
educational materials, or entertainment, that are written in SMIL,
accessible. The Note has been reviewed by the Education and Outreach
Working Group, the Protocols and Formats Working Group, and the
Synchronized Multimedia Working Group. The Note catalogs the accessibility
features of SMIL 1.0 in order to help authors create SMIL presentations
that meet the requirements of the "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
1.0" <http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT>. The Note also recommends
features that will increase the accessibility of SMIL players based on the
"User Agent Accessibility Guidelines" <http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-USERAGENT>
(still a Working Draft).

This Note is part of a series of Notes that WAI will publish to highlight
accessibility features of W3C specifications. The first Note of the series,
"Accessibility Features of CSS" was published June 16, 1999. Other W3C
Notes are available on the W3C Technical Reports page <http://www.w3.org/TR>.

Please feel free to share this information with organizations you think may
be interested in accessibility of multimedia on the Web.

Regards,

Judy
