Dear Group,

Maybe I missed class for this one...

Please explain:  When does (JavaScript) SCRIPT go in HEAD and when does it
belong in BODY?

The formal HTML specifications do not allow NOSCRIPT in HEAD!  (SCRIPT in
HEAD is fine though.)  How does one make such use of SCRIPT accessible then?

I am trying to construct some explicit advice for fixing:
