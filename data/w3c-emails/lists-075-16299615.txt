As a general rule of thumb, scripts within the BODY produce content ( document.write() ) or set up event handlers (BODY onLoad="onLoadHandler();"). The scripts in the HEADER define the functions and variables to be used (called) by those in the BODY, such a s function called onLoadHandler to be executed on load of the document. I'm simplifying, of course.

No need for NOSCRIPT in the head (unless you're writing content within the head with document.write() ? - unusual).

Hmm... the dropdown thing "if you're interested in..." looks like a dropdown menu but doesn't seem to be? Looks like it needs fixing even _with_ scripts; I find it very confusing. A NOSCRIPT would display the whole text instead of the dropdown, I guess. (If it's not intended as a menu, why not have plain text, without the need for a script?)

The links on the composite image in the middle would need ALT attributes at the least, probably echoing all of the text that is visible with a mousover. Without a script they would still function as links (if I understand the code correctly) so a NOSCRIPT is not needed for those.

Hope this helps,
Cheers,
