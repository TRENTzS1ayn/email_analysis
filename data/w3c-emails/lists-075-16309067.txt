My IPS is about to discontinue shell account access, and with it, support for
Lynx, which is my browser of choice for most things. I recall hearing about a
Dos-based version of Lynx that can be run on a Windows-based PC. Three
questions:

1. How does Dos Lynx compare with Unix Lynx?
2. Can the program be installed by a technophobe?
3. Where do you get it?
