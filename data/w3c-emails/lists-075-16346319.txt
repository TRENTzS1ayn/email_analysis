Don't know, I've never used the Unix version

There is a DOS version, but there is also a 32-bit Windows version; that's probably the one you want to get (see below)

Can you use WinZip? Then you can. All you need to do is unzip the archive in a directory (letting it cretae subdirectories but that's the default), then create a shortcut (the latter for convenience only - you can start it from Explorer)

>3. Where do you get it?

http://www.fdisk.com/doslynx/wlynx/
Windows: lynx_w32.zip
DOS: lynx_386.zip

 From the readme.txt:

The Win32 version will work on Win95 or WinNT using the standard winsock.
Win3.11 will NOT work -- not even with win32s and wolverine installed.
This is a console application meaning that it appears to run in a DOS box
within Windows, but it accesses the Windows network layer and other kernel
functions directly.
