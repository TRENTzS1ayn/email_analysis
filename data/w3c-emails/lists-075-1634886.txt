Dear friends and colleagues,

Would you like to know how to make your web sites accessible to more
people?  

Announcing MORSELS FROM THE EAGLE'S NEST published via email by
Soaring
Eagle Communications (http://www.eaglecom.bc.ca).

In its commitment to increase awareness and accessibility of
communication so that people with disabilities may fully participate
in
all facets of society, Soaring Eagle Communications specializes in
accessible online communications, making it possible for everyone to
use
the Web.

Consider these facts:

"There are 40 million people with disabilities in the United States
and
many of them have problems that keep them from using a carelessly
designed Web page.  This isn't because the techniques to make pages
disabled accessible aren't available, but rather it's because Web
designers don't think of the problems they may be creating." 
(Netscape
World, August 1996,
http://www.netscapeworld.com/netscapeworld/nw-08-1996/nw-08-bestpract.html)

"Approximately 2.3 million Canadians between 15 and 64 years of age
have
disabilities." 
(http://www.equalopportunity.on.ca/enggraf/ability/myth.html)

"Some 240,000 Canadians -- one in every 100 -- are low-visioned.  Some
70,000 of them (25 percent) are in the "legally blind" category."
(The Low Vision Association, http://www.lowvision.on.ca/p52.html)

Seniors - many with failing eyesight and dexterity - is the fastest
group getting online.

In the US alone, individuals with disabilities have a combined income
of
nearly $700 billion.  Of that figure, $175 billion is discretionary
income.
(President's Committee on Employment of people with disabilities)

Can you afford to exclude these many from your sites?

MORSELS FROM THE EAGLE'S NEST provides tips on making web sites for
