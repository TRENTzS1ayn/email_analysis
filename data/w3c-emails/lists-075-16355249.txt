There are two versions to consider. One is truly DOS-based - you can run it on, say, an old 386/486 running DOS. The other is a Win32 version. You can run it on Windows 95/98/NT, but it's still a text-mode program. The Win32 version, at least, compares quite well with the Unix version. This is NOT the old DOSLynx, which had a separate code base and lacked many of the Unix features.

Both can be obtained at:

My IPS is about to discontinue shell account access, and with it, support for
Lynx, which is my browser of choice for most things. I recall hearing about a
Dos-based version of Lynx that can be run on a Windows-based PC. Three
questions:

1. How does Dos Lynx compare with Unix Lynx?
2. Can the program be installed by a technophobe?
3. Where do you get it?
