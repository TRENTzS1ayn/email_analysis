 Softquad created HotMetal5 which had an interface that allowed a user
to create an accessible web page.  The latest version HotMetal6 and
the new XML editor do not mention these attributes on the Softquad web
site.  Does anyone know if Softquad is still creating products that
support accommodations for individuals with disabilities?
