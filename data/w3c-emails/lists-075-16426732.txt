I should hope not! I *use* the tooltips. If I came across a page that had ALT attributes and managed to use JavaScript to suppress the tooltips, I'd immediately construct a filter for my trusted Proxomitron (an HTML/JavaScript filter program that functions as a local proxy) to suppress that suppressing JavaScript so no other site could do that to me again. ;-)

Seriously though, I don't think it's possible.

Nice!
But it's still a tradeoff between downloading extra bytes (which would be ignored) and an extra connect. Which is more efficient? I have no idea. And you have two pages to maintain (or generate) instead of one.
