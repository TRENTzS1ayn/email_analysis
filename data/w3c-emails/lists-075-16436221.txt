That handles your question 1-3, I hope someone else can fill in the details 
on the pure DOS version.

check out Rene Ludwig's Lynx_Kit, available from:
http://rene.simplenet.com/download/lynx_kit.exe

The lynx_kit contains a true DOS port of Lynx 2.8.1 in a self-extracting 
file, along with a PPP packet driver, so that you can access the internet 
via a PPP account from within DOS. It requires a 386 or faster processor.

Rene also has an archive of other handy DOS Internet utilities at:
http://rene.simplenet.com/intool-e.htm

if you are looking for a DOS port that will work on a 286, then you need to 
try Bobcat, information about which can be found at either:
http://www.hicom.net/~oedipus/blind.html#bob
or http://www.hicom.net/~oedipus/blind.html#bob

Bobcat can be downloaded from:
http://www.fdisk.com/doslynx/bobcats/

as a last resort, one could always telnet to a public version of lynx, a 
list of which can be found at:
http://www.hicom.net/~oedipus/weave.html#telnet
but there are obvious limitations on what one can and cannot do using lynx 
via telnet....
