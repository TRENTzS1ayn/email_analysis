I am so frustrated by the way Netscape renders web pages.  I still cannot
understand why pages can be brought up in Explorer, Opera and some other
browsers and look wonderful!  Yet Netscape does a hack job of them when  it
brings the same page(s) up.  I hate the fact that we have to code for
Netscape as if it were a prima donna.  Just my thoughts!
