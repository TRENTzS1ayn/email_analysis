Place options at end of code?

Thanks David,

I am in the process of creating something simialar and considering the
problems.

One is that one wants to provide a scale of hidden options that need to be
available, but not all the time.
It is an essential tool for me as the page needs to be configurable, and our
clients in the main cannot deal with confusion.

Your attachment puts this well.
However it is unacceptable if the screen reader picks all the options up
inline.

Is it possible to put the options at the end of the code and have the css
place them on the page?
Would this work to solve your concerns?
