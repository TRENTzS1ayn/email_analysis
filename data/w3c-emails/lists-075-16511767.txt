The "sliding" menu system is a very sharp tool, as it
can provide a site's entire navigation system without
taking up any screen real estate. It can also be
generated dynamically, so main site sections are
always in the menu and secondary menu systems are
built dynamically as one moves through the site.

Unfortunately, I've tried Jay's suggestion of moving
navigation to the bottom of the code and using
positioning to keep it at the top. While that's a very
simple thing to do - if you're not too careful with
Netscape because it will just not work at times in
Netscape - screen readers, in my experience, read the
page as it is rendered in the browser and not
according to its placement in the code.

I've run into that numerous times, and have even tried
including (Server Side Include) the file last in the
include files I'm calling. Again - the screen reader
reads the page as it's rendered.
