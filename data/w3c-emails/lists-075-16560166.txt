Here are some more sites to check out.  The frames aren't named but the
NOFRAMES content is there.

frame are broken)

  Hi All.
  
  I find this thread on accessibility of FRAMES very interesting as a
  user-agent developer.  We have just recently enhanced our product, a
  telephone-based browser, to support frames, but have been disappointed by
  the marginal increase in accessibility.  We have observed as Martin
  McCormick, that many FRAMES are either labeled poorly or not at all.  I
  have yet to run into a site that has anything in the NOFRAMES section other
  than a "raspberry" (sorry, but you lose) or a link to upgrade.  To me, this
  is the height of laziness in web design -- hard is it to throw your main
  index link and perhaps a few more in between two tags?
  
  We currently support a 'deep link', that may be stored for later sessions,
  but someone may not get that far if they can't even navigate the initial
  FRAMESET properly.  We would be happy to modify our browser with either a
  setting that turns off frames or perhaps even better, chooses the NOFRAMES
  option automatically if available -- if, we thought there was any NOFRAMES
  content out there.  Does anyone know of a site that actually implements
  NOFRAMES?

  aloha, patrick!
  
  you asked:
  
  quote
  As a semi-tangent, is there a way to force IE or Netscape to display a
  NOFRAMES section of a site?
  unquote
  
  no, as far as i am aware, the only GUI browser that will allow you turn off
  
  support for frames, so as to expose the content of the NOFRAMES is Opera-- 
  i'd recommend you download a copy from:
  http://www.operasoft.com/download.html
  
  and try it....
  
  you also asked:
  
  quote
  I'm asking out of theoretical curiosity. If someone designed a functional 
  NOFRAMES section conveying all the information of the frames page, would an
  
  IE/Nets user be stuck with the framey version?
  unquote
  
  unfortunately, the way things stand today, the IE or NS user would have no 
  choice but to use the FRAMESET
