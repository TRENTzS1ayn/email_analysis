Bruce, 

It's spelled out pretty clearly at
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/Overview.html#Uselist> 
-- "Don't cc the WAI IG list with messages you are sending to other
organizations."

If you have a letter that you think is important for WAI IG to see, then
you can send a separate copy to WAI IG -- but note also at
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/Overview.html#Uselist> 
-- "This is a large list. Keep your comments brief and to the point."
I would not want people to just use this as a place to archive materials,
however.

Again, we get heavy use on this list, so I appreciate everyone's
cooperation in avoiding cross-postings.

Regards,

- Judy
