One of the reasons for this is that when someone does a "reply
all" to a message, they may hit the WAI IG list too -- and also
there's the possibility for confusion, about why the WAI IG
list was included at all.  Someone may think that because you
included the list, *you* are speaking for the W3C, the WAI, or
the IG, and may take your comments to be "official."

Might be better just to stick your letter up on a web site and
refer the list to the URI.
