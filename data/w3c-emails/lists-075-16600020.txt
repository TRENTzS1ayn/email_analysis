Hi all.  I've received a couple of private messages concerning my
posting
last week about the slicing menus that seemed to use cascading style
sheets
to control content in addition to display style.  The site concerning
me is
behind our corporate firewall and is therefore not available for me to
point
you all to.  However, I've discovered that the scripts in use seem to
come
from something called the "DynAPI Project" at
http://www.dansteinman.com/dynapi/.  According to this web site a new
set of
scripts appears to be in the works.  I note that there is a discussion
thread on this site concerning the new betas, and I think I'll try
writing
the developer to see if he has done any investigations into
accessibility of
the library.  I think we'd be making a step forward if those
developing
popular scripting and other libraries could be sensitized to the
concept of
accessibility.

Cheers,
Jerry
