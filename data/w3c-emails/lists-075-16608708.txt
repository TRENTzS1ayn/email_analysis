Editorial

Access to the built environment, to information, culture and to all
aspects
of our communities is a basic human right. Access allows us to
contribute to
society's diversity. Access enriches everyone.

The best way of ensuring access is through Universal Design, that is,
planning, building and maintaining our environment for the needs of
all
citizens, thus making them feel welcome as integral parts of the whole
and
encouraging them to participate in all of society on equal terms.

Universal Design minimizes the dependency of people with disability on
others - a dependency that is not inherent in the nature of their
disability
but imposed on them by the cumulative countless actions and omissions
of
generations of policymakers, planners, builders and designers.
Universal
Design is a prerequisite for Independent Living, for living in the
community
with equal opportunities, self-determination and self-respect.

The Institute on Independent Living is committed to compiling a
collection
of key documents on Universal Design as part of its full-text online
library. Below, we draw your attention to resources which you might
find
useful in your work.  But we also need to ask you for your help.
Please,
assist us with your expertise in this area and tell us which documents
would
improve the usefulness of our collection.

Adolf D. Ratzka, Ph.D.
Director, Institute on Independent Living

This Month's Columnist
http://www.independentliving.org/column
**************************************************

Regular visitors to the website will have noticed our latest feature:
a
monthly columnist.  We will present a number of internationally
renowned
leaders in the disability movement, who will write engaging articles
for the
Institute.  Karen Stone introduced this feature and the millennium
with her
retrospective of the past century from a disability perspective
(http://www.independentliving.org/column/stone1_99.html)

Steven E. Brown follows our theme of universal design with his
article, What
Happened To Architectural Accessibility?
(http://www.independentliving.org/column/brown1_00.html)

All columns will be archived at:

**************************************************
Independent Living Virtual Library - Universal Design
http://www.independentliving.org/Library/Library_Contents1.html
**************************************************

Under the sub-heading "Universal Design" in our on-line Library,
you'll find
hundreds of texts on Accessibility Resources, Country Profiles,
Economics of
Access, Guidelines, Housing, Legislation, and Transportation.

Here are just a few titles:

Mobility for All
http://www.independentliving.org/Mobility/index.html
While access for people with disabilities is poor in most
industrialized
countries, it is even worse in developing contries. This publication
presents simple and cost-effective design solutions for our public
transport and access needs around the world: busses, cabs, bus stops,
streets and pathways including a list of organizations and resources
for
accessible transportation.
The Institute is proud to be the only website granted permission to
re-print
this publication.  The Spanish translation is forthcoming.

Toolbox: A guide for making a disability program in your local
community
http://www.independentliving.org/LibArt/advocacy/konkkol1.html
In many parts of the world laws and regulations have been drafted to
improve
the life of disabled people. However, in all societies the situation
of
disabled people is still worse than that of non-disabled people.  The
Toolbox assists you in identifying your community's shortcomings and
in
advocating for change using international documents, political support
and
the strength that comes from organizing
the disability community.  Translations in Russian, Slovakian and
Swedish
are forthcoming.

Do "assistive devices" really assist disabled people?
http://www.independentliving.org/LibArt/AssistiveDev.html
Assistive devices are to ensure that people with disabilities are
active in
society. But what prevents them from assisting disabled people to be
independent?  This article discusses: availability, appropriateness,
affordability, and maintenance.

A basic guide to the EU bus and coach directive
http://www.independentliving.org/LibArt/eubus.html
On March 7th the European Union member states will meet to discuss the
technical details of the forthcoming buses directive.  While the
article
provides background on the current battle for accessible buses and
coaches
in Europe, the arguments of the disability lobby can be of interest to
groups
and agencies also outside of Europe.

United Nations Standard Rules: Accessibility
http://www.independentliving.org/STANDARDRULES/StandardRules2.html#anchor137
0198
Although the United Nations Standard Rules imply no legally binding
responsibility, it has become an important instrument in the hands of
the
disability community to demand full access as a human right.  Read
Rule
number 5 on Accessibility as a target area for equal participation.

Portuguese Parliament promotes Web Accessibility
http://www.independentliving.org/LibArt/portweb.html
Portugal became the fourth country in the world to officially promote
web
accessibility for people with disabilities, after the United States,
Australia and Canada. These measures are included in the
implementation plan
for the National Initiative for Citizens with Special Needs in the
Information Society.

For more information about web accessibility, visit the World Wide Web
- Web
Accessibility Initiative (W3C-WAI) at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/

achievements, needs and plans in our full-text virtual Library. To
