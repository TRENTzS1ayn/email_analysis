Perhaps we need a Web_Access_Media_Coverage_Monitoring (WAMCM) listserv 
(snappier titles gratefully accepted). I have found the opinion pieces 
posted to the list to be very useful in formulating my own accessibility 
arguments, but I understand the reasons for excluding these items from WAI-IG.

I haven't been on the Education & Outreach list. Are discussions of 
strategy & useful lines of argument appropriate there (again excluding 
full-scale cross-posts)?
