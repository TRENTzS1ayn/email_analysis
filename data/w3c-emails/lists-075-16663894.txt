I just wanted you all to know that I've joined this list, figuring that it
is peopled by folks who know about W3C recommendations and are generally
savvy about modern web programming.  Thanks to those who passed my prior
messages to this list and to those who've already corresponded with me about
the puzzling problem of screen readers and pull-down/sliding/whatever menus
on web pages.

Cheers,
Jerry Weichbrodt
