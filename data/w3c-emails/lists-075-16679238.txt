Patrick:

I've been thinking about ways to split off different areas of discussion
the WAI Interest Group list, and this is an interesting possibility.

The Education & Outreach mailing list is more focused on development of
specific E/O deliverables, such as curricula, reference pages, etc., and
that mailing list doesn't necessarily include the people who catch the
press coverage. (W3C monitors press coverage on topics related to W3C work;
however the WAI IG list is generally faster at spotting the articles, and
inaccuracies in some of the articles.)

So, two possibilities: 
(1) start a separate WAMCM mailing list as Patrick proposes; or, 
(2) invite people to post the articles that they notice onto the EOWG
(Education & Outreach Working Group) list, and W3C staff and/or EOWG
members can respond as appropriate. The EOWG list, by the way, is publicly
viewable from the EOWG home page <http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO>, and accepts
public postings.

Thoughts?
