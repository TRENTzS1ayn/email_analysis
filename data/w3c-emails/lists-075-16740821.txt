Place
-------------------------------------------------------

IID is organizing the 1st Inter-American Dialog on Disability and 
Development, to be held in August 26-27, 2000, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, as 
part of the official calendar of activities of the IXX World Congress of

Goal
-------------------------------------------------------

The main goal of the event is to bring together government agencies, consumer 
organizations and international agencies that operate in the Inter-American 
region to evaluate existing programs/initiatives and to develop strategies to 
increase cooperation for the next 10 years. Please find below some more 
details on the event.



Why attend?
-------------------------------------------------------

The reasons why agencies should attend this meeting are:

1- Development agencies normally have sparse information on 
activities/organizations on disability issues in Latin America. Because of 
this fact, some opportunities for cooperation have been missed;

2- There have been no opportunities for a dialog involving all the actors in 
disability and development programs in the field;

3- Very few meetings on the topic have been held in developing countries, 
especially in Latin America. Taking into consideration the unique opportunity 
of the RI2000 this is a unique occasion to establish a productive dialog and 
new partnerships involving a number of key organizations from the region and 
also those groups, which operate globally.

4- Having the meeting combined with such a significant international meeting 
(RI2000), where delegations of more than 100 countries will be attending 
(3000-4000 participants are expected) it's a strategy than can benefit all:

??   International agencies can benefit from the opportunity to learn from the 
whole conference and to establish new partnerships;
??   Many of the invited agencies are already enrolled in activities during 
the RI2000;
??   IID is a part of the RI2000 organizing and scientific committees and 
would like to use the opportunity of having such a selected group of 
potential speakers to involve them with other development related activities 
also in the RI2000;
??   This approach could prove cost beneficial to your organization as you 
will be able to make many linkages and connections.

America as well as international development agencies such as:

What is the IID 
-------------------------------------------------------

The Inter-American Institute on Disability (IID) is a non-profit entity, 
founded and managed by disabled people and their allies, to empower people 
with all kinds of disabilities and their families in the Inter-American 
region, and also in Spanish and Portuguese speaking countries of Europe and 
Africa. 

The purpose of the Institute is to interface between public and private 
organizations and service providers, stimulating international and 
multi-cultural cooperation and awareness for disability development in the 
Inter-American Region as a whole. 

IID's approach includes, but is not limited to: 

1) the dissemination of information on disability and;
2) the fostering of cooperation between international, regional and local 
governmental and non-governmental entities working with disability.  

With its central office located in Washington, DC, USA, the Institute 
maintains on-going contact with Inter-American bodies located in the same 
area, such as World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, Organization of 
the American States, among others. 

The IID Regional Office for Latin America is located in Rio de Janeiro, 
Brazil, and its mission is to develop and to promote IID's activities within 
the region.

Other than its Central and Regional Offices the Institute will be creating 
branches and/or country representation (in partnership with local entities) 
in the related sub-regions: Andean Region, Central America, Southern Cone, 
Europe, Africa.

The IID is initially developing communications support and public information 
activities that aim to build greater awareness and understanding of the 
situation of disabled people in the target region.

Among its current activities, IID produces an on-line newsletter, in Spanish, 
Portuguese and English, on relevant information for its network on disability 
issues, distributed through the Internet to almost 15000 people, including 
direct subscribers and forwarded messages to several other listservs.

The Institute acts directly as a contractor and broker (training, project 
development...) for government, service providers and the population of 
people with disabilities, and also provides support, making subsidies 
available to other entities and service providers, trends analysis, opening 
new communication channels, enabling partnerships and promoting new efforts. 

Economic development activities, such as micro-credit loans for people with 
disabilities are part of the agenda of the IID.


Examples of current projects of IID, 
in collaboration with organizations in the Region:
-------------------------------------------------------

??   DisabilityWorld (www.disabilityworld.org)

DisabilityWorld is a new e-zine dedicated to advancing an exchange of 
information and research about the international disability rights and 
independent living movement.  The Webzine is the heart of a larger project, 
IDEAS for the New Millennium, funded in 1999 by the U.S. National Institute 
on Disability & Rehabilitation Research as a five-year project. 

The IDEAS project, headed by the World Institute on Disability (WID) based in 
Oakland, California, is being conducted as a collaborative effort with the 
participation of other U.S. based disability groups: 
??   the Independent Living Research Unit (ILRU) of The Institute for 
Rehabilitation Research, based in Houston, Texas; 
??   Rehabilitation International (RI), based in New York, New York; 
??   Whirlwind Wheelchair International (WWI), based in Berkeley, California, 
and 
??   the Inter-American Institute on Disability(IID), based in Washington, 
D.C. 

The IDEAS project leaders selected five main content areas to track during 
the five-year period: independent living (WID); employment (ILRU); media 
(RI); technology & accessibility (WWI); and governance (WID). 

The IID, which is also a co-editor of the e-zine, will be responsible for 
information on these topics in the Spanish language and from Latin America. 
The crosscutting topic of disabled women's activities in these five areas 
will be reported. Initiatives benefiting disabled children and youth will 
also be covered. 

For the first couple years of the project, we will concentrate on collecting 
and analyzing information on the following 10 countries where we know there 
is significant activity in the five content areas: Britain, Germany and 
Russia; India, Japan and New Zealand; Brazil and Nicaragua; South Africa and 
Uganda. 


??   I.T.: Employment for People with Disabilities

The Trust for the Americas, a non-profit organization affiliated with the 
Organization of American States through its Inter-American Agency for 
Cooperation and Development (IACD), in partnership with the Inter-American 
Institute on Disability (IID), received awards from the World Bank's infoDev 
and Development Marketplace for its Net Corps Americas project "I.T.: 
Employment for People with Disabilities." (info: 
www.developmentmarketplace.org)

This project will send high-tech volunteers to Central America to train 
people with disabilities to use the new information technologies and it is 
the first step by The Trust for the Americas to implement the Inter-American 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Persons 
with Disabilities, adopted by the OAS at its General Assembly in 1999. The 
project was awarded a total of $139,000 - $89,000 from the Development 
Marketplace and $50,000 from infoDev. 

The goal of the Development Marketplace's competition is to foster innovative 
ideas in the development community. For its part, infoDev is a global grant 
program managed by the World Bank that aims to address obstacles facing 
developing countries in an increasingly information-driven world economy. 

Approximately three hundred finalists, out of some 1,500 proposals, 
participated in the two-day competition at the World Bank. Forty-five were 
selected to receive the Development Marketplace Award and two received the 
infoDev award.
