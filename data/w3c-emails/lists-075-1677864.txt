below are three urls which sem to me to blend the os and the web. 
this is a scary thought.  this means, that authoring agents, user
agents, and coding standards are going to have to some how blend as
they currently don't have to.
microsoft has:
http://www.microsoft.com/vizact/home.htm

microsoft and others have:
http://www.desktop.com
and then there is:
http://www.mywebos.com
which seems possibly quite powerful.
any thoughts?
