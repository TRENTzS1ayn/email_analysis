true but then the question arrises as to what we deliver it on and
from what I've seen of the current crop of delivery platforms for this
type of thing, there doesn't seem to be much hope.  I'm the eternal
optimist but here as well as in some other arenas, just as we are
about to catch up, it seems as though the proverbial rug will be puled
out from under us.  How long will it take to get access up to speed on
this vursus how long it will take for it to proppagate?

These are things I have concern about.  Not, can it be accessible? 
What will the cost be in dollars and lost potential while its access
evolves.  Perhaps this is a paradigm where providing access can be
done early and often.  I only know that as this prolfferates, we are
in for a bumpy ride.

Neither case has inherently better conditions for accessibility as far as I can see.  What is a potential problem is the "dynamic document" metaphor - this would really make things difficult for *current* screen readers.  Then again, it's not a question of dynamic vs. static either.  It's a deeper question again.  If dynamic documents do become the dominant metaphor, this just means accessibility standards for this model need  to be created.
