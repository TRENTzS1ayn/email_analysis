As a basic principle, accessibility which is added on afterwards is generaly
more expensive, and further behind, than accessibility which is designed in
from the start, and keeps being a design criterion.

The way I think of it is that accessibility is a first-class technical
problem. The purpose of a communication medium is to get information from
person to person, and if there is a reason why that doesn't work, whether it
is becuase the bits get lost in the network, or two systems can't
interoperate (and this applies to a word processor unable to read a different
format and to a braille line unable to present the information in a document)
then the medium doesn't work. The challenge is twofold. First, designers need
to take this understanding on board. Second, they need to keep it on board,
and keep thinking about it, especially where they are trying to make an
optimisation. Applying the "it'll work 90% of the time, or 99% of the time"
approach to justifying a deviation from proper design practice is the warning
bell, but it must be heeded if accessibility is going to be a fundamental
feature of specifications or systems.

  These are things I have concern about.  Not, can it be accessible? 
  What will the cost be in dollars and lost potential while its access
  evolves.  Perhaps this is a paradigm where providing access can be
  done early and often.  I only know that as this prolfferates, we are
  in for a bumpy ride.

Neither case has inherently better conditions for accessibility as far as I can see.  What is a potential problem is the "dynamic document" metaphor - this would really make things difficult for *current* screen readers.  Then again, it's not a question of dynamic vs. static either.  It's a deeper question again.  If dynamic documents do become the dominant metaphor, this just means accessibility standards for this model need  to be created.
