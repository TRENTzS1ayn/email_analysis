Nobody has been able to hack because the server kept crashing. The most 
secure server on the market today is WebStar. They made the same offer and no 
one has come close.
The US Army switched to WebStar and the other armed forces in the US are 
reviewing and seriously considering it. I have seen it in action and I must 
agree - pretty darn good server.
