Hi All,

Most of the time, use of alt tags for graphics on web pages is thought
of
as something that's only for those of us who are blind.  Below is part
of a
Wired News review of the newest version of Dragon System's Naturally
Speaking.  As the comments illustrate, alt tags can also help people
who
use voice input to navigate the internet.  The full review can be
found at:

I tried using Dragon for email using Microsoft Outlook 98, and for Net
surfing with Microsoft Internet Explorer 5. These are the optimal
programs
to use, according to Dragon. 

Surfing the Web is slow, but promising. Users can use commands like
"go to
address" followed by "www-dot-wired-dot-com" to visit different sites. 

Text links are easy to jump to -- the user just says "click" and then
the
name of the link. But it's tougher to click on search buttons or check
the
boxes in user surveys. Users can say something like, "click image," to
select the first image on the page, and then "next," to go to the next
one. 

That's a lot of "nexts" if you're shooting for the bottom of the page. 

Not all Web pages are speech-enabled -- which would allow them to
conform
to certain guidelines that make them work best with voice recognition
software. 

Dragon Systems' manager of technical support Kevin Gervais said it's
difficult for the software to recognize things like a GIF posing as a
search button.
