Actually the way to do this in HTML is to use the OBJECT element, with a
cascade that allows you to put something more useful than a simpe alt
element.

In fact a SMIL presentation is probably more accessible than flash - there
are several players, including open-source stuff and the Real Networks G2
player. But you can put that into an object cascade along with the flash
version, a quicktime movie (there are circumstances where that is a good
alternative) and a number of other versions...

  i was thinking another way to make Macromedia Flash Accessible for those who
  do not want to download the software.  Seems there is a way to make an image
  display if you do not have the plug-in.  Of course, if you have an image
  then we can have an ALT tag, where we can describe the visual presentation.
  
  comments?
