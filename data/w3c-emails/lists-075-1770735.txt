   In any accessible design considerations, the abstract format used is really not the issue, but rathter, how, *precisely*, is it coded.
 
Since the actual code of the form is not given, there is no way to give any credible answer.  Judging solely from the outline, I don't foresee any problems at all.

This seems to imply there is a perceived need to move the focus to the page returned.  Again, unless there is something in the code that would make this necessary, I don't understand the question.  If the page is returned, and it is not in a frame, which must be the case since it is a frameless interface, there should be no problem.
If I had the code, I could give more useful comments.
