Dan,

As Steven McCaffrey said, it is a lot easier to help you with specifics in
hand.  But your actual drafts deserve a little privacy; more than what
these email lists afford.  I suggest you follow up with Steven or David to
organize a small lightweight review group for private review of your early
sketches.  Then bring the prototype site back later for public review
before you consider it final.

In addition there are some detailed comments interleaved below.

By this I assume you mean that it is pure HTML; no scripting involved.

The tabbing generally covers links as well as form controls, so you are OK
as far as text links at the foot for next page are concerned.  But note the
guideline requiring informative link text.  No "click here," please.

This navbar should be skippable.  See

more.

Next/Previous buttons should not be a problem if you give them good ALT text.

You should consider dropping the next-hit, previous-hit links.  This is a
good point for user testing.  They may get in the way more than they help,
at least in eyes-free mode.

In the follow-up (private?) discussion, you will need to clarify the
