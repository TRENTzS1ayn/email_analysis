WAI Interest Group:

Reminder! The Last Call for the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines
will close next Monday, October 4, 1999. We urge you to review and comment
on the guidelines before that time.

The message at
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/1999JulSep/0399.html>
explains where to send comments. The document to review is at
<http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-AUTOOLS-19990903/>.

A few things about this review:

1. No amount of after-the-fact comment can make up for not having commented
on the guidelines when there was an opportunity to do so. We expect this to
be the last opportunity for public comment before these go for W3C Member
review on whether they become a W3C Recommendation. Do you see any problems
in these guidelines that would bother you if they became a final
Recommendation? Do you think they're good? Needed?

2. You do not need to be an expert in authoring tool development to comment
on these guidelines, only someone who is interested in ensuring that in the
future there are more authoring tools that support the creation of
accessible content and that are accessible. Most of the people on the WAI
Interest Group list fit this description. Will these guidelines address the
problems in authoring tools that this list so frequently discusses?

3. The document isn't that long, and most people find it pretty
understandable. If you can set aside an hour for this, you should be able
to get through it, although more is better. 

4. If you can turn some of the list-discussion energy into also commenting
on the Techniques document
<http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-AUTOOLS-TECHS-19990903/>, the Authoring Tool
Guidelines Working Group would really appreciate that. 

If you had previously forwarded the last call review request to another
mailing list, please feel free to also forward this reminder. 

Thank you!

- Judy
