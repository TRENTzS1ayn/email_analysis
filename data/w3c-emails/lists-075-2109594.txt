pardon me, but I don't think anyone said one could learn JAWS and MSIE in
one fell swoop.

You are creating a straw doll and then congratulating yourself for smashing
him up (forgive me for being so harsh here).

Yes, computer support-wise, to leave out training for any approved/mandated
software would be ludicrous.  (Yes, I know horrible anecdotes will pour
forth saying this happens all the time.  However, my point is not saying
that bad computer support or inaccessibility does or does not occur -- only
that approved/mandated software does not equate to inaccessibility.)
However, I don't find it unreasonable for a company to establish a JAWS/MSIE
software combo as supported software and then provide training/support for
any user who would need to use JAWS and MSIE.

Once again, I realize there are exceptions to the rule, and there may be a
legitimate need for the employee to use an alternative -- and we could
discuss these hypotheticals all day and go round in circles.  Good policies
incorporate exceptions to the rule.  From a computer support issue, it is
much easier to provide support to the exceptions to the rule than to have a
wide open standing policy where everything is allowed.

Once again, I fear we are confusing matters by attempting to mandate the
allocation of resources and not the outcome of the overall policy, which
should be that an accessible environment be present.
