This is really off-topic for this list, but it seems some issues should
be clarified ...

Right.

To clarify: numeric character references should work regardless of
character encoding.  &#960; SHALL be interpreted as "GREEK SMALL
LETTER PI" even if the document is encoded in US-ASCII (or whatever).
Indeed there are some user agents which incorrectly treat NCRs
differently depending on character encoding, but please note that
such behavior is non-conforming.

Some pre-XML browsers support hexadecimal numeric character references,
sush as Alis Technologies' Tango browser.  Tango does display &#x3c0;
as "GREEK SMALL LETTER PI".
