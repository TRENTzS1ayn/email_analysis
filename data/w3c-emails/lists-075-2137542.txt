Hi, Charles

I'm not quite sure what your point is.  Issues of interaction via
web technology will be coming more to the forefront as recognition
of the benefits becomes more common.  People like interaction.
They learn better.  It's more interesting and fun.

I haven't heard of people doing much research on how interaction on web
pages can improve accessibility.  As I've been watching blind people
using web pages, a common problem I've seen is getting a sense of
context of the page.  (It's not that dissimilar to what a blind person
has to do when moving into a new office or bedroom.)  What would be
helpful in web page interaction for long distance learning (or other
situations) is having a key that the blind person hits and a box pops up
giving a quick explanation of the purpose of the page in the course
along with any special aspects about the page.  (Current software
technology has a hard time recognizing purposes of pages.)

Again, this technique falls outside of interoperability, but sure would
make it easier for blind users.

Scott

PS  If interoperability is such an important issue, why doesn't W3C
just say all browsers should work the same?  (There would be the
nagging real world business issues of product differentiation
and browser improvement.)
