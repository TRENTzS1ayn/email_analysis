On the one hand, I agree that there's lots of interaction on the web that's
worthless or less than worthless to disabled and non-disabled people alike.

But there are cases where the benefits of interaction are clear.  Some
examples just off the top of my head...

1. An animated simulation of a physical system with parameters that can be
instantly changed to see their effects on the output.

2. A spreadsheet that can be sorted on different columns.

3. A 3-D molecular model that can be rotated into different views.

It's not easy to make these accessible at all. We've got to look at Scott's
question in this context.    If an instructor has managed to make these
accessible on a single configuration, do we complain if he or she hasn't
made it accessible across all configurations... something which may be
difficult or impossible in practice or even in principle?  This is the type
of situation he's talking about after all.
