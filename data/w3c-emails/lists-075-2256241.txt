Yes.  The behavior nonetheless exists - Netscape 4 (4.0 on Macintosh and
4.something on Solaris) is where I have encountered this.  MSIE on Windows
behaves properly; I don't know about on Macintosh.  Lynx, of course,
performs properly.

Designing a Web page based on SHALL is a fun exercise, but not very useful.
WILL is the relevant word for Joyce's question.

Tango added that feature after the XML WG developed the &#x convention.  I
didn't say that only XML browsers supported it, but that only browsers
developed after XML did.  Supporting something before it exists is
difficult.
