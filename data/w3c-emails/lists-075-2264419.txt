Hi, Charles

If you forgive me, your analysis is missing a point.  I've been using a
very rough efficiency analysis method of keypress counting.  In many
cases, using a key to trigger an explanation is more efficient than
using a link.  (It's something that sighted people can overlook.)  How
many keystrokes would it take a blind person to find and activate the
link?  It depends on where the link is and where the blind user is
focused.  However, in all most all instances, by the time the blind user
gets to the link and activates it, the number of keypresses is greater
than the one used to pop up a window with the information.  Also, since
the targetted user is blind, the issues of font size, style, etc,
aren't important so there's little benefit to using another web page.

The browser is based on interactivity.  The trick is to use the
interactivity to benefit the user without being intrusive.  It's kind of
what I tell the students I work with that a good interface is like a
good butler.  The butler helps you perform the tasks you want and can
often anticipate your needs while at the same time being as minimally
intrusive with few demands.
