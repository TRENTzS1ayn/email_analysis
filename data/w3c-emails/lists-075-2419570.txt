David,
With your example, you had purchased a software PACKAGE (which happened to 
include hard copy documentation).  Kynn's example was just for a textbook 
(which happened to be about software, but that is not really the point).

Publishers are always going to charge the same for diskette as paper. 
 After all, most of the cost for a book (music, video, software, etc.) 
reflects profit and royalty.  A smaller amount is for recovery of 
non-tangible costs (marketing, distribution, etc.).  Very little of the 
price is pay for the media (paper, plastic, magnetic tape, etc.) and actual 
manufacturing costs.

Of course, this same theory holds for the soft drink wars, yet anything 
moderately healthy costs half again as much as the straight sugar water. 
 Cost to manufacture a can of Coca-Cola (TM): 6c
Cost to manufacture a can of apple juice:  9c
So rather than charge less than a nickel more for the fruit juice, they 
mark up the price throughout the distribution chain by 50%!

Oh well. -- Bruce
