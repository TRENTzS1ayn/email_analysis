In the real word, hypothetically sufficient training is seldom even the 
answer!

This discussion thread presumes that there was already someone in the 
office who (1) was blind, (2) using JAWS and MSIE, (3) not having any 
trouble.  This is already a "best case" scenario.

In my experience, 1&2&3 does not really happen.  Usually what happens is:
Some MIS person with no AT history hears about JAWS (or some other screen 
reader) and declares the problem solved.  Any difficulties from this point 
on pit MIS and management against the blind user and blame problems on lack 
of user competence.

If an objective competent outside expert examines the situation, they 
quickly find that maybe 1&2 is true, but upon close examination they learn 
that:
It turns out that the blind person using JAWS and MSIE who reports no 
problems is:  A) Actually a "super user" and is jumping through ridiculous 
hoops to make the system work (and doing things the average user -- blind 
or not -- should not be expected to do); or, B) Having plenty of 
difficulty, but not willing to admit and/or does not want to make waves.

I would love to hear of situation where 1&2&3 all proved to be true!

Just more rain on the parade.
