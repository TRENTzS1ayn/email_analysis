WAI Interest Group:

This mailing list gets heavy traffic and requires cooperation from all list
users to keep the discussion on topic.

Please review the "Using the WAI Interest Group Mailing List" section from
the WAI Interest Group home page, at
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/Overview.html#Uselist>.

Among other points, this includes:

- "Don't cc the WAI IG list with messages you are sending to other
organizations." 

This is also not an appropriate list on which to send requests to
participate in voting campaigns.

Also, for those who are still using vacation auto-responders on this list,
please note:

- "If you use a vacation auto-responder on your e-mail program, make sure
to exclude responses to any mail with w3c-wai-ig@w3.org in any header."

Thank you for your cooperation.

- Judy
