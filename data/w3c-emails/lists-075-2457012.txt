Bruce,

I believe your description is accurate more often than not.

These are difficult things to measure.  Where does knowledge of effective
use of an access tool end and jumping through hoops begin.

One could say that even a site that lacks alt tags isn't really a problem
because the links can still be followed.  You might have to experiment a
bit or a lot but you can still get around.  Personally I don't agree with
that idea but some in the disability community don't find anything wrong
with it.  To me accessibility has to have some measure of effective and
timely use of the material in question.
