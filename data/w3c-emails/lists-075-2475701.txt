Seems to me that if the new employee "refuses" to use what is available
rather than is "unable" to use it, the employer would be in a good position
to "refuse" further employment to that employee. The same would happen if a
non-disabled employee "refused" to use IE instead of Netscape, Windows
instead of Lynx, etc.
