be that as it may, it shakes out that if thousands of diskettes were
produced it would be cheaper to produce them and all they have to do
is make a copy to provide it to the user.  to make a copy of the book
in hard cover, they usually have to do annother pressing which runs
into lots of money.  The bottom line here if you will though is that
the blind person who is using an electronic copy is not only using it
on an expensive device but also has to settle for less access to it by
its nature and his/hers.  ie we get text and y'all get everything at a
glance.
