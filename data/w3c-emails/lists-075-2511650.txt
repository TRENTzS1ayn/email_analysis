Hello, my name is Kynn Bartlett.

I'm the President of the HTML Writers Guild, and I am head of our
AWARE Center -- AWARE stands for Accessible Web Authoring Resources
and Education.  I'm in charge of all Guild projects relating to
educating web designers on how to create web sites that can be
accessed by anyone, including people with disabilities.

Naturally, I was eager to see your video about technology improving
video access when my wife made me aware of it.  I went to your site
at:

      http://www.cnn.com/videoselect/

...using my browser, Opera 3.6, which is javascript capable, java
capable, and stylesheet capable.

I was greeted with a large rude banner saying that I don't have
stylesheets enabled, and an unusable web page.

I have yet to see the video.

That is the fault of poor, inaccessible programming techniques
by whoever put together your video selection system.  Ironic, isn't
it, that you run a story on accessibility -- while your own site
remains inaccessible!

If you need assistance at creating a more accessible site, I would
recommend the following to your webmasters:

      http://www.operasoftware.com/     The #3 browser, it does javascript
      http://www.awarecenter.org/       AWARE Center homepage
      http://www.cast.org/bobby/        Test your pages for accessibility
      http://www.w3.org/WAI/            W3C Web Accessibility Initiative

You can also write to me for further advice, if you need it.  I teach
online classes on web accessibility and web management in addition to
running the world's largest organization of web designers (over
106,000 worldwide) and I would be glad to help you.
