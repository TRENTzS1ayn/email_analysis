Hi,

I've added an example to my template processing page on how the same
article text can be presented on a web page with images and color and also
on a text-only page.  The site also has the source for the main program
along with the format and article files.  The URL is:

    http://members.aol.com/phoenixl/template-processor

Take a look at the README page.

Scott
