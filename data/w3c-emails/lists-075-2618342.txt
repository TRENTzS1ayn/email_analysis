Kynn:

I noticed that, although you are proficient at CSS layout, you are still
reluctant to use CSS for positioning. For example, the HTML Writers Guild is
built on table layouts and the Aware page (http://aware.hwg.org/) avoids
layouts that would require either tables or CSS positioning. I have also
used CSS to format pages, but mostly in experimentation. It is discouraging
to see how Netscape 3.0 displays those pages and how Netscape 4.0+ forgets
to reformat the page according to style sheets when the window is resized. I
know that there are javascripts that force Netscape to reload on window
resize. Maybe I'll make more use of that in the future.

My question, however, is how reasonable or advantageous is it to use CSS for
layout purposes? (DIV, SPAN, etc--not just font color and less consequential
attributes)? Does the disability community really benefit enough from it to
justify poor rendering in browsers with less-than-prefect CSS support? Does
the non-disability community benefit from it?

Even though I really like the concept of CSS, I have my doubts about its
usefulness until browsers give it better support.
