This is the crux of the matter.  CSS is not widely supported enough,
nor reliably supported enough, to be able to use CSS reliably for
layout.  In the case of the HTML Writers Guild, there's an extra
design consideration involved in that while it's okay to look "different"
in various browsers, we can't look "bad" in any of them, and if you
use CSS for positioning you take a serious risk of looking "broken"
in some browsers.

(Most users, when they encounter a page that doesn't look right, will
think the page is poorly designed, not that their browser is deficient.
So the HWG site has to be created in a way that it will look "right"
cross-browser.)
