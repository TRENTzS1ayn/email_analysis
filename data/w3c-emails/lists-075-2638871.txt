Absolute position is handled differently by both Internet Explorer 4 and 5.
That is it looks great on 4 but really bad on 5.

This is the crux of the matter.  CSS is not widely supported
enough,
nor reliably supported enough, to be able to use CSS
reliably for
layout.  In the case of the HTML Writers Guild, there's an
extra
design consideration involved in that while it's okay to
look "different"
in various browsers, we can't look "bad" in any of them, and
if you
use CSS for positioning you take a serious risk of looking
"broken"
in some browsers.

(Most users, when they encounter a page that doesn't look
right, will
think the page is poorly designed, not that their browser is
deficient.
So the HWG site has to be created in a way that it will look
"right"
cross-browser.)
