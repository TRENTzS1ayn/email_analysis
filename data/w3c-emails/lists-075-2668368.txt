But isn't that contrary to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
Double-A?

Here's my short and extended opinions about using tables for
layout.

Short opinion:

Given the current browser situation, we can't use style
sheets for layout.
Instead, use a table entirely for layout or entirely for
data, but don't
mix these uses in one table or nest data tables inside
layout tables.  (Or
avoid table layout altogether unless it serves a real
purpose).

Also, help the reader identify when a table is used for data
by:
1. Including a caption of the form "Table of blah blah
blah..."
2. Using header cells in the top row.

Extended opinion:

1. Another advantage of tables is that with current tools
it's easy to
control the order in which the contents are read, because
it's directly
determined by the table layout.  Tools that use CSS for
layout may produce
a reading order that's very different than the visual order.
This is
because e.g. if you slide text blocks around on the screen,
all the tool
does is change the coordinates, not the reading order.  This
happens for
example with Microsoft Publisher.  Of course, it's
straightforward to do
this if you're writing raw HTML and CSS by hand.  But you
run into problems
with some visual type editing tools.

2. It's true that using stylesheets for layout instead of
tables
theoretically gives the screen reader a way to deterine if
it's really a
data table or layout control.  However, this could easily be
done without
style sheets, e.g. by requiring a caption on all data tables
(even a null
caption), or defining a class.

3. The current author guidelines permit tables for layout
until browsers
shape up, but require that they make sense when read in the
order of the
raw HTML ("linearized").

4. Therefore, perhaps we should permanently allow the use of
tables for
layout provided that a standard way is agreed on to
distinguish layout from
data use.  We've got time to think about this since it
doesn't impact what
we're doing right now.
