I agree that for maximum accessibility you don't want to use tables for
layout.  

However, strictly speaking, the guidelines don't rule out tables for
positioning until user agents support style sheet positioning (per
checkpoint 5.3), and we're not at that point yet.  Furthermore, you can
still get a triple-A by having a separate page without the table layout
(checkpoint 10.3).  If I'm misreading these guidelines somebody please
straighten me out. 

Also, Masayasu Ishikawa pointed out in subsequent email that css 2 doesn't
have true columns, in the sense of automatic text flow.  That makes me even
more reluctant to push use of css for columns on a webmaster, since a year
from now I'd have to tell him or her that it's gotta be changed again.
