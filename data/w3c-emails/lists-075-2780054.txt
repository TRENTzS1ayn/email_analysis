My apologies if I have not be paying enough attention!

Is there a browser (besides Lynx) that has the option to automatically add 
keystroke shortcuts to ALL links on any given web page?  Is this a feature 
of Opera?

What software or techniques are people using for efficient voice-controlled 
web browsing?  (Yes, I know you can drive the mouse cursor by voice.  One 
can also use command like "Tab Five" and "Shift Tab Two".  Both of these 
methods quickly get tiresome.)

Thank you much.
Bruce Bailey
