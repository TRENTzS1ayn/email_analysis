How can the NFB justify such a legal action when the organization itself
generates funding from inaccessible web sites.  Take a look at

http://www.nfb.greatergood.com

an online fund raising shopping service which they are linked into.  It has
some of the same accessibility problems they are complaining about with AOL.
