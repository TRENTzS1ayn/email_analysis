Len:
With respect, I have to disagree on the emphasis.
If the emphasis is indeed somewhat ambiguous (or at least mildly confusing), the WCAG should be modified to make things more clear.
I used square brackets to emphasize what I think should be the emphasis.
Also, I see the guidelines concerning tables for layout and the use of a text-only version as closely related.
It is my experience that increasingly, the one remaining reason why a web page designer has to resort to a text only version is precisely because tables are being used for layout when there is no good reason (in my opinion) for doing so.

"  
Guideline 3. Use markup and style sheets and do so properly.
  Mark up documents with the proper structural elements. [Control presentation with style sheets rather than with presentation elements and attributes.]
Using markup improperly -- not according to specification -- hinders 
accessibility. [Misusing markup for a presentation effect (e.g., using a table for layout] or a header to change the font size) makes it difficult for users with specialized software to understand the organization of the page or to navigate through it. Furthermore, using presentation markup rather than structural markup to convey structure (e.g., constructing what looks like a table of data with an HTML PRE element) makes it difficult to render a page 
intelligibly to other devices (refer to the description of[ difference between content, structure, and presentation]). 
Content developers may be tempted to use (or misuse) constructs that achieve a desired formatting effect on older browsers. They must be aware that these 
practices cause accessibility problems [and must consider whether the formatting effect is so critical as to warrant making the document inaccessible to some users.] 
At the other extreme, content developers must not sacrifice appropriate markup because a certain browser or assistive technology does not process it correctly.  For example, it is appropriate to use the TABLE element in HTML to mark up tabular information even though some older screen readers may not handle side-by-side text correctly (refer to checkpoint 10.3). Using TABLE correctly and creating tables that transform gracefully (refer to guideline 5) makes it possible for software to render tables other than as two-dimensional grids. 

Guideline 5. Create tables that transform gracefully.
  Ensure that tables have necessary markup to be transformed by accessible browsers and other user agents.
[Tables should be used to mark up truly tabular information ("data tables").
Content developers should avoid using them to lay out pages ("layout tables").] 

Tables for [any use] also present special problems to users of screen readers(refer to checkpoint 10.3). 
Some user agents allow users to navigate among table cells and access header and other table cell information. Unless marked-up properly, these tables will not provide user agents with the appropriate information. (Refer also to guideline 
3.) 
The following checkpoints will directly benefit people who access a table [through auditory means (e.g., a screen reader or an automobile-based personal computer) or who view only a portion of the page at a time (e.g., users with 
blindness or low vision using speech output or a braille display, or other users of devices with small displays, etc.).]..."

I agree that for maximum accessibility you don't want to use tables for
layout.  

However, strictly speaking, the guidelines don't rule out tables for
positioning until user agents support style sheet positioning (per
checkpoint 5.3), and we're not at that point yet.  Furthermore, you can
still get a triple-A by having a separate page without the table layout
(checkpoint 10.3).  If I'm misreading these guidelines somebody please
straighten me out. 

Also, Masayasu Ishikawa pointed out in subsequent email that css 2 doesn't
have true columns, in the sense of automatic text flow.  That makes me even
more reluctant to push use of css for columns on a webmaster, since a year
from now I'd have to tell him or her that it's gotta be changed again.
