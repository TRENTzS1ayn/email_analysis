Len asked:
> Will it be be available after the conference also?

Yes, it's my understanding that the streaming video file will
be available after the conference as well as in "real time."

BTW, if you are interested at all in the AOL lawsuit, Cynthia
Waddell tells me she'll be specifically addressing that in her
portion of the session!
