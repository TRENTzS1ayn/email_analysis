aloha, kynn!

it is unfortunate that the graphical icons that link to the streaming
presentation of your, cynthia, and kim's presentation are NOT alt texted on:
       
http://www-project.slac.stanford.edu/interlab99/program/panel-accessibility.htm
nor do they seem to be ALT texted on any of the other pages which i checked,
including the URI you cited in your original post
        http://www-project.slac.stanford.edu/interlab99/

i know that these are things over which you personally have no control, but it
is a sad commentary on just how much work needs to be done in order to get the
message across to people that it is not enough to merely address accessibility
issues in a symposium, but that the forum through which accessibility issues
are being addressed MUST, itself, be accessible to persons with disabilities...

anything else is akin to the editor of a newspaper committing his highly
principled stance against discrimination, racism, and sexism into an editorial,
before leaving the office for a round of golf at a country club which excludes
blacks, jews, and women; or to the hosting of a symposium on accessible
architecture in a building without access ramps or doors wide enough to
actually accommodate anyone using a wheelchair or scooter...

anyway, i couldn't get a connection to the live stream, but i hope that your
presentation was well received, and i "look" forward to listening to it when it
is archived...

CYNIC, n.  A blackguard whose faulty vision sees things as they are, not
as they ought to be.  Hence the custom among the Scythians of plucking out
a cynic's eyes to improve his vision.
