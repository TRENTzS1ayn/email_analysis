Len:
I'm still unclear.
I use JFW 3.2 with IE 4.01 and it is not smart enough to do that automatically.  If things don't make sense, I know to try the "Reformat Page" commandd (In WCAG terminology, a "table linearization or serialization command) which, may, if the page is coded correctly, make sense when llinearized.
I was really getting at the issue you mentioned.  It does not really matter whether  HTML tables or CSS is used for layout.  Either method will cause accessibility difficulties (rather large difficulties, - the user not being able to make sense out of what is being read).
I interpret The main theme of the guidelines to be the crucial distinction between content and structure on the one hand and presentation on the other.
HTML tables were intended to be used for tabular data, as is pointed out many places.
To use tables for layout is a misuse of tables.
To say that 
CSS is not widely supported 
implies 
it is o.k. to go ahead and misuse HTML  tables for layout anyway just seems to be sending the wrong message. 
If tables should not be used for layout, they should not be used for layout, whether or not CSS is currently widely supported.  This does not mean CSS must be used either.
Layout is a presentation issue, not a content or structure issue. 

If layout is actually used for structure then a one dimensional linearization of a two dimensional layout is certainly not equivalent access.
Do you agree?
Restricting the discussion to the use of CSS 
"Do you agree with that?"  Then we can get to triple A.
the short answer is yes.  Perhaps we are talking on different levels/scope.

Steve,

(Caveat: this is all my personal opinion, not an "offical" interpretation).

I think I understand why you're uncomfortable with the emphasis that came
out of what I said.  I was spotlighting practices which we all know give
less than maximal accessibility, yet still rate double A, or even triple A.
 I don't like that either.

But here's the actual text.

3.3 says "Use style sheets to control layout and presentation. [Priority 2] "

Yes, that looks like using tables for layout rules out a double A.
                   
However, there is a note on 5.3 that says

"Once user agents support style sheet positioning, tables should not be
used for layout."

Since CSS layout isn't supported yet I read that note as providing an
exception to implied requirement of 3.3 that tables not be used for layout.
So the page can still get a double-A.

Another way to look at this is that if you're using a screen reader which
only reads straight across the physical information on the screen, instead
of looking at the underlying HTML or Active Accessibility information, I
think it will fail just as badly on CSS layout as it would on Table driven
layout.  I can't test that directly because the combinations I have, like
lynx, MSIE/JAWS, pwWebspeak, etc. etc. are all smarter than that.  But I
think it has to be true.  So it doesn't seem to me worthwhile to insist on
the CSS layout here.

Do you agree with that?  Then we can get to triple A.

The question of what clarifying statements might be written for the
guidelines is  separate issue.

for users with specialized software to understand the organization of the
page or to navigate through it. Furthermore, using presentation markup
rather than structural markup to convey structure (e.g., constructing what
looks like a table of data with an HTML PRE element) makes it difficult to
render a page

HTML to mark up tabular information even though some older screen readers
may not handle side-by-side text correctly (refer to checkpoint 10.3).
Using TABLE correctly and creating tables that transform gracefully (refer
to guideline 5) makes it possible for software to render tables other than
as two-dimensional grids.
