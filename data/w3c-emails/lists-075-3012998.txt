Is this the consensus that history of previous replies be edited out?  I've
also heard the opinion that it's convenient to have the full history for
people finding themselves in the middle of a thread.  Saves a bunch of
clicking.

Of course you have to start with the new stuff and clearly identify where
the old stuff starts especially so people with screenreaders don't have to
wade thru it all.

Personally, I'm easy either way.
