Dear Chairs, 

On behalf of the User Agent Guidelines Working Group [1], I am 
pleased to announce the publication of the "User Agent 
Accessibility Guidelines 1.0" Last Call Working Draft. 
The document address is:

       http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19991105

The Last Call review period will end 1 December 1999. Please
send review comments before that date to w3c-wai-ua@w3.org (archives
available at [2]).

At their 3 November 1999 teleconference [3], the User Agent Guidelines
Working Group decided to move the UA Guidelines to Last Call. By
moving to last call, the Working Group asserts that it
has met the requirement of its charter [7] "to complete the
development of user agent accessibility guidelines addressing
accessibility of graphical, voice, and text browsers, multimedia
players, and third-party assistive technologies which work in
conjunction with browsers and multimedia players." 

The Working Group has also published a "Techniques Document" that 
explains different ways to satisfy the requirements of the Guidelines.
Comments on this document are also welcome, although it is not
in Last Call. The Working Group does not anticipate moving
the Techniques Document to Recommendation. When and if the 
Guidelines become a Recommendation, the Techniques Document will
become a W3C Note. The Techniques Document published at the
same time as the Last Call Guidelines is:

       http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-TECHS-19991105

The list of changes to the Guidelines [8] and the WG's issues
list [9] are available on the Web.

QUESTIONS AND ISSUES

In your review, please consider the following questions and issues:

1) Do you understand the Guidelines and Checkpoints or do they need
   clarification?

2) Do you find the documents (Guidelines and Techniques) themselves
   usable? Can you find what you are looking for?

3) Two checkpoints [numbers here] require user agents to make
   available to users information about the current input
   configuration (e.g., keyboard input). These checkpoints 
   have been assigned different priorities: Priority 1 for 
   user-specified configuration and Priority 2 for
   author-specified configuration (e.g., access keys). The Working
   Group did not reach consensus on whether these two checkpoints
   should be merged into a single checkpoint, and what the priority
   of such a checkpoint would be.

4) Checkpoint 6.1 (Priority 1) asks user agents to implement the 
   accessibility features of supported specifications. 
   In the Authoring Tool Guidelines Proposed Recommendation, 
   checkpoints that refer to
   content accessibility do so by "Relative Priority". This means that
   the priority of the checkpoint in the UAGL depends on how much
   you wish to conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
   [6]. There has been a suggestion to make 6.1 a checkpoint with
   a Relative Priority rather than Priority 1. The Working Group
   did not reach consensus on whether the burden of doing so
   (complicating the priority definition) outweighed the benefit 
   of consistency among the three sets of Guidelines. Also, it is 
   not clear that a Priority 3 requirement in WCAG would always be 
   a Priority 3 requirement in UAGL (i.e., it may be more important
   to implement   a feature than for the author to supply it). 
   Comments on the proposal to make 6.1 a Relative Priority
   checkpoint are welcome.
