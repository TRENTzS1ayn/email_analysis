I was able to listen to the broadcast after the fact.

Will it be up for a while?  Will a copy be posted at the AWARE site?  I 
realize no one has the time to transcribe the thing, but how about 
including links to the presenters' notes (what you guys worked from NOT 
just your overheads).  I don't care how poorly formatted it is.

The content, by the way, was great.  And I loved being able to connect 
people's voice with their listserv posts.  I just wish the video was of the 
same quality...

The pictures were SO static --especially the screen shot of the un-changing 
overhead outline!  Is this a function of my poor connection bandwidth 
(dial-up), the broadcast bandwidth, by design, or software limitations? 
 Personally, I think an audio-only presentation might have been better 
(given the video limitations).  How large (in MB) is the whole file?  How 
about publishing (at cost, and in an accessible format -- of course) a 
CD-ROM version?  Is the video (especially the first half of the broad cast) 
a series of jpeg stills -- or does RealMedia actually continuously transmit 
a "movie" -- even when the video is basically static (like when we are just 
looking at an overhead outline which has as its only movement camera 
jiggles)?  What kind of compression is used?

Thanks for tolerating these annoying questions.  I am hoping to put 
together some digital video soon -- and hoping to learn from others 
mistakes!
