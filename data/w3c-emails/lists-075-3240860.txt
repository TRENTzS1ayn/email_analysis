Hi, everyone.  I'm told that you can now access the web accessibility
panel featuring myself (from the HTML Writers Guild), Kim Stephens from
IBM, and Cynthia Waddell from San Jose, in a streaming media (RealVideo)
format.

There is a URL link located on the following page, which also contains
my slides with relevant links (that were handed out in the presentation
on dead trees) to important websites:

      http://www.awarecenter.com/presentations/kbartlett-slac-interlab99.html

Caveat:  The streaming media files are not under the control of the 
HTML Writers Guild; we also do not have a transcript of the video
available.
