Jonathan,

Check out http://vinfo.com/scribe.htm.  They have a shareware product
called Scribe that runs under DOS and plays sound files through your PC
internal speaker.  Everyone has one of those.  I have heard it myself and
it's low fidelity, but pretty understandable.  Pair that with a (shareware)
text-to-speech toolkit and you could have the low-budget solution you seek.

Not the optimal situation to be sure, but you seem severely constrained as
far as resources.

Hope this helps,

Richard Premack

Graphical interfaces are important, and I was expressing a concern that we
are failing to meet this need.

We currently have no budget, no telephones to hand,
Even if we had soundcards we would need headphones, or earphones.
This would dramatically effect the sessions. Language labs are fantastic, I
was lucky enough to have access to one 30 years ago, but they are very
different to other more collaborative environments.
