since you posted this publicly, I feel obliged to put out the other
side of the coin.  Some Email programs will not allow easily cutting
and skimming of urls.  Some people cannot access the sites where some
of the stuff is archived and five minutes for you translates into
perhaps 5 hours for someone with one finger.
