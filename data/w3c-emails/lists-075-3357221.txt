Mr. Bailey,
I personally know Ms. Feingold and forwarded her press release because there
is no url.

Cynthia's reputation is such that I don't think she will be hurt if I use 
her as an example.

What is this groups "rules" for longish re-posts of email?

Personally, I would much rather get a one or two sentence description with 
a URL.

I am very skeptical of email that does not come from the original source. 
 There is no "face validity" to this kind of forwarded message.  Aside from 
the fact that Cynthia is well established here, how does the rest of the 
list (or someone new to the list, or someone not on the list that I would 
like to share this information with) not know that Cynthia has been duped 
by someone calling himself "Lainey Feingold".  Without a reply from Mr. 
Feingold (who might be quite busy -- and does not know me from Adam) what 
could I do to confirm this story or look into more deeply?

Feel free to flame me (off the list please) if I am full of it, but I 
respectfully request that everybody here try to include a URL with ALL 
longish messages -- even if that means fewer posts!

Granted, I understand that many press releases DON'T have URLs, and many 
LISTSERVs are NOT publicly archived, but fortunately, those are the 
exception.  The real problem is people who send YOU good -- but 
non-referenced -- stuff that you feel obligated to share.  Fight this bad 
habit as close to the source as you can!  Get THEM to send you the source 
BEFORE passing the info on to someone else.  Remember -- this IS how email 
hoaxes and chain letters get their start!

With the example below, the Trace uaccess-l is archived at URL:
http://trace.wisc.edu/docs/uaccess-l/listproc/ but *I* can't get in further 
since I am not subscribed.

But in less than five minutes with AltaVista I found this:
http://www.ilusa.com/News/63099talking_atm.htm

Not to sound like a REAL jerk, but is five minutes of Cynthia's time (or 
whoever would post long -- non-original -- stuff like this) really THAT 
much more valuable than (5 min * X number of people who are interested) of 
everyone else's time?  (I realize that five minutes of Cynthia time *is* 
MUCH more valuable than five minutes of my time, but that is not really my 
point!)

Thank you!

-- Bruce Bailey
