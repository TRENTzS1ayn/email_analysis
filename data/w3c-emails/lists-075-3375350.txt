Right, that's kind of the case I am trying to make.

YOU know Ms. Feingold, but I don't.  'Course, I know you well enough, so, 
in this example, that is good enough for me.  But what if this was 
something I wanted to pass on to some one else?  ("Well, Bruce knows his 
stuff, and he endorses this Cynthia Waddell, and she vouches for Ms. 
Feingold, so I guess this is legitimate...")  What if THAT persons wants to 
pass it on?  You see where I am going with this!

Is it fair to request that the original author (Ms. Feingold in this case) 
to make the post?  (BTW, What are we to think of a law practice that does 
not have a web site?  In this case, should we not wait for the press 
release to be picked up by an established news source?)
