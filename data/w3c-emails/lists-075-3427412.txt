Kynn, 

I don't agree with your logic here.  Nor do I agree with the complaint you
received on the web cast.  I thought the goal of making the web accessible
is to do it for all people, no matter what their disability.  This should
be done looking at two primary resouces, is it technically feasible and is
it readily achievable, if I can use these phrases here.  

As more and more things are moving to the web, it is up to all of us to
plan better to ensure that accessibility is being maintained.  Again, I
will post to the list, if you want to view and hear examples of accessible
video content done via the web, e.g. audio describe and closed captioned,
please go to the Able Channel at www.tvontheweb.com and see for yourself.
