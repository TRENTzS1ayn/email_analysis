This message addresses several recent questions on WAI Interest Group
Netiquette. Netiquette for this list is available on the WAI Interest Group
home page, under "how to use this list" or
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/Overview.html#Uselist>. 

We periodically update this section to capture additional guidance which
seems needed. To minimize list traffic discussion on list netiquette, if
you have comments on this message, please comment to me at jbrewer@w3.org.

There is no ban on forwarded or lengthy postings, however, please bear in
mind two things:
- for news articles, it is better to send URL's when available, due to
copyright considerations;
- the heavier & wordier the traffic on this list, the fewer people stay on
the list.

A recent question on list usage regarded whether to strip out all parts of
a preceding message that one was not directly responding to. Previous
discussions have shown that carrying forward at least a little context from
previous parts of the thread helps some people to understand a message.
This isn't a rule, but is what some people say they prefer.

A reminder also not to cross-post to this list when sending messages to a
group of addresses. It can result in unexpected replies back to the whole
list from non-list members if they use a group reply.

Finally, since the topic of list archives is mentioned below, a reminder
that this list is available both as an archive
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig> and also as a digest
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/Overview.html#Uselist>.
