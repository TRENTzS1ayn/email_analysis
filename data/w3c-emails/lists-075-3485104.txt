While several people have said that they agreed with this "definition of
accessibility" (see Kynn's original posting below), I think that there is a
danger in this definition.

If I were to restate it in words I'd feel more comfortable with, I'd say
that the goal of Web accessibility is to maximize access to the Web for
people with disabilities. 

So, why take out "percentages"? The Web Content Guidelines Working Group
very deliberately did _not_ make demographic slices of different disability
groups a factor in assigning priorities to checkpoints within the
guidelines. The checkpoints are instead prioritized according to the extent
to which they address barriers that completely, partially, or only mildly
impede access for various disability groups, not according to what percent
of the population those barriers impact.

The "percentages" argument effectively matches the "marketability"
rationale for Web accessibility. If one looks the universal design
rationale (carry-over benefits from Web accessibility to greater usability
for other Web users) or the "requirements" rationale (for some kinds of Web
sites, in some countries, there is a requirement to provide a certain level
of accessibility) then the "percentages" approach has shortcomings, as it
may mean certain carry-over benefits being lost (such as the efficiency of
indexing and searching on captioned audio), or some groups of disabled
users not having their needs met (people with less common disabilities).
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are a prioritized list of ways to
ensure accessibility across disabilities, and across these three
complementary rationales.

At the same time, it's not yet easy to have full access in every situation.
Captioning of audio and description of video are very possible for
pre-recorded multi-media, using SMIL (Synchronized Multimedia Integration
Language) or other formats. So, once a videoconference is completed, it can
be reproduced with captions and descriptions. On the other hand, captioning
of audio for a live teleconference is difficult with today's tools (a good
market opportunity for someone!) though possible; and description of live
video yet more difficult, though again possible with some creativity.

So, my conclusion would still be the same in this situation: provide the
maximum access that one can. I just wouldn't suggest calculating it on the
basis of percentages, since there are some groups who would never get
access with that approach, yet who need it as much as the rest of us.
