Looks like I had a long day when I sent the notice out on the AOL matter and
apologize for my typing errors.  My office continues to be flooded with
calls and email about the case.  I should have caught the various errors
surrounding the name of the National Federation of the Blind.  Please accept
my apology.

first, it is the National Federation of the Blind and I have had a
posted url up on at least one of these lists for a couple of days now
where people can and have downloaded the text of the complaint,  which
is readable at:
