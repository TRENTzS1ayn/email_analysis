Judy and Chuck-
As Judy stated, the AOL case is not just about AOL employees.  The Americans
with Disabilities Act also seeks to remove a host of barriers in the
public's access to programs, services and facilities.  When a program or
service screens out access based on disability, then it becomes a target.  I
am discussing this in the articles I am writing at the request of the
American Bar Association and the National Disability Law Reporter.

Chuck,

Two thoughts as a follow-up on your message:

You mentioned that the Americans with Disabilities Act might be applicable
to an ISP if it were an issue of reasonable accommodation in the workplace.
My understanding is that there may be a broader angle of applicability as
well. For background take the US Department of Justice's September 1996
opinion <http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/foia/tal712.txt> on the applicability of
the ADA to the Web: besides state and local government, it also mentions
places of public accommodation and their obligations for communication
access. It will be interesting to see how that is interpreted in US courts. 

You also mentioned that there are so many ISP choices available. Sometimes
the most convenient choice for an ISP subscriber would be an ISP that one's
family members, colleagues, or friends are already subscribed to, so as to
take advantage of informal support on initially learning the application,
and to take advantage of features such as instant messaging where more
options might be available among subscribers of the same ISP than among
subscribers of other ISP's.
