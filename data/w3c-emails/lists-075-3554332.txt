Scott's preposition is that pages should be dynamically generated
"for the sighted" and "for the blind" (and presumably "for" other
disability classes); my preposition is that, right now at least,
the principle of graceful degradation is a much more useful thing
to concentrate on.  [For the future, see http://www.ccpp.org]

Summaries of links and document structure are available on many web
browsers; also, META descriptions provide page summaries and should be
encouraged for this purpose as an accessibility aid.

Pages created with tables used for layout can and should be linearized,
though.

I'm not sure I understand why you think this is so, and why you believe
that searching is not an acceptable, accessible way to find information.

Jumping back and forth on a page isn't real good design even for sighted
users, though.  As a matter of good UI design and graphic design,
jumping around should be minimized, period.

ACCESSKEY is broken and should, in general, be avoided -- in my opinion.
I agree that if they are used, they should be documented -- but this
is information that should be on the "visual" page as well.

That's one possible solution.

Except that ACCESSKEY is broken, but that's another discussion.  There's
no reason that you can't have keys to activate popular links on the
graphical version, is there?

Ditto.

Sighted people also can suffer from this problem, though.  That's a
problem in poor web design, again.

Is it true that blind users prefer drop-down lists and sighted users
prefer radio buttons?

Because you're talking about different types of training.  It's easier
to say "make this page universally accessible" than to say "make this
page optimized for a blind person, okay, now make this page optimized
for a deaf person, okay, now make this page optimized for a blind AND
deaf person, okay, now make this page optimized for a blind AND deaf
person using a Mac, ..."

Eventually, you end up coming back to universal design because that way
you can include everyone instead of having to create algorithms for
every single combination of disability type.

Yes, but the architecture is not yet in place.  This will take more than
just what you have in your CGI scripts (which are a step in the right
direction) in order to be a generally applicable solution to web
accessibility.
