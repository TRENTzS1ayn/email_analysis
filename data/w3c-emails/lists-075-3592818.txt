Is valid HTML required for single-A compliance?  I don't believe it
is.  Checkpoint 3.2 ("Create documents that validate to published
formal grammars.") is priority _two_.  Therefore, you can keep the
invalid (browser-specific) HTML code they like, and still get a
single-A rating.

I can't access your page -- I'm assuming you did replace these with 
the CSS equivalent to get the same functionality, but in a standards-
complaint way?

According to http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/index/attributes.html
only BODY can take the VLINK and ALINK attributes.

As I said, I can't see your page for some reason.

I'm not a javascript guru so I will skip this one for now.
