Accurately describing picture content is necessary for accessibility
considerations, especially LONGDESC/D-Link.  However, giving good
and useful picture descriptions is not as easy as it sounds; there
is a certain art to it, and you can improve with practice.

I recently went on a trip to Rome to speak at the E-Commerce
Summit (http://www.e-commerce-summit.com/) and the day before
the summit started, I went on a commercial tour of Rome and took
many pictures of what I was seeing.  I would like to make these
available on the web, and, as a practice exercise, I'd like to see
if anyone (who can see my pictures) would be interested in helping
to describe these pictures or at least evaluating the descriptions
that I or someone else has provided.

Anyone game?
