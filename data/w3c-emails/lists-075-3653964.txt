Hi Scott,

You talk at the end of your note about the potential benefit of dynamically
generating different versions of pages.  Of the examples you gave the one
where the benefit is most obvious is the radio button vs. drop down list.
Radio buttons are more convenient in many situations for sighted people
(especially when there are a lot of ratings arranged table fashion) but in
a previous discussion on this list blind users pointed out the advantages
of dropdown lists while screenreading.    And this isn't just a
hypothetical situation: I'm facing this exact situation right now while
advising some folks how to make an online survey.

In the other examples though, you described solutions that didn't require
dynamic generation. Could you give additional examples in which the
advantages of different forms is more obvious?  For example, a case where
text is laid out in a table, and is understandable when linearized, but
could be read more conveniently if not linearized?

By the way, reading order is one situation where style sheet layout could
do the same thing as dynamic generation.  To bad we can't count on that in
visual browsers at the moment.
