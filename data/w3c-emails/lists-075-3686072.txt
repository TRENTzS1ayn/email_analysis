Mr. Neff,

I have enjoyed your presentations at GPO and DC Webmasters
about
Internet/disability issues.  My colleague is exploring
alternate PC input
devise information, as she has a carpal-tunnel-like problem
in her wrist and
hand, mainly from using a mouse.  I've tried a number of
sites that have
bits and pieces of information, but do you know of any
DEFINITIVE sites that
discuss, in some depth,  EFFECTIVE alternatives - i.e.
perhaps trackballs,
touch pads, pedals, voice recognition, etc.  I gave my
colleague a Logitech
track ball to try, but she is leaning towards
trying/ordering a touch pad
that she heard about.

Thanks in advance for your help.
