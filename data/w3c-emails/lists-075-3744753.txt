Getting back to what the person was looking at, a touch pad, here's my own
personal experience:  mice get my hand and wrist sore, mainly from pressing
down on the mouse button.  I'm using a touch pad which completely takes
care of the problem--at least when used in combination with as many
keyboard shortcuts as possible, an angled keyboard, a good chair, proper
keyboard and monitor height, good lighting conditions, and a pair of weak
(1.25D) reading glasses to bring the monitor in focus without contorting my
back or neck.

However, the positioning of the touch pad is important.  If it's positioned
under the cursor keys or number pad it gets my shoulder uncomfortable.  The
best position for me at least is a built in touchpad in directly below the
space bar.

It's also important how I use the touch pad.  I use the right tip of the
middle finger of my right hand so my palm is facing toward me and a bit
down... in other words, at a natural angle.  I also touch as lightly as I
can. 

It's also set up so a light tap is equivalent to a click, and a light tap
followed immediately by a light touch and drag on the page is equivalent to
a mouse drag. I only use the buttons for button 2. 

The particular keyboard I use is an Adesso Truform keyboard pictured at
http://www.adessoinc.com/pck308t.htm (don't confuse their truform with
their nuform).   

However, I am not endorsing this product over other similar keyboards, nor
am I endorsing this way to address the problem in general.  This is just my
own personal experience.  There are no doubt other good solutions.  

For example, I find the new iMac mouse comfortable to use: provided I use
it a particular way.  This means not placing my hand on top of it, as if it
were an ordinary mouse, but rather resting the side of my hand on the
table, curling my fingers around to hold the mouse between my thumb near
the back and my other fingers near the front, and squeezing to activate the
mouse button. 

But that's just me.  Anyone experiencing significant discomfort should
consult with a physician.  I am not a physician.

I'd be glad to give more details but I think we should take that level off
list.
