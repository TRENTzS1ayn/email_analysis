Agreed in general. An exception might be at an art exhibition.
We recently had audio descriptions done professionally,
with mood music, artist background
material on top of fairly fine detail. That was really impressive for most

Nice addition. ?Similar to background about a painting? What made you
take this picture? Who was with you? Were you sightseeing etc.

Brings out the picture from being one of those family snaps that we 
tend to bore the relatives with?
