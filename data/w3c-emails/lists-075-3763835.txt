If you go to an Art Gallery exhibition you can look at pictures. At many
galleries you can also get an audio "guided tour" (usually just a cassette
tape, but sometimes a real and knowledgeable person). And many exhibitions
also have a catalogue, which has pictures of the pictures, and an awful lot
of words about the pictures.

I think there is a message in that somewhere. I guess it is the same as the
one Bruce is describing - Universal access is often surprisingly useful to
the people who could survive without it, despite the fact tht it is critical 
to only a few people (and a particular aspect may equally be completely
unusable for an equal number of people - an audio description helps
people who cannot see just as much as it excludes people who cannot hear. The
goal is to provide the redundancy to cater for both groups, and the benefit
spreads to many people in neither group.

  Kynn,
  
  How academic an exercise do you want this be?  Most descriptions I have come
  across (which includes the CAM stuff) is very short and functional -- this
  include descriptive video.  Now, a static web page does not have real time
  constraints, but aren't most of your friends and colleagues (including those
  who happen to have vision impairments) interested in why YOU took a
  particular photo, who is in it, and what were your impressions at the time?
  Seems to me, only the photographer can answer these questions!
  
  Take a look at the ultrasounds I posted for MY friends and relatives.  I got
  good feedback from my friends who are blind, and much to my surprise (I
  should have predicted this, but I didn't), family who were sighted liked the
  descriptions too!  (They appreciate the help with knowing what they were
  looking at.)  I latter learned that most people did not realize that the
  ONLY reason I bothered with descriptions (of course I would have included
  ALT text) was for the benefit of my blind friends!  (This also proved to me
  that _I_ am still learning lessons about the importance of universal
  access.)  Photos can be found at URL:

  A picture may be worth a thousand words, but sometimes it is nice if someone
  tells you -- Just what the Hell is that?
