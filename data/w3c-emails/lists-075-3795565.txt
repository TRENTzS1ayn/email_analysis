What would be interesting is to use some metadata tools to provide bits of
metadata about the photos. That way you can find out who made what statements
about them, and then get the descriptions from the person you trust.

  which is why, when i go to a museum, i like to gather together at least 2 and
  optimally more friends whose aesthetic judgement i trust, and get all of their
  opinions and perspectives...
  
  there's no doubt about it -- when you're blind, the more information you're
  able to get, the better your experience of a visual object will be...
  
  what would really be interesting, kynn, would be to have you describe the
  photos from your point of view -- including the reason why you took the
  picture, the mood that you were in when you did so, what you were attempting to
  capture on film, and what you actually captured -- and then allow visitors to
  add comments or describe the scene from their perspective...
  
  now that's a site i would bookmark,
          gregory.
