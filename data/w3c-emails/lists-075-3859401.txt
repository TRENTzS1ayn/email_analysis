assume as much public media does a 3rd grade level education when
writing your descriptions.  There are many opinions, but the fact is
that if you keep it generic and don't refer to in jokes or leave the
<reader> hanging with coloquialisms unless pertenant, it is doable.  I
will dug up urls where this has been done quite well.  Let's get on
with the experement.  What matters more than whether or not a person
had sight is how much of what people talk about and they read about
they are able to assimilate into something that at least for them has
meaning.
Thanks!
