Several people reported problems in downloading and playing
my MP3 files. It turns out to be a server problem specific
to MP3 files. While I will report this to my provider, you 
can in the mean-time get the two MP3 files by downloading 
and unpacking the zip file (53K file size)

   http://www.seeingwithsound.com/extra/tongue2.zip

and play the resulting two MP3 files in your MP3 player.
These are the same files that I had posted direct links
for. I'm sorry for any inconvenenience caused. My original
posting can if necessary be reread from the W3C archive 
at the web page

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/1999OctDec/0462.html

but again, the MP3 file links there are likely to cause
problems, so please use the above zip file instead for
now.

Best wishes,

Peter Meijer
