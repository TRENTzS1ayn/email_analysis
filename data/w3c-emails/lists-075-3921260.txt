Hi,

I've set up a demonstration of how two web pages can be generated
dynamically each with a presentation tailored to a particular
type of user.  The URL is:

    http://members.aol.com/criptrip/dynamic_web_pages

Currently, the demonstration works best on Internet Explorer version 4
or newer.

Scott

PS  Would love to hear any feedback.
