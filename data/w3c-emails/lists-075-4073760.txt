If something is not possible, then document why you cannot meet this
objective.  Last week I spoke with Jenifer Simpson, President's Committee on
Employment of People with Disabilities. If you are not able to meet the
guidelines, then document why you are not able to or make it available in
another format, for example, can people call in for the information or can
it be sent to them? There are other options until you can make it available.

I wholeheartedly agree the tools, training, and budgets are not there, but
they will come.  You can at least try and if you cant make it - document and
use that for justification as an interim solution.

Uncaptioned   Webcasts

   
Judy:
I agree completely.
I have found myself disagreeing more frequently lately on
policy or policy-like issues and at the same time agrreeing and admiring the
technical advice offerred on how to do this or that.
I am trying to take a step back and consider those who seem
to be sayingg, basically, that 
a. Perfection is not possible. and 
b. in the "real world" 
( the negation of which is an often mystical place since I
consider myself to always be in the real-world) there are such an such
considerations.
Statement a. above is obvious and I don't see what it
implies.
Statement b. is, in the abstract, worthwhile, but needs
fleshing out.
I think all would agree that the ideal is maximum
accessibility.  The disagreement, if any, is over how?
As you point out, there are some technical issues not yet
handled well with current tools.
The web guidelines address this issue in many places, some
more indirectly than others.
In some places there is the phrase about "interrim"
solutions.  In many places there is the phrase "graceful transformation" or
"graceful degradation".  
My interpretation of phrases like these is basically common
sense.
Some "user agents" don't support this or that so either
avoid a certain feature or provide an alternative.
If you do use a certain new technology/feature, remember
those who might not have access by that particular mode.
If it is known in advance that some feature will be used,
that will be inaccessible to some groups, plan ahead to provide an
alternative.
I think we can all agree on these.  If any of us still
disagree, we need to communicate better exactly at what point do we
disagree.
If some of us are facing "real world" impediments, whatever
the cause, we need to reach out and ask each other for help.
None of us should be afraid to say "I know this is right, I
want to do this, but here are the obstacles I face.  Can you, as the
consumer, help me make a case to overcome these obstacles?"
Those who insist on their rights to maximum (not minimum)
accessibility 
and those information providers who hav limited time /
resources
must try not to oppose each other but work together.  
Providers: Ask the consumers for help in getting more
resources.
Consumers: Make your rights known, be as clear and precise
as you can.

today's ideals *are* tomorrow's real-world.  We all can do
it.  I am an eternal idealistic optimist.

While several people have said that they agreed with this
"definition of
accessibility" (see Kynn's original posting below), I think
that there is a
danger in this definition.

If I were to restate it in words I'd feel more comfortable
with, I'd say
that the goal of Web accessibility is to maximize access to
the Web for
people with disabilities. 

So, why take out "percentages"? The Web Content Guidelines
Working Group
very deliberately did _not_ make demographic slices of
different disability
groups a factor in assigning priorities to checkpoints
within the
guidelines. The checkpoints are instead prioritized
according to the extent
to which they address barriers that completely, partially,
or only mildly
impede access for various disability groups, not according
to what percent
of the population those barriers impact.

The "percentages" argument effectively matches the
"marketability"
rationale for Web accessibility. If one looks the universal
design
rationale (carry-over benefits from Web accessibility to
greater usability
for other Web users) or the "requirements" rationale (for
some kinds of Web
sites, in some countries, there is a requirement to provide
a certain level
of accessibility) then the "percentages" approach has
shortcomings, as it
may mean certain carry-over benefits being lost (such as the
efficiency of
indexing and searching on captioned audio), or some groups
of disabled
users not having their needs met (people with less common
disabilities).
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are a prioritized
list of ways to
ensure accessibility across disabilities, and across these
three
complementary rationales.

At the same time, it's not yet easy to have full access in
every situation.
Captioning of audio and description of video are very
possible for
pre-recorded multi-media, using SMIL (Synchronized
Multimedia Integration
Language) or other formats. So, once a videoconference is
completed, it can
be reproduced with captions and descriptions. On the other
hand, captioning
of audio for a live teleconference is difficult with today's
tools (a good
market opportunity for someone!) though possible; and
description of live
video yet more difficult, though again possible with some
creativity.

So, my conclusion would still be the same in this situation:
provide the
maximum access that one can. I just wouldn't suggest
calculating it on the
basis of percentages, since there are some groups who would
never get
access with that approach, yet who need it as much as the
rest of us.
