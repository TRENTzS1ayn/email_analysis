Hi Scott,

I agree that you can get optimal accessibility by generating pages
dynamically, tailored to the needs of the particular user.

As for whether I'm implying that there's a "primary" page... well, sort of,
but I prefer to word it differently, since that word might lead people to
think that it's somehow superior to the other pages, when all I mean is
that it's the page presented to the average non-disabled user who just
takes the default presentation.  So I'll call it the default page.

To be really simple and concrete, would the default page have ALT text?  I
think it should for a number of reasons:

1. If a blind and sighted user are working--or playing--together, it's
useful to have the same prsentation.  Lets say for example that the sighted
person has a question about how to use a screen.  If the blind user is
seeing a dropdown list and the sighted person is seeing radio buttons there
will be confusion. This sort of thing turned out very useful in
workstations I designed back when I was at AT&T.  As another example, a
parent who is blind may want to be looking at or talking about a screen
with a child who is sighted.  Sharing the experience more fully requires
access to everything on the screen, including "decorative" images.  This
last example is one a blind individual gave me back a few years ago when I
was asking about ALT text on decorative images.

2. Blind users can spot check that pages are equivalent and thereby gain
confidence that all are.  Or find bugs to report back.  It's a way for
users to do quality control.

3. Even if dynamically generated pages are really equivalent, they can
"send the message" that so called "text-only" pages are needed... and
promote their use where they are hand written and subject to error.

4. Accessbility features have advantages for non-disabled people.  E.g.
simple ALT text makes a page usable even if there are delays downloading.
A person would not want to switch to another page if they find images
coming in slowly.

So that's why I think that even if there are optimal dynamically generated
pages, the default pages should also be accessible.  I'm hoping you feel
the same about that.
