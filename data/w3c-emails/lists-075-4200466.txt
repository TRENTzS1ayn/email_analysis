Hi, Len

Basically, I would agree that a user having a choice would be
desirable.  The issue of best use of resources is a consideration.

While some aspects of accessibility could be easily incorporated into
the default web pages, some aren't.  I believe one of the most
challenging has to do with visual layout.  Given that CSS is not
standardized, it will be easier to use tables for layout.  Second,
layouts using tables probably won't transform very easily into a more
linearized form.  In this area, I think it makes  sense in a situation
where pages are generated dynamically, not to put the effort in trying
to balance off visual appearance with accessibility.  The visual
experience is so compelling that it will cause designers to often ignore
the accessibility aspects.  I believe providing for customized web pages
for blind users provides for accessibility without going against the
strong visual design current of the default page.

With regards to the issue of text-only, I believe that is more a matter
of increasing awareness in the population.  It is probably not that
dissimilar from getting the population to understand that providing
braille to accomodate is not the anwser since only 10% of blind people
read braille.

PS An interesting question, though probably philosophical, to consider is
whether blind and sighted people actually do see the same page.  Blind
people users use screen readers which affect their experience of web
pages in some significant ways.
