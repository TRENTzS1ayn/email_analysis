Hi, Kelly

Answers to your question kind of depend on the definition of
"problem".  Does "problem" mean can't get access to it at all
or does it mean how much does it impede using a web page?

In the example I got from a search engine, tables nested to
various depths are used for layout.  See what it's like via
a screen reader.  The URL is:
