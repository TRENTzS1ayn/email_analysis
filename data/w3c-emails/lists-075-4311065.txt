Could you provide some clarification on what you mean here.  Below is part
of the text as decolumnized by both JFW with Internet Explorer and Lynx.
Of course missing here are the numbers Lynx could insert or the word Link
before each line below but basically each line below is a link.

My impression of this page, like much of the main Yahoo Index, is that you
have a basic category name and then some subcategories under that category.
 The pattern is terminated with a link that has several periods, which is
an indication that the next link will be a major category.  To me this is
very readable and functional.

The other sections of the page are links to live events today and are
equally readable to me.

I'm not saying readable to Kelly equals accessible.  But of the hundreds of
people who are Blind I've worked with on internet access, Yahoo has been a
favorite site because people find it functional.
