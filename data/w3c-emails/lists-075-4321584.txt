 From a realistic point of view, if we say that tables should never
be used for layout, we might as well give up right now on trying to
sell web designers on accessibility.

Tables _are_ and _will_ be used for layout.  That genie is not going
to go back into the bottle.  Insisting that using tables for layout
is "wrong" will cost us more than it's worth.

We need to choose our battles carefully, and not lock ourselves into
a position that is completely unsupportable.  Fortunately, technology
_has_ advanced enough that tables can be unstacked relatively easily
by most assistive tech, and thus "losing" the tables-for-layout
battle is an acceptable loss, since it doesn't cause that much
damage -- the adaptive technology DOES exist to make them accessible.

Therefore I have to respectfully disagree with my good Gregory, and
support what Kelly says -- tables for layout, if not used in completely
awful ways, _are_ accessible thanks to advances in web technology.
