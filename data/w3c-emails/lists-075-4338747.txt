Hi Scott,

OK, we agree that giving a choice is desirable... although we might differ
on how desirable.  I'd also agree that we can't ignore how much effort it
will be for a webmaster.

As for your assertion that

>layouts using tables probably won't transform very easily into a more
>linearized form. 

Another thread just popped up on on this list re problems with tables and
other folks are discussing various experiences with tables. We're seeing
different view there.

My view is that it's not hard to avoid the table linearizing as gibberish,
although you do have to use a few tricks.  For example, if you want a
layout with several text fields in a row and you want the names on top of
the text fields, you can't just put names in a row above the text fields.
If you did that a screen reader would read all the names and then present
all the fields.  A real mess. But in this case you can easily put each name
and text field in their own table cell, with a break <BR> in between.  That
gets the reading order correct.

Of course, I'm assuming that the browser or browser screenreader is reads
the table in the order it appears in the HTML.  This is true of text or
voice browsers like lynx, pwwebspeak, emacs/w3, and home page reader, as
well as graphical browsers-screenreader combinations which linearize
tables, like internet explorer and jaws with the reformat command. 

Now, that doesn't always put the items in the order that yields maximal
efficiency. In fact, it can be rather messy... e.g. users hear the main
menu links, the title, some of the links again (when they are featured in a
center splash image) etc. I agree that it could be made better on a
separate page with different format.  

So yes, I've said it before and I'll say it again, would indeed be valuable
to have alternative versions of the page which are easier to read in an
efficient manner.

But my point is that I still feel that even the default page should at
least avoid gibberish and not be completely impossible to use.

Is there an example you can give where it's really tough to avoid
gibberish... an example that would come up commonly?

Or if anyone else out there has a good example please post it up on the list.

Len
