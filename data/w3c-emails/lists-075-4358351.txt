as an example of what I mean look at the following lines
extracted from your message:

Children's
Audiobooks,
Music,
Science & Space...


Now, when you land on "audio books"
--how do you know that that's children's audio books 
without feeling around the screen?

For instance say you search for occurrences of "audio books" 
on the page--
you hit the string "audio books"
multiple times,
and each time you have to look both at the line above
(or possibly below)
to put it in context.

This in itself does not sound too bad--
but realize that the fact that the "children's" landed up in
the line immediately above "audio books"
was pure accident --and something that could change if the
Yahoo site 
decided to change from being row-oriented to column-oriented
in their table design.
Equally,  the proximity of "children's" to "audio books" 
is a function of whether the screenreader  decides to
decolumnize using row major or column major order.
