Hi Len,
I was wondering what effect placing a null value in the alt tag. Doesn't
this result in the same problem as having no alt tags at all, in that the
user will be prevented from finding out the reason for the image? I would
assume that in most cases the image has some meaning, and therefore would
benefit the user if they could have a description of it.

I don't doubt that on a very busy interface there might be call to reduce
the amount of text (although perhaps the page is overloaded anyway?) , but
such decisions should be made with a lot of caution, and only when there's
no other way to simplify the page. Otherwise,it might wrongly encourage
designers to use null values on images that would enhance the page.
