I agree with Kynn and Kelly that, at least for now, we should NOT be going 
after folks who use tables for layout.  Additional comments are in line.

Yep, it is not fair that blind/vi users have to buy expensive screen 
readers/magnification.  I also agree that issues of economic disadvantage 
ARE appropriate for discussion list.  But we can't do much at all about how 
expensive speech synthesis is.  It's not fair that some people are blind.

Well, its been over a year now since most screen readers learned to deal 
with tables used for layout.

Lynx (even a few revs. back) deals very well with tables (and frames). 
 (Better even than many current browser/screen reader combinations.)  If 
the version of Lynx native to a persons shell account does not cut it, 
there are many free current versions available by free with telnet.

Hardware speech synthesizers are still expensive, but recycled units can be 
found if one looks hard enough.  The Disk Operating System is free or very 
inexpensive (if you can even find it for sale) and the LATEST release of 
JAWS for DOS is FREE!  One can find 386 computers for free too.  There is 
plenty of good freeware, including the DOS version of Lynx.  Now, people 
who have the skills to put all this together into a workable system are 
rare.  Let me make it clear that I don't believe that just because someone 
is poor and/or disabled they deserve a second (or third) rate computer. 
 But I do want to make the point that lack of money is not (strictly 
speaking) a barrier to web access.  (It is a barrier to fun, fast, 
multimedia, modern access to the Internet, but that is a different 
argument.)

Nowadays, most people, disabled or not, simply are not interested in 
text-only applications.  Their expectations, for understandable reasons, 
are too high for this.  People have the right to make the choice that 
old-but-serviceable is not good enough.  I also think the poor and disabled 
should be accommodated at their local library (or other public place) with 
(fairly) modern equipment.  Given these two reasonable alternatives 
(low-cost-but-old, or public accommodation) I have a hard time with either 
plan that we (1) give away modern computers to everyone; or (2) dumb-down 
everything to the lowest common denominator (html 2.0)!

It IS wrong, but this is only a Priority 3 impediment.  As people have 
repeatedly pointed out, the positioning functions (and other features) of 
Style Sheets is STILL not supported by Netscape Navigator 4.7!  Until CSS 
is widely supported, authors have little PRACTICAL choice but to continue 
to use tables for layout.  So lets function on the Priority 1 and 2 goals 
of urging authors to use headers and summaries and make sure the table is 
intelligible when decolumnized.

I respectfully disagree.  Adding your four points together does NOT get us 
as much as it would cost to fight this battle.
