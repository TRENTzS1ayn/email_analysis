Hi Scott,

I originally sent these comments to another list where you posted your
message.  I don't know if you didn't get that response so here it is again.

I tried your page using Internet Explorer 5 and JFW 3.31 as well as
Window-Eyes 3.1.  I have a few comments.

1. Is it possible to list the access keys, for lack of a better term, in
some fashion that allows the screen reader to cursor directly through the
list, similar to using a word processor?  As it stands now, the screen
reader's focus is on the Ok button in the dialog box listing the keys and I
had to use screen review keys (Jaws cursor, JFW; Mouse Pointer,
Window-Eyes) to read the dialog box more than once.

2. It appeared to me that the only way to get the navigation keys you
listed to work was to turn off support for Microsoft Active Accessibility
in both JFW and Window-Eyes.  This is a toggle in both programs but having
to turn it off and on just to jump to the different sections of the page
seems sort of to defeat the purpose of having the access keys.

Kelly
