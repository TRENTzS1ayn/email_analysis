Hi, Len

I believe that the thread on tables may not be finished yet.

The issue of tables has a lot to do with positioning text
and also with color backgrounds.  For example, if there is a left column
index and a main column with header and body, the column index is read
first.  Nested tables for alinging blocks of colors in certain
ways in a column is another problem.  Because there can be so
many ways to use areas of color on a web page to create a certain
design effect, I would be careful not to make the assumption that
linearization is always readily achievable, e.g.:

          H    
        T      
      W        
    O          
  R            
G              
      
(For screen reader users, this is the word "GROWTH" with the letters
starting at the lower left corner and going towards the upper right.)


Z Z Z Z Z Z Z                 
          Z                   
        Z                     
      Z                       
    Z                         
  Z                           
Z Z Z Z Z Z Z                 

(This is a Z, made up of a lot of Z's.)

I'm not saying that default page should be impossible to use, but that
in a trade-off between visual appearance and visual accessibility, it
will be hard for designers to give up visual appearance.
