Mr. Luebking,
I noticed your comment "It be great if it can be tied into the 508
dates on web page accessibility."

The W3C has no control over the content and release date of the U.S. federal
agency's final Section 508 rules on access to electronic and information
technology.  These rules are currently being formalized within the agency
and could be issued at any moment; although the stated release date is "by
February 2000."

Hi,

The responses I've gotten about dynamic web pages which have been customized
for blind users have been so consistently positive that I am pretty
convinced that this approach is appropriate for blind users.
(If you have seen the examples and disagree, please let me know.)
I'd like to see the guidelines address the issue and was wondering what
the steps are for that.  It be great if it can be tied into the 508
dates on web page accessibility.

Scott
