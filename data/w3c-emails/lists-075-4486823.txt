I think he was referring to the government accessibility dates, which
I've heard quoted as:

"February 2000 the Access Board will announce a standard that must
be met."

"August 2000 is the deadline for compliance with accessibility
standards for government sites."

As there are people who know more about this than I do, on this
list -- including Judy herself -- I'd like it if someone could please
post more specific details about who, what, why, when, where, and how
for these dates.  Thanks in advance!
