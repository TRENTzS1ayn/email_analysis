Scott, Kynn,

Regarding timing of Section 508 regulations, I believe that the US Access
Board will first issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), which will
be followed by a public comment period; then the final rule would be issued
after the appropriate periods for public comment have concluded. 

Additional information on the Section 508 process is available from the
Access Board especially their Q&A on 508
<http://www.access-board.gov/eitaac/section-508-q&a.htm>. For other links
related to Sec 508 please look at the WAI policy reference links page under
that section <http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/Policy.html#508>.

Cynthia is right that the W3C does not control the content or timing of the
US Access Board's Section 508 rules. For comments on W3C documents
including WAI guidelines, that is through W3C; for comments on the US
federal agency's guidelines, that should be to the appropriate US federal
agency.
