Alan,

Look at the final report from EITAAC
<http://www.access-board.gov/pubs/eitaacrpt.htm> -- the Electronic and
Information Technology Access Advisory Committee -- and you will see that
EITAAC did consider both Web sites and Web-based applications to be covered
by the definition of electronic and information technology, and also that
there are references to WAI guidelines in this report. Equally important,
however, please note that this report was a recommendation to the Access
Board for their consideration, and is not the same as the final rules that
will eventually be issued on Section 508. A draft version of those rules
should be available in an NPRM (Notice of Proposed Rulemaking) shortly, and
then available after the conclusion of the public comment period sometime
in 2000 -- whether or not that will be by the originally intended February
2000 date is unclear.

Links to this report and to other documents related to US Section 508 are
available from WAI's policy reference links page at
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/Policy>, as are links to policy-related
documents in other countries. Additions are always welcome, please send to
my attention at jbrewer@w3.org.
