Scott,

There are some things that cannot be currently done accessibly. For those
things there are a few alternatives:

  1. Just don't. Consider whether something is really necessary, as well as
how it will appear. In addition, consider waiting for better technology, and
using it when it becomes available. Scalable Vector Graphics makes it easy to
achieve such effects in a form that will linearise perfectly well, containing
plain text that can be searched, selected, retrieved by search engines and
other metadata harvesters, etc.

  2. Use the best technology available. To make the word growth travel
diagonally up the page will break down in all kinds of situations. If it is
really necessary, the best solution may be to use an image, or a cascade of
object elements.

  3. Make a separate version. Unless you make it very obvious that there is
another version, and that it is up to date, this is not worth considering,
but as a last resort it is better than nothing. However, in the case where
this is the chosen approach, don't just amke a "text-only" version. There are
many features of accessible design that go beyond text, and many features of
ordianry design that are easy to use and valuable in an accessible version -
images, structure, well-designed actve elements, etc etc.

cheers

  Hi, Len
  
  I believe that the thread on tables may not be finished yet.
  
  The issue of tables has a lot to do with positioning text
  and also with color backgrounds.  For example, if there is a left column
  index and a main column with header and body, the column index is read
  first.  Nested tables for alinging blocks of colors in certain
  ways in a column is another problem.  Because there can be so
  many ways to use areas of color on a web page to create a certain
  design effect, I would be careful not to make the assumption that
  linearization is always readily achievable, e.g.:
  
            H    
          T      
        W        
      O          
    R            
  G              
        
  (For screen reader users, this is the word "GROWTH" with the letters
  starting at the lower left corner and going towards the upper right.)
  
  
  Z Z Z Z Z Z Z                 
            Z                   
          Z                     
        Z                       
      Z                         
    Z                           
  Z Z Z Z Z Z Z                 
  
  (This is a Z, made up of a lot of Z's.)
  
  I'm not saying that default page should be impossible to use, but that
  in a trade-off between visual appearance and visual accessibility, it
  will be hard for designers to give up visual appearance.
