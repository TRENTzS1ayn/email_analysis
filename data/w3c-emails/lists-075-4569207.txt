Found this link on Slashdot -- Al Gore visited Microsoft and wrote
an article on Slate, in which he said:

"After the discussion, I got a chance to visit Microsoft's Home of the Future--where I got a chance to see technology that was definitely impressive. My favorites were features of Windows 2000: magnification for the vision-impaired, and a voice that reads the screen to the blind."
