Found this link on Slashdot -- Al Gore visited Microsoft and wrote
an article on Slate, in which he said:

"After the discussion, I got a chance to visit Microsoft's Home of 
the Future--where I got a chance to see technology that was 
definitely impressive. My favorites were features of Windows 2000: 
magnification for the vision-impaired, and a voice that reads the 
screen to the blind."
