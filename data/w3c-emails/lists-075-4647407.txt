just weighing in here.  we've learned from Gregory and it has been
acknowledged by others that improperly marked up tables are a barrier
to some users and there is good evidence for using proper markup and
not using tables for lay out <decoration>.  Although this may be a
hard nut to crack, it is no less so than asking for captions in video
or audio descriptions and yet, we saw from judy that kin was in error
when he said if it comes down to making information available to some
was better than making it available to none according to the current
legal attitude.

We could argue back and forth all day for the justification of a
position on either side but it comes down to what our goal is.  We
have two of them as I see it.
1> provide information concerning the how tos and whys of
accessability for all.

2> be the poliece that helps inforce this practice.  In guarding your
door Bruce on both counts, you are like the company who is accused of
rong doing and then ttold to clean up its act and make sure it doesn't
happen again.  Like it or not, you are in a prime position to aid in
this but from this thread, it would seem that you are joining with
what we might call the enemy in this senario.  The guidelines were
hard to accept even a year ago and are still hard to accept but are
getting easier.  If you show people that it is possible to lay out
their datta without using tables and still make it look pretty or if
they use tables for lay out then to do certain things that make it
easier for all of us, I think they are just as likely to accept this
as any other guideline.

One of our biggest problems is the way all those legacy editing and
creation tools handle markup and that the people using them in large
numbers do not know a lick of html.

I know you better than is stated above but thought you'd like to know
that your statements on this thread have cast you in this light.

We are all on the same side right?
