I guess it is time to weight in on this one. First, I plead guilty to using
tables for layout!
It is darn hard to resist the flexibility you can achieve that makes your
pages look good no matter what size screen or resolution they are displayed
in. It seems to me that most of the table related complaints are because the
tables turn into gibberish when unstacked.  This usually seems to be the
result of a designer not considering this aspect and layering tables with in
tables with in tables (makes the code gibberish too).  It is probably easier
to say 'don't use tables' than 'don't use tables poorly' but I really don't
see the problem with using a simple table to make things line up nicely for
something like a list of links that will still make sense no matter which
way you 'stack' it. (other than it being a misuse of html of course - but
there are lots of cases of that)
