Scott,

Regarding your example of the letters "GROWTH" laid out starting in the
lower left and traveling up and to the right.  You're asserting I believe
that it would be hard to use tables in such a way that it linearizes to g r
o w t h.  Indeed, if all you did was lay out these 7 letters in a 7 by 7
row they would get read out backwards.  But it's pretty easy to make them
read correctly.  See

http://astro.temple.edu/~kasday/wai/tableorder.html

I agree with Charles by the way that if all you're trying to do is create a
visual effect then an image would be better, with alt text description.
However, we can still look at your example as an abstract challenge, which
is what I did.

I don't understand the Z example.

Len
