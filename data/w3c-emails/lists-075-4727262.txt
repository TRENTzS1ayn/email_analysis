Regarding using tables for layout.. which translates in practical terms to
not having any 2 dimensional layout at all... you said

>there are several things in WCAG that were accorded a priority 3 that should
>have been accorded a much higher priority -- this is one of them -- 

Are you pushing for a priority 1 or 2?

This gets into Evaluation and Repair land.  Web services that just
linearized tables would get around the problem. 

If such web services were available would you be content to leave the ban
on layout a priority 3?

I will now stand back...

Len

p.s.
the obvious way to linearize of course is to just delete <TABLE>, <TD>, and
<TH> tags, and replace <TR> with <BR> or <P>.  Kind of what lynx viewers
already do.
