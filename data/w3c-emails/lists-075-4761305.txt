we are all on the same side and all arguments and points here made are
valid.  the matter is that there are many who will not be able to
benefit from a site that uses tables or does not walk that thin line
of coding them correctly.  this is for lay out.  I was not saying that
kin is on an opposing side.  I was pointing out to those who think
that it is enough to do tables for lay out accessibly and I use the
term loosely here  that the argument that to provide access for some
rather than none at all as a rasionall has been shown not to have
benefit to us.  Strive for accessability in the broadest sense as
someone so aptly worded it before me.
Thanks!
