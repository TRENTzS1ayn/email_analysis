Of course it's unfair.  That's why tools should support accessibility,
and then we wouldn't have this problem -- someone could use Front
Page or Mozilla Editor, and produce a working, accessible web page.

Have you seen the "EMT"/"WAFT" idea?  That's been proposed on 
Scott Leubking's excellent "ba-univ-tech-access" list for just
such a case as this -- a university with trained web designers
who can do the accessibility magic for professors and other
staff who aren't skilled in HTML.

So, let's work on that. :)  Keep in mind that web accessibility (and
web design itself!) is a very young field -- the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines _just_ came out this year!

Developing templates is good and useful; we should consider identifying
the needs of those educators for their pages and then providing some
accessible examples.  Would you like to work on this?
