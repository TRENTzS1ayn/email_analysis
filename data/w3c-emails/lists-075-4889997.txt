Excellent idea.  Steven, I can accept the statement that there
-are- cases where linearized tables don't provide satisfactory
access -- in fact, I accidentally made one myself on a test design
for the Harvey Mudd College web page once -- but I'd like a 
concrete example or three that we could look, and ponder how
exactly we could convey context better.  Could you identify some
publicly accessible pages that have that problem?  Is Yahoo one
of them?
