Access to metadata about the page is probably a user agent issue.

There are other well-known schemes which include descriptions - for example
in the Dublin Core it is possible to provide a description for anything that
has a URI (image, webpage, website, etc). One project that I have been
working on is using metadata incorporated into images to provide descriptions
of the image, but I had not really thought about using it to describe
pages. It makes plenty of sense (I use descriptions of pages often when i am
searching...)

  I found this reference to meta data while searching the W3C site.
