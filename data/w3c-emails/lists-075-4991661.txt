Kin.  I'm not disagreeing with you.  I live in a world of balance and
have learned to accept and at times buy into it.  Balance is a key and
looking toward the future when these problems are solvable more
readily or removed from the arena is a good way to focus our energy. 
For now, I'm content to assist in working out the problems that we
face in a way that is equitable for all.
