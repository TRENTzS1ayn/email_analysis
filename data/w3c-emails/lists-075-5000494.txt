I'm not a lawyer, so I don't give legal opinions.  However, I would
oppose any laws that require me to do something if it will hurt my
company substantially, and I stand by that opinion while still fully
supporting the idea of universal accessibility.

In the same way, many Christians feel that acceptance of Jesus as a
personal savior is right for everyone, but would be against the laws
of this country being changed to require adoption of Christianity as
a state religion.

I believe accessibility is right, but I don't believe that you have the
right to drive me out of business despite my good faith efforts to do
as much as I can to make my site (or building) accessible.
