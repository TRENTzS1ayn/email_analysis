Can anyone describe a "universal" one approach that solves all
accessibility problems?

If not, can spokespersons for each type of disability (vision,
cognitive, physical, etc.) offer an opinion as to the precise solution
that would be an acceptable accommodation for everyone with their
specific disability?

I would like to hear comments about accessibility issues related to
using Windows, Macintosh, and other operating systems.

What feedback can you provide about the browser you use? What positive
and negative features of your browser relates to your personal access
issues?

What specific hardware and software have you used? What specific
positive and negative issues have you encountered?

I would like to take this information and request our local association
of community colleges to consider developing a course that addresses
access issues in terms of web design with the goal of launching a web
site in cooperation with the County Board of Education.

Your assistance would be appreciated.
