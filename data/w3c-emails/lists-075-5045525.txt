Mike,

readers can be (and are) amde for many features. In most cases they rely on
decent structure being present in the page they are trying to render, which
is a constant problem. Another problem is to get such tools deployed.

The User Agent Guidelines Working Group and the Evaluation and Repair Tools
Working Group deal extensivley with how to read what is out there, and The
Authoring Tool Guidelines Working Group deals with the question of how to get
the tools that are used to put content  out there to make sure that it is the
sort of structured, valid content that is necessary for such readers to work.

Cheers

Charles McCN
