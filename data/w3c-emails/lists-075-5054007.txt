It turns out you have more control over reading order than you might think,
even when you layout text with tables.  For example, you can have a menu
bar on the left that actually gets read after text to the right if it.
This assumes any browser, like lynx, that linearizes to read in the order
of the HTML.

For an example of this see

http://astro.temple.edu/~kasday/wai/tableorder2.html

So even without CSS layout, it can be reasonable to ask a web page author
to pay attention to reading order.  

(Aside from the possibility that the trick shown in the above web page may
not render well in early browsers.  I only tested it in NN and MSIE 4 and
Opera 3.5)

Plus there are other techniques like having links or keys (as in Scott's
demo) to jump you to specific spots.
