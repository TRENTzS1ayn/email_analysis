Claude,

this more or less describes what the Web Content Guidelines Working Group
does. I would suggest loking at the guidelines that group has produced, and
the furether work that they are looking at doing. In addition, the Education
and Outreach group has worked on some alternative presentations of the
guidelines - the quicktips card is one, and there are a set of slides which
are designed to teach people how to apply the web content guidelines to
writing web pages. Further information on these can be found at

Cheers

  Can anyone describe a "universal" one approach that solves all
  accessibility problems?
  
  If not, can spokespersons for each type of disability (vision,
  cognitive, physical, etc.) offer an opinion as to the precise solution
  that would be an acceptable accommodation for everyone with their
  specific disability?
  
  I would like to hear comments about accessibility issues related to
  using Windows, Macintosh, and other operating systems.
  
  What feedback can you provide about the browser you use? What positive
  and negative features of your browser relates to your personal access
  issues?
  
  What specific hardware and software have you used? What specific
  positive and negative issues have you encountered?
  
  I would like to take this information and request our local association
  of community colleges to consider developing a course that addresses
  access issues in terms of web design with the goal of launching a web
  site in cooperation with the County Board of Education.
  
  Your assistance would be appreciated.
