Let me see if I understand Cynthia's comments on Kynn's opinion that

If we're talking about a small business with total profits of $30,000 a
year, so that spending the extra 50,000 would bankrupt the company, then as
I understand it it's undue burden.

However, if we're talking about a company with profits in the Billions per
year, and this is merely an annual expense, it's no longer an undue burden,
right?
