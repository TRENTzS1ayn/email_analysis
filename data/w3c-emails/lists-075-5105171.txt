I don't know about research on this in specific, but in general
meta tags for keywords and descriptions are very valuable for
accessibility purposes because they can provide a good
"summary" of what the page is all about.  This is good for
slow or limited transmission media, such as speech -- a summary
would let you know if you're on the right page without having
to read the entire page, for example.

Naturally, they also help with search engines, and as you say,
they could be very useful for cognitive disabilities as well.
