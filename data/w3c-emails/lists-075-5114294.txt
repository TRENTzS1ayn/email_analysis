In many cases, a modern reader -can- accommodate the fashionable
trends in web design -- assuming that the web designer has given
the screenreader or voice browser enough information to accurately
represent the page.

Some ways of expressing information are very graphical -- frames
are a visual metaphor based on 'physical' location on a screen,
for example.  These are fine to use as long as you realize the
limits of the method, and provide adequate compensation for those
limitations.
