aloha, len!

you asked:
quote
Are you pushing for a priority 1 or 2?

This gets into Evaluation and Repair land.  Web services that just
linearized tables would get around the problem. 

If such web services were available would you be content to leave the ban
on layout a priority 3?
unquote

yes, but only if their maintainers pledged to keep them at stable URIs in
perpetuity; to use browser sniffing responsibly, so as to tailor the
linearization for the user agent requesting the content marked up using TABLE;
and to conscientiously maintain and keep them up-to-date...

which, is, i know, a hell of a lot to ask, but the wages of sin ain't never
cheap, 
gregory
ps: there's no need to step back -- we're moving forward!
