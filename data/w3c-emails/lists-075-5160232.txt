The difference between null and missing ALT text is the real life behaviors of
browsers.  In somecases, MISSING alt text is PREFERABLE to null alt text!

<Q>2.8 When alternative text has been specified explicitly as empty (i.e., an
empty string), render nothing.</Q>

This is how Lynx currently behaves, but not pwWebSpeak.  The guidelines say
nothing about what to do about missing alt (and  invalid html, of which would
be one example.  Lynx (and the big two with image loading off) generate
something like [IMAGE].  This is different behavior than ALT=" " or
ALT="nbsp;".  The bigger problem is when an image is a link.  With Lynx, each
link normally gets a number, so the following snippets of code are shown next
to the default rendering with Lynx:
<A HREF="foobar.html"><IMG SRC="foobar.gif"></A>    [1][LINK]
<A HREF="foobar.html"><IMG SRC="foobar.gif" ALT="Foobar"></A>    [2]Foobar
<A HREF="foobar.html"><IMG SRC="foobar.gif" ALT=" "></A>    [3]
<A HREF="foobar.html"><IMG SRC="foobar.gif" ALT=""></A>

Notice that the last example generates nothing!  If "hidden" links are the ONLY
links on a page, Lynx generates a warning, but otherwise these hidden links are
effectively invisible.  (One can list all links on a page, or look at the
source code, but these are extreme time consuming measures.)

We have been over this before, and many have made the arguement that ALT="" is
frequently appropriate.  I agree that it should be valid html, but I think this
is a point where the WCAG could make a clear unabigious distinction.

The problem with ALT="" is that it is ambiguous.  You don't know WHY the author
put that in there.  Is he just trying to get his code validated?  Is this
REALLY just a decorative, content-free graphic?  Does he have something against
text-based browsers?  Is this some kind of spacer image?  Did he just forget?

IMHO, ALT="" is NEVER prefereable to other choices.

For decorative graphics, use a single non-alphanumeric character.  There is
ALWAYS a punctuation mark that is closer in meaning (closer than nothing
anyway) to a "content free" image.

The burden of repeated links (one big arguement for using ALT="" within <A HREF
... /A>) is much less of a problem than the chance of missing content and
links!
