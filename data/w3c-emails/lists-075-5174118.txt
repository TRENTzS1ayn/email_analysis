Bruce,
 Thank you for the clear statements on this issue. From a personal
standpoint I have frequently be annoyed by the use of alt="", I am always
left wondering what the intent was and what I might be missing, on the other
hand I don't really need to be told about every little 'spacer.gif', that
too can be annoying. A system of punctuation marks to indicate the function
of various graphics seems like a great solution but since we seem to have
trouble getting people to use any alt= in many cases, it seems like a bit of
a dream.
