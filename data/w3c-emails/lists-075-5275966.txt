I'm going to get killed for saying this, but all we need is a text
file with boothnumbers, urls and email addresses and an explanation of
the company/exhibitor.  I don't think I could fathom any floor plan
that was done electronically or If I could, it would take a darn lot
of reading.  Here is a sketch of a way to do it though.
each set of coordinates has a link whose name is that of the booth
holder/occupant.  going to that link, you find where it is and its
number.  for instance, it is on the far left isle or the second isle
from the left facing the back of the floor.  its booth number is: xxxx
and it holds -------- within and any other pertenant info.  in the
same way, you can have links to front egress, rear egress, left and
right egresses and other points of interest as well such as restrooms
and floor transits.

links to the exhiborts web sites and email addresses phone numbers and
postal addresses would all be in each vendors information followed
from their link or on a list to which it points.

tactile maps at best are clunky and often it is easy to become
disoriented because there are no real landmarks on the floor to
indicate yourprecice location as you are moving around the floor
unless you can smell popcorn or hear something or ask someone.  I hope
I'm getting this across well.  it would even be cool to have this set
up in some sort of real time fashion so we could drop in on live
action at a booth or workshop.
