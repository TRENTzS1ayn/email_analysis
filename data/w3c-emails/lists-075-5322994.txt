It's a matter of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing, it
would seem.

If this document meets the compatibility guidelines in the Proposed
Recommendation for XHTML 1.0, you might want to send a bug report to
<w3c-html-review@w3.org> as well, as a comment against the compatibility
achievements of XHTML 1.0.

Your site, http://www.ucitd.com/ does not open when on a Macintosh using
MSIE 4.01!  Instead of browsing, I get prompted to "Save downloaded file
to".  (The saved file is, of course,  ascii html.)  I even tried browsing
(directly) to http://www.ucitd.com/index.cfm?type=text but got the same
results.  (..index.html and ..index.htm just got 404 errors.)  Navigator
(on the Mac) does not have this problem.  Can anyone else on the list
confirm this behavior?
