Hi Rich:
I think this is a very innovative idea, but I too could not make sense of much of anything beyond simple straight lines.
I think that an SVG or XML approach still provides the best means of getting information such as what objects are on the screen and how they are connected.
In order for the soundscapes approach to really work would take RI AI (Real Intelligent Artificial Intelligence) pattern recognition.  I don't think the eye-brain system of humans works by scanning one bit stream at a time but I'm talking outside my area of expertise here.
P.S. slightly off topic:
I've heard about a manual that is produced by either APH (American Printing House for the Blind) or LOC's NLS/BPH 
Library of Congress National Library Service For the Blind and Physicall Handicapped.
Does anyone know if this is online anywhere or available to NLS members on audio cassette?
-Thanks in advance for any info on this.
-Steve

Hi.
Has anyone played with these "sound scapes" Peter talks about here? I've 
tried listening to a few from his web page, but having never seen (not even 
light), I have a hard time making any kind of sense out of anything but the 
simplest of "images" (one straight line). How useful is this to those of 
you with limited vision, or with no vision but prior visual experiene? Some 
may argue that given enough training, this can become a viable way of 
"seeing." I think the learning process would be very painful, slow, and 
frustrating. What do you-all think?

> 1. Left and Right.
>
>    Video is sounded in a left to right scanning order, by
>    default at a rate of one image snapshot per second. You
>    will hear the stereo sound pan from left to right
>    correspondingly. Hearing some sound on your left or right
>    thus means having a corresponding visual pattern on your
>    left or right, respectively.
>
> 2. Up and Down.
>
>    During every scan, pitch means elevation: the higher
>    the pitch, the higher the position of the visual pattern.
>    Consequently, if the pitch goes up or down, you have a
>    rising or falling visual pattern, respectively.
>
> 3. Dark and Light.
>
>    Loudness means brightness: the louder the brighter.
>    Consequently, silence means black, and a loud sound means
>    white, and anything in between is a shade of grey.
>
> All of this means, for example, that a straight bright line on
> a dark background, running from the bottom left to the top right,
> sounds as a tone steadily increasing in pitch: ooiieep. Two bright
> lines give two tones. Three distinct bright dots sound as three
> short beeps, and so on. Although the rules are simple, real-life
> images like the photograph of Kynn often give very complex sounds,
> because there is so much to be seen.
