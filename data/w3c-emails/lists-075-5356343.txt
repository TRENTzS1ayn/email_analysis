Again, I don't care whether the image came from a photo, a crayon drawing, 
an oil painting, etc. If there is any relevant info there, just tell me 
with as few words as possible. If the logo is echoed by a title which is 
already present in text, then just make the alt tag null. For example, if 
you have your "ACME Corp logo" image above a title "ACME Corporation", then 
in your representation you would hear "ACME Corp logo ACME Corporation", 
which is redundant. I've seen this type of thing out there more than once.

Disclaimer: I'm totally blind, never having seen anything at all in my 
life, not even light. My perspective may thus be quite different than 
someone who has seen or can see some at present. Please do not take these 
comments as other than simply my opinion. I'd sure like to know what others 
think, however.
