Hi, Kelly and Paul, I would be interested in this too.  As I mentioned
earlier this month, the HTML Writers Guild (obviously not a college,
but at least, an educational organization) has recently adopted a
policy similar to that which you describe -- we require that our
"partners" who provide services to our members do so in an accessible
way, so as not to exclude our HWG members who have disabilities.
