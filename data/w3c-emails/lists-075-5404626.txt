Rich:
I am now totally blind but had 20/200 (borderline legally blind) vision in one eye only up  until 1990.  From my perspective as well, I am only interested in alt text if it is relevant to me understanding whatever the purpose of the picture is.
That is, in the extreme case of, say, an art exhibit on the web attempting to give comparative analysis of artists' techniques and/or an historical perspective, I would want enough alt text to determine what the similarities and differences are.  So this would include comments about colors, lines, shapes etc. in enough detail so I can understand these similarities and differences.  I am not interested in descriptions of decorative graphics.
I think I do agree with Alan just about all the time.  He seems to be saying what to me seems to be common sense: "Why did you put this picture on this page?"
If this particular picture conveys a particular idea, mood, piece of information to a sighted viewer, try to provide  an alt text description of that (the idea , mood, or piece of information) in as concise a way as you can.
On the other hand, if your site or set of pages on your site is really there for the sole purpose of saying to your visitors "Here is a collection of nice looking pictures, I hope you find them enjoyable to look at too." , I don't think I would be offended if alt text was not provided.  I would be happy just to hear "This page consists of a collection of nice looking pictures." so I can move on to another site!
personally, for purely (What do I say here? educational/pedogogical reasons), I think everyone should think a little bit why a particular thing (whether picture, audio file, poem, set of links, etc.) was chosen.

Again, I don't care whether the image came from a photo, a crayon drawing, 
an oil painting, etc. If there is any relevant info there, just tell me 
with as few words as possible. If the logo is echoed by a title which is 
already present in text, then just make the alt tag null. For example, if 
you have your "ACME Corp logo" image above a title "ACME Corporation", then 
in your representation you would hear "ACME Corp logo ACME Corporation", 
which is redundant. I've seen this type of thing out there more than once.

Disclaimer: I'm totally blind, never having seen anything at all in my 
life, not even light. My perspective may thus be quite different than 
someone who has seen or can see some at present. Please do not take these 
comments as other than simply my opinion. I'd sure like to know what others 
think, however.
