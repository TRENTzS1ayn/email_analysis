Re the ALT text

ALT="The Pines Hotel, a fine old stone building in extensive grounds."

The picture gives two pieces of information it seems to me.

1. There are extensive grounds, presumably for walking around, something of
interest to anyone, sighted or blind.  Maybe particularly interesting for a
person with a dog.

2. It's an old stone building which suggests other amenities that may also
interest people
   blind or sighted.  E.g. quiet rooms to chat, unhurried meal service
(although of course it's no guarantee.  The inside may have been gutted and
replaced with some ghastly substitute).  Also, those surroundins may be
attractive to a sighted companion.

A sighted viewer of the page gets that info immediately, right at the top,
without scanning any further down the page.

Now, suppose that information is nowhere else on the page, or buried way down.

Should the ALT text be included?

I don't think I would be offended if alt text was not provided.  I would be
happy just to hear "This page consists of a collection of nice looking
pictures." so I can move on to another site!
