Thank you for the support.

Yes and no. As the list of U.S.U. web accessibility requirements grew (from
Priority 1 to most of Priority 2), I wanted to make sure that I wasn't
pushing my luck within the group. As of yet, I have not formally recommended
any of the Priority 3 checkpoints. Luckily, I am the one drafting the policy
and I have some freedom with regard to its wording and criteria. The policy
is due for official review next week, and, in accordance with your
suggestion, I will revisit the Priority 3 guidelines.

You mentioned the language attribute. Which other checkpoints from Priority
3 would you recommend as system-wide requirements? I open this question up
to the group (...keeping in mind that one of my goals is to not instigate a
major backlash from existing webmasters that would frustrate my efforts).
