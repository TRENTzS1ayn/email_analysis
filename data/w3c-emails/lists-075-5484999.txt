I played with the sound scapes recently and a while ago.  Anything but the 
simplest geometric shapes was just noise to me.  I think the technology may 
have promise for real time use (where the user is controlling the up/down 
left/right component), but products that work that way (for navigating the 
real world) are already available.  By the time AI is sufficiently advanced 
to process these sounds intelligibly, we would already have better 
automated pattern/graphic recognition!  This is well beyond my area of 
expertise, and the idea is novel and interesting, but I don't see the real 
world application.
