Al,

You make some good points.  *NEXT* year I will have to see if they can 
implement a strict Euclidean X,Y coordinate scheme for booth assignment. 
 There is a committee that is working to assure that there are volunteers 
to meet attendees who are blind.  These folks won't be orientation and 
mobility specialist though.

You might be on to something with your idea for an "aislewise index" to the 
floorplan.  Can you point me to some example?  This work will NOT be done 
by the "floor planners" but after the fact.

But jeez:

Do you think we will be handing out laptops and portable Global Positioning 
Systems at the door?
