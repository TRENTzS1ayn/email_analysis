This is actually just good writing practice as well. It's been a
requirement at all the publishing houses I've worked with for computer
books, and goes beyond just abbreviations and acronyms to include jargon
and technical words the average reader isn't likely to know (e.g. This past
year, John learned HTML, the HyperText Markup Language, which is used to
created Web pages.  and   Riboflavin, the vitamin more commonly known as
Vitamin B2, has the following properties.....)

The practice increases overall comprehension for everyone!
