Only the person that included the image knows why it  there. Alt= should 
be
 used to tell us why the picture is there - longdesc is for describing the
 'look'. Telling someone they are misusing the alt= seems to me to be
 treading on 'artistic interpretation'.
 In the Hotel picture example, for instance either alt would seem to be
correct depending on the reason the picture was there. Is the selection 
 of
 the particular picture "The Pines Hotel, a fine old stone building in
 extensive grounds" important to its function, or could any picture of a
 building severed its purpose in the context? And I still don't care for 
 the
 use of alt="", makes me feel 'left out'.
