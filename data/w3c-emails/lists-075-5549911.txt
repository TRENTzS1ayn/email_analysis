Is longdesc going to make it in the next guidelines or be supported.  Not
sure what the latest and greatest is?

Only the person that included the image knows why it  there.
Alt= should 
be
 used to tell us why the picture is there - longdesc is for
describing the
 'look'. Telling someone they are misusing the alt= seems to
me to be
 treading on 'artistic interpretation'.
 In the Hotel picture example, for instance either alt would
seem to be
correct depending on the reason the picture was there. Is
the selection 
 of
 the particular picture "The Pines Hotel, a fine old stone
building in
 extensive grounds" important to its function, or could any
picture of a
 building severed its purpose in the context? And I still
don't care for 
 the
 use of alt="", makes me feel 'left out'.
