Dear Peter,

I just verified this phone number.  This company does NOT have a web site!
Nurion Industries
Station Square, Building 2, Paoli, Pennsylvania 19301.
Tel: 610/640-2345

You can find similar products from Trace's HyperAbleData at starting with 
the "Type of Product" search at URL:
http://www.trace.wisc.edu/conet-bin/xad?Mn=index.html&db=1&p=20&Opt=22
Follow the link for "Sensory Disabilities" then "Blind and Low Vision" then 
"Travel Canes".
Take a look at the products listed under "Auditory Cane", "Laser Cane", and 
"Vibrating Cane".
I could not find ANY manufacturer URLs, but I have used working prototypes 
and shipping products for at least five years, perhaps longer.  Sorry.  All 
of these devices have been expensive and in limited production.  My 
impression is that most users have not found the products to be that great, 
and certainly not worth the asking price.  Vendors, for their part, have 
had a hard time getting the word out to potential customers.

No, I am referring to electronic canes!  (see above)
