It can be hard if the applet is actually interactively doing something,
e.g. it's a little physics simulation.  But when applets are used
decoratively, e.g. to scroll text, it's pretty simple to have alterative
equivalent content that appears when applets are turned off (just put
alternative content between the last PARAM and the closing </applet>.   In
this case the alternative is merely the text that's scrolled, possibly
including links. 

Similarly with some SCRIPTS where it's simple to have a NOSCRIPT.

Perhaps your guidelines could make this distinction and be tougher on the
simpler cases.

Thank you very much for bringing up this thread by the way (I'm also at a
University).
