Your point is a good one. For the most part, however, it seems that the kind
of alternative content which you describe is already covered in Priority 1,
1.1. The way that I interpreted the Priority 2 reference to scripts and
applets was that the scripts/applets themselves had to be accessible as
opposed to an alternative format.

Original Message:

[...] when applets are used
decoratively, e.g. to scroll text, it's pretty simple to have alterative
equivalent content that appears when applets are turned off (just put
alternative content between the last PARAM and the closing </applet>.   In
this case the alternative is merely the text that's scrolled, possibly
including links.
Similarly with some SCRIPTS where it's simple to have a NOSCRIPT.

Perhaps your guidelines could make this distinction and be tougher on the
simpler cases.
