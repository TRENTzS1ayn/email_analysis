We could use typed images i.e.

<img src="clear.gif" src="" class="non-functional">

so that evaluation and repair tools don't report on null strings which
are there deliberately.

Or how about a space or &nbsp; (is this legal)?

I suspect there are solutions - but it would require the software
vendors to agree on a solution.
