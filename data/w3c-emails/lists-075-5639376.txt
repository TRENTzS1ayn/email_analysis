All along we have been using ALT=" ". This has been the defacto standard on
how to call a image spacer, so if there is a change then we and many other
people will need to go back and re-code these pages!

We could use typed images i.e.

<img src="clear.gif" src="" class="non-functional">

so that evaluation and repair tools don't report on null
strings which
are there deliberately.

Or how about a space or &nbsp; (is this legal)?

I suspect there are solutions - but it would require the
software
vendors to agree on a solution.
