accessibility is right, but I don't believe that you have the right to

as I can to make my site (or building) accessible. <<

Kynn,

You are absolutely correct that no one has the right to drive you out
of business because of accessibility costs. If this happened you'd
have to blame it on an incompetent judge or your rotten lawyer because
the ADA specifically prohibits it. Businesses are only required to
make accommodations that are "reasonable" and that would not be an
"undue burden." These terms have more case law history than many
people think, but even in an unlitigated area like website commerce,
putting you out of business or even hurting your business
"substantially" would not be legal.
