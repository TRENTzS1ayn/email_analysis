Hi folks, I got this request from one of the students in my web
accessibility class -- anyone got these figures handy?  I don't have
a good head for statistics, comes from being a blond. :)

>    One reviewer wants "figures on the numbers of sight- and

>American
>population, student-age population, students potentially interested in
>journalism and mass communications." I know the last one is off the wall,
>but do you know where I might find some figures for the first two
>categories?
