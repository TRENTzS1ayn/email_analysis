You are correct; the third category is off the wall.  However, Beth Haller,
faculty of Townson State University near Baltimore, MD has been very
involved in a communication and disability organization.  You may want to
contact her. The following is contact information for disabillity stats.

Hi folks, I got this request from one of the students in my web
accessibility class -- anyone got these figures handy?  I don't have
a good head for statistics, comes from being a blond. :)

>    One reviewer wants "figures on the numbers of sight- and
>hearing-impaired in any or all of the following categories: total
>American
>population, student-age population, students potentially interested
in
>journalism and mass communications." I know the last one is off the
wall,
>but do you know where I might find some figures for the first two
>categories?
