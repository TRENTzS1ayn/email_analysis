I thought you might like to know the following

one of my students is very keen on wordsearches, 
(note that the meaning of the words is not  required)
She found a suitable website within minutes unaided and has had minimal
experience of using the www.
one of her own creations will be on our homepage this weekend.

another equally able and experienced student was looking for a map of the UK.
after half an hour, I started to help a little harder, and we eventually found
a rather useless and very small one.

I realize this does not help generalise issues, however I do feel that it is
important for us to discuss the means of access as well as html and indeed xml.

symantics is not a suitable metaphor it is the limbic system I seek, 
seat of the emotions.
