On the other hand, in the market of educational CDs and toys you will find
many contenders: computer-accessible atlases and interactive globes.

Don't be surprised at this.  End-user data speeds are still generally
inadequate for the delivery of high quality maps.

I hope, as a teacher, that you are not solely concerned with emotions.  The
current Consumer Reports has an interesting review of educational products
as possible gifts.  They rated them separately on fun and
"problem-solving."  I would guess that you want to keep fun above some
minimum and then maximize the problem-solving value of the experience, once
the fun level is acceptable.  I understand that for many of your clients
the web just isn't enough fun yet to keep them at it.
