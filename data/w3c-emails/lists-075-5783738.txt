Leonard, 

Your analysis is correct except for one small detail.  There are alot more
deaf/hard of hearing users on the internet than you propose in your
analysis.  

What might be deemed as a compromise solution to the problem you bring up
is a phased approach to making one's site completely accessible.  For if
you could put the arguement for not making your multi-media files
accessible, why wouldn't the same arguement work for mot making the web
site accessible for the blind/visually impairred?  

Just something to ponder when you want to talk about accessibility over
the web.
