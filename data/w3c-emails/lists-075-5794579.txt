Because in some cases it might be harder/more work/more expensive
to make the web accessible to some groups than to others.

For example, ALT text on images is a "poster child" for blind accessibility,
and transcripts are the same for deaf accessibility.  However, it's easier
and less time-consuming (and therefore less expensive) to add ALT text
than to add a transcript.

Some may wish to argue legal specifics here, and that's fine, but we
have to also consider the economic impact of our demands, because that's
what the people who make the decisions are going to have to consider
as well.
