What about using audio descriptions.  I guess that that is also too
expensive to do.  I'm sorry, but making video content accessible is just as
important to me as making a web site accessible with alt text tags.  The
tests to do are two fold.  

1.  Is the accessible solution proposed technically feasible?  

2.  is it readily achievable?  Readily achievable can be looked at in
various ways as this is a very vague term.  Does it mean that you need to
go back and make everything accessible from the time you started doing
business on the net?  I don't think so, not when you put the arguement of
cost against the accessible solution in making the company go bankrupt.
However, I do believe that it means to plan and budget properly so that
future presnetations will take into account the need of accessible
solutions for all people.  

Just for your information, closed captioning on taped video content not
only gives access to the deaf/hard of hearing, but in conjunction with the
audio description which help theblind/visually impairred community, the
learning/cognitively impairred populations benefit by having the redundency
in information being presented.  Please remember this when you think about
wanting to make some type of video presentation via the web.  yes, it is
technically feasible and yes, it can be readily achievable if you plan and
budget properly for the accessible solution.
