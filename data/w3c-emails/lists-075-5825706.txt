Of course emotion is not all, however the approaches currently outlined in the
guidelines tend to reflect the concerns of the programmers rather than the
interests of observers.

People commenting on the huge success of certain sites, eg blairproject or
that famous film review site, would not usually refer to point 1.1, 1.2  and
1.3.

recognisig that this is not inspiring fayre for the general punter.

The difference, between finding maps and wordsearches has little to do with
graphic image sites.
rather  that describing a map with words is not trivial, and  that any
wordsearch will do, but one is looking for a particular map.
