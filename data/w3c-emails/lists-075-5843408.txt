I have been having a little trouble getting what I want past the parser.

could anyone show me a cleaner piece of code to do what I want at
www.peepo.com it looks ok but the code stinks!

I would also like some air between the words to be found 
<tr></tr><tr></tr> works but the parser was screaming.
