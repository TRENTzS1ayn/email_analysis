Jeffrey,

re your comment that

Actually,   I wasn't making any assumptions about the number of Deaf or 
hard of hearing users on the internet, although I was responding to someone 
who said that it was "perhaps 1%".   (It can be tricky counting the 
greaterthan signs to figure out who said what).   You're no doubt right 
that 1% is an underestimate though: e.g. according to the 1992 census

http://codi.buffalo.edu/graph_based/.demographics/.awd/AWD/AWD.html

5.6% of the population 15 and older has difficulty "hearing normal 
conversation".

But the main point is that even if the number had been as small as 1%, 
businesses would be obligated to accommodate them under ADA unless it was 
an "undue burden".
