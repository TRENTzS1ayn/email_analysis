Wendy recently posted a quick note about a FREE "(Volunteer) Tape Recording 
Manual" by the National Braille Association.  I ordered mine the day she 
made the post (thank you Wendy).  Call your local (or the national) library 
for the blind and print handicapped.  The document was last copywritted in 
1996 but it is not clear what was changed from the 1979 edition.

It is pretty good with lots of examples.  It is a little long (68 pages) 
but more than half is reference material.  Everything in there is very 
applicable to writing longdesc.  IMHO, it is a work that desperately needs 
to be converted to HTML.

(FYI, the map example -- much simpler than the one I posted to this list -- 
goes on for more than half a page.)
