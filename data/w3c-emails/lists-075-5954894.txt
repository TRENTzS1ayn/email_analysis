Thanks Bruce and Wendy and all.
I too would like to see this in HTML.
I agree it would provide valueable aid for writing longdesc although I would like to see us go even further than a static longgdescc.  This would involve interactivity as I discussed on the "How to describe flowcharts..." thread back in August.
That long math example probably would be a case in point.

Wendy recently posted a quick note about a FREE "(Volunteer) Tape Recording 
Manual" by the National Braille Association.  I ordered mine the day she 
made the post (thank you Wendy).  Call your local (or the national) library 
for the blind and print handicapped.  The document was last copywritted in 
1996 but it is not clear what was changed from the 1979 edition.

It is pretty good with lots of examples.  It is a little long (68 pages) 
but more than half is reference material.  Everything in there is very 
applicable to writing longdesc.  IMHO, it is a work that desperately needs 
to be converted to HTML.

(FYI, the map example -- much simpler than the one I posted to this list -- 
goes on for more than half a page.)
