<Q>Every Wednesday morning in BW Online's Daily Briefing, John Williams' 
Assistive Technology column can help you learn
what's hot and what's not in this exploding market. As disabled people 
become an increasingly important part of the American
workforce, John critiques the new technologies and products that help the 
disabled to realize their potential as successful,
productive employees. John knows this market inside and out -- he has 25 
years of experience writing about disability issues.
Follow his columns, collected here -- so you can stay in the know.</Q>

He offers these recent articles on accessible web design (sorry, I can't 
get rid of the frames!):

Can Visually Impaired Surfers Get Around on Your Web Site? (10/10/99)
http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/nov1999/nf91110d.htm

Making Web Sites Easier for the Disabled to Use (9/1/99):
http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/sep1999/nf90901a.htm

Now, in only Mr. Williams could take care of the missing ALT tags and 
persistent frames (both severe obstacles to accessibility) for at least his 
little corner of BWOL!

Kynn, both are good for:  http://aware.hwg.org/media/
