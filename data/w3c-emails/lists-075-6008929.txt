Thank you to those who provided feedback on my previous postings regarding
the forthcoming web accessibility guidelines for Utah State University. Now
that the draft is in a formal format, I would once again like to invite
members of this mailing list to offer their feedback.

The URL for the draft can be found in the next paragraph. First some
additional background: As soon as the policy is approved (probably before
January 2000), it will immediately apply to all new web pages at the
university. As such, we have included all the elements of priority 1 and 2
plus some elements of priority 3 in our guidlelines. We will draft an
additional policy with regard to existing web pages, with a grace period in
which to comply (conditions are yet to be determined). We will also draft an
additional policy with regard to third-party vendors (this may take longer).
Please scrutinize the policy for errors of fact, misstatements, etc. We want
the document to be as technically accurate as possible. Many of the
guidelines are either direct quotes from W.A.I. guidelines or paraphrases of
them. Note that we will include "how-to" pages on the site as well as the
guidelines themselves, but these have yet to be drafted.

Having made those explanations, I now present you with the URL:
