WAI Interest Group:

If you intended to review and comment on the User Agent Accessibility
Guidelines Last Call, there's still a bit of time: the last call review
period officially closes today, Wednesday Dec 1, but if you have comments
please send them in. 

The User Agent Guidelines Working Group has been receiving a number of
comments, and it's very helpful to have the fresh perspectives on it. Lots
of people on this list (the WAI Interest Group list) are often discussing
issues related to browsers, multi-media players, & assistive technologies
that work with these, so here's a chance to get those thoughts into a W3C
document before it becomes final.

Here's the original request for Last Call review: 
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/1999OctDec/0394.html>
And here's the document to review:
<http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19991105/>

Note that there's also a checklist that goes along with that, which is good
for an overview:

<http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19991105/checkpoint-list.html>
And there's a Techniques document also:
<http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-USERAGENT-TECHS/>

Please send any comments to:
<w3c-wai-ua@w3.org>

Thanks very much,

- Judy
