Hi all,
I'm trying to understand the new <OBJECT> element in HTML 4.0 as it
relates to accessibility.  I've tried it to place an image in IE5 and got
nothing.  Anyone know of a source that shows which HTML 4.0 elements are
supported by which browsers?  I've seen such for CSS (although all of the
one's I've seen are for CSS1 and not CSS2), but need same for HTML 4.0 and
would be grateful if someone could spare me the time digging.

Thanks,
