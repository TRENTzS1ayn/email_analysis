Karine, have a look at http://www.w3.org/Talks/1999/11/15-WAI-MS/slide5-0

IE 5.0 should handle it properly. etscape 4.x handles object fine for media
types that are not natively rendered, so it doesn't do it for images or text
types, but works for movies. IE 4 puts it in a scrolling box, even if the box
is bigger than the contents. Amaya deals with it fine for image types it
supports - I haven't tried it for other types of content. And I haven't tried
other browsers either. I just tried lynx on that page - it gives access to
the object as (image) when links for all images is turned on. I will play ith
that a little more.

  Hi all,
  I'm trying to understand the new <OBJECT> element in HTML 4.0 as it
  relates to accessibility.  I've tried it to place an image in IE5 and got
  nothing.  Anyone know of a source that shows which HTML 4.0 elements are
  supported by which browsers?  I've seen such for CSS (although all of the
  one's I've seen are for CSS1 and not CSS2), but need same for HTML 4.0 and
  would be grateful if someone could spare me the time digging.
  
  Thanks,
