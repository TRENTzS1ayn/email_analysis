"PERVASIVE COMPUTING 2000"

January 25-26, 2000
National Institute of Standards and Technology
Gaithersburg, Maryland

"Pervasive Computing" is the strongly emerging trend toward:
     Numerous, casually accessible, often invisible computing devices
     Mobile or embedded in the environment
     Connected to an increasingly ubiquitous network structure

Failing to see and act upon this trend may be very costly to U. S.
Information Technology companies; just as it was for mainframe companies
to
ignore the emergence of personal computers; and for the PC companies to
ignore the infant World Wide Web.

The innovative firms which establish a critical mass relatively early in
the generation life cycle are usually the ones with superior returns on
investment.

For computer users, the underlying premise is compelling: simplicity of
use, ubiquitous access, minimal technical expertise, reliability and
more
intuitive interaction methods. Through intelligent use of technologies,
Pervasive Computing presents an unusual opportunity to better serve
human
needs.

TOPICS: Human-computer interaction, pico-cellular wireless, multimedia
information access, service discovery, human-centered integration and
interoperability, programming pervasive computing applications, and
innovative pervasive computing devices
