DIR depends on the browser - old browsers presented it as a columnar list I
think, but now they handle it as UL. Anyway, using it to indent text is
wrong. Use a style sheet. There is no other correct and reliable way to do
the job. But then if users are so concerned about presentation why do they
use outdated browsers?

  <DIR> do it and how will it hold up on older browsers?  Thanks for your
