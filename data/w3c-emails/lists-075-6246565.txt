>>CSS is what you want to use here. Something such as the
following:


div.section1 {
             margin-left:20px
             }

in the head section or in a linked style sheet.


Then: <div
      class="section1">

in the code.

This will "degrade gracefully" in older browsers, although
it will NOT be
indented.
