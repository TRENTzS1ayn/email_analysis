Dear All,
My agency recently got a $50,000 grant from the local "Job Services" agency 
to develop ten low-maintenance computer setups that could accommodate a 
broad range of physical and sensory disabilities.  We have had the first of 
ours in the field for a few months now and things are going pretty well.  I 
have just completed the "documentation" for this project.  I am hoping you 
all will provide some feedback on the equipment that we ended up with.  I 
also welcome comments about the site design.  I hope to get some photos of 
the completed unit, preferably with customers!  In the meantime, please 
take a look at URL:

Responses to me or the list as you feel appropriate.
