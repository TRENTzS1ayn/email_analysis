I suppose this depends on the traffic your web site sees, your definition
of "rely," and the extent to which you really need to indent a section of
text.

On the sites I run, 93% to 98% of our users come in with browsers that
would either display that CSS example as intended, or have been explicitly
configured not to do so--a decision I'm not about to argue with.  0% of
the browsers on our web site would have their display broken by the
example.  That's the graceful degradation mentioned earlier in the thread.
On other web sites, the first number will vary, but the second number will
remain 0%.  So you can rely on CSS not to break the user's display, if you
choose to define "rely" that way.

If your need for indented text is such that it can't tolerate a
non-indented display on at least some displays, you eventually have to
consider if you should be using a page description language like PDF
instead of HTML.
