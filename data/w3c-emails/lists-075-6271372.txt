Assume that people who have browsers which do not support CSS are probably
not very interested in presentation controlled to the level provided by CSS.

  in the head section or in a linked style sheet.
  
  
  Then: <div
        class="section1">
  
  in the code.
  
  This will "degrade gracefully" in older browsers, although
  it will NOT be
  indented.
