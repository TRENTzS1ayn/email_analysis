Its not about whether or not your browser supports CSS, rather its about
what the corporate design standards are.  What jamie is asking is, "How do
you do this if you do not use CSS"

Assume that people who have browsers which do not support
CSS are probably
not very interested in presentation controlled to the level
provided by CSS.

Something such as the
  following:
  
  
  div.section1 {
               margin-left:20px
               }
  
  in the head section or in a linked style
sheet.
  
  
  Then: <div
        class="section1">
  
  in the code.
  
  This will "degrade gracefully" in older
browsers, although
  it will NOT be
  indented.
