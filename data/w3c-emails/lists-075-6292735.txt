The way I understood the question it was "how do I do this, and what happens
when people use an older browser". My answer is "Use CSS is how you do it. If
people use a browser that is older than Explorer 3 they will lose the
effect. But if people use a browser that is older than explorer 3 they are
clearly not motivated by the latest and greatest presentation, so I wouldn't
be too concerned."

It's a little like assuming that people are going to be using Black and White
TV (much more common outside the USA), except that where there is a clear
accessibility isue with the use of colour there is much less issue with
indenting text. (If there is some markup-expressible reason to indent the
text, for example because it is a quote, then the natural way to do it is by
using blockquote or whatever is relevant, but I am assuming it isn't the
case.)

  Assume that people who have browsers which do not support
  CSS are probably
  not very interested in presentation controlled to the level
  provided by CSS.

  Something such as the
    following:
    
    
    div.section1 {
                 margin-left:20px
                 }
    
    in the head section or in a linked style
  sheet.
    
    
    Then: <div
          class="section1">
    
    in the code.
    
    This will "degrade gracefully" in older
  browsers, although
    it will NOT be
    indented.
