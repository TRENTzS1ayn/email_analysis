Thanks for everyone's help.  I've decided to go with a style sheet.  There 
is a really helpful site at http://builder.cnet.com/Authoring/CSS/ss02.html 
The article seems old but it served it's purpose quite well for me.

>>CSS is what you want to use here. Something such as the following:


div.section1 {
             margin-left:20px
             }

in the head section or in a linked style sheet.


Then: <div
      class="section1">

in the code.

This will "degrade gracefully" in older browsers, although it will NOT be
indented.
