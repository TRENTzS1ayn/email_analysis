Hurray!

But I don't understand why you could not just put the section in question 
in a two column table (border="0" of course).  (The first column could 
contain just "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp" -- or you could use the width 
attribute.)  Using tables in this fashion is only a P3 violation.  This is 
certainly stylistically better than using blockquote or dir (although clear 
NOT as good as using CSS).
