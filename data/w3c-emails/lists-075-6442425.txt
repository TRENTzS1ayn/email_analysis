I had considered using tables but they are large documents with up to five 
levels of indenting.  Besides the burden on downloading the files via dial 
in accounts in the field, our main audience, browsers seem to choke up a 
bit on large tables.  I've decided that in this instance the document would 
not likely suffer significantly from the use of an older browser not 
capable of supporting css.  Thanks for the suggestion though.

Hurray!

But I don't understand why you could not just put the section in question
in a two column table (border="0" of course).  (The first column could
contain just "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp" -- or you could use the width
attribute.)  Using tables in this fashion is only a P3 violation.  This is
certainly stylistically better than using blockquote or dir (although clear 
NOT as good as using CSS).
