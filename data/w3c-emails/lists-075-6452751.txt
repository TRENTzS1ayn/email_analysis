What was it Judy said about long and frequent posts?

Greg may have only copied half of the transcript.  I went to the /. site, 
got bored reading on screen, and started a print out.  It wasn't until I 
got about 50 pages through that I realized that there are about 200 print 
pages on this thread (and that this topic is old news now).

BTW, Kynn did a great job enlightening the nerds.  Thanks Kynn!
