Okay, if not tables (and not CSS) you could always use <UL>.  This gets you 
the indentation and is not an abuse of HTML, but it will also start each 
indented section with a bullet.

I am thinking it would go like this:

Main document body.  Blah Blah Blah.
<UL>
<LI>Level one indent.  Blah Blah Blah.  LI keeps paragraph text which wraps 
indented like you want.
<P>To start a new paragraph with the indentation, but without another 
bullet, just use the P tag.  If this goes on long enough, people might 
hardly notice the bullet at the beginning!
<UL>
<LI>This paragraph is indented to level two.  Repeat this and the P trick 
as necessary.
</UL>
</UL>
Back to main document body.  Blah Blah Blah.

Just one more technique!
