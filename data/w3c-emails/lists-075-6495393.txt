Hi there,

I've been asked some questions about the accessibility of the material
produced by, and the interface of WebCT version 2 which was released in
October:

http://www.webct.com/v2/

They have statements on their web site such as

"The Bulletin Board now can display messages in a no frames view.
This makes the bulletin board easier for a screen-reader to use. In
this view, the screen displays either hyperlinked threads or
individual messages."

and

"Accessibility.
Most built-in images now have ALT tags and many incorporate
"mouseovers," showing text (ALT) information at the bottom of the
browser. A no-frames version of Bulletin Board and Mail has been
added. The online Help contains an informative section on
Accessibility."

I'm keen to find out if anyone has actually used it or had a look at it, and
whether the improvements they mention have actually made an impact on the
usability of the material produced for disabled people.

Cheers.
