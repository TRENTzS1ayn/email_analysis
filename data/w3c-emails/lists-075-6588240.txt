IRC provides simple text-based chat. I haven't tried it with JAWS, but I will
have a go at it this weekend. It is also very widely available.

Daniel LaLiberte, at W3C, did some work on threading IRC to make it less
disorienting and more like a newsgroup. I have cc'ed him on this message in
the hope that he can provide some more up to date and comprehensive
information

  Help!
  I need information about accessible chat-rooms which can be accessed by VI
  JAWS users.
  I've been asked by the Danish Ministry on Housing and Urban Affairs how they
  can make a chat room on the ministers homepage that complies with the WAI
  guidelines.
  Please send links to any relevant information for me to pass on to the
  ministry's webmaster
