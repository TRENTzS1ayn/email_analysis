It is a goo idea to avoid browser controls if possible.

But it is not possible to know what the controls are on every browser, so to
implement accesskey properly a browser should ensure that an element with an
accesskey attribute can be accessed directly, and should have a way for the
user to know how to access that element.

For example, if an element has accesskey Q, one browser might make the q key
go to that element, another might mak it alt-q, and another might already use
those keys, so make it alt-3. In each case, only the browser knows what the
accesskey is, so it must tell the user.

As a more complex example, there is no key on my keyboard for the japanese
character "Kuchi" although that is a legitimate character for an
accesskey. So my browser will have to use a different key, and tell me how I
use that.

As another complex example, a mobile phone browser may take the items that
have an accesskey and make a separate "tabbing order" so I press the * key
and then tab through the things that have accesskeys. Again, the browser
knows what it will do, but the author doesn't.

  I would like what criterion you use for the choice the accesskey.
  
  Is it important to avoid the accesskey coincide with

  Thank in advance.
