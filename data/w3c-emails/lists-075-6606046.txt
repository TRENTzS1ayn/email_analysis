This is an interesting question.  I hadn't thought of our threaded chat
work in light of accessibility, though that is clearly relevant because
the motivation was to make the chat stream more intelligible, easier to
use, more valuable as an archive, and available asynchronously.  These
are all things that make it more accessible too, I'm sure.

The work on our threaded chat system is not yet available, however.
There will be some announcement when it is available that Charles can
pass on.
