Came across a website, http://www.thegateway.org/ , with a nice use of 
style sheets.

The area on the left looks like an image map, but the menu selections are 
really text links, with style sheet defs to put them in the style of the 
usual image map (e.g. sans serif font, no underlines, blend into colored 
background).   Haven't done a complete review but looks good so far...
