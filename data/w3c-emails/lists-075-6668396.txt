Hi Bruce,

Having gone back to the part of your note about missing characters,
now I'm confused.  Unicode 2.0 (1996), in Chapter 7 'Code Charts',
on page 7-180 in 'Mathematical operators' defines:

U+2285  NOT A SUPERSET OF
        (canonical decomposition) 
            U+2283 (SUPERSET OF) +
            U+0338 (COMBINING LONG SOLIDUS OVERLAY

U+22A2  RIGHT TACK
        (alternative name) 
            proves, implies, yields

These characters are *not* missing from Unicode/ISO-10646, although
they may have missing character entity names in HTML.

Cheers,

Hi Al and Bruce,

In Unicode 2.0 (1996), in Chapter 7 'Code Charts', on page 7-155
'General punctuation', the following character is defined:

U+2011  NON-BREAKING HYPHEN
        (cross reference) U+002D - HYPHEN-MINUS

I believe this is what you're looking for.  I've copied Martin
Duerst (W3C Internationalization leader) to verify.

1. There is the whitespace=nowrap formatting property that in theory should
accomplish what you are after if you wrap the whole <span
class='my-nowrap'>hyphenated-expression</span> and then style this class or
ID with the property whitespace=nowrap.

2. Missing characters should go to the Unicode Consortium.  It would be
good to get in touch with the internationalization, XML InfoSet, and/or
math groups depending on just what the character is, to find out if there
are others in W3C that care about this character one way or another.
