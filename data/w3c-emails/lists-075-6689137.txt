Web accessibility milestone in Europe ? April 2000

The Portuguese presidency of the European Union ( EU) that will take place
during the first semester of the year 2000, goes to re-launch the European
Initiative for the Information Society, through a ministerial conference
that will be held in Lisbon in April of 2000.

According to Portuguese Minister of Science and Technology, the re-launching
of the European Initiative for the Information Society will be centered in
subjects such as accessibility and regulation of the Internet.

As you know, Portugal is the first European country where web accessibility
is mandatory. This legislation was an initiative of the Ministry of Science
and Technology. I think that people from EU countries should join efforts
and take this conference as a milestone to promote web accessibility in
Europe.
