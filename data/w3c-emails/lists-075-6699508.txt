Except that using UL for indentation (as a presentation effect) is WRONG -
see the HTML specification. People who are looking for lists want to know
what is a list, not what has been indented.

  Okay, if not tables (and not CSS) you could always use <UL>.  This gets you 
  the indentation and is not an abuse of HTML, but it will also start each 
  indented section with a bullet.
  
  I am thinking it would go like this:
  
  Main document body.  Blah Blah Blah.
  <UL>
  <LI>Level one indent.  Blah Blah Blah.  LI keeps paragraph text which wraps 
  indented like you want.
  <P>To start a new paragraph with the indentation, but without another 
  bullet, just use the P tag.  If this goes on long enough, people might 
  hardly notice the bullet at the beginning!
  <UL>
  <LI>This paragraph is indented to level two.  Repeat this and the P trick 
  as necessary.
  </UL>
  </UL>
  Back to main document body.  Blah Blah Blah.
  
  Just one more technique!
