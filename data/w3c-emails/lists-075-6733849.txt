Thanks Al!

Of course CSS has an answer!  This is even more elegant since mostly I am 
worried about this when the hyphen is part of a hyperlink.  That means that 
(once I make the plunge to CSS) I can just add the nowrap to my style for 
Anchors?  Too bad I have been using &nbsp; for text that is part a link for 
a while now...
