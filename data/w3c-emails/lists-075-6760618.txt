Very Nice.  I was not aware that Adobe PageMill supported CSS.  I will have 
to take another look at it.

I am always critical about the approach of creating an image map of text 
links, so this CSS is most welcome.  Text-as-graphics is an abuse of 
bandwidth and looks poor when printed.  I remain curious as to why the 
author of this page only went halfway.  Why do they use images for the 
headers?  I would like to see a "legacy-free" (html 4.0 strict) version of 
the page.
