        Fortunately, a well-designed web page will work right on any
browser regardless of whose it is.  The key is that the web page be
built with html that truly conforms to the standards for proper web
design.  You can read all about how to design a working web page that
everybody can use at

        If you follow the guidelines and keep things as simple as
possible to still get the job done, you should end up with a good web
site.
