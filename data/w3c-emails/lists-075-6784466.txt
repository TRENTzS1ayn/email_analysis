Hi All,

I've mentioned the online grocery retailer HomeGrocer.com a couple times on
assorted lists.  Their web site can be found at <http://www.homegrocer.com>.

This morning I had a discussion with one of the head people responsible for
technical development with the site.  This person is more in the planning
rather than the actual coding of the web site but expressed an interest in
trying to experience for himself how a screen reader worked with their site
and how some of the improvements I suggested might work.

I'm looking for someone from the Seattle area who might be willing to give
this person a demonstration of screen reading technology.  It would be
helpful if you had experience with online shopping at some level and better
yet if you've tried their site a time or two.

If you are interested and willing to give this person a demonstration,
please write me privately off the list at: kford@teleport.com

and we'll see what can be arranged.

If you want to experiment with the site visit

http://www.homegrocer.com

and enter the zip 97206 in the third edit box you find and then choose the
button that says, "one."  It is important that you add the string ?nojava=1
to the web site address after choosing the Shop Now link once you've passed
the site's main entry screen.

This site is reasonably screen reader friendly as it stands now.  However
with some minor improvements (mostly alt tags on buttons and such) it could
be even better and I also think it would be good to let this company know
people who are blind are out here trying to use their service.

Kelly
