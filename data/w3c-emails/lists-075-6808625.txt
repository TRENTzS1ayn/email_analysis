       FYI -- Jakob Nielsen also has a new book that should be
       available on Friday, with the title:
       Designing Web Usability: The Practice of Simplicity
       Chapter 6. Accessibility for Users with Disabilities

       I've created a link to the book on a new portion of our
       website, the CITA bookshelf, which has been designed to provide
       a way to reference books as sources in papers our office has
       recently written.  This tool provides links to Amazon.Com
       (text-only version), Barnes & Noble, Borders, Fatbrain, and
       Reiter's, which is a local scientific bookstore here in
       Washington DC.  There's also a link to an associated page for
       the book Dr. Nielsen's website, which provides the complete
       Table of Contents:
