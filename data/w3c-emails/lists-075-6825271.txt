Of course the non-breaking hyphen is the correct thing to use.
For quotes, never use &#147; and &#148;, this is not correct
HTML at all. The numbers in &#...; constructs refer to Unicode,
and Unicode does not have any characters at these positions.
Please see http://www.w3.org/TR/html40/sgml/entities.html#h-24.4.1
and use any of:

<!ENTITY lsquo   CDATA "&#8216;" -- left single quotation mark,
                                                U+2018 ISOnum -->
<!ENTITY rsquo   CDATA "&#8217;" -- right single quotation mark,
                                                U+2019 ISOnum -->
<!ENTITY sbquo   CDATA "&#8218;" -- single low-9 quotation mark, U+201A NEW -->
<!ENTITY ldquo   CDATA "&#8220;" -- left double quotation mark,
                                                U+201C ISOnum -->
<!ENTITY rdquo   CDATA "&#8221;" -- right double quotation mark,
                                                U+201D ISOnum -->

As for 'implied', the comment in
http://www.w3.org/TR/html40/sgml/entities.html#h-24.3.1
just is a note pointing out the assumption of the authors
of the HTML spec that this was the same as an entity in
some ISO standard with a different name, and that this
assumption was supported by some other ISO document.
Neither are the characters missing from Unicode/iso10646,
and they are even available as *named* character entities
in HTML 4.0.

In case somebody really has a new character to propose
(which I don't think will happen very frequently),
please have a look at
http://www.unicode.org/pending/proposals.html.
