Hello, I cite below a new communication from the European Commission regarding the Information Society for All. Besides the interest of the initiative itself I want to raise another topic now. This is the increasing use of PDF files as the ONLY format to reproduce their communications in DG13 (at least). See for example the Homepage at http://europa.eu.int/comm/dg13/ which is full of links to PDF files.

This, as you know, is against guideline 11 of WebContent "Use W3C technologies and guidelines".

Now, a good way to start the implementation of this EU initiative would be to put the DG13 communications in plain HTML. Don't you think? Who could we contact to make this message heard?

Best regards, Rafael Romero.

The European Commission has launched today (8/12/99) an initiative entitled "eEurope - An Information Society for All", which proposes ambitious targets to bring the benefits of the Information Society within reach of all Europeans. The initiative focuses on ten priority areas, from education to transport and from healthcare to the disabled. The initiative is a key element in President Prodi's strategy to modernise the European economy.
...
Areas of action (list of 10 areas):
