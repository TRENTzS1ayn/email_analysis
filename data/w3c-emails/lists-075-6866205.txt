Let me ask this again,

My pages now contain a line like
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1">
This is a lie, since I insist of using the forbidden &#146/7/8; characters. 
 Is there another charset value I could use that would make everything 
legal and valid?

&8217; &8220/1; don't work with the 3x browsers.  I have a LOT more Win 3x 
users I am writing for and NO unix users that I know of.  I have no plans 
of changing my practices until either (A) Navigator starts supporting 
&l/rd/squo; or (B) the W3C validator starts invalidating about my code.

Thanks,
Bruce Bailey
