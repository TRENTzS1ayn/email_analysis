To the attention of eEurope site webmaster.

Dear sir or madam,

I would encourage you to facilitate all texts relating to this new exciting initiative also in HTML format.

Presently they can only be downloaded as PDF and this takes more than ten times longer than the equivalent HTML files. Not only so. PDF files do not allow to copy the text easily for citing in another documents and the users need an especific plugin to render them in their computers.

More importantly, this format is not accessible for people with disabilities that can not use standards graphical browsers, like blind people. This would be hence a good way to start implementing what is intended as priority area 7, which is eParticipation of the disabled in the information society.

For more information about accessible web design you could visit the site of the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative at http://www.w3.org/WAI

Yours sincerely,

Rafael Romero.
