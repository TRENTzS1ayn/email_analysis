Francisco,

I am very pleased to hear about the E Europe initiative on 8 December.  We
also had good news in Ireland recently.  On 16th November, The Irish Prime
Minister Bertie Ahern, launched new web design guidelines for the Irish
Government and public service.  These guidelines include the Worldwide web
consortium's WAI guidelines for access for people with disabilities.  The
Irish Government's web sites are being revised and we have already noticed
improvements!

We in the Visually Impaired Computer Society of Ireland (VICS) would be
delighted to support a petition.
