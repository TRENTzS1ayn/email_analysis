Francisco,

not being in Europe I'm not sure what support I can give, but I wish you lots
of luck. (You might like to look at how the Australian Government approaches
accessibility).

Cheres, and good luck. (Actually I suspect that hard work and ability will
get you success ;-)

  Francisco,
  
  I am very pleased to hear about the E Europe initiative on 8 December.  We
  also had good news in Ireland recently.  On 16th November, The Irish Prime
  Minister Bertie Ahern, launched new web design guidelines for the Irish
  Government and public service.  These guidelines include the Worldwide web
  consortium's WAI guidelines for access for people with disabilities.  The
  Irish Government's web sites are being revised and we have already noticed
  improvements!
  
  We in the Visually Impaired Computer Society of Ireland (VICS) would be
  delighted to support a petition.
