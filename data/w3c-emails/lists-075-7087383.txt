I've planned to use some time during Christmas to  have a look at FrontPage
and see if I can find out more on Shared Borders. The person who asked said
that "shared borders" is a technique generally known but he couldn't give me
more information (or wouldn't). It might be related to navigation and used
in stead of Frames. So any help is still very welcome!

Can you tell us what they are?

(Or can someone else who is more familiar with FrontPage?
