Shared borders, in FrontPage98 at least, are borders / navigation areas 
automatically generated by FrontPage for use throughout a FrontPage 
generated web site.  They can be placed on the top, right or left or a 
combination thereof.  I'm not sure if they are implemented using frames or 
not.  I think they are not for the top ones.

I've planned to use some time during Christmas to  have a look at FrontPage
and see if I can find out more on Shared Borders. The person who asked said
that "shared borders" is a technique generally known but he couldn't give 
me
more information (or wouldn't). It might be related to navigation and used
in stead of Frames. So any help is still very welcome!

Can you tell us what they are?

(Or can someone else who is more familiar with FrontPage?
