Then it seems basically like a technique for building templates to apply to
many pages at once. WHich aren't necessarily good or bad for accessibility -
it depends on how they are done, and the content that is in them, which in
turn depends on FrontPage...

  Hi, I have personally used MS FrontPage shared borders, and I like it a lot.
  
  Well used they can provide you with the same functionality as a frameset, but without using actual frames. The common content in all pages is automatically updated by Frontpage everytime you edit it from any page. Then the "pseudo-frame" is included at the top, left, down or right part of all pages where it has been defined to appear.
  
  The border appearing at left or right is obtained by the use of a column in a table.
  
  I have set up a demo for all interested people at our site. I will leave it there for 4 weeks. Have a look at it at http://acceso3.uv.es/sharedborders/
  It was created automatically by Frontpage from a deafult template, so do not pay attention to the content. It uses shared borders at top, left and bottom of every page. 
  
  The site also uses Common Navigation Bar as the content for the Shared Borders, but it does not have to be that way necessarily. These two features are, for me, the ones providing most value-added to this Authoring Tool, for the time saving they mean for the setup and maintenance of big sites.
  
  I hope this is useful for everyone. Best regards, Rafael Romero.
  
  PS: this is more probably a question to be discussed in the Authoring Tools Working Group.
