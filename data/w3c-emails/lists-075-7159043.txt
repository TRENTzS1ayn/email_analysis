Bruce,

you should (as I recall the spec - this is really a SMIL question) have a
type attribute in the video element. And you may find that isn't enough for
Realplayer either - i believe it uses another scheme for addressig streaming
documents, although I don't really know.

  The W3C validator DOES validate SMIL ascii/text files.  I am anxious about 
  how good a job it is doing.  I guess it should be great, since SMIL is a 
  W3C spec.  I guess I don't quite understand why the CSS validator is 
  separate from the main validation service, but SMIL is not.  Does it really 
  test against the SMIL subset DTD specifications, or merely make sure that a 
  file follows "general" XML specifications?  I was most disappointed to 
  discover that the SMIL files from NCAM for the publicly available "Car" and 
  "Elevator" do not validate as they are written.
  
  My most immediately pressing SMIL problem is this:
  Can a .smi (ascii/text) file reference (binary/media) files that are 
  located on a different server?
  
  I have tried using a BASE REF statement in the HEAD sections which seems to 
  be ignored.
  I have tried an explicit SRC statement like:
  <video src="http://38.201.92.250/ramgen/channels/able/car/carsilent.rm" 
  region="videoregion"/>
  But that just gets me an error message, "RealPlayer cannot play this type 
  of document".
  Removing the http:// (and a few other permutations I tried) results in 
  other equally non-helpful error messages.
  
  This question may belong in another group, but I need to know so I can 
  experiment with live captions.
