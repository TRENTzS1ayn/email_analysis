...Glad you posted the article.  I thought I'd posted the url for it
before it hit the news stands, but wanted to post it again and got hung
up with other things.

...this may be true, but this is the first actual top level to achieve
this as sailor and mec were mandated.  This is hard to explain, but this
actually comes from within the gobvernment its self.  While technically
you are correct,  The goal for conneticut is to be the first to offer
completely adcessible government services.  To my knowledge, that has
yet to be achieved by any state government.

Commendably accessible but I dare say that some of the pages that they
lead to have quagmire tendancies.

unless it has changed radically in the last two weeks, it is not what
I'd consider accessible.  Further, the last time I checked, there was
only one directive regarding information on technology for the blind "go
to nfb".

I might also add that the site admin has been made aware that the page
where the article is located meeds to be more accessible.  see below.

I'm sure Kathleen would love to hear from those working to make their
states and local municipal webs accessible.
