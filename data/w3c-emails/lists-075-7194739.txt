To Bruce and David and my other WAI friends:

I was contacted by Civic.com and asked to write an opinion piece on web site
accessibility for state and local government information technology
managers.  I was not asked to do a  'how-to' article or provide a list of
resources or organizations.  There are many things I left out; unfortunately
I was limited to 700 words - I could have written enough to fill the entire
issue! I was not told to leave them out - there just wasn't enough room.  I
am very aware of AWARE and the other resources and organizations that Bruce
mentioned; in fact, I am taking "Designing for Universal Accessibility with
HTML 4.0"   http://www.hwg.org/services/classes/d201.8.html   with Kynn
Bartlett right now and having a wonderful time - I highly recommend the
course.

If Connecticut 'comes in second' behind Maryland or any other state, that's
still not a bad place to be, IMHO. And Yes, I would love to hear from those
working to make their states and local municipal webs accessible.

Have a good holiday and a safe Y2K!
