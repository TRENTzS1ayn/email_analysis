I love the Internet!  Many thanks to Larry Bouthillier, author of 
"Synchronized Multimedia On The Web" at URL:

The answer is that:
<video src="http://38.201.92.250/ramgen/channels/able/car/carsilent.rm" 
region="videoregion"/>
should instead be:
<video src="rtsp://38.201.92.250/channels/able/car/carsilent.rm" 
region="videoregion"/>

RealPlayer media does REQUIRES a streaming server, which is quite an 
expensive product.  Since I want to experiment with smil files, I need 
public files that are hosted by someone else!

Can anyone point me to a RealPlayer file that has an offline transcript 
available (but not real time captioning)?  I want to try my hand at making 
good my claim that synchronized captioning is not that hard!

I am still trying to figure out how to suppress the "videoregion" if one is 
trying merely to produce real time caption of an audio-only broadcast.
