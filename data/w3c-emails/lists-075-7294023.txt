There is a policy reference on our website, but it is substantially out of
date. It is international, so doing things by American University has not
been a priority (there are a number of places outside the US interested in
this) whiloe it is difficult to find reaources to track government policy in
different countries.

  Is there a good resource that tracks state regulations and university
  policies on accessibility and ADA compliance? I'm putting together some
  resources for our product strategy team, and need some specific information
  to convince them to move accessibility closer to the top of the priority
  list. 
  
  Best case scenario: is there a central repository of accessibility
  requirements by state or by university?
  
  Otherwise: Please feel free to send me (mailto:rbrown@blackboard.com) any
  information that you have regarding individual universities or states, and
  I'll start compiling my own list.
