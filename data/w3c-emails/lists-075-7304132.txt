On the wai interest group listserv, there is a thread (which you may already
know about) regarding the lawsuit, but the thread is a bit dated. The link
to the wai archive which started the thread is
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/1999OctDec/0088.html.


The main page for those archives is
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/1999OctDec/. If you look this
up, you'll have to scroll down to nearly the bottom.

I, personally, have not heard anything more recent about this issue.

> I work for NYS government and we have recently adopted the W3C Guidelines
for NYS Web sites.  This has brough up many questions from NYS public
colleges and universities.  A while back there was some info on the San Fran
State University access law suit.  Can anyone provide a URL for this or any
other pertinent information to help guide us in answering these questions.
