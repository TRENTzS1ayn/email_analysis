Thanks to everyone who has sent me information about current requirements
for universities and state regulations. (Have more?
mailto:rbrown@blackboard.com)

I realized that I should give more context to my request, to help target the
sort of information that I'm trying to find. Blackboard builds online
teaching and learning platforms for schools, corporations, and other
clients. What exactly does this mean? One of our product lines is an web
application designed to help teachers place their courses online and to
interact with their students over the internet. Since this is a complete
teaching and learning environment, we're very concerned about making it
accessible.

I'm interested in the state and university regulations pertaining to online
educational resources, because we want to make certain that we are meeting
the needs of the educational community. We're trying to position ourselves
ahead of the curve on accessibility, and to do that we need to know both
current regulations and anticipated future requirements.

In addition to current recommendations, requirements, and regulations, I'm
also very interested in feedback from teachers, web/technology coordinators,
and other members of the educational community. Does your university have an
official accessibility policy? Is one in the works? What level of compliance
is required? Is the issue just starting to be raised? Is the issue coming
from the top down (legal departments, management) or the bottom up (teachers
and students)? And (just to put it in terms that competitive analysts can
understand) how much of a competitive edge _is_ accessibility? Please email
any hints, rumors, or anecdotes about accessibility to
mailto:rbrown@blackboard.com. (Wish lists are welcome, too.)

Thanks,
Reidy

Is there a good resource that tracks state regulations and university
policies on accessibility and ADA compliance? I'm putting together some
resources for our product strategy team, and need some specific information
to convince them to move accessibility closer to the top of the priority
list. 

Best case scenario: is there a central repository of accessibility
requirements by state or by university?

Otherwise: Please feel free to send me (mailto:rbrown@blackboard.com) any
information that you have regarding individual universities or states, and
I'll start compiling my own list.
