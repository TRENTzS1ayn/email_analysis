Hi Kelly,

the answer is that to make it look the same and linearise neatly you need
smarter tools. You could use the online tablin tool -
http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/tablin is the homepage for it. Otherwise if
the table was flipped so the headings were on teh side instead of the top it
would linearise better.

(tablin can do that for you too...)

Cheers

Charles

  Hi All,
  
  Perhaps this is detailed in a techniques document someplace so pointers are 
  appreciated.  Further I'm not an expert on HTML coding as much as I am on 
  figuring out how to handle whatever web pages toss my way.  I have a 
  question about techniques for coding tables so they linearize correctly.
  
  Below is an example of how a table from Lands' End reads in JFW and 
  Window-Eyes.  Is there a way to code this table so it still looks the same 
  visually but so the column headings of Chino, Poplin and Active would 
  appear in better locations when the table is linearized by the web browser 
  and screen reader?
  
  
  The word "link" appears in front of anything that's a link and the word 
  "graphic" in front of anything that's a picture.
  
  This is roughly how one section of the Men's Shorts page appears in 
  Window-Eyes or JFW.  Lands' End uses this same layout for all their product 
  pages.
