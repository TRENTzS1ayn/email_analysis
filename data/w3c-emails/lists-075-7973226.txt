Charles,

If I understand this correctly, you are saying that the time has come for
the Authoring tools to be more sophisticated because more people are using
them as compared to the small minority of people who actually write the code
from scratch.  Well, I agree more people don't hand code as compared to
those who do. The more I speak with other web authors, the more I find that
they all use some kind of editor for doing their sites.  I find it difficult
to use an editor for writing html because when I put them through the
validators I use, I end up having to rewrite so much to make them
accessible.  Yet, when I write my own html code, I have no problem with it
passing accessibility standards.

So, I believe that since the majority use Authoring tools, these tools
should be developed with accessibility standards built in.  Maybe even throw
in a tutorial in the readme file about what the code is used for and why.

As I am not an expert on this, these only only my thoughts.

Joyce Taylor
