pico, notepad and wordpad are still my favorite editors for html but only
because I haven't tried word perfect's text editor for dos yet.  I think
though that since much of the web is going to mixed html and other things,
some kind of integrated approach is good to comtemplate.  My problem with
this is that to date, I have not found anything I have used which works as
well as coding by hand from an accessability standpoint.
