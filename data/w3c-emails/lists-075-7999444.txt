Joyce,

Yes.

(the long version:

Certainly it is important for authoring tools to include how to make
accessible (and valid and well-designed) content, and the example of how to
write HTML that is included in Amay is the sort of thing I have in
mind. There are good and bad ways to use any program, and tutorials,
documentation, and the user interface itself should all guide the author
towards doing the right thing as the natural way to use the tool (this is a
major theme of the Authoring Tool Guidelines).

That people need to learn to hand code in order to produce valid pages
strikes me as a bad reflection on Authoring tools, and in looking at a
variety of them I am pleased that in general they are improving drastically
in this regard.

In some sense my question is one of priority - are there enough good enough
tools that we can stop concentrating on the backwards-looking strategy of
teaching people to write code and start teaching them to use tools better -
essentially an easier thing to do.

  Charles,
  
  If I understand this correctly, you are saying that the time has come for
  the Authoring tools to be more sophisticated because more people are using
  them as compared to the small minority of people who actually write the code
  from scratch.  Well, I agree more people don't hand code as compared to
  those who do. The more I speak with other web authors, the more I find that
  they all use some kind of editor for doing their sites.  I find it difficult
  to use an editor for writing html because when I put them through the
  validators I use, I end up having to rewrite so much to make them
  accessible.  Yet, when I write my own html code, I have no problem with it
  passing accessibility standards.
  
  So, I believe that since the majority use Authoring tools, these tools
  should be developed with accessibility standards built in.  Maybe even throw
  in a tutorial in the readme file about what the code is used for and why.
  
  As I am not an expert on this, these only only my thoughts.
