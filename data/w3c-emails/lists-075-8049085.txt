Well, it shouldn't be so complicated anyway!

Okay, so how should the ATT vendor code differently?  IMHO, they should be
using text instead of pictures of text, but CSS and other techniques are not
so compatible with Navigator.  Its great that they have dynamically changing
ALT content, but I doubt that it is available to screen readers (I know Lynx
doesn't see it).

That's kind of my point -- they SHOULD be synonymous -- but they are not!
Not in the specification and not in actual practice.

Right, and the onFocus/onMouseOver script SHOULD occur when you TAB (and NOT
require you to press enter).  This IS what happens when you use the
keyboard.  In order for the onFocus to be triggered by the mouse, however,
one must click (select) the item with the onFocus attribute.  This is NOT
like onMouseOver!  This is NOT the modality users have come to expect!

Yep!

Subject: RE: Seeking guidance...

At some point it is up to the screenreader to work properly. If the authors
have done what is necessary to amke sure that access is possible (including
ensure that the script stuff is not necessary to understand the page) there
needs to be some work done by people who provide access to the content
through software such as browsers and assistive technologies.

Having a way of authoring that supports accessibility is vital for
accessibility, but unless there are also user agents that support
accessibility the web will still be only for some people.

  For example, take http://www.att.com

  As you mouseover items on a menu, another image changes to show some more
info.
  And, bless them, their javascript also changes the alt text of that other
  image.

  Are screenreaders going to show this changed alt text in the other image?

  Also, what if a mouseover changes the image it was on.  What does the
  screenreader read when it the image gets focus?  the original alt text or
  the changed alt text?
