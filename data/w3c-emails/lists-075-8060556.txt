Dear Chris,

Thanks for doing this work!
Your experiment demonstrates the problem.  The HTML 4.01 specification for
onFocus is BROKEN.  In order to get things to work properly, a page author
has no choice but to redundantly code for onMouseOver AND onFocus.  The good
news is that pages can be coded to improve keyboard access.  The bad news is
that we don't yet have attributes that are device neutral.

Bruce
