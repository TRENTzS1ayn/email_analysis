Kynn,
Do you know if the search engine on Microsoft Site Server is friendly to
screen readers?

Hi, Mike, I've had some contact with the people at Searchbutton.com --
they provide search engine service for web site owners and they have
a free option.  I've spoken to them about web accessibility and they
are very committed to making their service usable by everyone (even
more so since one of their founders has a visual impairment); their
service is reasonably accessible (see a verson of it at 
http://www.hwg.org/) and they are -very- interested in suggestions on
how to make it more accessible.

I'd give them a try if I were you.  I can give them my personal
endorsement as a great bunch of people. :)

PS:  Mention my name, they may send me a t-shirt. ;)
