Dear Kelly,

The quick answer is "Yes, absolutely!"  I am not sure who first pointing
this kind of technique out to me, but the correction is pretty straight
forward:  Nest the tables properly!

I've simplified the actual code here, and actually proposed an initial
condition that is WORSE than what is there.  Graphics and the like could
easily be added as desired.

Problem table code fragment (as is) looks something like this (6 rows, 3
columns):
<TR>
<TH>Chino</TH>
<TH>Poplin</TH>
<TH>Active</TH>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Plain front</TD>
<TD>Plain front</TD>
<TD>Ripstop Hikers</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Pleated</TD>
<TD>Pleated</TD>
<TD>Cargo Water</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Drawstring</TD>
<TD>Drawstring</TD>
<TD>Tactel Adventure</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Cargo</TD>
<TD> </TD>
<TD>Knit Sport</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD> </TD>
<TD> </TD>
<TD>Knit Cargo</TD>
</TR>

The simple fix is to use break tags to change this into a table with just
row:
<TR>
<TD>Chino<BR>
Plain front<BR>
Pleated<BR>
Drawstring<BR>
Cargo</TD>
<TD>Poplin<BR>
Plain front<BR>
Pleated<BR>
Drawstring<BR>
Active<BR>
Ripstop Hikers<BR>
Cargo Water<BR>
Tactel Adventure<BR>
Knit Sport<BR>
Knit Cargo</TD>
</TR>

This does not present well for some application (especially with graphics,
as is the case with Lands' End) so then the trick is to use properly nested
tables.  Each cell should get a table which is a single column, but multiple
rows.  The outside table has only one row.
<TR>
<TD>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TH>Chino</TH>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Plain front</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Pleated</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Drawstring</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Cargo</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</TD>
<TD>
<TD>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TH>Poplin</TH>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Plain front</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Pleated</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Drawstring</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</TD>
<TD>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TH>Active</TH>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Ripstop Hikers</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Cargo Water</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Tactel Adventure</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Knit Sport</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Knit Cargo</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</TD>
</TR>

The Lands' End site uses nested tables, but does not do so properly, that
is, they don't ensure that the content linearlizes correctly.  Checkpoint
5.3 REALY should be P1.

A tough question is how could GUI authoring UA facilitate this kind of
approach?
