Hi Cynthia
   We have been doing some work with the Microsoft Site Server search
engine in our Exploit Interactive web magazine.  We have just released a
Dublin Core-aware search facility, which provides searching across
various areas of the magazine (e.g. issue 1, Regular Features, articles
about projects funded by the European Union).
   The search facility is available at
http://www.exploit-lib.org/cat_search/
   A description of the architecture is available at
http://www.exploit-lib.org/issue5/metadata/
   Although this type of search interface can be implemented using a
backend database, the advantage of using a standard such as Dublin Core
is that the data can be reused by remote applications.
   I'd be interested to hear if there are any accessibility problems
with the interface.
   Brian
