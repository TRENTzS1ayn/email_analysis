Right, but I should think it would be MUCH better than hearing:
Chino: Poplin: Active:
Plain front, Plain front, Ripstop Hikers.
Pleated, Pleated, Cargo Water.
Drawstring, Drawstring, Tactel Adventure.
Cargo, , Knit Sport.
, , Knit Cargo.
Which is how my first example would be read.  (For the sake of space
considerations, I've converted cells to commas, row endings to periods, and
indicated header cells with a colon.)


Please note that my code fragments (from my previous post) would have the
same visual orientation: six rows, three columns, with the items organized
(grouped) by column.

I am just trying to highlight the importance of Checkpoint 5.3, tables
should linearize.

Ideally, screen readers would do something with TH versus TD.  Shan Sasser's
post that you reference (regarding the example in the techniques document)
is basically of an intelligent (but wholly theoretical) transformation (via
screen reader) that uses proper markup to convert tables of the one type to
the other.
