Hi Bruce:

>Ideally, screen readers would do something with TH versus TD.
Yes, they 
(I can't speak about later versions of JFW than mine or other screen readers),  don't and is precisely why the example 
is only of theoretical, not practical, value.
I find it rather strange to have somehing called a theoretical technique.
Since this is where designers go to find out how to do it, I think it 
is likely to be misleading.  
Will it or will it not work today is what designers want, righfully, to know, not 
"theoretically, on systems which dont yet exist yet, or if they do, only in the minority"
when examples are given, my criterion is they should work on the majority of
systems (independent of device, browser, screen reader and versions therof). 
 

It should also be noted that there are many
generalization paths from a single example and much effort should be given to explaining for exactly which of those paths, 
the example is valid and which may not be and for what reasons.
If you could carefully generalize from your example,
that would probably be helpful to designers who may ask themselves whether that technique will work for them in the cases of tables they are working with currently.
