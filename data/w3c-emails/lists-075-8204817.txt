hi Steven, Kelly, and others:

I don't have the time this week to get into this in much
detail, but we did some work about a year ago regarding the ability
to navigate and understand web based data tables.  We developed a
tool, which is only of "beta" quality, called HelpDB, and it is
available to download off the Trace web site.  HelpDB allows you
to navigate around the web data table row/columns for cell
by cell information including the header information.  It
uses the HTML markup (e.g., <TH>, <TD>, etc) to accomplish this.
There are many things that could be done with this tool, but
time and resources are another issue ;)

The tool currently only works with IE 4 and 5, sorry.

The README.TXT file has much more detail, please refer to that.
