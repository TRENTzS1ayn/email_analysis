WEB STANDARDS PROJECT BLASTS MICROSOFT'S "ARROGANT" BREAK WITH
STANDARDS

http://www.webstandards.org/ -- 10 April 2000 -- The Web
Standards Project (WaSP) today denounced Internet Explorer 5.5
Windows Edition for abandoning Web standards Microsoft has
publicly committed to supporting, and focusing on proprietary
technologies which are certain to fragment the already-troubled
Web space.

"We are incensed by Microsoft's arrogance, and perplexed by its
schizophrenic decision to support standards on one platform while
undercutting them on another," said Web Standards Project group
leader Jeffrey Zeldman.
