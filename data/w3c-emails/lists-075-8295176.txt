>Maryland's Online Public Information Network has rolled out a "new and

accessible.
>They use a whole bunch of (text-based) onMouseOver JavaScript.  I have
asked

on
>recent discussion, I don't expect that this currently helps screen
readers
>much and I know that it does nothing for Lynx users.  So, where do they
add

NOSCRIPT
>is valid ONLY in BODY!  In Sailor's case, this may not be necessary as
the

main
>heading links.

>(1)  What can Sailor do to improve accessibility.
>(2)  Is the site, as is, WCAG P1 compliant or not?  If not, why not?
>(3)  Is their a general technique for making such "pop-up" links
accessible?
>(Or does one just ensure that said URLs are replicated elsewhere?)
