Here at James Cook University, we are redeveloping our web site (isn't 
everyone?)  The design preferred includes left-side navigation links.

So my question for the group is what is the best way to implement such 
links?  Have you found a particularly accessible site?  Should we implement 
in style sheets or as tables (I prefer style sheets, the info tech guys are 
arguing that doesn't cater for older browser.

I'm playing around with this as an idea

http://www.tld.jcu.edu.au/develop/jcuproto/asd_lynn/asdplan.html (only page 
redone with style sheets so far)

Others think it should be more like http://www.jcu.edu.au/newsite/asd/
URL of accessible left-hand navigation sites are welcome.
