Thanks Marjolein,

I don't have much say about the bloat size.  My assumption is that Sailor
will hear from the many school systems that have 28.8 modems at best.

Bad design is NOT a P1 violation.  With accessibility issues I have some
influence.  With usability concerns I am just one voice in the crowd.

I am embarrassed that I didn't notice that they are using .GIF'd text.
