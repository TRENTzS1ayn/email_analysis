One thing I will pitch is that the .GIF'd text must go.  It IS an
accessibility issue.  They have disabled the user's ability to control font
size!  Don't know why I didn't think of that sooner.

I am still waiting for creative input on how to ensure that
onMouseOver/onFocus content is accessible...  Please feel free to quote
