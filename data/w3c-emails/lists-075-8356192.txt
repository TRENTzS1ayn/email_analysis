I went to the main Sailor site with Lynx/32 and with IE 5.01 with
Window-Eyes 3.1.  Attached is a copy of the Microsoft Active Accessibility
buffer which a Window-Eyes user will hear when viewing that page.  Any line
that begins with "link" should act as a link.  One would never know that
there was 29K of stuff associated with this page.  My initial impression
was favorable, generally.

But if you decide to search for something, the picture changes.  The edit
box is easy to find, and it has a good label which Window-Eyes and Lynx can
read properly, in or out of MSAA mode.  But where do you submit your
search?  Am I blind or something?  Guess I'll have to hack into the HTML to
find out why I can't search from the main page, or where one might do a
search from a subpage.  I would   think Sailor's own copy of Lynx won't do
any better, but perhaps it's pointed at a different page?
