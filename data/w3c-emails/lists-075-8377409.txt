No, you are not correct in assuiming that it is a lie. onFocus is not defined
to be keyboard specific. There is indeed a problem that onFocus is not as
broadly applicable as onMouseWhatever, but this is a bug in the specification
of HTML. Within WAI, fixing specifications (in future versions) is primarily
the responsibility of the Protocols and Formats group, which is W3C
member-only.

  Use application-level event triggers rather than user interaction-level
  triggers.  In HTML 4.0, application-level event attributes are "onfocus",
  "onblur" (the opposite of "onfocus"), and "onselect".  Note that these
  attributes are designed to be device-independent, but are implemented as
  keyboard specific events in current browsers.

  >From recent discussions, am I correct to understand that the last sentence
  above is a LIE?  That, in fact, PER THE FORMAL 4.01 SPECIFICATIONS, onFocus
  is DEFINED to be keyboard specific?  And that MSIE 4+ (for example) handling
  of onFocus is perfectly in keeping with the specifications?
  
  There is also the problem that the formal specifications allows the use of
  onMouseOver MUCH more liberally than onFocus...
  
  This might belong on the GL or ER list.
