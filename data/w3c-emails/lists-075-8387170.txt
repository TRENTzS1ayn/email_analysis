Dear David,

The Maryland Government Internet Policy is in full force, which is part of
the reason Sailor is committed to keeping their site accessible.  Perhaps
they will provide a "low bandwidth" alternative to the home page.  My
assessment is that only the homepage is a problem.  Do you agree?  From
strictly an accessibility point of view, in the interests of providing equal
access, I am very reluctant to suggest concurrent parallel pages.  Sailor is
not serving their pages dynamically, so I would think this would be the
wrong course to pursue.  I am not yet convinced that the homepage cannot be
improved so that it provides the same (new) "look-and-feel" and cuts the
download time by half.

Even without a mechanism for providing access to the onMouseOver content, I
think the Sailor site meets the P1 checkpoints WITHOUT the need for
alternative pages.  The content "hidden" within the JavaScript IS readily
available from the primary (accessible) links.

The main Baltimore Maryland Library for the Blind and Print Handicapped is
right across the Street from main Pratt Library which houses the Sailor
Operation Center (SOC).  I wonder if Sailor has gotten feedback from those
users?

Cheers,
Bruce
