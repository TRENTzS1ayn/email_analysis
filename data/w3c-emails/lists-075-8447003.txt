bruce, I agree with you that it will be a bad as you picture it but
devolution was the only word I could come up with when describing the
process from accessable to somewhat inaccessable.  along the accessability
continuum, this is devolution.  I know of the comitment and appreciate you
setting me streight on who is in charge of who but the fact remains that the
m e c used to have on their site that they monitor accessability of their
links and sailor was one of those links.

Hopefully, we can stave off that day because the two sites are both good and
I'd hate seeing all that work go down the drain.
