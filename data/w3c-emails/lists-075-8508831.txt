Bruce,

I don't understand why you say the duplicate content won't help
lynx or screen reader users. The sub-menu a mouse user sees as the result
of the mouseover is on the page you get by following (clicking) the topic.
It is complete equivalent content as far as I am concerned.

If you were to add "skip navigation" it would be equivalent access as
well. That sub-menu is so simple, but one has to wander through all the
navigation stuff to find the simple menu at what turns out to be the
bottom of the page.

Dear Group,

Please take at look at URL:
http://www.sailor.lib.md.us/
and provide me feedback (on or off the list as you see fit).

Maryland's Online Public Information Network has rolled out a "new and
improved" look to their site.  They are interested in keeping it accessible.
They use a whole bunch of (text-based) onMouseOver JavaScript.  I have asked
them to duplicate the onMouseOver content into onFocus tags, but based on
recent discussion, I don't expect that this currently helps screen readers
much and I know that it does nothing for Lynx users.  So, where do they add
the alternative content?  The SCRIPT definition is in the HEAD and NOSCRIPT
is valid ONLY in BODY!  In Sailor's case, this may not be necessary as the
sub-heading "pop-up" links duplicate those available by following the main
heading links.

(1)  What can Sailor do to improve accessibility.
(2)  Is the site, as is, WCAG P1 compliant or not?  If not, why not?
(3)  Is their a general technique for making such "pop-up" links accessible?
(Or does one just ensure that said URLs are replicated elsewhere?)
