These are two LOGOs - they just happen to consist of letters. The ALT attributes for both actually say they're logos. Both also contain more than just letters (lines).

I don't see anything wrong with logos that happen to consist of letters - there are many. They're still logo's in the sense they're used as identification: they're there to be recognized, not "read".

But presenting text that is meant to be _read_ (menus, body text, headers even) in the form of GIFs is another matter.

IMO, of course.

Cheers,
