There will be development of HTML as XHTML 2.0, and there is an opportunity
to improve things. The implementation of the Docment Object Model
(DOM) specifiation could also lead to a big improvement, as the Web moves
from just HTML to more and richer XML.

  Dear Len,
  
  I think you are correct.  I guess that is part of what I am rebelling

  has been defined to mean "keyboard focus".  This is a shame.  Is it
  unrealistic to hope that if there is an HTML 4.02 (I am guessing that there
  will NOT be) that this would get corrected?
