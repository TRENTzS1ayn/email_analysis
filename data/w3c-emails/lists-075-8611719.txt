Thanks Marjolein,

I agree completely.  Nothing wrong with text in logos, mastheads, buttons,
etc.
I am even somewhat tolerant of them in headers and as drop caps.

I am not very happy with the language of my proposed new check point:

P1:  Don't use images for body text.

Care to help me improve it?  Is "body text" clear enough a term?

Just picking nits:
(1)  Is there really such a thing as "Web  Accessibility Initiative    (WAI)
logo" or is it just fancy lettering?  (And what's with the extra spaces in
the ALT tag?)
(2)  Could not the "WAI logo" be rendered with CSS?  If so, isn't this a P2
violation on the WAI home page?

Cheers,
Bruce
