I've been thinking: a better *alternative* for that might actually be a sound. Say an easy to recognize jingle, that tells you you've arrive at the Fuzzybuz site (or whereever).

Does alternative content always have to be alternative *text*? Or can we have several alternatives, ratehr than just one?
