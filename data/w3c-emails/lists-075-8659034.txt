Several alternatives is a good thing. Sound is great (except that I can't use
it on my machine, and deaf people can't use it at all) for reminding people
of things. So is smell, but we don't really have that capability on the web
yet.

  I've been thinking: a better *alternative* for that might actually be a sound. Say an easy to recognize jingle, that tells you you've arrive at the Fuzzybuz site (or whereever).
  
  Does alternative content always have to be alternative *text*? Or can we have several alternatives, ratehr than just one?
