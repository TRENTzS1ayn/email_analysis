Dear Charles,

No, I think we just have a different opinion about the way things SHOULD
work!

Right.  And as humans with our current interface devices, keyboards and
mouse, we have limited ways to "tell" the computer where we are looking --
what our focus is on.

onMouseOver is a very reasonable way to tell the computer "I might be
interested in this, can you give me a little more information before I
choose it?"  Clicking is a reasonable way to select something.

Tabbing -- and then pausing -- is also a very reasonable way to give the
computer the same "maybe I'll select this" message.  Enter/return is a
reasonable way to select something.

Sure, users have gotten use to activated widgets on a page.  Users have also
gotten use to content that is dynamically change with very litter
interaction on their part (i.e., onMouseOver).  There should be a
keyboard-oriented equivalent to this.  If it's not onFocus, I don't know
what else it could be!

Improving the DOM is fine, but this shouldn't be necessary.  I am perplexed
that (1) onFocus doesn't have the same broad applicability (per the
specifications) as onMouseOver, and (2) it requires keyboard
activation/selection rather than the lesser standard of just actual "focus".
It is rather obvious to me that the 4.01 spec is BROKEN in this regard.  The
spec should be corrected (4.02) rather than wait for a whole new round of
standards and technology to fix the problem.  I am sorry that I am about two
years late bringing this up!
