Alas, no. But I've been thinking (I do that sometimes):

Now, if browsers really started to support the OBJECT tag, there would be a way, since it's designed to *contain* alternatives. You could have an outer object with the image, contained in that an object with the sound, and contained in that alternative text (for instance.

Turn off images, and you'd hear the sound - unless you've also turned off sound (or you've told the browser you can't hear it, or you don't have a sound card) in which case you'd see (or hear) the text.

HTML provides a way, I think. Now if only browsers would support standards.
I'll dream on for a while ...
