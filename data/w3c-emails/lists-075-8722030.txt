I have a few comments on this "on mouseover"/focus issue.  I'm not sure what
to quote from the foregoing, so I'll just forge ahead on my own <smile>.

So how do you implement a keyboard-oriented "I'm focused on this item"
feature and make it so that it doesn't disturb a person walking through a
page in, say, an Active Accessibility buffer? A speech user might need a
change of voice to indicate that some text that wasn't there previously just
"popped up." One possibility for focusing on "focusable" items might be to
use the Tab key to move from item to item.  Tabbing is nice, but it makes it
easy to lose context since you never hear what's between the "hot spots"
you're tabbing amongst.  Also, it would be nice to be able to say, "I've
decided I'm interested in this widget right here", based on reading through
the buffer of text on a page, without having to tab away from it and then
tab back to it again.
Just a few thoughts.

Jerry
