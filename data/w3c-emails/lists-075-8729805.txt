I'm glad to hear there's a chance for a more general input model in XHTML 2.0.

A few thoughts...

There are lots of input devices commecially available today that go beyond 
the mouse and keyboard model.  For example, game controllers crawling with 
buttons; or spatial input devices, used in virtual reality, that can sense 
position and orientation (x, y, z, pitch, roll, yaw).  And still more that 
never got beyond the research stage (e.g. a touch screen I developed a 
while back that sensed normal and shear components of any number of 
simultaneously applied forces).

We want to maximize the opportunity to provide accessible alternative 
inputs. So a general input model should support, at a minimum,

1. an arbitrary number of input devices

2. each device can send events and status for zero or more discrete 
variables and zero or more continuous variables

3. at any time, a given input device I can send events to any user 
interface object O (e.g. field, menu, 3D lever, etc); we then say that that 
O has focus from I .

4. The software may respond to the events and status information in (2), 
and acquisition or loss of focus described in (3).

5. Software "event transformations" would be available to change events 
from one or more input devices to the equivalent of events from any other 
device.  (This is a generalization of "serial keys" and
"mouse keys").

This would give us the maximum chance to provide an alternative 
inputs.  (Plus it's just plain good software engineering I think).

p.s.

A more general approach would be to bypass the normal inputs and go 
directly to the underlying data but that's beyond this the scope of this 
discussion.
