Hi Kelly,

this seems like a bug in your screen reader, although the code as included
here is not valid. The table should not appear inside a paragraph, and you
need the closing tag for the form...

Cheers

  Hi All,
  
  Again if there are pointers on this please direct me to appropriate
  resources.  I've been experimenting with ways to ensure that a screen
  reader will read the correct text for things like edit boxes and such on
  forms.
  
  If I exclude the table references in the below example I hear all the text
  read as a prompt.  If I include the table references I only hear the direct
  instruction to enter a name.
  
  What's the best way to code things so a screen reader will only read the
  direct instruction?  Is my method acceptable?
  
  <FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="bogus-script"> 
  An edit box is where you type information.
  <p>
  <table>
  <tr>
  <td>
  Please enter your name:
  <INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="name">
  </td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  <p>
