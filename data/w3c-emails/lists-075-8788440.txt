Members of the List may be interested in the release this month of
significant new guidelines for producing alternate media for the California
Community Colleges.  These guidelines, in conjunction with the Long Distance
Guidelines, provide requirements for electronic textbooks and webpages and
are the result of the US Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights,
Letter of Resolution discussed in my Digital Divide paper now posted at
http://www.icdri.org/cynthia_waddell.htm.    

Please see http://www.htctu.fhda.edu/amguidelines/am33000.htm for the new
guidelines for providing accessible media.
