Hi Charles,

Do you know why <http://validator.w3.org> would accept the code I mentioned 
as valid?  I copied what I shared here from a longer document at 
<http://www.teleport.com/~kford/formtest.htm> that shows as a valid 
document when I test it.  That document has the closing form tag and such 
but the table and paragraph stuff is identical to what I shared here.
