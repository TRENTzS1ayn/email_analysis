Maybe it's fluid on your computer - it certainly isn't on mine. Yes, maybe if you have the latest, fastest hardware and a video with lots of memory - but not everyone has that (or can afford it). Like I mentioned before, it's so slow that the mouse continues moving when the submenu and arrow on the main one stops displaying.
Try it on another computer (mine is a P166 with 64M RAM and the video has 2M).

Testing tip: put the site (or at least the part you need to test) on a floppy disk and load the site from there. It will give you approximately the access speed of a 28.8K modem (which is not what's in the shops now - but it is what many people still use, or the effective speed they can get out of their provider...)

Nope - I can just click - on a link that doesn't have an arrow.

Sorry,
