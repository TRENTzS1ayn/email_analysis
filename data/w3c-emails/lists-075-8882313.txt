Dear Jim,

I asked:
>> In both of your paragraphs above, by "sub-menu page" are you
>> referring to the onMouseOver navigation tool-tip pop-ups?

To which you replied:
> Absolutely not. I mean the page you get to if you follow (activate!) the
> main menu item.

Okay then!  I was making the point that the visual user, by virtue of the
onMouseOver content, can essential skip a step.

>> Current page, using onMouseOver:
>> Home Page -> onMouseOver sub-menu (same page) -> Target Page (one select
"activation")
>> Current page, using screen reader or keyboard:
>> Home Page -> sub-menu page (new page) -> Target Page (two select
"activations")

Re-phrasing both of these as:
> Find main menu item
> bring up submenu
> find sub-menu item
> open target page

I find to be a little bit disingenuous.
