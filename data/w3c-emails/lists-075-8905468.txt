I would like to point out that the need for tables to linearize correctly is
extremely important when tables are used for layout as well.

The example Steve reference to Kelly
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/1999JanMar/0086.html
is nominally of a simple data table.  Steven goes on to clarify that:

The practical work-around solution for this example is the same technique
that should be used for tables used for layout.

I understand that (regrettably) coding tables so that they make sense when
linearize will never rank a P1 in the WCAG.  It is not too late to get this
particular item into the 508 regulations however!
