All,

Today President Clinton spoke on a live webcast (was it accessible?)  about
the Digital Divide at an organization called Plugged In in East Palo Alto.
http://corp.aol.com/cgi/newmarket/schools.html

www.pluggedin.org.  It is quite interesting because as we all know people
with disabilities are victims of the digital divide.

I looked at the plugged in web site and this is what I found:

Their website does not look too accessible to me.  Alt tags do not come up
on the image maps which mean they are not there or are coded wrong.

No alt tags that I can see on other images.

they do have some links on the bottom but they can do a lot better I am not
sure but the tables don t look to accessible either.

The other pages are pretty bad also.

The Portfolio can be found at: http://www.pluggedin.org/pie/portfolio.htm

It is full of Javascript and no alt tags I can find.

Their Portfolio itself  has some real disasters.

The Forever Young Foundation
http://www.foreveryoung.org/

no alt tags, loaded with Javascript for starters.  A real shame.  It also
pops a separate window.

 The Community Partnership site at http://www.communitypartnership.org/  has
a text only version now, but it did not for a long time.

Kids Survey is loaded with javascrip and I cannot find any alt tags.

The rest of the links to the portfolio don t work.

Pretty nasty stuff.

What a shame cause these kids are obviously quite talented.

I would venture to guess that this organization receives state and Federal
aid.  Seems to me they have some legal obligations to make sure their work
is accessible.

Let me know what you think.

Sincerely,

Mike Burks
