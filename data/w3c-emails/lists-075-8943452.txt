Hmmm. That would be a bug in the validator. (Albeit a fairly minor one,
assuming the form element is closed in the original.) Unless I am
interpreting SGML too strictly. The nice thing about XML is unambiguous
syntax. Sigh.

  Hi Charles,
  
  Do you know why <http://validator.w3.org> would accept the code I mentioned 
  as valid?  I copied what I shared here from a longer document at 
  <http://www.teleport.com/~kford/formtest.htm> that shows as a valid 
  document when I test it.  That document has the closing form tag and such 
  but the table and paragraph stuff is identical to what I shared here.
