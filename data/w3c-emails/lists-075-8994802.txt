I would advise making the list grammatical and doing proper markup.  As you
probably know, Lynx puts various punctuations for bullets in front of list
items in an unordered list.  The user will only hear them if these
punctuation marks are turned on as they read the page on their favorite
screen reader.  In many bulleted lists, since IE puts the Windows-CP1252
character #149 in front of bulleted items, Window-Eyes will say "bullet" if
"enhanced" punctuation is set to "describe".  If a person wants to grok the
items in a list, they may need to stop the automatic reading for a moment
and scan through the list line by line.  In my opinion, this does not place
an undue burden on the reader.
