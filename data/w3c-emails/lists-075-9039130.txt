As Phill pointed out, the punctuation is not ungrammatical, it is
un-stylistic.  Had the same grammar of a list of items been presented in
inline style instead of in point format, the punctuation would have been
the default style because the rules of grammar apply in a way that they are
typically waived in point form.

Another angle on this issue is the availability in auditory styling
properties of a pause after each list item as a matter of style, which is
pretty much the right classification for this behavior.  Audio does an
implicit convert to inline style as Phill explained, so the audio
punctuation in the form of pauses is just good style.  Now if people were
only implementing the full CSS2...
