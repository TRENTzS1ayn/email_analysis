Dear all,

My thanks to the people who have responded off the list as well.

This has been very interesting to me.  I did not realize this issue was so
ambiguous.

Since addressing this problem is helpful, why is there not a P3 checkpoint
associated with this?

What mark-up, using CSS, would people suggest, as the "right" way to fix
this problem?  This may be kind of moot since aural style sheets are not
supported anywhere.  By the time they are, I would hope that the new crop of
screen readers would be fixed so that they automatically pause after
headings.

As an interim solution, I like Phil's technique for making some punctuation
invisible.  Phil, could you share a URL where you implement this?  I have
see "invisible" text used to hide speech-oriented menus, for a good example,
see URL:
http://www.techconnections.org/

How common do people think this kind of technique is?
Do people think this technique is advisable?
Does HTML or CSS support a "transparent" color for text?

Thanks.
