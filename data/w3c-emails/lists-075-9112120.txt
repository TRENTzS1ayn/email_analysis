That is a clever attempt to opt out of the debate over which is better.  If
you can't decide, why not do both?  Sorry, I am not buying it.  For my part,
I am loath to use TITLE on IMGs that are NOT links.  And for IMGs that
actually ARE links, I use the TITLE that is specified in the HEAD by the
referenced HREF'ed document.  This is usually something similar for what you
propose for ALT content.  I agree with Marjolein on this one.
