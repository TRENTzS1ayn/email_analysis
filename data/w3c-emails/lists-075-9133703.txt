I disagree - it is an attempt to use each attribute for their intended
function. The alt attribute specifies a replacement text, and the title
attribute specifies, in humna readable form, the role of the element in the
document.

  That is a clever attempt to opt out of the debate over which is better.  If
  you can't decide, why not do both?  Sorry, I am not buying it.  For my part,
  I am loath to use TITLE on IMGs that are NOT links.  And for IMGs that
  actually ARE links, I use the TITLE that is specified in the HEAD by the
  referenced HREF'ed document.  This is usually something similar for what you
  propose for ALT content.  I agree with Marjolein on this one.
