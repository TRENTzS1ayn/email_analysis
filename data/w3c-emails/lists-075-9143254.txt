Course Description:

The days of designing for only one or two web browsers are long
gone; today's Web surfers use anything from non-visual screen
readers to the latest version of Netscape Navigator, and the
future will bring even more Internet-enabled 'Net appliances --
televisions, phones, watches, toasters, cars, and more. Designing
for universal accessibility is vitally important to ensure that
the sites you create today will continue to work tomorrow and
beyond, into the 21st century. Instructor Kynn Bartlett will
show you how to use HTML 4.0 to make your pages accessible to
everyone.

(Pre-requisite: Intermediate level HTML skill)
