It's a nuisance, it's true.

On the other hand, the email list administration medium doesn't always give
us all the flexibility of control that we might like.  

Alternatives which would raise further barriers to spam have downside
effects like:

a) they put more barriers in the way of participation by people we do want
to hear from, such as consumers with disabilities who are on the hairy edge
of coping with the medium as it is.

b) delaying what we hear from newcomers or outsiders while some staffer
gets around to screening it, or

c) being so thoroughly organized that people are on call at all times night
and day to cover occasional moderation opportunities.

Changing the listserver rules to clamp down a little more on spam is under
discussion between the staff and Coordination Group as we speak.  But
please be aware that there are possible downsides to some of these changes
and that is why it doesn't happen overnight.

In the meantime, would others interested in netiquette or list
administration policy issues please follow the posted suggestion:
