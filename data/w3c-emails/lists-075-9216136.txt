Hi,
Does anyone know if Microsoft Agent Technology is accessible? If I   program
agent characters like Merlin and Genie through Javascripts and load them on
a web page, can screenreaders like JFW get access to the text that the
character 'speaks'? Is accessibility implemented through MSAA?

Any thoughts/ideas would be appreciated.

Thanks.
