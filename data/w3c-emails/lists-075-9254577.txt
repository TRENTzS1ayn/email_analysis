The Federal Communications Commission held a public forum today, April 28,
2000 from 10-11:15 am, EST.  For persons not able to attend the forum in
person, we broadcasted the meeting via Real Audio.  To make the internet
broadcasting accessible to persons with hearing disabilities, we tried a new
in-house technology for real-time captioning on the internet, via Real
Video.

As many of you know, the FCC is committed to ensuring access to all persons
with disabilities, and has worked through three vendors in the past to
provide real-time internet captioning, all of which are no longer providing
this service.  We would appreciate your comments on our in-house trial of
internet captioning.  

To view the captioning, go to http://www.fcc.gov/realaudio/ 
If you do not have RealPlayer, you can download it from the website.  It is
also instructions on the site as to how to do this.

Any feedback or comments you have on the usability and readability of this
service is welcome.  Please send all comments to access@fcc.gov.  Thank you.
