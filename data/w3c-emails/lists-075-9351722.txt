David, 

Getting authoring tools to support production of accessible content is
indeed an important way to ensure that there is more accessible content on
the Web.

That is why W3C/WAI developed, with input from many organizations and
individuals, the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (ATAG)
<http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG> which were released as a W3C Recommendation on
February 3, 2000.

You might want to visit the ATAG press release
<http://www.w3.org/2000/02/ATAG-PressRelease> and the testimonials and fact
sheet that are linked from the release. 

There are currently a number of authoring tool developers working on
implementations of ATAG.

For more information, contact either myself (information in signature block
below) or the head of press relations, Janet Daly, at the W3C; information
available from http://www.w3.org/Press.

Thanks for your interest,

Judy
