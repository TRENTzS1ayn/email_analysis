I would like to invite everyone who is interested in html 
design, talking about web accessibility, tips on html design for 
blind web authors, making programs that work with the web such 
as web editors work with screen readers, and concerns to do with 
the internet in general to join us on the html-designers list. 

Wether you want to design web pages, and are blind, or want to 
talk about the accessibility rules, or have some knowledge of 
html but are uncertain how to make certain aspects work as a 
blind person: than please feel free to join our community. Send 
a message to: htmldesigners-subscribe@egroups.com for those of 
you using html readers: <mailto:htmldesigners-
subscribe@egroups.com> 

You may visit the html-designers page at: 
http://htmldesigners@jumpcomputers.com 

Or feel free to contact me, Frank at: 
franciscoi@bigfoot.com 

If you feel this message could help others please feel free to 
forward in it's entirety. 


Thanks,

Frank.
