An article on wired.com:

"Not so long ago, Web designers who wanted to create fancy
  sites with dynamic interfaces had to take a deep breath and
  code their pop-up menus and glowing menu buttons in Sun's
  Java.
"But buggy Java engines, performance problems, and design tools
  geared toward programmers instead of graphic artists has
  prompted a mass exodus from Java to a once-obscure format
  originally intended for animators: Macromedia's Flash."

The accessibility drawbacks of Flash aren't even touched on,
and instead you get the following:

"Torrone, a Macromedia partner who sits on the Flash advisory
  board, is building the first online bank entirely in Flash.
"You couldn't do a whole bank in Java," Torrone said. "It's too
  unstable. There are too many different implementations on
  different browsers and different platforms. It has lower
  penetration and there are security issues like malicious Java
  applets. Flash is almost foolproof. It's just graphics. There's
  no key to the door."

Anyone else worried about a trend towards an all-Flash web?
