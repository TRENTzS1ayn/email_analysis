I find the title of this mail funny. Flash has been touted as "The 
future" for the last two years. In reality it has already arrived, 
and in my opinion, peaked. I think Flash is "Like, sooo 1999". It is 
very good for visual designers, and served it's purpose well. 
However, it is quite limited, and authors are looking for more 
comprehensive tools. SVG (scalable vector graphics) is a better 
standard for Flash-like content. It hasn't been adopted yet, but it 
should be quite accessible, because it is text-based, not binary code 
like Flash.

I think Quicktime has a lot more potential, and it's important to 
make sure Apple know how important accessibility is, so they can 
build such features into future versions of Quicktime. If this is 
done, it could be a perfect medium for talking books.

Flash is very prevalent, and that is a worry. Authors have to realise 
that it isn't suitable for everyone, and alternatives should be 
provided. Macromedia has to attack this issue head on as they develop 
their software. Everyone concerned should write to Macromedia and 
Apple, and demand accessible Quicktime and Flash!
