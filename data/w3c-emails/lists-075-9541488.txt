I tried to sign on to the passcenter service, but after completing 
the registration form, I was taken to a blank page. I never got to 
choose any faces. I'm waiting for a response from support.

I did see the demo faces, and they were all smiling. I thought it 
would be much better if people had different expressions on their 
faces, making it easier to remember them, than a sea of people with 
the same cheesy smile.
