I tried to sign on to the passcenter service, but after completing
the registration form, I was taken to a blank page. I never got to
choose any faces. I'm waiting for a response from support--David


I also signed up and when I went back to use the product, they returned
that my user name was not registered. So I went through the registration
process again, picked the same user name and received a messaged stating
the user name was already taken.  So I wrote to support and still haven't
received an answer as to why my user name was but wasn't registered.

I did get to see the faces, but thought, like David, that  all the smiles
didn't help in the recognition process.
