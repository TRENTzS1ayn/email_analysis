My only caution is that jaws should not be viewed as the benchmark.  you
should use live individuals in your area who are disabled to try out what
you have done and make suggestions and or provide feedback.  useability is a
moving target from the technology stand point and going through hoops to see
that one set of users can use the software may debilitate your effort on
behalf of others and for the future.

Thanks for the work though.
