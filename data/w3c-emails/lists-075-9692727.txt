I find that some multimedia catalogue software is useful for this 
kind of thing. I use "iView Multimedia" (for Mac), which will output 
an HTML gallery from your image library, and caption it based on 
keywords, comments etc. that you can add with iView. Makes updating 
easy, but you would have to add ALT tags, unless you could add them 
with Applescript or something. Maybe I should contact the author to 
mention the issue - the software could easily be updated to 
automatically create them.

I'm not sure what equivalents are available for Windows.
