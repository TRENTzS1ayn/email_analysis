I am also interested in the answer to this.

Terry,

I would very interested in understanding why Santa Rosa decided to develop
their own guidelines rather than just endorsing the WCAG?  There is a check
list (similar in format to yours) at URL:
http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/full-checklist.html 
which you might have deleted the P2 and P3 items from.  How did that list
not suit your needs?

Cheers,
Bruce Bailey
