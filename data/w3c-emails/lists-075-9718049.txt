In my opinion, Santa Rosa did the right thing.  The Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines are a wonderful thing, but they are not
an implementation plan that can be used by an organization or
company.  The correct use of the WCAG in these cases is as a
foundation for building an implementation plan, which can include
both WCAG sources and other sources that might also be appropriate
for any given site.

I believe WCAG 1.0 priority 1 checkpoints are "must haves" for any
implementation plan, and then priority 2 and 3 checkpoints
considered individually, plus any additional requirements.  (In
no case would I ever advise anyone to -not- include WCAG p1 in
their own guidelines.)

PS:  WCAG actually does specify some "de facto" implementation
      plans by the single-A/double-AA/triple-AAA conformance
      system, but in my opinion, that produces *terrible* plans for
      practical implementation of increased accessibility, and
      I consider the conformance levels to border on being
      dangerous...
