Hello Terry:
    I thought I might share one observation.  I use JFW 3.2 with IE 4.1 and when I tab from link to link on the page,
http://www.santarosa.edu/access/www/checklist/ 
I hear repeatedly only the words
Explanation, Examples, Testing.  Without context, I have no way of knowing to which checkpoint any one of these refers.  I think the checkpoint subject should be part of the linked text.
-Steve
