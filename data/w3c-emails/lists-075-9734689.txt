Description:
   The iMedia list encompasses the full range of technologies involved in
   producing dynamic media for the internet (or any net for that matter).
   Acquisition (how to shoot for a particular target), digitization (how
   to get the best image for compression), compression, authoring (QT,
   ASF, Javascript, DHTML, Flash...), delivery (embedding on web pages,
   player technologies, HTML, streaming, bandwidth, client issues....),
   and art (discussion of iMedia as a new art form, thinking out of the
   box, interactivity....). List inspired by Stephen Muro and Jeff Handy.
