Greetings,

I tend to agree with Paul, the W3C stuff while very valuable to an
experienced web developer, is almost useless for a lay person. Those of you
who have heard my presentations on Web Access have heard this before. We
have rewritten the guidelines to be more usable for our developers here at
OSU, mostly faculty who know almost nothing about HTML code. We have found
that almost anything that is produced for general consumption needs to be
tailored to the specifics of your institution.

We have approached the WAI with a more usable rewrite of their guidelines,
and have never had a response. We wanted distribution permission to beta
test the evaluation protocols we had developed, and basically got blown off
by the WAI, despite talking to the folks in charge on more than one
occasion.

The other piece of misinformation that tends to get spread around is that
accessibility does not cost anything. If you try to sell this to your
institutional IS folks your credibility is going to take a nose dive. Making
educational websites fully accessible adds 10-15% to the development time of
the site, so logically it also adds correspondingly to the cost of overall
development.

Hi Paul and all,

Gee, I thought this reaction to the WAI content was a little extreme.
I think their job -- which we probably agree was done almost perfectly  --
was to specify exactly where there were access problems in content,
browsers, and authoring tools, and what the corresponding solutions and
approaches are.  As a matter of fact, to my mind WAI documents are
the best such job I've seen.  Their completeness does in fact cause
for problems in reading and implementing, for people who don't want to
become experts.  I think this category includes 95% of the people
who we want to reach, such as your users.  But that's not really
WAI's fault.  In fact, they did a good job of publishing the
bare essentials on a business card.  This format may be too brief,
but it has gone a long way in convincing potential critics that the
problems are not abstruse or insoluble.

And I'll bet that if you -- or a bunch of us -- approached WAI with
a proposal to extract, collate, index, and "leaven" their content
for this semi-mainstream, non-expert large audience, they'd be
entirely enthusiastic.  I've done this for some corporate clients,
who also like to fold in some of their own content for an intranet
accessibility resource, and it's quite feasible.
