In my opinion you are correct.  The proposed legal standard for
accessibility with respect to federal web sites is found as part of the
proposed Section 508 rules.  The details can be found at:

http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/nprm.htm

These proposed rules are out for public comment until May 30, 2000.  It is
not clearly defined when the final rules will be published after this date.
