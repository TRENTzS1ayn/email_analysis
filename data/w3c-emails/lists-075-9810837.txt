It should be pointed out, however, that the issue is not completely
all "up in the air" and we do know quite a bit about what the
legal requirements for government sites will look like -- even before
they released the document which Kelly referred to above!

We knew/know the following:

      1.  _Some_ level of accessibility to government/public
          information _will_ be mandated; what's being debated is
          "to what level" not "will it happen."

      2.  The requirements _will_ be based (as in, "source material",
          not necessarily "directly copied") upon the Web Content
          Accessibility Guidelines, which were published last
          year.

Which leads to a good conclusion:

      Don't wait until the government standards are published before
      _studying_ and _implementing_ the WCAG.  You can't go very
      wrong with your own WCAG-based policy; at worst, you'll just
      have to add a few more items onto the things you are already
      doing -- and in truth, web accessibility is more about
      *a mindset* and less about *a list of checkpoints*, so if you
      start now on "thinking WAI", you'll be ahead of the game.

Hey, there's our new motto:  "Think WAI".
