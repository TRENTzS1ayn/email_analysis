I do not think that MSAA is currently implemented in Microsoft Agent, but it
was something the Accessibility and Disabilities Group talked about with
them, and I think they are working on it. Send mail to Tandy Trower - I
think he is in charge of the project tandyt@microsoft.com, I think. Of
course, for someone using a screenreader, Agent shouldn't be a problem -
they speak what is shown on the screen - so the only problem is if you're
using a software based synthesizer - sometimes it is difficult for two
applications to use the sound card at the same time.

Hi,
Does anyone know if Microsoft Agent Technology is accessible? If I   program
agent characters like Merlin and Genie through Javascripts and load them on
a web page, can screenreaders like JFW get access to the text that the
character 'speaks'? Is accessibility implemented through MSAA?

Any thoughts/ideas would be appreciated.

Thanks.
