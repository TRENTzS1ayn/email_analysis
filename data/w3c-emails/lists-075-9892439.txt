Web Accessibility Subcommittee members--

Have any of you been following the latest thread on the accessibility
listserve? It is getting quite heated. It is in regards to the
burdensome nature of the W3C documentation.

The members have been bringing up some salient points that will affect
our education outreach efforts. I currently dread pointing people to the
W3C guidelines, as they are very intimidating to the uninitiated.

This checklist from the Section 508 site (
http://www.section508.gov/webpage.html) states: "The WAI's Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines may differ from the legally-enforceable
standards that the Access Board will promulgate by February 7, 2000."
This reflects the decision of the Department of Justice to stray from
the W3C to some degree. Their decision may stem from legal sticking
points, but it reflects the movement that other groups are making toward
setting their own standards.

The more discussion I read on this issue, the more I think we need our
own guidelines, separate from the W3C.

Just my two cents. Any thoughts?
