Greetings all,

By the way Ian the name is Ron, you are confusing me with an English
gentleman of some renown. I am a relatively unknown academic who is doing
what we believe to be come great work out on the west coast of the US.
(grin)

What started out as a closed discussion just became much larger, but that is
okay. We are all working towards the same ends, and I always am a fan of
full disclosure.

I never wrote a formal proposal I wrote both a letter and sent an email,
along with all of the files created by our efforts. This was almost a year
ago right after the ATIA conference in Orlando. We asked for permission to
distribute our revised checklist for beta testing as a part of a more
comprehensive evaluation package project we have been working on for a
couple of years. This was done to be in compliance with the copyright on the
WAI documents. 

We also contacted WAI when we first started this project right after the
release of the first draft of the WAI guidelines. I have also talked with
folks representing WAI at several conferences over the last couple of years.
To sum things up, I have never been overly impressed with the responses that
I have received for what we feel is very important work. I always want to be
a part of the process whenever possible, but the impression I got from those
that I talked to was disinterest at best. Who they were is unimportant at
this point, but I was surprised by the response I got, given the role they
play in the WAI. Granted they did not know me from Adam, so as many
academics do I proceeded on my own.

If any of the concerned parties would like to contact me directly on this
issue I would be more than happy to discuss it with them. We have invested a
considerable amount of time in our work, and I would like to move it to the
next stage, and get feedback from a larger group.

Hello,

[I'm moving this discussion from the user agent list
to the IG list as it does not concern the User Agent 
Guidelines Working Group alone.]

I have a question about one comment below from Rod Stewart:

  | We have approached the WAI with a more usable rewrite of 
  | their guidelines, and have never had a response.

Do you have a URL to your proposal?
