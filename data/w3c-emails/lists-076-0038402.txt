When I said quote That should be the criterion endquote I did not mean
accessible with HPR, I meant accessible.

Accessible with Home Page Reader does not necesarily mean accessible, and
there are at least features of the page which do not work in non-javascript
browsers. At least for students at RMIT University, where my office is, and
who have to use lynx or emacs in text-mode, this counts as inaccessible.

However this does raise an interesting topic - what level of support needs
to
be provided for technology which is not up to date? An interesting
corollary
on this is that up-to-date tends to vary from language to language - there
are a huge range of products avilable in the english language, but there
are
relatively few designed to use any sign language, or to use Gaelic or
Faroese.

  Just what the world needs.  Another disability-oriented portal site which
  doesn't meet the P1 checkpoints.  Drop them a line!
