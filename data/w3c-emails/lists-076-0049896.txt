INCLUSION BY DESIGN
Planning the Barrier-Free World
June 1-5, 2001, Montr?al (Qu?bec) Canada

Call for papers at: http://216.13.114.21/worldcongress/call-eng.htm

From June 1-5, 2001, The Canadian Council on Rehabilitation and Work is
hosting an international world congress - INCLUSION BY DESIGN - Planning
the Barrier-Free World in Montr?al, Canada (Palais des Congr?s de
Montr?al). As well as encouraging barrier-free design, the conference
delegates and presenters will look at inclusive policies which can be
developed and implemented through government, corporate and community
infrastructures.

Senior Canadian and international representatives are invited to attend
this truly unique and progressive event. Approximately 2,000 delegates
and presenters from around the world will reflect a range of global
issues, experiences and solutions. The event brings together the policy
makers, educators, professionals, organizations and individuals who
focus on implementing universal design and equal access for all people.

INCLUSION BY DESIGN will incorporate two approaches:

First, it will promote the application of universal design and
barrier-free measurements for products, goods and services.

Second, it will emphasize that recognition of an accessible and
inclusive environment cannot become a reality without the deliberate and
persistent effort of citizens and their leaders.
