## eEurope Targets

By the end of 2000:


Review Information Society legislation and standards on accessibility.

Recommendation to take account of people with disabilities in the public
procurement of information and communications products and services.

By the end of 2001:


Commitment to make all public Web sites and their content accessible to
people with disabilities.

By the end of 2002:


Create centres of excellence in each Member State to develop an EU
curriculum in Design-for-All.


## Progress made

A dedicated website has been set up by the Portuguese Presidency at
http://www.egroups.com/group/eeurope-pwd/ to discuss the eEurope initiative
in the area of citizens with disabilities. This website has received a
healthy response and discussion is on-going.

Some informal discussions have taken place with key actors in this field,
including organisations of users and the High Level Group on Disability.
Current work carried out by CEN on Design-for-All standardisation is also
being linked to the eEurope initiative.

## Progress needed

A mechanism must be established to monitor relevant legislation and
standards to ensure their conformity with accessibility principles and to
harmonised national action. By next June Commission will propose a
co-ordinator mechanism for monitoring, in consultation with Member States.

The Commission will prepare a Communication on how public procurement
instruments can positively take account of the needs of people with
disabilities in the procurement of digital technology products and services.

The European Institutions and the Member States should endorse the existing
Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) guidelines, making the design and content
of all public Web sites accessible to people with disabilities
(www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT). Public-private partnerships should be
encouraged to ensure widespread web accessibility.

The Commission will set up a Virtual European Network to optimise the
interaction among national centres of excellence (either physical or
virtual) and encourage the development of curricula in Design-for-All for
designers and engineers.
