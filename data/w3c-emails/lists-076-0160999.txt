Subject:HCI Usability-Accessibility Evaluation

As part of a doctoral research project in Human Computer Interaction (HCI),
I am investigating current practices for evaluating web site accessibility
from a combined HCI usability-and accessibility evaluation perspective.
That is to say, I have found numerous examples of usability evaluation
protocols based on HCI theories.  While some factors used in HCI evaluation
protocols "point" to accessibility related issues, none seem to address this
concern directly.  Likewise, I have found several protocols for evaluating
web sites for levels of accessibility.  While a good case could be made for
the point that a more accessible site is a more usable site, I have not
located any accessibility evaluation protocols that specifically address
non-accessibility-related usability issues.  Likewise, I have been unable to
locate examples where these two perspectives have been combined to produce a
single, more holistic evaluation protocol.
Is anyone on this list aware of existing usability-accessibility evaluation
protocols?  Can anyone point me in the direction of research or literature
in this area?  Any personal thoughts on this matter are certainly welcome.
