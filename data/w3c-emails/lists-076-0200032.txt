Thanks for responding, Bruce. Using an empty TITLE attribute in the IMG tag
to suppress tooltips does indeed work with MSIE, which suits my wife's
client for the moment. By the way, we tested with MSIE 4, 4.5 and 5 on
Windows.

Pop-up tooltips still block rollover effects on Netscape, though, (correct
me if I'm wrong about that!) and designers are still likely to avoid alt
text because of that.

I mentioned that we designed past that issue on one site by making the
rollover effect appear in a different part of the page than the pop-up
tooltip. Personally as a graphic designer, I enjoy including that kind of
"thinking through the design" in my gestation process when working on a site
but this whole issue will take a lot of education with web designers in
general.
