Can we remove this individual from the list or is it possible to block
his messages from our computer? 

I would hate to cease my membership to this forum, but this type of
communication is not acceptable. 

I don't wish to receive this or any other type of advertisement on the
w3c-wai-ig@w3.org forum.
