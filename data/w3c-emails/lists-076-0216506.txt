Claude:

This person is not registered on this list. The WAI IG list, as most of the
other WAI lists, accepts public postings. This means that from time to time
this list, as with most mailing lists, will receive spam.

W3C already has extensive spam filtering in place, which blocks out
hundreds of messages per day that would otherwise hit this list. New
spamming addresses are periodically added to the filters and spam services
that we use.

If a spam message comes in, it is important not to reply to it. On the few
occasions when members of this list reply to a spammer, it serves to
validate both the w3c-wai-ig address and the respondents' address as valid
addresses which can be sold to other spammers at a higher rate, thereby
increasing the spamming. So it is important not to reply to spammers.

Please just delete the messages and move on. For any further comments on
this topic, please send to me directly instead of to the list, to reduce
the list time on this topic.

Thank you,

- Judy
