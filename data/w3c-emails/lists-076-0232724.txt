Hello,

         Please bare with me as I tell you about two doube hits available to 
you online. They are:

          1. My weekly column on assistive technology appears today under 
Daily Briefing on BusinessWeek.Com. Its on a new operating system for blind 
people. Your comments are welcome.

           2. Also online is Business Week print magazine. There is a special 
report on the Americans with Disabilities Act, future technologies and 
enabling technologies.
There is also a special interview online with Vinton Cerf.
               To read the insert, when you come to the BusinessWeek.Com page 
move to the right hand side of the page. You will see a picture of a woman in 
a chair and above her the words Privacy on the Net  What Should Be Done. 
Click on the picture and you will come to the table of contents, scroll down 
and you will see a special insert section on The Disabled: Enlisting A New 
Workforce. 
              I would appreciate any of your comments on the articles. 

              You can find the same articles on the ADA, but not Vinton 
Cerf's interview, on magazine stands. Be sure it says March 20 on it and not 
March 13. 

               I want to thank all of you for your support of the column. 
Please keep reading it and sending me your comments and please keep telling 
your friends.

                John Williams
