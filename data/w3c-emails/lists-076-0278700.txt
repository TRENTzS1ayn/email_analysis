Hi,

I am seeking a little advice on a problem I have viewing a web site with a
macintosh web browser. The problem I am having occurs when I visit a page on
e-trades web site [1] with ms ie 4.5. I cannot view the material on the page
because the text is too small for me to read. The default setting for my
font size is Largest. To work arround the problem I downloaded the page and
removed the all the <small> </small> tags. This improved the situation and
made the text barely readable, but at least now I could read the text. The
new problem now was all the relative links did not work.

I mentioned the problem by e-mail to e-Trade and provided the details of
what I did to try and work around the problem.

The issue as I understand it has to do with the dpi the monitor is set to
display, or something similar to that. Please correct me if I am wrong.
Anyway, Wintel computers I think are set to a default 96dpi while Macintosh
computers use 72dpi. This may translate into trouble when web masters assume
a default setting of 96dpi.

I think Wintel users can change their dpi in the Monitors control panel. I
assume changing it from the default (small fonts?) to a custom setting of 72
dpi should reproduce the problem, correct? I am unaware of anyway to change
the dpi setting on a macintosh computer (without probably having to use any
3rd party software).

I referred them to w3 [2] as a source for more information on the problem.
In response, they suggested that the problem did not lie with their code,
and that I should increase the size of my font in my web browser. I rewrote
them and mentioned that that did not solve the problem and explained the
possible source of the problem to them again. They then responded with a
message indicating I should: (1) visit the online help center for
instructions on how to navigate, or (2) call a toll free number for help. I
plan to call the toll free number.

Should there not be a resolution to the problem, short of closing my
account, is their anything someone here can suggest I can do to view the
page or similar pages?

Thanks for any suggestions in advance.
