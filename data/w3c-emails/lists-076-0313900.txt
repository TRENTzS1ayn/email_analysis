To make the relative links work in your downloaded version you could add a
base element in the head, to tell it what to assume the relative links are
starting from.

As an alternative, you could write a User stylesheet that says small is
font-size: 95% or something. (or 125%) But I am not sure without thinking
abut it for aa while what kind of stylesheet you need - there are all kinds
of styling approaches used here.

The real issue just has to do with poor design. In my humble opinion.

  Hi,
  
  I am seeking a little advice on a problem I have viewing a web site with a
  macintosh web browser. The problem I am having occurs when I visit a page on
  e-trades web site [1] with ms ie 4.5. I cannot view the material on the page
  because the text is too small for me to read. The default setting for my
  font size is Largest. To work arround the problem I downloaded the page and
  removed the all the <small> </small> tags. This improved the situation and
  made the text barely readable, but at least now I could read the text. The
  new problem now was all the relative links did not work.
  
  I mentioned the problem by e-mail to e-Trade and provided the details of
  what I did to try and work around the problem.
  
  The issue as I understand it has to do with the dpi the monitor is set to
  display, or something similar to that. Please correct me if I am wrong.
  Anyway, Wintel computers I think are set to a default 96dpi while Macintosh
  computers use 72dpi. This may translate into trouble when web masters assume
  a default setting of 96dpi.
  
  I think Wintel users can change their dpi in the Monitors control panel. I
  assume changing it from the default (small fonts?) to a custom setting of 72
  dpi should reproduce the problem, correct? I am unaware of anyway to change
  the dpi setting on a macintosh computer (without probably having to use any
  3rd party software).
  
  I referred them to w3 [2] as a source for more information on the problem.
  In response, they suggested that the problem did not lie with their code,
  and that I should increase the size of my font in my web browser. I rewrote
  them and mentioned that that did not solve the problem and explained the
  possible source of the problem to them again. They then responded with a
  message indicating I should: (1) visit the online help center for
  instructions on how to navigate, or (2) call a toll free number for help. I
  plan to call the toll free number.
  
  Should there not be a resolution to the problem, short of closing my
  account, is their anything someone here can suggest I can do to view the
  page or similar pages?
  
  Thanks for any suggestions in advance.
