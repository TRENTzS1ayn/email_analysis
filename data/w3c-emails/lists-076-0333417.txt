As quick news analysis -- Frezza's response seems at least 50%
more wordy and "defensive" than it needs to be, continually
reminding us that he writes a column and setting up straw men
of the sort "well, if you don't agree, then you're trying to
gouge out my eyes and shut me down and that's pretty
un-American!"

Weird response.  I think he'd have been better off by simply
not writing a rebuttal, or at least, keeping it as short as
possible.
