I propose that this should read:

<blockquote>
<li> If the image is assumed to be a bullet, it is recommend that list items
be marked up with the <LI> tag, possibly in conjunction with CSS -- which
can render bullets using the author's choice of graphic.  If this approach
is not satisfactory (to the author), then ALT="*" is recommended.
<li> If the image is assumed to be a horizontal rule, it is recommend that
horizontal rules be marked up with the <HR> tag, possibly in conjunction
with CSS -- which can render bullets using the author's choice of graphic.
If this approach is not satisfactory (to the author), then ALT="--" is
recommended.
</blockquote>

I would point out that <q>--</q> is what both Karl Ove H. and Wendy C. used
in the signature portion of their email (a text-only medium) to convey the
meaning of a horizontal rule...
