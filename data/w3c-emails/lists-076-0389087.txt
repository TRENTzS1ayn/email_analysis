LEARN MORE ABOUT SECTION 508... 
AND HOW IT WILL AFFECT YOU
On August 7, 2000, a fundamental change will occur
in the U.S. government's criteria to determine what
IT solutions to purchase.  Furthermore, the U.S. government
will be held more accountable in how information is accessed.
Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires that information
must be equally accessible, through technology, to both
disabled and non-disabled federal employees and members
of the public who need to access government information.
Be sure to attend the following FOSE sessions that will
highlight this topic:

1.  Keynote Address:  Janet Reno, U.S. Attorney General
     (invited)  Tuesday, April 18, 12 - 1 p.m.
     Hear Ms. Reno address the challenges of Section 508.
