Thanks Bruce.

Yes.  I put it on the wish list.  High priority I'd say.

Yes.  Another simple but useful thing to do.

Hmmm.  One simple thing would be to just put a warning on any <IMG> with an 
onmouseover attribute.  That tells the user to look at what happens and 
check if it's in the ALT or longdesc... or some other obvious place 
nearby.   Would that cover it?

I use one of those on my home page BTW, http://astro.temple.edu/~kasday
