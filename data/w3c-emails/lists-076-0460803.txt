Also, Bruce...

You mentioned about administrators.  Right now, as you say, the philosophy 
of the WAVE is close interaction with the human users.  However, once I've 
gone through the work of parsing and detecting various conditions, it would 
be simple to output statistics if that's what you had in mind.  E.g. for 
images, total number, total without ALT text, total with suspicious ALT 
text, and the rest... which need human perusal.

Those kinds of overview statistics might also make it more useful to users 
who are blind, another thing I want to do.

What sorts of things would you like to see?  And what format?  HTML tables, 
"spreadsheet" files, etc?  Not that I'm promising a completion date (grin).
