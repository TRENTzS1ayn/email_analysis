Briefly, Bobby mostly makes checks that can be reduced to a pass/fail
decision by machine inspection of the markup.  

It give you a report that documents what other things you need to check
with human judgement in the loop, but it doesn't set up those manual checks
for you to the extent that WAVE does.

The WAVE was developed specifically to explore techniques whereby automatic
processing can help people perform the "non-automatable, manual" checks.

For more on this philosophy and an integrated description of different
kinds of checks please check out the document draft at
