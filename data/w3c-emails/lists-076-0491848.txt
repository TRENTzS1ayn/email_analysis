MAGpie 1.0 Release


The CPB/WGBH National Center for Accessible Media (NCAM) is 
pleased to announce that the Media Access Generator (MAGpie) 
is now available.  MAGpie simplifies the process of adding 
captions to multimedia in three formats:  Apple's QuickTime, 
the World Wide Web Consortium's Synchronized Multimedia 
Integration Language (SMIL) and Microsoft's Synchronized 
Accessible Media Interchange format (SAMI).  MAGpie can also 
integrate audio descriptions into SMIL presentations.

For complete details on downloading MAGpie, visit NCAM's Web 
site:  http://www.wgbh.org.  There is no charge for the 
software.

Screen-reader users should note that MAGpie has been designed 
to work with Window-Eyes and several versions of JAWS for 
Windows.  See the NCAM Web site for full details.

If you were part of the original MAGpie beta-test group, NCAM 
would like to thank you for your participation.  If you no 
longer wish to receive announcements about MAGpie, please 
send a note to Geoff Freed at the address below.

Funding for MAGpie comes from the Trace Research and 
Development Center at the University of Wisconsin, as part of 
its Information Technology Access Rehabilitation Engineering 
Research Center which itself is funded by the U.S. Department 
of Education's National Institute on Disability and 
Rehabilitation Research.  

Thank you for using MAGpie!
