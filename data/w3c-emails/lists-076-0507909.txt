This element of type INPUT with attribute type="image" should have an ALT
attribute set.  If you bash an ALT into the page, the screen reader gets
it, no?

The rules for when to inspect for an ALT may not be that complete in the
WAVE logic yet.

Note: score one for the new evaluation techniques draft.  If one goes to 

Techniques For Evaluation And Implementation Of Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines

http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/index.html#q8

It is very clear that the page is broken and this condition should be checked.

Not nearly so clear in the HTML Techniques annex to the WCAG.
