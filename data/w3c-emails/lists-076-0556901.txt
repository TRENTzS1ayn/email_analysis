Kelly, thanks for spotting that.  Fixed now.

That was an

<INPUT type="image">

WAVE now tests for ALT text there.  Do you think thats being too 
tough?  Should we allow a readable value attribute, which is what the 
screen reader picks up on?  I'm personally inclined to say no, thats too 
much like allowing an image filename to be a substitute for ALT text. Plus 
it would make the coding of WAVE harder <grin>.

Also, I'm glad to see that the WAVE output is sufficiently accessible that 
its bugs can be spotted through a screenreader.

WAVE also showed in that example javascript that wasn't hidden from 
non-javascript browsers... they should have used an HTML comment <!--
Hmmm.  wonder if I should do something about that... people might can 
scared off by the javascript or think WAVE was broken...
