This came up on xml-dev.
Anyone know of anything?

regards,DaveP

A colleague of mine mentioned that W3C may be working on table 
accessibility involving XML expression of table relationships.   If 
anyone's seen info on this from WAI or elsewhere, could you forward to 
me?  I haven't been able to find it on the W3C site. 

Thanks,
