I probably only told half the story last time.

As far as accessibility, on should start with the browse methods described
in the User Agent guidelines 

User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0

http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10

What we need in the format (markup usage in XML dialects) is the
information required to support these display and interaction variants.

The HTML mechanisms for clarifying cell-to-header etc. relationships can be
used if you are comfortable with namespaces and bring them in from the html
namespace.

The other place to look is in the Structures work in XML Schema.
