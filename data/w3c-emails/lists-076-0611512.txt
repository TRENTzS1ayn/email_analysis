Thanks. This works but unfortunately requires I edit each page I visit each
time I visit it. One work arround may be to write an applescript that adds
the information automatically for me.

It just occured to me perhaps if I disable support for stylesheets the site
may be a bit more accessible to me. As soon as I have an opportunity to go
online I will let you know the results.

I just had an opportunity to visit the site with style sheets disabled. It
works much better now.

I think I read somewhere that there is a version MS IE for the Mac does not
properly calculate the sizes of inherited properties when percentages are
used. I cannot recally my source but I think I should be able to find it
again if I browse:

http://css.nu/pointers/

Should this be the case it may be better if I use the em unit. But if I
understand your point you are suggesting the use relative values.

Unfortunately, the feature set on the Mac and Windows versions of IE are not
par. There are some features that are unique to each version. But even if it
were as you suggest it would be time consuming and a bit unreasonable even
with an applescript to help.

MS IE 4.5 does not support client side local style sheets. I am not aware of
any Mac Web Browsers that support this feature. This means I would need to
download the page each time to get the new changes and edit the associated
style sheet.

This is a very good suggestion. Although currently there is no support that
I am aware of for local style sheets on the Mac web broswers that I use,
support may be available in the future. A collection of these values could
become useful at that time. I have cc ed a copy of this message to eTrade.

Thanks for your advice. I have sent eTrade a copy of this message and hope
they are interested in correcting the problem. I mailed before on the issue.
I pointed them to the w3 site but not to any specific document.  Here is an
edited excerpt of a message I received on the issue:

--------------------------------------------------
Case #: 000312-1105

What you may want to try is modifying your fonts on your browser.
If you are using Netscape you can click on Edit and select Preferences.
From there you can click on Fonts and change the font size.
With Internet Explorer you will click on View and then select Fonts to
change the size.

But otherwise we would not change the web site and the issue is with your
browser settings.

A follow up eMail message attempting to explain that, in my opinion, the
problem did not lie with the browser I was using the issue was responded by
a different support person with the following (edited excerpt):

Your response was very helpful. Thank you for taking the time to provide
such a comprehensive response. I suspect the coders at eTrade may not have
access to a mac. So does anyone know for sure if changing the dpi to 72 in
the monitors control panel would help them duplicate the problem for sure. I
think it should but I am not 100% sure.

I am using a G3 upgraded 8600 connected to a NEC 5FGp monitor. The
resolution is set to 1024 by 768. I tried your suggestion, and when I set
the resolution to 640 by 480 the text on the page becomes just barely
viewable.

Unfortunately, I did not find this option in MS IE 4.5 or Navigator 4.0.8
Preferences.

Thanks. This option would be a bit time consuming however as it would
require I edit the doument time each time I visit the page.

I agree with you 100%.

So in conclusion. Disabling support for Style Sheets in MS IE for the Mac
make the page viewable now. The same soulution should work in Navigator.
