Anyone ever tried the Premo Web Talkster?  It's described, along
with other software, at:

      http://www.webtalkster.com/products.htm

Product description from that page:

"Premo Web Talkster v1.0.f This application is the result of the
continued development of Talking Browser and Web Talkster browser.
It includes many upgraded features and has replaced the above
mentioned applications. Just released 3\12\2000, we have
experienced a heavy download and very few bug reports. Check it
out, it is being offered as Freeware!"
