Actually I agree with Kynn. The priority scheme says that if you don't meet
level-A there are some group or groups of people who are not able to access
the content. Priority 2 - double-A - includes all the things that are
important  to remobing barriers which put some people at a significant
disadvantage in trying to access content.

  That strikes me as a little harsh!  How good does a site have to be before
  getting your seal of approval?  Do you have a complete synonym for an AA
  site?  An AAA site?
  
  Granted, we are debating the merits of promoting a few P2 items, and we
  don't want to discourage folks from addressing as many P2 and P3 items as
  possible.  Still, meeting A compliance levels means that a site is pretty
  damn accessible, especially compared to the majority of sites out there!
  Add to that the fact that many non WCAG P1 Compliant sites are perfectly
  usable (with a screen reader or whatever) once one experiments enough to
  learn which unlabeled [LINK]'s are important and which are not.  What is the
  vernacular for describing such a site, "less than minimally accessible"?
  Add to that the fact that many P2 and P3 items (given the current state of
  the art with browsers) are pretty much inconsequential.
  
  I think it is counter productive to be dismissive of Level A compliance.
