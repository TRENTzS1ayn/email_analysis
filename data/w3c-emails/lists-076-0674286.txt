Does anyone know anything about the upcoming Internet
World 2000 conference taking place in Los Angeles first week in April?  Is
anyone going?  Is
this conference of any importance  -- as compared with say, Interop.  I
noticed the W3C will not be represented there, but a group calling
themselves "The World Wide Web Institute(.com) will be.  Does the W3C,
specifically the WAI, frequent these types of private-sector shows to
spread the gospel
of accessibility or do we rely primarily on press channels and
public-sector conferences?

Just wondering.
