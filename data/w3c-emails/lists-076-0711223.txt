Hi - I'd like to let you all know that CAST is looking for a new programmer
for Bobby. Our current programmer is leaving to join a startup company that
is growing fast. We're just wrapping up our work on Bobby 3.2, and the new
person would be involved in the design and implementation of Bobby 4.0,
which we hope will take a quantum leap forward in flexibility and usability.

We're looking for someone who has at least 2 years of object oriented
programming experience, including at least 6 months Java experience; strong
computer science background; familiarity with many W3C standards including
the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, HTML 4, XML, Document Object
Model, Cascading Style Sheets, etc.; experience with educational technology
is helpful, and the ability to work effectively in our loosely structured
environment. Working physically at CAST is not required but it is important
to attend regular meetings, so this person should be within driving distance
of Boston, MA.

If people on this list or people you know are interested, please send
resumes by mail or email to the address in my signature below. We'll begin
callbacks in a couple weeks.
