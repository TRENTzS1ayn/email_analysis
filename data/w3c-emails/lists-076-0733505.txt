We are in the process of developing a set of accessibility guidelines to
be used by the Santa Rosa Junior College district in California. We are
using the W3c and Bobby recommendations along with the Department of
Justice guidelines.
Still this isn't assuring that pages with forms are accessible by the
blind. What are your recommendations for designing for JAWS.
