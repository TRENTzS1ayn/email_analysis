Terry,

if you could forward the prblems that are still occurring to the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines list at w3c-wai-gl@w3.org that group may be able to
answer your questions, or can take your input on board for subsequent work.

Cheers

Charles McCathieNevile

  Justice guidelines.
  Still this isn't assuring that pages with forms are accessible by the
  blind. What are your recommendations for designing for JAWS.
