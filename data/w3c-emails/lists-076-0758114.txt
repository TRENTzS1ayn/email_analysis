It sounds like you have received feedback?
There are many screen readers available and many versions of those still in use.
It is very important to keep universal design principles in mind.
In this case, this means designing in a screen reader/browser independent way.  I use Jaws For Windows (JFW) version 3.2 with either Lynx 2.8.1 or Internet Explorer 4.01.

What kind of form is causing difficulties?
Search forms? PDF forms? Other?

We are in the process of developing a set of accessibility guidelines to
be used by the Santa Rosa Junior College district in California. We are
using the W3c and Bobby recommendations along with the Department of
Justice guidelines.
Still this isn't assuring that pages with forms are accessible by the
blind. What are your recommendations for designing for JAWS.
