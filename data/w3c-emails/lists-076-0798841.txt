Dear Sir/Madam

My name is James Boyd, I am a final year student at The Nottingham Trent
University, Nottingham, England.  As part of the course I am doing a
dissertation based on Web accessibility for the disabled.

One asspect of the project is to see how easy it is to implemet an
accessible web site, from the prospective of a first time web designer.  I
have no previous experience of web design myself, I have attempted to design
a web site for a guesthouse using a number of accessibility resources
including the WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and Bobby.

Although I am not currently a member of your group I was hoping you would be able to help me.  At the moment I have been able to test the site using some evaluation tools, the problem have problem is I have no real means of assessing the sites accessibility from a user's prospective.  I was hoping with the groups experience in the field you could take a quick look at the site, and briefly give me your opinion on the site. 

If you could help the sites address it http://www.boydie14.freeserve.co.uk .
On the home page there are two links to two sites,  if you could look at the
accessible version of the site and give me some feedback on its
accessibility it would be very much appreciated.

Yours Sincerely

James Boyd
