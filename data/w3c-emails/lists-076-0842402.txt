Sorry, but you are missing the boat on this one!

Adherence to 6.3 is of critical importance.  JavaScript dependent web pages
are probably the second biggest accessibility obstacle faced by persons with
disabilities!  (Missing ALT content has got to be first, but bear in mind
that it is disingenuous to rank P1 checkpoints in this fashion.)
