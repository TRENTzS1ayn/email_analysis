Wow...some great comments, and late on a Friday
afternoon!

I had suspected I was missing the boat <GRIN>. Now
that I've taken my bath....

One more question: how many organizations will
redesign their sites to work with browsers that don't
have JavaScript enabled?

ServerSide code can take the place of some client side
JavaScript - if an IT department has the resources to
implement more servers and IT people and the necessary
developers to recode their Internet based
applications.

In my opinion, #6.3 will probably be, hands down, the
largest reason most developers/organizations give up
on accessible web design - or ignore it for that
reason.

It's tough enough to build online Applications that
work in IE and Netscape. I think it's a little
unreasonable to assume developers are going to now
ditch all JavaScript - which means recoding a whole
lot of stuff - to conform to Level A.

I know that #6.3 doesn't preclude the use of
JavaScript, but it means that any site's functionality
based upon that scripting has to be rebuilt to not use
the JavaScript. And client side JS is popular for a
very important reason: money. It costs to add servers
to support server-side scripting. 

I understand that WAI is about Internet Appliances as
much as disability, but Internet Appliances are not
advanced or prolific enough to argue #6.32 is doable.
I browse the web at home and from my Palm and cell
phone - I don't think it's reasonable for me to ask
Amazon.com to rebuild their delivery system to work
with my Palm browser. It would be nice, but I'm in a
minority sending and reading email from my Palm and
Cell Phone.

Just my two cents, well, maybe ten cents by now.
