there are resources on the Web for learning many programming languages. Ones 
I have used that should be reasonably accessible include the Sun Java manual 
and some material about PERL.

The Java Tutorial is at http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/ but the site
is a bit confusing. Look for "your first cup of java" (text of the link) to
get started.

I have used information from http://www.perl.org but there are a number of
sites that have PERL materials (I have used others but forget where they
were - perl.org has many links to different information though).

All that I have seen is in english (but I don't know any turkish so I have
never looked).

hope this is some help

cheers
