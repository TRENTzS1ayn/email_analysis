Dear Joel,

A couple more quick questions / comments inline, after much snippage...

Based on what?  Level A (wrt 6.3) means that some uses of some JavaScript
means that some people will NOT be able to access the page/site.  It's clear
and unambiguous.  The fact that you have done a great job ensuring
compatibility with your JavaScript is commendable, but does NOT warrant
changing priority level!  Most coders of JavaScript will not be as careful
as you!

Okay, but did you check usability with Lynx?  What is the rational for
dismissing this browser, but not certain versions of IE / Navigator?

6.3 does NOT require you to give up JavaScript, just that your site is
useable without it!  I know a number of folks who disable scripting on their
browsers -- since the bad JavaScript and Java people publish would routinely
crash their computers!  I have no idea how common place this practice is,
but I bet it is more popular than the folks at Sun would like to admit!
