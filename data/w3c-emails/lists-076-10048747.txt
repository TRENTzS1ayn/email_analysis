Hi Kelly and the WAI-IG,

I discovered this intertest group back in May. Since then I have
experimented in making an accessible web page. I think I had fairly
good success with my first attempt. This group has certainly opened
my eyes to the difficulties that people such as yourself encounter on
the web.

Although education will go a long way, accessibility will only become
commonplace when big business sees that it stand to make a buck.
Based on information I have found in this group, there are about 30
million Americans who are blind. These Americans have disposible
income totaling about US $750 million. I also understand that very
few on the online merchant sites are accessible.

Correct me if I am wrong, but I also understand that most of the next
generation commerce sites will be voice enabled and the enabling
technologies are based on the coding that makes a site accessible to
the blind. The point is that sooner or later online merchants as well
as online business will be forced to make their sites accessible to
you as a matter of good business or by default.

Prior to October I was coding my sites by hand. Since October I have
been using HomeSite 4.01. The reason I chose HomeSite is because it
was evaluated by W3C for accessibility. I must confess that I found
the software very confusing at first. It took me over a week to
master the simple features. I am now starting to use HomeSite to
create accessible web sites but I realize I have a long way to go.

Here in Jamaica no one considers the needs of the disabled. Not the
government, not business, not even organizations setup to assist the
disabled. So if I tell a client that I am able to create web sites
that are accessible to the blind I will get a blank response. The
fact is I do not even mention it, I just do it to the best of my
ability. Have a look at the proposed web site for Knolford Polo &
Tennis Ranch hotel in Jamaica
http://tourjamaica.freeservers.com/test/knolford/index.htm. N.B. This
hotel is a sports theme hotel that will not practical for people with
disabilities as the sports are polo and tennis. Anyway, I ran Bobby v
3.11 on the site and found that four out of fourteen pages failed (I
was not even trying to make the site accessible).

Another site I am working on is for a non-profit organization, called
Farquharson Institute of Public Affairs located at
http://tourjamaica.freeservers.com/test/fipa/index.htm, that is
working to foster social change. This site will be made accessible as
it will contain information that will affect everyone. According to
Bobby v. 3.11 this site passes the automatic testing. Not bad
considering that I am still wet behind the ears.

I will appreciate any feedback to the above proposed web sites.

Philip
