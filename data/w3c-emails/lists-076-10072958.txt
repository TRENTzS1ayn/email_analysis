I think this is a great idea... right up until he says "will not render
properly on any other browser."

If it didn't render prettily, that would be fine with me. But it must be
readable and usable!

I agree, however, that it's time to start using XHTML strict and saying to
hell with Navigator 4.

See similar thread on the html list.

Subject: COMMENT: No Longer Supporting Previous Browser Versions

I am taking a stand here. We recently declared all previous versions
of
Netscape Navigator unsupported and wrote code exclusively for IE5. Now
that
Netscape 6 has arrived, we are motivating our target audience to
upgrade too.

The new HSRC website will be available only to users of Internet
Explorer 5.5
and/or Netscape 6. It will not render properly on any other browser.

I realize this has financial and technical implications, but that's
what
computering is all about these days. One has to keep abreast of
developments
and one also has to upgrade one's hardware occasionally to fit latest
specifications. Netscape 6 requires a 233MHz processor - minimum!
