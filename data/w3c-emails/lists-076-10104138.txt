Ok Nick, you got the plug in.

very pretty site, is not the font size a weeny bit small? when you reset 
your browser to large fonts you have to scroll up and down as well as side 
to side. But I suppose that is nit picking. What happened to the Nav bar in 
the index page? who washed it? It appears to have shrunk.

 From the text version of the index page when you hit a link you revert to 
the visual version.

I take it you designed the site?
