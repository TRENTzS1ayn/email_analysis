Nick,

Checked our your site, and if I was interested just for myself, it would
be a nice site, but for persons with disabilities that affect the ability
to read, the site is just one more useless government site. The only place
I could find any icons or "illustrations" to support the plethora of words
was on the site about accessibility where the included the icons for all
the awards received. Even the site for What's New, with a link to
information on PWD's adding income, was mared by the absence of any
illustrations to guide a poor reader to the information they want.  

If this is an example of the best that can be made under the guidelines to
insure access to ALL web users with disabilities, then the guidelines are
woefully inadequate. Otherwise, the site has accommodated some with
disabilities but slammed the door in the face of others.

Anne
