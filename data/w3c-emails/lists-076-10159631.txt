Howdy,

I was wondering if anyone could tell me whether drop down menus, of the
type that are activated by a javascript or applet rollover, present
accessibility problems for text-to-speech browsers. 

An example (an applet version) of what I'm concerned about can be found
at: http://www.buseco.monash.edu.au/oldTechServ/

Cheers,
Dey
