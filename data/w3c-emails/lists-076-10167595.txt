Anne, can you take one or two specific pages and describe what kind
of illustrations would be useful?  E.g., "this page could use an
illustration of a man with a shovel after the first headline" or
"this page could use some sort of graphical representation of the
numbers in table 3".

I am fine with the idea of making sites more accessible by using
graphics, but I think many people (myself included) are not
entirely sure what kind of graphics are necessary.  Also, if you
could explain _why_ you made the recommendations, that would help
a lot too, as it will enable web designers to get into the right
mindset when thinking about conveying content not only through
text but in a variety of different ways.

Thanks!
