There is no javascript on that page (as viewed with Lynx).

Javascript cannot be an applet.

The common idiom for creating popups causes accessibility problems, but
can be fixed by designing properly, i.e. write the page to work without
scripting then add the scripting whilst keeping the old function.
Specifically, never use javascript: URLs, except where client side 
scripting is of the essence of the page.  Instead, use a normal link and
override it with an onclick attribute.  Make sure the onclick returns
false to prevent the href also working on an JS enabled browser.

Note the page is cache unfriendly (no last-modified-date) and uses a
non-standard HTTP header (without an x- prefix) (window-target).
