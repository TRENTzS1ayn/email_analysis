Actually, I have to disagree with this; I don't believe that bgcolor,
font, or bold themselves present -any- access problems whatsoever.  It
is entirely possible to use those elements without creating accessibility
barriers.

Errors result when those are -relied upon- to provide information, not
when they are -used-.  That is a subtle but key point to understanding
accessibility on the tag level.

(Not speaking of specific examples from this page, just speaking in
generalities.  I do agree that the claim of Triple-A conformance is
questionable.  By the way, I suggest spelling out Single-A, Double-A,
and Triple-A rather than relying on the letters A, AA, and AAA, as
those may be rendered unreliably.)

Transitional XHTML is not deprecated.  11.2 does _not_ mandate the use
of XHTML Strict.
