To clear up any confusion, we didn't have anything to do with design 
at open.gov.uk.  I merely mentioned it for the interest of the group. 
:-)

However, we do *try* to work to WAI and W3C (without claiming to be 
gods of the universe in this sphere) and are currently actively 
engaged in raising awareness on the issues here in Scotland.  In the 
past few weeks we've made good progress in getting stuff about it 
into the business press here, and have had very positive meetings 
with government and enterprise agencies (Scottish, not UK) with 
regard to raising the standard of work done in this country.  We have 
high hopes of getting it introduced as a contractual standard for any 
officially supported work.

We're also doing a lot of networking with anyone with an interest in 
progressing this in Scotland especially, from any point of view. 
Anyone with an interest is welcome to contact me directly, but please 
be aware I'm hideously overstretched so may not be able to respond in 
detail to everyone.

Oh, and since I've already been accused of plugging <grin> I may as 
well mention we and our growing network of associates do offer 
seminars, training, audits, etc. on both accessibility and 
usability...

Cheers,
Nick
