I think this is a really important point. It's not just a matter of
educating web designers, getting the clients to ask for sites that
comply with standards is crucial.

I have had mixed results in trying to get clients, in public sector
organisations, to ask for W3C standards in their specifications, but
being able to point them to this page:

http://www.open.gov.uk/services/standards.htm

and being able to say to them -- "these are the standards the government
is aiming at, why should your site be designed to any lower standards?",
helps.

However I agree that the use of the Triple-A icon is not appropriate,
but it *is* a big step in the right direction :-)
