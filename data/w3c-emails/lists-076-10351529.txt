Busy weekend ahead, so I can't do justice to your question. First of all,
the opening page is horrid. There isn't enough difference in the types of
index to illustrate the differences in use. But, going to "Topic Index"
http://www.open.gov.uk/index/topicindex.htm there is a table, each cell
contains a single word as a link. Each of those single words can and should
be illustrated ... similar to what I did on
http://www.geocities.com/apembert45 ... 
a picture of a barn, a tractor, or a bunch of wheat would do nicely with
agriculture. Finance needs a picture of a bank, or a pile of money, etc.,
Justice, a picture of the major court building, or a picture of a scale, or
any of the other symbols of courts and justice, and so on, for all the
links on a page. 

In reading the various comments this mornng, I was saddened by the fact
that you and only you seemed to take note of this issue, while everyone
else is concerned about legalisms. I think this points to the need to put a
very specific statement in the guidelines that we can use to say, "What, no
illustrations? You failed guideline x.x and checkpoint x.x."
