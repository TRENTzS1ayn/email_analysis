Charles (et al.),

I agree that deprecated elements like FONT and BGCOLOR have no place on a
Double-A page.  They are using textual graphics for headers which (thank you
Wendy) we have finally come to a consensus is a violation of Checkpoint 3.1
(P2).

The home page didn't validate when a took a look (despite the provision of a
live check).  Some other pages I spot checked were fine.  I am not sure why
they commented-out the CSS badge on the homepage when it too is provided
further in.  Some deeper pages claim only Double-A conformance.

I also noticed that the logo button graphics are shrunk by putting in false
information about the image size.  Is this a violation of any standards?

How does a site claiming Single-A compliance justify a high level link to
Adobe Acrobat Reader?  I did not come across any PDF documents, but lack of
HTML equivalents would be a violation of Guideline 11.

Why does a government site have banner graphics anyway?

I like the feedback form since it allows contact by people in a public
setting (like libraries) where an email client is not available.  They do
provide a bunch of email address at
<http://www.open.gov.uk/services/team.htm> I CC'd this message to a generic
one provided on the feedback page.

I also looked for and found violations of Checkpoint 3.7 requiring the use
of <Q>...</Q> instead of other forms of quotation marks (P2).

The descriptions available for the sparse graphics that do exist are so
poorly done that they are IMHO virtually useless:
<http://www.open.gov.uk/longdesc/photos.htm>
<http://www.open.gov.uk/services/standards.htm>

I also agree with Charles that the efforts of the web development team are
truly commendable.  We really are nit picking.  The site is extremely
accessible, and definitely Single-A compliant.  Hip, hip, hurrah!  (Now that
we're done with the virtual ticker tape parade, is it too much to hope that
Judy might write them a note complaining about the Triple-A claims?)
