Hi, Davey, can you explain this a little further?  I think I understand
what you are saying but I am not sure.

I do have serious fears that if we reach too far and demand too much
(and I _do_ believe that's possible; this may be a point of philosophic
disagreement right there), then the WAI and WCAG will become meaningless
by forcing people to choose between accessibility and decent design
practices.  I don't want that choice to be made and I don't think
it's necessary, -because- I think it's a case where accessibility
will lose consistently.
