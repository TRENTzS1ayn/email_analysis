Not so fast, Bruce... I said their efforts were commendable, but I stopped
short of calling them extremely accessible. I agree that the site is far
more accessible than most, but I also think that Anne is correct when she
complains that the text-only nature of the site is a barrier to people with
cognitive disabilities.

Anne and I may not agree on the *extent* to which images are needed
(sometimes I think Anne would like nothing better than for every site on
line to look like a Dr. Seuss book), but without any visual clues, this
would be a pretty difficult site for most people with cognitive
disabilities. And given that it's a government site, that seems a pretty
serious oversight.
