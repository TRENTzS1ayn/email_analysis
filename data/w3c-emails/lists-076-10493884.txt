This one of those messages wanting to give the UK egov site a thumbs up for
trying.

Is it possible that the W3C-WAI icon conformance language might be
misunderstood?  Without a careful reading, one might think that Triple A or
AAA means compliant with Priority 3, rather than 1, 2 and 3.  Or perhaps it
was flipped to mean compliant with Priority 1, which I believe the site
accomplishes.
