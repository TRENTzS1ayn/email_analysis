Hey, Kynn,
Oops! Well, that's what I get for trying to be cute! Let me try again: The
point of the guidelines is perfectly clear--use css; don't use physical
mark-up. 

It's possible of course to do linguistic deconstruction of the guidelines
centering on the meaning of the word 'avoid' but would not be valid given
the context of the rest of the text.

Your point is also perfectly clear--and you may well be right. But that
means that you are in disagreement with the guidelines. And that's okay. You
don't have to play twister with the word 'avoid.'

As my old man used to tell me, "Just stand up straight and make your point,
boy!"

Your Pal,
Davey Leslie
