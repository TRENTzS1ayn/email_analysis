Charles is right in is interpretation (well, I believe I contributed the
wording, and that is what I thought I meant) as far as I can see.

I guess you should have been able to find the example by looking at the
techniques for the checkpoint. I'll take it as an action item.

  level is the city, the second is the date.

  At least that's my understanding of 5.2.

  Hope that helps.

  Hi all,

  I have spent quite a while trying to find the meaning of "two or more
  logical levels of row or column headers" in WCAG checkpoint 5.2 for data
  tables.

  Can anyone tell me what "two or more logical levels ..." means and where I
  should have found that meaning?
