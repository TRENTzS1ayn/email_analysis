alt="", I would think.  However, before you do this, given that many
GUI browsers treat alt as "tool-tips", you should make sure that it
is totally clear that the text duplicates the icon, even if the icon
image is only displayed as a placeholder.

If it really is only there to enhance, an nearby really means so near as
to be obviously part of the same construct, there is no need for a non-empty
alt string.
