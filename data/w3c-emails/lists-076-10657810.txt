I give hearty "hear, hear" to this.

The WCAG document was never intended (in my understanding of the process)
to be used as a _legal document_ in the way in which it is used.  There
are more "loopholes" (as Marti has identified) than the Florida
election statutes!

This is why I believe that these _guidelines_ are always going to be
subject to interpretation.  If we really intend for them to be
_legally enforceable_ than the current method of creating the WCAG
guidelines is woefully inadequate.  At the very least we should have
teams of lawyers reviewing every word written.
