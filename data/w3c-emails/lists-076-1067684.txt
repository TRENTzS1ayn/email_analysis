Sorry, I just finished listening to this article and My over all conclusion
is that those who found the census inaccessable are either using the wrong
stuff or don't know how to use it.  I also find amazon to work and I use it
with netscape.  I don't know what webvan is but the article over all was not
bad in that it brought out the issues.  I wish someone would write an
article based on what is possible today rather than using unproven
individuals as their yardsticks.  I appreciate though that there were some
success stories here.

I mean no slight against anyone here but there are much worse examples of
the web than those listed.
