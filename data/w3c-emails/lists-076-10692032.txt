Amen, brother, excellent post.

Both you and Kynn raise valid points. Professional web designers have set up
shop between content providers and end users. The best design therefore
would be the simplest: feather-light and nearly transparent. But working
like this requires an intelligence, maturity and a fundamental humanity that
will never turn a young web designer into a rock star.

But this is surely the toughest nut to crack: what to do about a basic lack
of humanity. Punish it? Educate it? A little of both? A lot of both?

Given that 60% of the world's lawyers are in the U.S., I suppose it is
inevitable that this will all be effectively decided in their courts. Too
bad. Given their recent performance in the Presidential election, it's hard
to be optimistic.

Your Pal,
Davey Leslie
