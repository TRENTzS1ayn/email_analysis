I agree with Dave. In particular, I would make sure that it is clera that the
image and the text are associated by including them in the same link, rather
than having two seperate links to the same place.

  alt="", I would think.  However, before you do this, given that many
  GUI browsers treat alt as "tool-tips", you should make sure that it
  is totally clear that the text duplicates the icon, even if the icon
  image is only displayed as a placeholder.

  If it really is only there to enhance, an nearby really means so near as
  to be obviously part of the same construct, there is no need for a non-empty
  alt string.
