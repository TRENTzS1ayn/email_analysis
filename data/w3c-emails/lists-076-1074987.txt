a week or so ago, I decided to see what I could do concerning the census
online.
I was able to get to and navibate the cite using jfw 3.5 and ie 5.01.  My
first barrier was that two pieces of information that were on the form that
was mailed to me were needed to see if I could fill out a form on line.  I
was able to over come this with sighted assistance or by scanning the form. 
This falls short of independance but for me it was doable.

The next and last barrier I faced was figuring out the lay out of the form. 
Instead of the form controll labels being positioned adjacent to the form
controlls, they were above which necessitated a bit of counting backing and
filling if you know what I mean.  I was able to complete the form but I
wouldn't call it a model of accessability.

Thoughts?
