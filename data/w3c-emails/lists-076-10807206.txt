Hi

Some of the recent posting have detailed the
'conflict' between supporting older mainstream
browsers (versions 3 and earlier of Navigator and
Explorer) and implementing the WAI guidelines.

For me, there has been one key concept that has been
missing in this debate and that is 'choice'.

For a non-disabled person to upgrade from a version 3
browser to a more current version is a matter of
choice, being disabled is not.

What this means to me, is that it makes more sense to
focus on the development and testing of web sites that
work well for the non-disabled in versions 4 and
upwards of the mainstream browsers.

This gives the following 2 key benefits:-

1. It allows closer adherence to the WAI guidelines.
2. It frees up more resources to focus on development
and testing, using user-agents for the disabled.

It is arguably more important to support older
versions of disabled user-agents, given the
substantial cost of upgrading some of these products.

I would just like to add how much I value reading the
postings to this list. 

Regards
Graham Oliver
