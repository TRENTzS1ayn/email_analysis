Marti,

Sometimes the quibbles over the guidelines seem to me like insisting that
all stairs be removed while someone decides how to build ramps! While
common authoring programs do not accomplish the accessibility needs, needs
cannot be met on most of the web. 

Every guideline needs to be grounded in here and now, what does it take to
accomplish it, and exactly who (how many) does it actually benefit, and who
is dis-served by it. 

As Kynn also pointed out picking a group, and pointing a finger to those
who can be beat up on for all the ills of the web serves no one.  I am a
"vision impaired person" who makes use of "text only versions" for
occasional print uses ... I am flummoxed by sites that include an "all text
version", a "regular version that is all text", and no graphical versions.
I don't have fancy access at home - I have plain old modem access, rural,
so we rarely get more than 30 on downloads even tho our modem will do
faster .... yet both hubby and I use the graphics on the web as much or
more than text ... I know of only one sighted friend who ever used text
versions instead of graphics, and even he changed up when he got a T1 at
home! Most folk I know got into the web because of graphics, not to avoid
them!

I suspect that most of the folks you're trying to convince to see it your
way, have experiences similar to mine. It's tough to argue with what's
obvious! 

Anne
