Just as an experiment, I decided to try and see if I could use style sheets 
to create a collapsing left hand nav.

When you load this page http://www.jcu.edu.au/asd/template/structure1.shtml 
with style sheets enabled, you get a left nav.  Turn off or load a user 
style sheet and the links should all become a few lines just under the 
banner graphic, with the contents of the page underneath.

Don't know if a) everyone has already seen a setup like this or b) if 
anyone cares but I was pleased I could get the styles to work this way.
