I really like Davey's "widening the doorway" analogy.
I hate to contribute to the bulk of this thread -- but I'll do so anyway!

Web-enabled PDAs and cell phones are our friends.  They are the leading edge
to low bandwidth considerations.   I think it's more important that we
address the digital divide and consider people with older browsers and slow
dial-up connections, but big business isn't concerned with selling to them.
Interoperability and standards works to both audiences.  Presentational
markup adds bulk to HTML code.  A strict structural-only page is relatively
small.  Of course, incorporating CSS elements in the HTML page adds quite a
number of kilobytes -- but linking to a style sheet is very light weight.
Adding the advantage of using device-oriented CSS you would think the
PDA/cell people would really be on this bandwagon.
