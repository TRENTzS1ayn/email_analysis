Here are some stats for December from a New Zealand history site I manage :

IE - 69.47%
NN - 14.64

Out of the NN users:
83.57% use vers 4x
7.76% use vers 3x

To put this in perspective, out of the 7,603 total visitor sessions for
December, 90 were by people using NN3x browsers.

Out of the IE users:
83.57% use 5x
15.72% use 4x
0.54% use 3x (43 visitor sessions)
0.14% use 2x (28 visitor sessions)

Not sure that this tells people anything other than the numbers still using
vers 3x browsers are very small, I would have thought it was extremely
unlikely that any organisation would still be insisting its employees use
NN3x as an internet browser (perhaps for intranet though).

Personally I always design pages so that the content is obtainable without
style sheets, not by defining fonts but simply letting the user's default
font do the work - it might not look quite as pretty but it is all there.
(If they want pretty they are going to be limited in their options with NN3
anyway).
