We are making a gift website and want to make it fully accessible. The site 
does have frames and we were considering a 'no frames' version until I saw 
the below from Charles McCathieNevile :

>Finally, I am not sure why you link to a text-only version. I found >no

If anyone could point us to resources that can help us achieve the above it 
would be a great help.
