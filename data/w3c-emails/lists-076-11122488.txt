Hi

Appologies for sending to the list using PGP MIME, several people have
told me off (off list) for doing this.

I have set up my MUA to send old-style PGP signed messages to this list,
if anyone has a problem with this let me know and I'll try to think of
another way of doing it.

Following is the message that some people won't yet have been able to
read.

Chris
