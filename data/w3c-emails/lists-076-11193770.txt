You are to be congratulated on a carefully done and significantly successful

How much use they are to how many people I can't quantify.? But there are
people with bona fide disabilities such as dyslexia for whom they are a
considerable aid.? For better or for worse there is no way _in the markup_ to
distinguish between gratuitous decoration and effective graphic enhancement of
communication.? In this respect what we need to get you is not guidelines
but a
right-brained partner in design.? The art is in the integration, the gestalt.

At the time that we negotiated this attribute into HTML 4.0, the concept was
that it gave the author a place to put text which was to _follow and expand on
the CAPTION (or TITLE)_ _as required_ in the context of linear reading.

A problem in the HTML specification is that if you only read the
explanation of
SUMMARY this is not clear.? One has to read the discussion of CAPTION to
understand the "optional expansion to complete the orientation to the TABLE"
function assigned to SUMMARY.

If your Organisational Index is as you describe it, "no SUMMARY at all" sounds
like a perfectly good design for effective communication.? If you feel that
the
language of the guidelines makes the SUMMARY sound obligatory, we shound take
that up in the content guidelines group.? It could just be that the message is
getting exaggerated as it passes through multiple stages of transmission,
as in
the game of 'rumors.'? Part of the problem is that there is a vast
variation in
complexity among those document components marked TABLE.? The SUMMARY can
range
from copious to none as a function of the actual TABLE and the orientation to
the table already afforded by CAPTION and/or TITLE.

The HTML Techniques for WCAG 1.0 do present the CAPTION first in terms of
providing orientation to a TABLE, and how the TITLE is an alternative to the
CAPTION in doing this.? It talks about how the SUMMARY is more important in
the
absense of a CAPTION but it never gets down to the point of a) saying that the
SUMMARY should be written on the assumption that it will be read after the
CAPTION or TITLE (which should be true) and "if the TABLE is simple and the
CAPTION or TITLE says what there is to say about the TABLE, no SUMMARY may be
needed."? Which is also true.
