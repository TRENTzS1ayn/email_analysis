thank you charles.  Actually, the javascript is functioning to deliver some
content.  It could be recoded into html most likely without any ill effects
but the guy likes the glitz.  So, the theory is that if the js is removed
from the accessable delivery the page would be fine with the content marked
up in html.
Thanks!
