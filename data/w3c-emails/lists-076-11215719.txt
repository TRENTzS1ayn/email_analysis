My guess, honestly, is "no" because WCAG is so subjective and Triple-A 
triply so, which means that while you can _claim_ Triple-A conformance,
anyone who wishes to can come along and second-guess your claim and
use the "fuzzy language" of WCAG 1.0 -- such as "when appropriate",
"until user agents", "clearest possible", "simplest", "when necessary"
-- to "prove" that you are not compliant according to their
interpretation.

Because of the potential backlash -- and because Triple-A, by definition,
does not eliminate any additional access barriers beyond Double-A -- I
would never advise anyone to "shoot for" Triple-A web accessibility.

(Then again, I may be the wrong person to answer this, because I feel
that the Single-A, Double-A, Triple-A compliance scheme does not work
at all.)

PS:  I urge you and other list participants to spell out Single-A,
      Double-A, Triple-A, instead of A, AA, and AAA, because it may
      result in some problems on screenreaders or other devices.
