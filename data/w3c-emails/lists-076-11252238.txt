Kynn!
Where were you when we needed you and how would you suggest we go
about providing avenues for compliance?  It seems that the guidelines
were in the making for a long time and there was a lot of thought
given to how to assist with their implementation.  what makes it tough
here is the ever changing targets and technologies.  We are all so
sorry that you have become so sour in the last year.

As a screen reader user, I have a less unweildy suggestion for
textually iconnizing the conformance ratings:
a a a
a a
a
although one must listen closely, it works.  keep it as simple as
possible.  there are other things that can be done here too like
using - between them or a full stop <.> and you can guess the rest.

My guess, honestly, is "no" because WCAG is so subjective and Triple-A
triply so, which means that while you can _claim_ Triple-A
conformance,
anyone who wishes to can come along and second-guess your claim and
use the "fuzzy language" of WCAG 1.0 -- such as "when appropriate",
"until user agents", "clearest possible", "simplest", "when necessary"
-- to "prove" that you are not compliant according to their
interpretation.

Because of the potential backlash -- and because Triple-A, by
definition,
does not eliminate any additional access barriers beyond Double-A -- I
would never advise anyone to "shoot for" Triple-A web accessibility.

(Then again, I may be the wrong person to answer this, because I feel
that the Single-A, Double-A, Triple-A compliance scheme does not work
at all.)

PS:  I urge you and other list participants to spell out Single-A,
      Double-A, Triple-A, instead of A, AA, and AAA, because it may
      result in some problems on screenreaders or other devices.
