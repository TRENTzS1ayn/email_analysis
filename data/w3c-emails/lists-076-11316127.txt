David, when the guidelines were in the making and the compliance
scheme was added on, I spoke up strongly then I and I continue to
speak up.

I am currently volunteering as a member of the WCAG working group
and hope to develop a more sensible compliance scheme.

I'm not sour at all!  I'm very optimistic about web accessibility,
I just feel that many on this list need a good healthy dose of
reality because so many of the "demands" I see coming from this
list (and others within WAI) simply won't fly in the real world,
and we risk winning the battle but losing the war.

If I seem "sour", it's only because I have to take the brunt of
negative feedback from people who disagree with me, as most other
people who present the realist viewpoint have been chased away or
asked shut up already.
