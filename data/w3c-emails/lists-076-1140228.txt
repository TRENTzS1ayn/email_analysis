WAI Interest Group:

For those of you following references to Web accessibility in the US
Government Section 508 Rulemaking process, the "NPRM" (Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking) is now available online, at the US Access Board Web site
http://www.access-board.gov

The two specific documents involved are the Overview
http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/overview.htm
and the text of the proposed rule itself
http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/nprm.htm

Note that there are several sections which address Web accessibility in the
text of the NPRM.

For reference, what was recommended to be included in this proposed rule by
the "EITAAC" (Electronic and Information Technology Access Advisory
Committee) consensus industry/disability/government discussion last year is
available online at http://www.access-board.gov/pubs/eitaacrpt.htm

WAI's "Policies Relating to Web Accessibility" page
http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/Policy has been updated to reflect
availability of the new material. WAI will review and comment on sections
relating to W3C/WAI materials in the NPRM. ("NPRM's" have public comment
periods, explained in the document.)
