Hmm. That is a good question. I'd say that one should consider a single page
to be a document and expand the first instance on that page. Then, even if
you enter from a link to an anchor down the page, you can always scroll up
to find the first instance.

Of course, you could always expand every instance, but that *does* seem
onerous.
