Nope, I am still here! Just that work got in the way of fun for a bit.
I admit to being a bit confused at this point. Are we supposed to take the
Checkpoints at "face value", or analyze them neatly as Charles did with
11.1?
As for the bit on "qualifications" -
  Isn't the idea here to include diversity? Everyone's opinion has some
value.  I don't think long lists of degrees or customers adds anything
useful to this discussion.
