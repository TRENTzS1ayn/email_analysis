Subject: Webcast interview re section 508 regs released at last


Special webcast interview with Doug Wakefield of the Access Board
discussing the implications of the section 508 regulations on the
design of
web pages.  This webcast will be available late Thursday afternoon,
December 21 2000
http://www.rit.edu/~easi

The regulations for section 508 of the Rehab Act, released December
21,
2000, requires the Federal government and its agencies to only procure
information technology and communications systems that are fully
accessible
to people with disabilities or which can readily be made accessible.
The
impact of these procurement regulations go far beyond the Federal
government.  Manufacturers who avoided modifying products to meet the
special needs of special consumers because they constituted a small
market
segment have a new motivation to make such alterations.  The
government is
a major market segment which few manufacturers can ignore.  While the
regulations does not place direct requirements on commercial
companies,
they will need to comply with the regulations unless they are willing
to
write off the government as a customer.  These regulations will
undoubtedly
become a de facto standard that will have sweeping implications all
across
society.

This discussion with Doug Wakefield will focus on how the regs impact
web
design.  Future webcasts will explore some of the other areas where
the law
is reducing barriers for people with disabilities.

Starting in January 2001, EASI will integrate the section 508
regulations
into its online Internet-delivered workshops: Barrier-free Web Design,
Barrier-free Information technology, Barrier-free Online Learning and
The
Global Business: Benefits of Designing Accessible and Usable
Electronic and
Information Technology.  Workshop information is at
