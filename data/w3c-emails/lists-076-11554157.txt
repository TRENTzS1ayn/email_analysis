If this problem occurs, it is because the author failed to set all the
colours when they set one.  Whilst an advanced user could to an
!important override on the background, the normal user is likely to do
a simple override that is no more significant than the browser's built
in default and will be overridden by a background in the document.

Neither of these is scalable, at least on NS 4.  They will both cause
problems.  The correct way with font is to use signed sizes to indicate
relative sizes, and the correct way with style (besides indirecting the
style) is to use em units.

If I override, it is because poor design has made the font too small or
the colour contrast insufficient.  I'd hope a good browser would override
both styles and font elements.  I've certainly had to override colours
(implemented with font, I think) on one major UK corporate site because
their designer had done successively lighter background shades on successive
tabs, to the point where I couldn't read the FAQ tab).  I then continued 
browsing for a while with colours disabled.
