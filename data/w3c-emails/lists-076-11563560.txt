I consider Javascript as unsafe technology and don't run it even on
IE, except when forced to do so by bad design AND I trust the company
not to have security problems.  As well as the direct security risks,
I tend to consider sites that don't work without Javascript as likely
to be designed by people who don't understand security issues.

A lot of people, not just the blind, use Lynx.  I use it when searching
for real information, particularly when the information is not about
commercial products.  Good compatibility with Lynx has a high 
correlation with a high information content (commercial sites tend to
have a low information content, even relative to the products they are
selling), and the real information is much more likely to be in PDF than
HTML on commercial sites (even when using IE, I head for the PDF white
papers on business software sites).

Lynx gives fast load times and fast navigation times.  The latter is 
because one can search for and access links without moving ones fingers
off the home keys on the keyboard.

Note that web logs underestimate Lynx use because of abuses of browsers
sniffing; Lynx is quite likely to masquerade as IE or NS.
