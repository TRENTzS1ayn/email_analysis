see below taken from the access-board news letter.  What is a "verbal
tag"?

Web_based Intranet and Internet Information and Applications
The criteria for web_based technology and information are based on
access
guidelines developed by the Web Accessibility Initiative of the World
Wide
Web Consortium.  Many of these provisions ensure access for people
with
vision impairments who rely on various assistive products to access
computer_based information, such as screen readers, which translate
what's
on a computer screen into automated audible output, and refreshable
Braille
displays.  Certain conventions, such as verbal tags or identification
of
graphics and format devices, are necessary so that these devices can
"read"
them for the user in a sensible way.  The standards do not prohibit
the use
of web site graphics or animation.  This section also addresses the
usability of multimedia presentations, image maps, style sheets,
scripting
languages, applets and plug_ins, and electronic forms.
