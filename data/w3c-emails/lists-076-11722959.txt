Hi.

I didn't see anything in this message about whether or not people thought
other people would try to make triple-A sites, but that was all I saw in
responses. So I did a bit of searching (nothing very careful, just some
random playing with a search engine) and came up with the following:

Assistive Tech - http://www.assistivetech.net

Assistive Technology Centre, Indiana University - Bloomington -
http://www.indiana.edu/~iubdrh

Texas Water Board - http://www.twdb.state.tx.us/

These were three of the first four I found. I am not sure that I agree with
all their claims, but they have all clearly thought about what they are
doing.

And best of all the GSA (some kind of US government agency -
http://www.gsa.gov is their home) has a website that provides links to look
for sites claiming conformance:
http://w3.gsa.gov/web/m/cita.nsf/RefLib/WCAGLogos - so you are free to follow
the links and find sites for yourselves.

cheers

Charles McCN

  Hi, please let me know if this is an inappropriate post for this forum -
  apologies in advance if it is.

  I've just spent most of the day trying to make a page (only this page!) AAA
  accessible: http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/dnzb_exhibs/sport/index.htm

  and I am about to give up on the grounds that I have other things I have to
  do and I am starting to get way out of my depth in terms of my knowledge of
  CSS.

  I was wondering if there is such a thing as an AAA rated site which uses
  images and for which the CSS code is viewable? I feel the need for some
  'real world' examples...

  Thanks

  PS If anyone would like to provide constructive criticsm of the page above
  (either directly or to the group) I would be most grateful.
