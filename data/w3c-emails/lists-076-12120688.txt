jim, thank you very much for your comment!  luckily i have this in an
include file and can fix right away.

here is another question. the image in the footer is really there for
functionality.  how would you describe the image in the footer?  What do you
think of  "Separates main content and the footer."  then catch the image
desciption in the longdesc and d-link?
