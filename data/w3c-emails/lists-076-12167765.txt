I don't know how it is currently implemented, where implemented, but,
in my view, it ought to be implemented in a full web link context,
such that content negotiation can be used to, for example, provide
recorded speech if the user agent specifies a strong preference for
audio in the request.  (An aural user agent should not necessarily
assume that a general preference for audio applies in this context,
though.)

I would expect HTML unless there were no links and no real structure
beyond basic paragraphing.
