There is no setting in HRP that I know of or could find. HPR actually
inserts a link, "long description," as copied from the text view of the
trace d link just below the pie chart (which is my least favorite example).
I have HPR set to preface links with "link." Notice how it has "link long
description link D." Alt text is in brackets.

Here is the screen shot of the page that is opened by the "d-link" at the
bottom corner of the image. This page is also referenced in the longdesc
attribute.

Pictures in news stories or images in shopping sites are also candidates for
long descriptions.

I can't get HPR 3.0 to read the longdesc at all. I tested it on
http://jimthatcher.com/webcourse2.htm on your pie chart. Is there a setting
that I'm not aware of that turns the longdesc on or off?
