If you use a proper implementation of HTML 4 (probably not NS4),
and you do not install the Flash plugin, Flash requested from an
object element will fall back to the contents of the object element.

Note this is how you should always use an object element.  One of the
main design features is the ability to have layers of fallback.

Unfortunately you may still get prompted with requests to download the
plugin and, depending on your security setting, may get ActiveX warnings.
