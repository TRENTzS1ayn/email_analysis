I only now have a computer that can actually run Mozilla, and by God 
it's not all that bad.

It has been discoverd that Mozilla on Mac interprets tabindex 
properly, understands accesskey for US-ASCII characters (hold Control 
and press the character, but as ever you have to know what the 
character is; accented characters do not work), underlines abbr and 
acronym (double-underlines them: solid+dashed), and-- get this-- 
gives you full access to longdesc (hit Properties in contextual 
menu). Title on everything produces a tooltip (and is listed in 
Properties from time to time).

Well, [expletive] *me*. All we need is visible manifestation of 
accesskey, ? la iCab, and we're off to the races. Until the next time 
Mozilla crashes.
