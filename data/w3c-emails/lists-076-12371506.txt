I thought this tip from a maninstream newsletter was on the money and proves
what we have been saying all along.  also the infomration on sarch engines
is helpful to build a business case.


1.  HTML Tip:  Structure Documents With Header Tags

HTML header tags (<H1>, <H2>, <H3>, etc.) are more than a quick way to
format text. Use them to define your page's organizational structure
and simplify page navigation. Well-written header text informs visitors
and helps them navigate through your page - maybe keeping them at your
site longer. Effective header tags will even increase your site ranking
on some search engines.
