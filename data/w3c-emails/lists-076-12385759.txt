Are there no other resources on the web that demonstrate how great DHTML
could be?

Illustration is a great step forward, we could also demonstrate how much fun
it offers....

Please try to wrack your brains and come up with a few links to interactive
sites, that don't use flash etc and thus do come within the W3C/WAI area as
it presently is understood.

http://www.assembler.org remains the most fun I've seen yet, way to go.
