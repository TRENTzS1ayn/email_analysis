A number of people on this list claim that bandwidth is no longer
an issue on the internet (a point with which I disagree).  However
I notice that the W3C site has abandoned language negotiation and is
now generating cacheable pages.  It used to be very sluggish.  I'd
suggest that they have found that bandwidth is still an issue!
