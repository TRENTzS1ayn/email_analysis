Actually it covers that one too!  Try the following (noting that,
whilst I've done this as an author style sheet, I think it should be
done as a user style sheet):

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN">
<html><head><title>accesskey</title>
<style type="text/css"><!--
[accesskey]:before {content: "[" attr(accesskey) "]"}
// -->
</style>
<p>
<a accesskey='A' id='fred'>Fred</a>
