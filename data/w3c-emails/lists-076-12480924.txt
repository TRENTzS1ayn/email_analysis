In fact, the standardised way, as specified in HTML 4, is to use typed links
- <a href="something" rel="glossary">Technical term</a>

  That's generally the preferred, non-XML, way of extending HTML.

  However, what you describe appears to be one the most classic uses
  of hypertext, so I'd have to argue that the most standard way of
  providing this function is with <a href..> elements.
