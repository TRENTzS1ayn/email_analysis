You could be a pedant and argue that since the contents of each cell
of a table used for layout is data of some sort or other it would
indeed count as a "data table".

A good rule of thumb for whether something is a "data table" or not
is to ask yourself if you would use a table for it if you were using
pen and paper to display the document.
