Another possible rule of thumb:

Does it make sense to have more than one header cell? If not, then it is a
linear thing like a normal bit of "text" (where text might mean pictures or
something).

Just another thought...

  You could be a pedant and argue that since the contents of each cell
  of a table used for layout is data of some sort or other it would
  indeed count as a "data table".

  A good rule of thumb for whether something is a "data table" or not
  is to ask yourself if you would use a table for it if you were using
  pen and paper to display the document.
