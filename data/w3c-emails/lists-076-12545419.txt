Hi Liz:

     If your curious, here is how one version of one screen reader rendered what you have so far:
(Jaws For Windows ver 3.31 with IE 5)

Property Description

Address:
2356 South George Street apt 6
Property ID#:
4

Type:
Duplex
Bedrooms:
5

Level:
GroundLevel
Max Occupancy:
8

Immediate Possession:
[Property is currently unoccupied]
Yes.
Wheelchair Accessible:
No.

General Location:
Central: 13th to 18th (east of High st.) 

The only minor difficulty is to figure out which comes under property and which under description but I think all the important information is clear.

Everyone's comments have been incredibly helpful; of course, I always seem
to have more questions!

In regards to the data vs. layout table issue, I would like to present the
following example:

<http://www.geocities.com/lizdesign/tables.html>

Supposing this is a data table, the top-level "header" is "Property
Description," with "Name," "address," and the like a "second level" of
headers (labeled as TDs because: "TH is for headers, TD for data, but for
cells acting as both use TD"
<http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/tables.html#h-11.2.6>).  Of course, the
spec doesn't show an example of such a construct... should you use "id" and
"headers" with TDs?  ("headers" are not included in example because I wasn't
sure.)

I feel like I'm using a table for layout... but if I think about the data
logically, it seems like there are logical headers, etc.

And on the page before my example one, there are search results that I don't
feel use the table simply for layout.

Thanks again,
Liz
