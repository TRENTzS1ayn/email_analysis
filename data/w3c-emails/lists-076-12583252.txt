Could this perhaps be a result of expecting poorly formatted tables?

This is actually almost identical to the page of results that comes before
the detail page I used in my example.  While not totally nonsensical, it
seems ironic that one record doesn't get a table, while more than one does
(perhaps that only seems hard to comprehend to me).

I think this is key:  was hoping there was greater consensus.

I would assert the use of colons is simply a formatting choice; at times I
use them, at times not.  But I do get your point, and I do agree it seems to
be a layout table.  But I'm not convinced that the HTML attributes defined
in the spec would be inaccurately (note that I did not use inappropriately!)
used if included to further define the relationships of data within this
table.

Just so you know, I use CSS to format the whole thing.  I just took out all
the style attributes and such so that the code would be uncluttered and the
table code itself clearer to tear apart.
