I've been pondering on this.

The pages I'm writing are computer-related courses for beginners. We 
have an expectation that amongst the general audience a number of 
people will have difficulty with English and so we need to be sure 
that the material is easy to understand. Part of that "easy to 
understand" is a desire to allow people to keep reading on the one 
page, not to open new windows, to use plain language.

If we consider the draft paragraphs below I think there are two 
"glossary" things going on. In the last para I link to a separate 
page explaining concepts such as "click and drag" etc. These 
explanations are several sentences long. In the first para though I 
deliberately use the word "format" which is then effectively 
explained in the following sentence.

I want to be able to use a Tooltip for the word "format". We need to 
teach the word, but some readers may stumble over it before reaching 
the next sentence, and that's where the Tooltip / Title attribute 
comes in.

It seems to me that we have tags for acronyms and abbreviations which 
allow this - presumably primarily on accessibility grounds. A 
"glossary" tag would make pages more accessible linguistically.

Format Text

Once you've written your document you might think it looks rather, 
well, ordinary. You can now format individual words or letters, 
sentences, paragraphs or even the whole document. You can change 
colours, sizes, fonts, margins and more.

[snip] Note that you can use the normal selection techniques such as 
click and drag, double click or shift-click. [snip]

Glossary: Not sure what these selection methods mean, how to use 
them? The Glossary <link to another page> will help.
