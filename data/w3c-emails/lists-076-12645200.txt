Aie. That would be awesome, indeed. The peoples we need to address 
could be using the languages of at least: New Zealand Maori, Samoa, 
Tonga, Niue, Vietnam, Malaysia, Serbia, Croatia, Ukraine and other 
formerly USSR countries, various African countries and a large number 
of other countries. [I'm aware that in New Zealand we have large 
numbers of people from other countries, and especially in Auckland 
large numbers of  migrants from all the Pacific Islands and refugees 
from a number of countries, but demographics isn't my strong suit.]

We'll also have a wide variety of people for whom English is their 
first language but whose literacy skills range from degree holders to 
those who might use the services of adult literacy programmes.

Indeed, that's one reason I don't want to open new windows. Replacing 
the contents though can easily lead to disruption in the flow of 
reading the text. While I'm happy to take people to another page for 
longer and more complex explanations I'd rather not do it for the 
more minor explanations.

I think this is somewhat overkill when the explanation is only a few 
words away. Where there are whole chunks of text separating them then 
it's a useful strategy.

This might have been what I was looking for when I declared a need 
for a "new tag". I had completely overlooked the dfn tag. Thanks for 
drawing it to my attention.

As a dedicated Mac user I've simply become used to using terminology 
that so many other people understand. I'm thinking in terms of 
browsers being used by home users: IE, Netscape and maybe some others 
such as Opera and iCab on Windows and Mac. I'm also aiming to make 
the pages easy to use for those who have disabilities and who may be 
using speech readers and the like. I'm not specially aiming at Linux 
et al as the target audience is extremely unlikely to have such 
Operating Systems.

In my earlier email I pointed out that these title attributes don't 
work for everyone.

Indeed - it's teaching MS Word in this instance. People will attend a 
hands-on course and the HTML pages are available as a later reference.

Definitely OT for this list: much as I certainly teach Styles for 
Word, Pagemaker and HTML there's still a need in Word to start off 
total beginners with the general concepts of selecting words etc and 
changing their format. I could say more, but this isn't the correct 
list.

Excellent suggestion. Thank you.
