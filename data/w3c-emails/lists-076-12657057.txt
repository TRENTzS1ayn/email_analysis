Not really.  It is the ease of teaching WYSIWYG formatting that results
in virtually no HTML authors actually understanding HTML!

I don't think that structure is difficult to teach, except to people
who have already learnt with tools that don't directly support it.
Someone who is used to using manual typewriters will naturally try
to underline headings, and someone who has used Write will think in
terms of bolding text to create a heading, so pragmatic considerations
may mean that you have to provide them with a migration path.  However
it is too easy to use the same path for learners who don't have
preconceptions; the result is that people are being continually taught
how to violate most of the priority 2 WCAG rules.

In my view, unless the structures that are being represented by the
formatting are understood, the formatting will fail to communicate
effectively.
