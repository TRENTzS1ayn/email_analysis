Well, horses for courses. I totally agree that when teaching HTML one 
should go straight to stylesheets and structure and not teach random 
bolding etc.

In terms of teaching MS Word, which is what my web pages are about, I 
don't see any problem with first teaching someone how to select text 
and apply bold, colours etc and then later moving to teach 
stylesheets. The media are quite different.

When I create a web page I can reasonable expect that a computer will 
mediate my communication and software and hardware will render my 
page as one or many of: visual text and graphics, spoken words, 
braille, in my language or another language. Software could create a 
table of contents or perhaps summarise my text.

When I use MS Word to type a letter to my Aunty Flo and print it 
ready for posting or faxing, I don't think that my use of bold or 
otherwise has much relevance to anything beyond how I want that page 
to look.

OTOH: when a "typist" in a government department uses MS Word to type 
up a briefing paper which will then be passed electronically to an 
analyst for further comment and editing, incorrect typing and failure 
to use Stylesheets can be devastatingly wasteful of resources.

I think we could now firmly return to the topic of HTML which is 
where this discussion began.



Cheers,
