Agreed. I spend a lot of time on structure.

Agreed. I've seen many many real life examples of this.

I do in fact teach Styles, but not in the first two hour course, 
which is where I drew my example text from and where this discussion 
originated. One of the many arts of teaching  to build-up learning, 
to begin with smaller skills and concepts and use those blocks to 
create ever more advanced sets of skills. Learning to select a word 
or two and format them individually is very much more appropriate for 
my target learners as a basic knowledge. Once they understand that 
concept then we can later introduce the stylesheet concept, which is 
really just applying bulk, appropriate formatting in a consistent and 
intelligent way which aligns with structure.

I'm very uncomfortable with a discussion which began with a query 
about HTML tags now turning into a critique (based on insufficient 
data) of my teaching methods. I would suggest that it return to HTML 
and accessibility discussion.

Another list I'm on discourages off-topic posts which must be "paid 
for" with a tip. I find that a very useful approach which could well 
be adopted more widely. Here then is a tip:

<tip>When creating instructional web pages code the HTML first, with 
structure in mind, and then later create a Stylesheet with your 
presentation suggestions. This helps focus the mind on what is being 
said.</tip>
