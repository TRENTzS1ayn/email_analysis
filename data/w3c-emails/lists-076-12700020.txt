Most of the issues are the same whether there is one table or nested tables,
except they are potentially more complex. There are some systems that cannot
handle multiple layer nesting, but as I recall not many.

  would like to post a topic for discussion and it centers on accessibility
  and techique:

  when using tables for layout, the cells that contains content may have a
  need for forms and data.  the content cell may be inbetween two cells - one
  on the left for data and the right for headlines.  there can be a need for
  nesting tables within the cell containing the content. for example, if there
  is tabular data in a cell, it can use a nested table that may take up one
  third or one fourth of the cell height.

  how do assistive devices render a table in a table like this?  what are the
  issues?
