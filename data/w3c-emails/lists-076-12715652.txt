Under default behaviour Domino renders the opening tag
for any Javascript as follows

SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript"

This is not HTML 4.01 compliant (Strict or
Transiational) because of the missing type attribute.

Will this missing attribute impact user-agent
behaviour?

Note that I would also like to ask Lotus/IBM to change
the way this is rendered, what would be preferred

SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript" type="text/javascript"

or

SCRIPT type="text/javascript"

or

Something else

bearing in mind that I am aiming for '4.01
Transitional' compliance because there are far too
many other issues with other Domino rendered HTML to
go for Strict.

TIA
Graham Oliver
