Does anyone know if you can add alt tags to images in PowerPoint 97/2000
presentations.  I know you can add alt tags to presentations that are
published as web pages, but what about slide shows.  Also, will a screen
readers be able to read the slide show or is there a built in reader in
PowerPoint.
Thanks in advance
Scott
