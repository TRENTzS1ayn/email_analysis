Use Alt+Down arrow to open the select menu when it has focus; then arrow up
and down.

Subject: Dropdowns and Screen Readers


Can JAWS or other screen readers read drop down form elements in web
pages.  I have a web site that has a drop down and JAWS only reads the
top value and does not continue to read the rest of the list.  Is there
something that needs to be modified in the form or in JAWS.
Thanks
Scott
