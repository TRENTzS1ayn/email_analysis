hi everyone

i'm just marking up a document with several occurences of asterisks after
words in data table cells which lead to a brief explanation or additional
info that couldn't fit into the data cell but is placed underneath the table
(a footnote basically).  i was wondering how to make that accessible.  

should i put an abbr or acronym tag  or span/title around the asterisk and
put the explanantion in there?  what if the explanation is really long,
won't that be confusing.  also, it would be repetitive, since the user would
then come across it twice, because it's still underneath the table for the
sighted users.  it would basically get read out twice by a screenreader. 

with references at the bottom of documents i normally link to the reference
and then from there back to the text, but that seems a bit overkill here. 
and confusing again.

or maybe i should put title="additional info after table" in a tag around
it.

what would be the best and least confusing solution?

thanks
iris

the page in question is at http://www.demos.ac.uk/project/docs/0103.html 
i'm not finished marking it up yet.
the data tables are further down the page (in grey).
