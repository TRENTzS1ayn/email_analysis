Iris,

I think an asterisk is good only when you have a single (foot)note on a page. When you have more than one, I'd suggest you number them, or use symbolic names as the W3C does in its standards. It would probably also help to link the footnotes back to their references. I'd put the notes themselves simply at the bottom of the page then - unless the explanation is *very* short. A list of notes can itself be interesting to read and warrant a link from a table of contents on the page.
