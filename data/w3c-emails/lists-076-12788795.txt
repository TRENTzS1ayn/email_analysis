If these are in fact glossary references (it sounds like it) then a link is a
good idea.Especially if that is made clear by including the attribute
rel="glossary" in the link.

a link is fairly low cost, and is explicit, and works everywhere. If you add
some type nformation to it viarel you can do cool stuff, whereas with an
asterisk or similar there is no explicit encoding. This is about getting the
semantics explicit so that even computeres can follow them...

  Iris,

  I think an asterisk is good only when you have a single (foot)note on a page. When you have more than one, I'd suggest you number them, or use symbolic names as the W3C does in its standards. It would probably also help to link the footnotes back to their references. I'd put the notes themselves simply at the bottom of the page then - unless the explanation is *very* short. A list of notes can itself be interesting to read and warrant a link from a table of contents on the page.
