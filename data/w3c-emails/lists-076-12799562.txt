no, they are not references that can go at the bottom of the page.  no, they
are not glossary terms.  no, i didn't write the content and don't want to
change it too much since it's an academic research paper.  

there are several tables of courses on this page, title of course, length of
course and attendance. there's an asterisk next to some course titles and a
note below the table ('this course was run in liaison with...'), which means
several items refer to this note.  i can't put it with the references at the
bottom of the page because linking back wouldn't be possible (several
items).  it would all become clear if you had a look at the page:

maybe i'm overdoing it a bit, trying to get this accessible?
