fantastic!  i can't believe we didn't come up with this ealier.  see, my
main interest is in making it less confusing for screenreader users. 
jumping around in the text is confusing, especially for such a bagatelle. 
this is a really good solution.  thank you sooo much.

thanks for all the other input too
