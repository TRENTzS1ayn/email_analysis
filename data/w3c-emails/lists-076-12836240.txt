-Please respond to Amy Goldman at PIAT:  piat@temple.edu


Dear Colleague:

In our quest to enhance web accessibility to ALL persons with
disabilities,
we
are looking for exemplars of websites that are user-friendly for
individuals

with cognitive disabilities.  This would include persons who have
difficulty

accessing text but who do not have screen readers, including those who
can
benefit from pictorially-presented information.  Your recommendations
and
assistance is appreciated!
