Well, I don't think it is taken as read, but it is understood to be important
on the Web just as it is elsewhere.

There is a checkpoint in the Web Content Accessiblity Guidelines:
Use the clearest and simplest language appropriate for a site's content.
http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/wai-pageauth.html#tech-simple-and-straightforward

And there is ongoing discussion of this in the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines group, as well as some discussion in the tools groups of methods
that can be used to check this.

cheers

  Hi

  Are there any sites or books or papers which contain any information about
  the effects on accessibility by making language on web sites simpler.  For
  example, less jargon and slang can improve things for those without Eng as a
  first language, and also those with limited education, the deaf, blind and
  so on.  Is this concept simply taken as read, or are there any studies on
  it?

  Any help appreciated.

  Thanks

  Jo
