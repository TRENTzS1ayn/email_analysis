There's been quite a bit of activity organized around the concept of "plain
language".   Regarding studies specifically regarding people with
disabilities, I would check with some of the major university sites (Trace
Center, University of Toronto, Temple).    I also included a link to the
Cognitive Disabilities links page I had put together a while ago -- please
let me know if you run across broken links.

Well, I don't think it is taken as read, but it is understood to be
important
on the Web just as it is elsewhere.

There is a checkpoint in the Web Content Accessiblity Guidelines:
Use the clearest and simplest language appropriate for a site's content.
http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/wai-pageauth.html#tech-simple-and-straightforward


And there is ongoing discussion of this in the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines group, as well as some discussion in the tools groups of methods
that can be used to check this.

cheers

  Hi

  Are there any sites or books or papers which contain any information
about
  the effects on accessibility by making language on web sites simpler.
For
  example, less jargon and slang can improve things for those without Eng
as a
  first language, and also those with limited education, the deaf, blind
and
  so on.  Is this concept simply taken as read, or are there any studies on
  it?

  Any help appreciated.

  Thanks

  Jo
