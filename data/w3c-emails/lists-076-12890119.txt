Does anyone know how other user agents use the title attribute in anchor
elements?

I know that IE displays the title in a "tool tip", and it seems like it
would be a good way to provide additional information to help the user
decide whether to follow the link.  I tried using JAWS, and JAWS seems to
just read the title, and not the actual link text.  Homepage reader seemed
to ignore the title text altogether.

The W3C's site (http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/global.html#adef-title )
says that title text may be presented by screen readers in a manner similar
to a tool tip, but I doubt that the intent is to exclude the link text.

It seems that, at least for JAWS users, the title text should be the same as
the text of the hyperlink, but this seems redundant.  Anyone have any
additional information?
