Ignoring the title attribute isn't great, but it's better than JAWS'
approach IMHO, since the title attribute is meant to have
"additional" information losing it is a disadvantage, but shouldn't
be a show-stopper, whereas if you get the title in place of the link
text you are potentially replacing crucial information with merely
helpful "bonus" information.
Since the title attribute may not be understandable outside of the
context of the element it applies to this seems to be a design-flaw.
Do any JAWS users know if this is something that can be changed
through settings?
