Greetings. I'm a plain (I prefer "clear") language consultant in Toronto. This
is my first post to this list, as most of my work related to accessibility so
far has been in mainly print, and secondarily Web materials -- in fact, my
learning might have taken the opposite direction of many on this list: plain
language first, which led me to learning about Web accessibility. So thanks to
Karl (and everyone) for the links to Web-specific resources relating to
accessibility. Though I don't have too much behind-the-scenes technical
expertise -- basic HTML and an elementary understanding of technical issues
around Web communication -- I always encourage clients to follow the the WAI
guidelines when they post information on the 'Net.

For anyone wanting plain language-related links, I would also have you start
with the PLAIN (Plain Language Association INternational) site mentioned
earlier: www.plainlanguagenetwork.org. From there you can link to some seminal
online resources related to the plain language field, and find out about people
and groups who do important work in the field.

If anyone's got an interest in clear communication resources for a specific
context (print, Web, health, education, etc.), let me know and I can give you
some suggestions of places to start.

Cheers,
Michelle
