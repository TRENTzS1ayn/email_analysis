I think you need to be concerned of both blind, low vision, color blind,
and cognitive users. So I would suggest adding an asterisk or super script
1 on the row header and a note at the bottom of the table that that row is
optional.  The addition of the background shading is useful, but not
sufficient.  If it wasn't a whole row of cells, I would also consider using
the word "optional" in parentheses in each cell.
