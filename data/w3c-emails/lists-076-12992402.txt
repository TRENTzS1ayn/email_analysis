Dear Colleague:

In our quest to enhance web accessibility to ALL persons with
disabilities, we are looking for exemplars of websites that are
user-friendly for
individuals with cognitive disabilities.  This would include persons who
have
difficulty accessing text but who do not have screen readers, including
those who
can benefit from pictorially-presented information.  Your recommendations
and assistance is appreciated!
