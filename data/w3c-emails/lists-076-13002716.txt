Lynx uses it as a provisional name for a link in its table of links
display (I think IE may do the same) until the user loads the 
referenced page and it can extract the title information.  That
seems a very reasonable thing to do, for me.

I would expect a link title to contain either the title of the
target page (possibly in context - real titles need to stand alone
in bookmark files and search engine results) or a very short abstract
of the content of the referenced page (the page title should, in 
effect, be an even shorter abstract).
