Wrong.  This link is a dead link for anyone without Javascript or
who wants to operate securely.  It is also invisible to search
engines.  It is a WCAG failure - priority 1, I think.

If you have to do this, do it like this:

<a   href="help.html"
     onclick="openHelpWindow('help.html'); return false" 
     href="help.html"
     title="Help on how to use this page (pops-up if Javascript enabled)">Help</A>

Your others examples suggest that you fail the "provide alternatives
to scripting" multiple times.
