> But very commonly, a link is one or more words in the middle of a paragraph. When that occurs, reading the title attribute and ignoring the text is absolutely not the desired behavior. I'd actually consider it brain-dead behavior on the part of whatever tool does this.

When you have a textual link that has link text that is descriptive 
enough you would not include a title.  When the link text is 
insufficient to communicate function you would override it with a title.

What we are talking about is the ability to override the default text of 
a link in the case that the text does not accurately describe what a 
link does.
