Apologies.  I forgot that this was the W3C list. 

My comments were addressed more towards making this "work" and less to 
the W3C compliant solution.  Our focus is the Section 508 guidlines and 
making "functional text" available to assistive technologies.  Further 
discussion should probably be carried out on the trace list.
