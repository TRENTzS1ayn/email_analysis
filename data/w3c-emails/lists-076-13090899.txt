The title attribute is not the same thing as a toolTip, although a
toolTip is a sensible rendering of the title in some contexts.

[useful things to do with title snipped]

That is indeed useful. However I may wish to have the following:

<p>The <a href="whatever.html" title="United States homepage of the
company">company</a> was set up in Ireland in 1934.</p>

Here title is doing it's job correctly, but rendering it as "The
United States homepage of the company was set up in Ireland in 1934."
is not correct (though it would certainly be great one-up-manship
amongst those who boast about how long they've been using the web!).

As it is title is a useful tool for making pages more accessible, but
to really do it's job we need ways for user agents to interpret it
without replacing the rest of the text in the link.
