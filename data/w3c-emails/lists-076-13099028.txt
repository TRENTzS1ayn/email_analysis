What is the general feeling about DHTML/CSS Filters? (See
http://www.w3schools.com/dhtml/tryit.asp?filename=trydhtml_glowlink for an
example, or http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/filter/filters.asp for
all the details.) They seem to be a much more accessible alternative to the
image-based rollovers that so many designers (& clients) seem to love. While
they seem to be a Microsoft-only feature, they do degrade gracefully on
non-MS browsers, leaving just the original text without the filter's styling
effects. And, using CSS's "hover", you can even get the rollover-type
effects without scripting.

Just trying to figure out why I haven't seen them in use more often - any
insights appreciated...

Thanks,
Mike
