I only ever used them on something where accessibility of any
description wasn't an issue (I was just playing with the technology,
and doing a few deliberately bad things to see what happens). And
agree that they would probably be more accessible than at least some
of the other types of mouseovers, etc.

I imagine the reason they aren't used much is that they are only
IE-applicable, and also some of the more complicated things that can
be done with them are difficult, which may put developers off the
whole thing.

When you consider that there is a strong overlap between those
developers who take particular pains to build accessible sites, and
those who believe in following standards for other reasons it may be
that this is why they aren't often used to make rollovers more
accessible).
