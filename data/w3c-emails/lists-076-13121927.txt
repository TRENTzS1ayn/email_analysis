Paul Bohman, Technology Coordinator of WebAIM, will be teaching a Web-based
course on Web Accessibility this summer, with Jeff Isom, WebAIM
Instructional Designer. The class is available with or without college
credit.

Below are some of the details:

COURSE TITLE: Inclusive Web Design- Disability Usability and Accessibility.
DATES: June 11, 2001 to August 3, 2001.
COST: $390 for college credit or $300 without college credit.
MAXIMUM ENROLLMENT: 25 people (sign up soon to ensure a spot in the class).
The course syllabus can be seen at:
http://www.webaim.org/courses/2001/summer/syllabus.

If you already encourage yourself an accessibility expert, then I encourage
you to forward this email to others who you think could benefit from Web
accessibility training (students or web developers at universities,
government agencies, businesses, etc.).

The class is self-paced, with hands-on activities. Students will learn
accessibility principles and create a portfolio of accessible Web pages.

You do not have to be a college student to enroll. University staff and
faculty are encouraged to enroll, as well as anyone interested in learning
more about Web accessibility.
