It's a pity that few people are aware of PATH_INFO, which allows, servers
to construct virtual directories behind CGI applications.  Orignally 
GETs to ? URLs were supposed to be cacheable, but abuse of this means
that HTTP 1.1 requires a positive indication of cachability and some
proxies don't even bother looking at the headers on request for them.

This particular page also tried to dump two useless cookies on me,
which is another thing that needs careful handling for cachability.
