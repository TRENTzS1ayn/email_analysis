Hello Charles and Katie

Below is a link and information on the free Macromedia
seminar June 13th.  The key note will be Mike Paceillo
of WebABLE.com, founder of the W3C/WAI, so I think
this should be a little different than the normal
Section 508 seminar.

Macromedia are putting together content that is
Dreamweaver, fireworks and Flash specific, how to-do
in applications not just code.

I think it will be well worth promoting to people you
know who use or may want to use Macromedia products.
