From: Kwesi [mailto:kt336490@oak.cats.ohiou.edu]

Dear Dr. Cantor,
My name is Kwesi and a doctoral student at Ohio University.  I am
presently doing a research on Web-based learning and students with
learning disabilities.  I am basically trying to find out the strategies
these students use in this learning environment as well as the
limitations they face.  I intend to interview professors who teach these
students to find out whta types of accommodations they make for these
students.  In addition I will be talking to web course designers to see
what types of accommodations they make for these students in this
environment.  My advisor Dr.  Sandra Turner met a professor at a
conference and told her about my research and she suggested I contact
you because you may be able to help.  I was wondering if you could post
my request on a listserv or to your students so that anyone who feels
they meet my criteria and are willing to participate can get back to me
for further details.
