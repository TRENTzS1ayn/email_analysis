HI all,

I've got two questions to ask, so will send a couple of emails.

Regarding image maps and "alt" text & "redundant text links"

I've been having a look at the technique outlined at

http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/

under "7.4.2 Redundant text links for client-side image maps"

(where it has an example using object & A to code the imagemap and its links)

I tried this example code, and when you turn images off in the 
browser, you get text links, which is great, and will fulfill the 
needs of those not using images.

I would think that "best practice" would be to still put actual text 
links on the page somewhere as well, for anyone who surfs with images 
on, but can't see well enough to see the image clearly.

Opinions would be appreciated!

Cheers

Rebecca
