I don't think the worry is about the small minority who are designing things
that are easy to parse, but the potential huge number of people who
will define elements like RED, FLASHING, etc., in a completely flat
structure, except possibly that even that would be too technical for them.
Most problem HTML is not designed for machine to machine communication
but only to be accessed through a human eye.

However, these people are already producing such flat, semantic free,
documents using span or font.
