I may miss an important point, but why would you not simply use CSS?
Of course you may not specify an element to mean "title" and let the
rendering agent--say, the screen reader--decide by itself what it
shall do with it--or then, if this is what you want, use XHTML.
Still, you may tell your screen reader what to do with it using
aural styles.

CSS offers ways to define consistant tables in XML, as well as to
disinguish paragraphs--and, IMHO, anything you might ever really
need to distinguish--using the "display" property. My only fear is
in rendering agents not supporting this yet.

I know little about XSL, but as far as CSS remains an acceptable
solution for describing content of XML documents--and authors use it
consistantly--I see no accessibility problem.
