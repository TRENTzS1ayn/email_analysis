The issue of why use server side image maps came up on the GL list recently
(WCAG1 P1 checkpoints 1.2 and 9.1).
The bit about "except where the regions cannot be defined with an available
geometric shape" is, in fact, meant to apply to maps where each and every
pixel is, in effect, a different hot link.  As Jim points out, the header
graphic at King County hardly qualifies to use this techique.  We are taking
about geographic maps, such as services provided by MapBlast and the like.

Redundant text links should be available forserver-side image maps; no reason for redundant links for client-side maps -You must use alt text for each of the areas. 7.4.2 is preceeded with "untiluser agents ...." and user agents are recognizing alt text on areas.  Ithink it is wrong to also have text links when you have alt text on theareas ... Opinion.An example I used in the "web course"(http://jimthatcher.com/webcourse2.htm) for me raises a very interestingissue about image maps. The King County Washington site(http://www.metrokc.gov/) uses a sever-side map for its primary navigationand has equivalent text links at the bottom of the page. Section 508 wouldnot allow this because !
the regions (lik all regions) can be specified in aclient-side map. But using this server-side map with equivalent links at thebottom of the page provides a skip navigation method. A dilemma!Jimhttp://jimthatcher.com512-306-0931
