Steven,

Regarding your first question, I can say that Window-Eyes does not 
currently support aural style sheets. This is something that I have 
approached our developers about, and we have brainstormed on a few items. 
But I'm not sure where the development will go from here. To my knowledge, 
none of the major screen readers support aural style sheets at this time.

Aaron
