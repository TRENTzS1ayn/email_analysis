It is very encouraging to see for-profit businesses start to offer this kind
of thing.
I am equally pleased by the MacroMedia announcement of their "Accessibility
Starter Kit".
My enthusiasm, however, is tempered by the fact that their page detailing
this has P1 errors on it!
<http://dynamic.macromedia.com/bin/MM/event_reg/eventDetails.jsp?key=1282>
Missing ALT="" on spacer gif, and "macromedia / what the web can be" logo
graphic has no textual equivalent.

I will not be there, but I hope someone gives them grief about this...
