  Steven,

  Regarding your first question, I can say that Window-Eyes does not
  currently support aural style sheets. This is something that I have
  approached our developers about, and we have brainstormed on a few items.
  But I'm not sure where the development will go from here. To my knowledge,
  none of the major screen readers support aural style sheets at this time.
