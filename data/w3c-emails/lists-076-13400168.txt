Does anyone have ideas on the appropriate way to mark up a group of
radio/option buttons (input type="radio") so that a screen reader/talking
browser can identify the group name as well as the label of the individual
buttons.

For example, if the group was:
"What kind of cheese do you want on your pizza?",
and the radio buttons are:
"Mozzarella",
"Cheddar",
"None".

and the user tabbed to the radio buttons (a la IE & JAWS in "forms mode"),
only the radio button label is read. So in this case, the user hears
"Mozzarella [tab]Cheddar [tab] None" but never hears what the question is...

Currently, I've got the radio button labels (Mozzarella, Cheddar, none)
tagged with <Label> for their respective buttons. I've tried using
<Fieldset> with <Legend> marking up the group label (What kind of cheese...)
, but JAWS doesn't read it as I would have expected. Home Page Reader
handles it a little better by simply reading the group lable before the
first value -- if you're on the third button, you still have to arrow back
to the first if you want to re-read the group label, but it's managable.

So two questions:
(1) What is the "correct" way to markup the button and group labels?, and
(2) What is the most practical way considering what the leading assistive
technologies support?

Thanks,
Mike
