Hi Rebecca,

I also like the technique but have encountered a problem. The example 
works fine in Netscape 4.74 but fails in IE 5.0 and 5.5 and I've no 
idea why.

Perhaps someone see a reason that accounts for the difference?

I'm using:

   <OBJECT data="navbar1.gif" type="image/gif" usemap="#map1">
    <MAP name="map1">
     <P>Navigate the site.
      [<A href="guide.html" shape="rect"
      coords="0,0,118,28">Access Guide</A>]
      [<A href="shortcut.html" shape="rect"
      coords="118,0,184,28">Go</A>]
      [<A href="search.html" shape="circle"
      coords="184.200,60">Search</A>]
      [<A href="top10.html" shape="poly"
      coords="276,0,276,28,100,200,50,50,276,0"> Top Ten</A>]
    </MAP>
   </OBJECT>
