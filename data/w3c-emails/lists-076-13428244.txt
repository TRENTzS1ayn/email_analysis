IE may not implement the HTML 4 specification completely, in allowing for the
a element to have coords attributes. iCab is another browser where this
works.

If you have HTML 4.01 then the allowed content for map changed specifically
to cope with this. So you could add area elements, to have

     <OBJECT data="navbar1.gif" type="image/gif" usemap="#map1">
      <MAP name="map1">
       <P>Navigate the site.
        [<A href="guide.html" shape="rect"
        coords="0,0,118,28">Access Guide</A>]
        [<A href="shortcut.html" shape="rect"
        coords="118,0,184,28">Go</A>]
        [<A href="search.html" shape="circle"
        coords="184.200,60">Search</A>]
        [<A href="top10.html" shape="poly"
        coords="276,0,276,28,100,200,50,50,276,0"> Top Ten</A>]

 <AREA href="guide.html"
          alt="Access Guide" shape="rect" coords="0,0,118,28">
 <AREA href="search.html"
          alt="Search" shape="rect" coords="184,0,276,28">
 <AREA href="shortcut.html"
          alt="Go" shape="circle" coords="184,200,60">
 <AREA href="top10.html"
          alt="Top Ten" shape="poly" coords="276,0,373,28,50,50,276,0">

      </MAP>
     </OBJECT>

Or you could do all of this in XHTML using the browser compatibility rules,
with the following:

     <object data="navbar1.gif" type="image/gif" usemap="#map1">
      <map name="map1">
       <p>Navigate the site.
        [<a href="guide.html" shape="rect"
        coords="0,0,118,28">Access Guide</a>]
        [<a href="shortcut.html" shape="rect"
        coords="118,0,184,28">Go</a>]
        [<a href="search.html" shape="circle"
        coords="184.200,60">Search</a>]
        [<a href="top10.html" shape="poly"
        coords="276,0,276,28,100,200,50,50,276,0"> Top Ten</a>]
       <p>
        <area href="guide.html"
          alt="Access Guide" shape="rect" coords="0,0,118,28">
        <area href="search.html"
          alt="Search" shape="rect" coords="184,0,276,28">
        <area href="shortcut.html"
          alt="Go" shape="circle" coords="184,200,60" />
        <area href="top10.html"
           alt="Top Ten" shape="poly" coords="276,0,373,28,50,50,276,0" />
      </map>
     </object>

This is a little bit clunky, since you are repeating content in order to cope
with browsers that don't fully implement the spec, but it should work, and
the examples should be valid for HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 respectively.

  Hi Rebecca,

  I also like the technique but have encountered a problem. The example
  works fine in Netscape 4.74 but fails in IE 5.0 and 5.5 and I've no
  idea why.

  Perhaps someone see a reason that accounts for the difference?

  I'm using:

     <OBJECT data="navbar1.gif" type="image/gif" usemap="#map1">
      <MAP name="map1">
       <P>Navigate the site.
        [<A href="guide.html" shape="rect"
        coords="0,0,118,28">Access Guide</A>]
        [<A href="shortcut.html" shape="rect"
        coords="118,0,184,28">Go</A>]
        [<A href="search.html" shape="circle"
        coords="184.200,60">Search</A>]
        [<A href="top10.html" shape="poly"
        coords="276,0,276,28,100,200,50,50,276,0"> Top Ten</A>]
      </MAP>
     </OBJECT>
