Jakob Nielsen's Alertbox for May 27 is now online at:
  http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20010527.html

A survey of 1,078 user experience professionals finds that usability
specialists make more money than designers and writers in the same field.
In all three areas, salaries are highest in the U.S., lower in Canada and
Asia, and much lower in Europe and Australia.


USERS WITH VISUAL AND MOTOR IMPAIRMENTS NEEDED FOR STUDY

I am conducting a research study on the usability of websites for users
with disabilities. If you know Internet users with a visual or motor
impairment, then please ask them to volunteer for the study if they are
located in one of the following cities:
 * New York City
 * Boston
 * Silicon Valley/San Francisco Bay Area
 * Los Angeles
 * San Diego
 * Portland, OR

Users will be paid an incentive for participating in the study.
We will come to the user's location to allow use of their usual assertive
technology.

Potential test users please contact Susan Farrell, farrell@nngroup.com
