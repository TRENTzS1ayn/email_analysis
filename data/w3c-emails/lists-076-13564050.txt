Hi All,

Are there accessibility issues surrounding dynamically generated images,
such as stock charts etc, which are different to static images? It strikes
me that it would be difficult to generate meaningful alt text for a dynamic
image, as the content of the image is always changing. I imagine the issue
is particularly difficult in the case of a dynamic graph, although I suppose
you could have an alternate text feed - does this sound like a sensible
approach?

Just curious,

Anthony
