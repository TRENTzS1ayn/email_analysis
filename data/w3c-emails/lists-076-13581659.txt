Hello Anthony:

    Wow, dynamically varying charts.
You mentioned a text feed.  Does this change dynamically too?  I would assume so.  I think this could be handled if say a single value was varying like a price of a single stock chart and the price was in ASCII text on the screen.  Some (most?) screen readers have advanced features all loosely called monitors or, confusingly frames, that can "monitor" a user defined area of the screen.  Advanced users can use the screen reader's scripting language to write sophisticated programs to do something if this user defined area changes.  The minimnum is to read the area itself but you could tell it to read any other portion of the screen as well.  This, as I said, is for the rather advanced screen reader user.  The latest version of JFW's Frame Manager makes defining such areas and taking various actions much easier than previously but I don't know about other screen readers.  The area itself must be well defined so you can specify a rectangle around it.  If the area were to move, this would make it very difficult f not impossible.  I would not want to see site designers depend on the user being able to do this - at least not yet.

Hi All,

Are there accessibility issues surrounding dynamically generated images,
such as stock charts etc, which are different to static images? It strikes
me that it would be difficult to generate meaningful alt text for a dynamic
image, as the content of the image is always changing. I imagine the issue
is particularly difficult in the case of a dynamic graph, although I suppose
you could have an alternate text feed - does this sound like a sensible
approach?

Just curious,

Anthony
