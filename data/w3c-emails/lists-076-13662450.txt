Hello,

Very interesting.  Google finds about 5000 pages total (2500 A, 1200 AA, 
1300 AA).  These are not unique sites, but pages on sites.  W3C turns up a 
lot. <grin/>

Next it would be interesting to run a bot version of Bobby, or the W3C 
validators, or tidy or <x-other-tool> through all pages on the Web.  It 
would evaluate them for the most common errors (lack of alt-text, use of 
server-side image maps, javascript, etc. etc.).  Al suggested this a couple 
years ago, but I don't think anyone has done it.

On the other hand, I wonder how many sites are accessible but have not made 
a conformance claim.

Good stuff Karl! Thanks,
--wendy
