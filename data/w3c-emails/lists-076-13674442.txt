Cyndi Rowland, project director of WebAIM, has published a paper looking at
accessibility of post-secondary education web sites. You can find it at
http://www.webaim.org/articles/whitepaper.htm. She looks at 6 studies, and
I'll excerpt the first one so you can see the type of data discussed:

1. Rowland and Smith (22) reported BOBBY data (version 3.0) gathered on a
random sample of 400 prominent colleges, universities, and online learning
institutions from all 50 states and the District of Columbia between
December 15, 1998 and January 8, 1999. Results indicated that fewer than 1
in 4 postsecondary institutions (n = 90; 22%) had front pages (i.e., the
institutional home page) that would receive BOBBY approval. In going one
level beyond the front page, for the institutions that had accessible
front-pages, only 3% (n=10) received BOBBY approval. Less than 1% of sites
that were accessible one level beyond the front page were accessible at all
links two levels from the front page. 

[Web Accessibility In Mind (WebAIM) is administered through a grant provided
by the Learning Anywhere Anytime Program Fund for the Improvement of
Postsecondary Education.]

Wendy & Rafael -
I haven't had a chance to update my website to reflect the demise of some
search engines, but here are some links I developed a while ago.   The
links provide search engine queries to find the pages that are linking to
the WCAG logo pages.    These sites should be either claiming that level of
compliance or are discussing the logos and providing links to their
descriptions.

   http://w3.gsa.gov/web/m/OLD_cita.nsf/Links/WCAGLevelAA
   http://w3.gsa.gov/web/m/OLD_cita.nsf/Links/WCAGLevelAAA

Hope this helps,
Karl

Rafael,

I'm on the look out for stats as well.  I have not found any about how many
sites claim level A, AA or AAA. If anyone finds any, however let me know
and I will add it to my "interesting stats page" at :
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2001/01/22-stats.html
