There are a couple of other issues. For some reason people seem to think it
is a good idea to produce pop-ups that don't provide the normal amount of
control (back buttons, resizeable, font size menu, etc), and instead of using
HTML to do it they make them in javascript with no workable alternative.

The basic problem (even if people do allow the user to control it) is a loss
of context. So generally it is better not to pop up a window - users who want
it are likely to know how to do it anyway - this is offered by most browsers.

Where you are going to do so, as Rob says it is good to provide some explicit
warning. Modern browsers are starting to do this anyway - iCab does, and
Opera lets you control whether it happens or not.

Hope that makes things a bit clearer...

  you can put a generic message on top if you have a  lot of links that will
  basically tell the user that
  the links will open a separate pop-up windows or one on top of the other.

  note, the trick here is whether you open a new window on top of the current
  window or a pop-up where you control the size, placement and commands. in
  any case, let the user know.

  you can also put a link next to the web site description that says <pop-up>.

  another case would be to post a message that you are leaving the site or use
  a message that says <you are exiting this site> some people have disclaimers
  attached.

  also when i read, "do not change the current window without informing the
  user", i take this to mean they are talking about the current site going
  someplace else.  so an internal link changes the current window and the
  external link will change the window - so this is ok.  trick is if new
  windows are opened or if the new browser window is opened on top of the
  current.

  comments?
