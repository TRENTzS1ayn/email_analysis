From a user point of view, the pop-up window problem is like this:  I click
on a link and IE displays the new page.  Window-Eyes or HPR reads the new
page just fine.  But the back key, alt-left-arrow no longer works; it
simply forces the same window to be reloaded.  I use alt-F4 to close the
window and resume reading the main page from which that window had popped
up.  

Now imagine that several windows pop open during the browsing session.
It's easy to lose track, and I don't know for sure whether there are more
IE windows outside the one which currently has focus.  So I hit alt-F4, and
pretty soon I have closed the whole browser without intending to.  It's a
good thing IE maintains some history between sessions.
