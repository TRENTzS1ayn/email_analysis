What paul is saying is that even though hpr jfw and possibly window eyes
indicate links, there is still a lot of stuff around that doesn't and if
you are using netscape with jfw or window eyes, you have little to no
indication that something is designated as a link.

Paul's comments:
Well, it wasn't really saying baaa, it was saying bar (B A R), but I
guess
it could still get annoying.

Personally, I like the bar separator. Without it, it's sometimes hard to
tell where one link ends and the other begins, when listening to the
words
in succession.
