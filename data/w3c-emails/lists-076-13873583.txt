Hi Graham,

the rationale for this one was that there were assistive technology and
browser combinations that would skip over empty form controls. I am not
certain, but I believe that this is no longer an issue. I will ask the Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines group to address this question as fast as
possible.

cheers

  Can anyone give me an indication of the usability
