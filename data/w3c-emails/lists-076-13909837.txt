The triangle would work better if it were hollow rather than solid (so it
doesn't look like the triangles used for expanding/contracting categories)
and if it had alt text that said something like "Link to information below."
By adding the alt text, you'd get the same effect as the pop-up window icon
(ToolTip-wise), and you'd also let VI users know that they are linking
within the same page (which would be nice, I think).

Frankly, I think these icons are a nice idea. It would be better if they
were fairly standardized across sites, however, to avoid having to learn new
ones on each site. Of course, it would be even better if browsers inserted
the symbols themselves, but that might be difficult to do when JavaScript is
used to do the pop-up. Maybe I'll swipe this idea and use it on my own
sites...

Now, why does the pop-up symbol for the Thompson Conference Center link (see
URL below) have a magenta triangle in the lower left corner?

"The blue triangle on the Optavia site doesn't actually
do anything, it just signifies that the following link
is an intra-page link (I assume).
That was my confusion, I was clicking on the triangle
itself looking for something to happen.
It doesn't (as far as I am aware) add any
functionality for screen reader users (there is no alt
text) so I am not convinced it is a good idea."
