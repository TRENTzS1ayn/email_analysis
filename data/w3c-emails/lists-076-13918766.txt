You can use CSS2 to include the icon you are used to, except you need a
browser that supports it (I think Opera does, but don't know how far), using
something like the following:

  a[name]:before, [id]:before { content: url("http://example.com/image") }

Amaya uses something like this, except it doesn't implement it in CSS2, to
identify targets in a document, and a few other cases. But in CSS2 it can be
generalised

  By adding the alt text, you'd get the same effect as the pop-up window icon
  (ToolTip-wise), and you'd also let VI users know that they are linking
  within the same page (which would be nice, I think).

  Frankly, I think these icons are a nice idea. It would be better if they
  were fairly standardized across sites, however, to avoid having to learn new
  ones on each site. Of course, it would be even better if browsers inserted
  the symbols themselves, but that might be difficult to do when JavaScript is
  used to do the pop-up. Maybe I'll swipe this idea and use it on my own
  sites...

  Now, why does the pop-up symbol for the Thompson Conference Center link (see
  URL below) have a magenta triangle in the lower left corner?

  That was my confusion, I was clicking on the triangle
  itself looking for something to happen.
  It doesn't (as far as I am aware) add any
  functionality for screen reader users (there is no alt
  text) so I am not convinced it is a good idea."
