Hello:
     I agree with David in that it is still an issue.  The consequence is
that I will hear only "Edit" but will not know what type of information is requested.

it is still an issue although many have solved it.  even though you have
to rub the text out, it is best to have something telling you where to
write because some renderings still confuse labels with edit boxes.

Hi Graham,

the rationale for this one was that there were assistive technology and
browser combinations that would skip over empty form controls. I am not
certain, but I believe that this is no longer an issue. I will ask the
Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines group to address this question as fast
as
possible.

cheers

  Can anyone give me an indication of the usability
  consequences of not putting defaults into edit boxes.
