Hi Charles:


     I'm using JFW 3.31.  I will just hear "edit".

Thanks Steven, Dave.

Can you please explain what software you're using, and what happens?

cheers

  Hello:
       I agree with David in that it is still an issue.  The consequence is
  that I will hear only "Edit" but will not know what type of information is requested.

  it is still an issue although many have solved it.  even though you have
  to rub the text out, it is best to have something telling you where to
  write because some renderings still confuse labels with edit boxes.

  the rationale for this one was that there were assistive technology and
  browser combinations that would skip over empty form controls. I am not
  certain, but I believe that this is no longer an issue. I will ask the
  Web Content Accessibility Guidelines group to address this question as
  fast as possible.
