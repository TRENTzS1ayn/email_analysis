Hi,

there are some errors I picked up using the W3C validator - the following
link will give you the results (warning long URI):

http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A//infocentre.frontend.com/servlet/Infocentre%3Fpage%3Dhome%26access%3Dyes&doctype=Inline&outline=

Main problems I saw were some missing alt attributes (which probably should
have been blank - alt="") and no headings to give an idea of the structure.

Like the content though.

cheers

  Hi all,

  We have just re-designed our usability infocentre with accessibility as a
  major criteria in the brief. As far as we can tell, we think that it is WAI
  P3 compliant but we don't want to make a big deal of this, or mistakenly
  make the claim because some of the priority 3 points are somewhat
  subjective.

  While I realise that this request is somewhat off topic for this board, I'd
  be grateful if anyone was to take a look at the site and tell us if you
  think it is P3 compliant. You can get it at this url
  http://www.frontend.com/usability_infocentre/index.html

  Thanks in advance,

  Anthony
