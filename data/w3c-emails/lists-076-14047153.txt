Hello Charles:

     Good question.  I don't want to generalize, so let me just give an example that does work.  The example in section 11.2 of the 
HTML Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 works fine.  I hear
"First name colon edit"
then I hit tab and hear:
"Last name colon edit"
which is fine.
The snipet for the first name is:

   <LABEL for="firstname">First name: </LABEL>
   <INPUT type="text" id="firstname" tabindex="1">

Note my comments above are not about grouping form controls which is the main point of 11.2.  I am just commenting on the label element.

If they have labels (using the label element) does this improve things?

  Hi Charles:


       I'm using JFW 3.31.  I will just hear "edit".

  Thanks Steven, Dave.

  Can you please explain what software you're using, and what happens?

  cheers

    Hello:
         I agree with David in that it is still an issue.  The consequence is
    that I will hear only "Edit" but will not know what type of information is requested.

    it is still an issue although many have solved it.  even though you have
    to rub the text out, it is best to have something telling you where to
    write because some renderings still confuse labels with edit boxes.

    the rationale for this one was that there were assistive technology and
    browser combinations that would skip over empty form controls. I am not
    certain, but I believe that this is no longer an issue. I will ask the
    Web Content Accessibility Guidelines group to address this question as
    fast as possible.
