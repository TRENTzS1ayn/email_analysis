Both good news and bad news are informative.  It would help to have
examples of
what works and also of what doesn't work.  You and David seem to believe that
we still need explanatory text, or at least some text, in the edit boxes for
best practice at the moment.  This is an "until user agents" provision in the
WCAG.  So for objectivity and consensus, it helps to know what the actual user
agents do with actual pages.  

To sell this to web authors as the general rule of what to do, it helps to
have
chapter and verse documentation explaining in what situations alternatives
don't work.  Target page, OS, Browser, Screen reader with versions.  It helps.
