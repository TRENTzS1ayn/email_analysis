Hello Al:

     Yes, I agree completely.  My screen reader and browser are fixed, so this is why I emphasized that I did not want to generalize.  For my versions of screen reader and browser, it appears the label in the example I gave works.  As for other screen readers I can't say.
Even for other codings of the form, I can't say.  I never know what is a safe
generalization.  


An examnple that doesn't work for me
is on the wired article page from a previous message
(JFW 3.31 IE 5.0)

http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,44062,00.html>
I hear (skipping some links)
"Slash news slash image map link" then I tab and hear 
"Edit"
then I tab and hear
"Combo box"
then I tab and hear
"Go button"

If I hit enter on the Combo box to go into forms mode,
then I hear
"Look for combo box Wired news"
(a pull down list)

I think the "Look for" is supposed to be associated with the edit field and not the Combo box, right?
This had me confused for some time.
I'll try to find an example of what works.


Steve

Both good news and bad news are informative.  It would help to have
examples of
what works and also of what doesn't work.  You and David seem to believe that
we still need explanatory text, or at least some text, in the edit boxes for
best practice at the moment.  This is an "until user agents" provision in the
WCAG.  So for objectivity and consensus, it helps to know what the actual user
agents do with actual pages.  

To sell this to web authors as the general rule of what to do, it helps to
have
chapter and verse documentation explaining in what situations alternatives
don't work.  Target page, OS, Browser, Screen reader with versions.  It helps.
