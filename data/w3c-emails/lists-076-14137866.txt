AG:: Yes and no.  With the edit box, yes.  With the combo box, sorta.  Not
really "not with the combo box."  

[Warning: from here on I am going to call it a "list box" so as to save "combo
box" for something where you have more than one way to make the selection.
The
form composed of both edit field and list box is closer to a "combo box" in my
estimation.  And is also what "look for" is talking about, in the end.]  

Yes, this page would be understandable if they marked the "Look for" as a
LABEL
and said that the LABEL was FOR the edit field.  The list box pretty much
works
as self-explanatory.  The edit field absolutely requires some clue as to what
you are supposed to fill in.

On the other hand, the "Go" button following after the edit field and the list
box is really the bottom line, and "look for" actually makes sense as applied
to both the edit field and the list box.  The user wants to go to slash look
for some kind of information.  If they find a topic in the list box that is
what they want to look for, they go there.  If they don't find a topic that
fits their question, they just say what they are looking for and they go to a
search results page.  The "look for" legend fits in either case.  The
design of
this feature, at least in terms of how the designer optimizes it for the
visual
user, is ambiguous in terms of what the "look for" applies to.  It is
logically
more like a LEGEND on a FIELDSET but one can't use FIELDSET for grouping and a
TABLE for layout at the same time.  Note that this combination of topic list
plus text search as a navigation utility is common, a best current practice. 
Compare this one with the SEARCH tool prominently offered at the start of the
Amazon home page.

Reference:
Go to <<http://www.amazon.com/>http://www.amazon.com/> and text-search for
"search".

The immediate remedy in terms of today's technology is to make "look for" a
LABEL element pointing to the edit field.  End of short term story.

Over the long haul, it would be nice if it were actually possible to express
the branching logic here, which is 

Look for 
 either
  - one of our subtopics [indicate with list box], 
 or else
  - you tell us what [indicate in edit box].
and go.

[Note the order reversal.  I think the if-then-else structure is easier to
understand read aloud when laid out in the reverse order as compared with the
Wired News visual layout.  Amazon happens to have the fields in the other
order.  Visual users 'always' see both before the elect to use either one.]
