Note that neither W3C nor ISO reccommend frames (not in XHTML 1.1 or 
ISO HTML and never in anything except the transitional alternative in
earlier W3C HTMLs; they are in one of the modules in modular
XHTML).

Pages should work with "use largest font", which is something that can
be left permanently enabled; "ignore document font sizes" has to be turned
on and off on a page by page basis if you are not to lose too much 
for pages that do scale well.

This is why the WCAG guidelines say don't use absolute (including point)
font sizes.
