Not really.  It only works at all because Lynx has a work around for this
particular sort of misuse of frames.  Earlier versions of Lynx and early
GUI browsers will only display the please upgrade message.  Treating
frames as links was added because of pages like this and completely blank
pages, not because it was a logical consequence of any specification.

I would never use a please upgrade message.  It is seen as condescending
by those who see it, and might be accessing the site using neither
a Microsoft operating system nor a recent Apple one.

The message is incorrect, because you cannot traverse the site without
reading the source on any browser that is not frames aware, this is because
there is no way of finding out what the URLs of the frame contents are,
otherwise.

Missing out NOFRAMES entirely would make this a blank screen page on
some browsers (like many Javascript pages are).

For frames aware, non-frames, browsers, you should use title attributes
to expand on the frame names.  I can't remember if Lynx acts on these.

(I treat any statement about minimum browser requirements as a warning
sign.)
