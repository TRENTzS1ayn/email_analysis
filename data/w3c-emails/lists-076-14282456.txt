Gregory,

You had suggested:

I went to experiment with using a "secondary" label, but got stuck
immediately when trying to associate one secondary label (the LEGEND, "What
kind of cheese?") with multiple radio button controls ("Mozzarella",
"Cheddar", "None"). The example from the UAAG implementation test had two
labels pointing to one control (a SELECT with several OPTIONS).

If the LABEL FOR attribute can be set to only one ID value, and each ID
value has to be unique, we seem to be back where we started as far as groups
of radio buttons or checkboxes are concerned...

Any suggestions?

Mike
