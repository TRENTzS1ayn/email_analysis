Jim, why do you say that label-for is inadequate when <labels with
label-for attribute> and <input with id attribute> fields are in seperate
table cells? Since the HTML uses an I D to explicitly associate both the
labeler and labelee, isn't it up to the assistive technology to worry about
the UI presentation?

I did have a question about multiple labels for one field, if that was
valid HTML - but according to HTM 4.01 [1], each LABEL element is
associated with exactly one form control. There is also the table heading
(TH) and the ability to have one header associated with multiple cells.

Regards,
Phill
