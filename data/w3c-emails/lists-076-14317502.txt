Hi Phil,

This sounds like a big shift from what I understood this check point to be
originally about.  It was my impression that this was originally for the
days when there really wasn't good keyboard access in graphical browsers
so AT users had to hunt around a few pixels at a time clicking to find
edit boxes.

This sounds like a shift to addressing a situation where visual layout
doesn't afford for correct labeling perhpps?

I think folks have to be careful with default text in actual input
controls.  In places where it exists, I've seen users get into an endless
loop because they start editing that default text.

When everything works correctly, the default text is replaced as soon as
the user starts typing in the idit box but I've experienced both JAWS and
Window-Eyes users really getting into a bind where edit controls have
existing text.

I'm not saying it is a bad idea, but I for one would hope it is a
technique of last resort.

Then again from strictly a usability perspective some folks find it
helpful to have the default text there, disabled or not.
