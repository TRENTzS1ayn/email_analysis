But what is that behavior?  If HEADERS can do it, why can't LABEL FOR
attribute do it?  I 'm not sure I even can imagine a problem with the
contents of the LABEL element containing more than one INPUT element. Am I
missing something? Might there even be a spec [1] editing problem, meaning
that it should have said that each control can only have one unique id, not
one label?

I thought TABINDEX just stopped at each control, not at each label, so it
would always stop at each text entry field regardless of how many labels
each field had or didn't have.
