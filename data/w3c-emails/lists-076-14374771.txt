The label redirects focus to the control. It was a design decision, and
until then there was no reason why a label could not have said that it
applied to two or more elements (except that it is slightly messy to work out
the syntax).

There is a different semantic attached to headers.

Oh, and label just makes an association between some existing content and a
control explicit. There may be cases where the same thing is needed without
adding content - this is why there is a title attribute.

  But what is that behavior?  If HEADERS can do it, why can't LABEL FOR
  attribute do it?  I 'm not sure I even can imagine a problem with the
  contents of the LABEL element containing more than one INPUT element. Am I
  missing something? Might there even be a spec [1] editing problem, meaning
  that it should have said that each control can only have one unique id, not
  one label?

  I thought TABINDEX just stopped at each control, not at each label, so it
  would always stop at each text entry field regardless of how many labels
  each field had or didn't have.
