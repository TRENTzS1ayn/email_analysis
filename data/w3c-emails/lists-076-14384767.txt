Anthony,

thanks for explaining how this happens. I guess one of the useful things that
we can do is identify the kinds of problems that people can face when
implementing this stuff.

I would generally recommend checking with as many automated tools as you can,
not because they are enough to solve the problem but because they pick up a
lot of stuff that can easily slip through a manual review - the fiddly little
code bits that the tools should take care of.

Just for the validator, if you have a javascript-capable browser you can use
a bookmarklet to get a validation and an outline of any page, which is a
simple, useful check. Add the following to your bookmarks:

(long javascript URI)

javascript:void(location.href='http://validator.w3.org/check?uri='+escape(document.URL)+'&doctype=Inline&outline=')

cheers

  Hi Charles,

  Thanks for your feedback. I have to admit that we were initially pretty
  embarrassed about the missing alt attributes when we got your mail. In
  fairness, it's the cardinal sin. Anyway, we re-traced our steps in the
  design process to figure out how me let such a seemingly obvious "mistake"
  slip through. Our reasoning raises some interesting questions. Here's what
  happened:
