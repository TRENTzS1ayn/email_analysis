Hi Jim etal:

     Could you clarify with the snipet below?
   <LABEL for="firstname">First name: </LABEL>

   <INPUT type="text" id="firstname" tabindex="1">

What do you vary and what do you hold constant?

1. Keep the text between the label tags, drop the label tags 
First name:

   <INPUT type="text" id="firstname" tabindex="1">

or

2. Keep the label tags and drop the text between tags.
   <LABEL for="firstname"></LABEL>

   <INPUT type="text" id="firstname" tabindex="1">

If I use 1 above and use the tab key, JFW 3.31 
skips over the First name: text 
which is still there and just says "Edit" 
so it is looking for some tag at least, although another tag besides the label tag might work.
Adjacency has no effect.
That is, I tried
First name: <INPUT type="text" id="firstname" tabindex="1">
JFW 3.31 still skipped over the First name: text.

If I use 2 above, again I just hear "Edit"
Now, at this point, I'm not considering complicating factors like tables etc.
I want to vary one component at a time to determine what causes what.

Am I varying factors incorrectly?

Hi all,

The label (first name) works because it is adjacent to the text input field,
not because of the LABEL element. Screen readers have been picking up
prompts like this since they were born. Label-for is only interesting when
the actual text of the prompt is some distance from the INPUT element. That
happens, for example, in a table of INPUT elements, and then LABEL-for is
inadequate!

I know this has gotten far off the track of the original question but I
could no longer resist.

BTW, GWMicro uses Frames correctly. They are well "named" for both screen
readers and Lynx. If I were them, I would not have used the NOFRAME content,
but so be it.

Hello Al:

     Yes, I agree completely.  My screen reader and browser are fixed, so
this is why I emphasized that I did not want to generalize.  For my versions
of screen reader and browser, it appears the label in the example I gave
works.  As for other screen readers I can't say.
Even for other codings of the form, I can't say.  I never know what is a
safe
generalization.


An examnple that doesn't work for me
is on the wired article page from a previous message
(JFW 3.31 IE 5.0)

http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,44062,00.html>
I hear (skipping some links)
"Slash news slash image map link" then I tab and hear
"Edit"
then I tab and hear
"Combo box"
then I tab and hear
"Go button"

If I hit enter on the Combo box to go into forms mode,
then I hear
"Look for combo box Wired news"
(a pull down list)

I think the "Look for" is supposed to be associated with the edit field and
not the Combo box, right?
This had me confused for some time.
I'll try to find an example of what works.


Steve

Both good news and bad news are informative.  It would help to have
examples of
what works and also of what doesn't work.  You and David seem to believe
that
we still need explanatory text, or at least some text, in the edit boxes for
best practice at the moment.  This is an "until user agents" provision in
the
WCAG.  So for objectivity and consensus, it helps to know what the actual
user
agents do with actual pages.

To sell this to web authors as the general rule of what to do, it helps to
have
chapter and verse documentation explaining in what situations alternatives
don't work.  Target page, OS, Browser, Screen reader with versions.  It
helps.
