AG:: You are varying things usefully.

It's not clear what the empty LABEL tag proves, but at least it acts as one
would expect.  And the negative result for the unmarked label wannabe text is
dead on.

There is another case you could try.  Here we put more interference between
the
label and the edit field, without going to TABLE lengths:

<SPAN CLASS="example fragment">
 Please enter your
  <LABEL for="firstname">first name</LABEL>
 here:
  <INPUT type="text" id="firstname" tabindex="1">
</SPAN>

What does your setup tell you if you make that variation and tab to the edit
field?
