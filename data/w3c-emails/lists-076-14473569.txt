Hi Phill,

The LABEL construct is inadequate when the labeling text comes from two (or
more) places. The simplest example is when the form elements are in a table
and the headers are, in effect the labels. E.g.,
http://jimthatcher.com/simpleformwithtitles.htm.

I think the question of labeling input elements shouldn't be merged with
questions of making header information available for table cells. The use of
these is different by assistive technologies. Also the forms I have seen in
tables are not as simple as my example above.

You asked about multiple labels for one INPUT element. That is part of the
issue and it is forbidden by 4.01. Also you may want one label to contribute
to more than one input element; there's no way to even write that.

This is why I argue the title attribute on INPUT elements is a good,
practical and simple solution.

Jim, why do you say that label-for is inadequate when <labels with
label-for attribute> and <input with id attribute> fields are in seperate
table cells? Since the HTML uses an I D to explicitly associate both the
labeler and labelee, isn't it up to the assistive technology to worry about
the UI presentation?

I did have a question about multiple labels for one field, if that was
valid HTML - but according to HTM 4.01 [1], each LABEL element is
associated with exactly one form control. There is also the table heading
(TH) and the ability to have one header associated with multiple cells.

Regards,
Phill
