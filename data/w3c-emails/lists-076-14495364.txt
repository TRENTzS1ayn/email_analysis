I tried the variations suggested so far. I am using the most recent versions
of Window-Eyes, JFW and HPR.

ALL speak the prompt in ALL the cases that have been suggested. Actually HPR
seems to have a bug and likes to spell "name" - don't know why.

One sees the value of the LABEL attribute in the last case which AL
suggested, selecting out some text from the string that precedes the input
element. I cannot explain why Stephen couldn't get JFW to speak the prompt
in case 1.

I don't understand this testing. If you use label for= these AT's will pick
it up. If you put the prompt close to the input element (left or above for
text boxes) they will pick it up.

Here's the HTML (attached for Stephen and Al). of course 1 and 2 are
identical. First name is spoken when tabbing in all cases with all AT's that
I tried.
<FORM>
<P>Case 1</P>
<P>
First Name:
<Input type="text" size="20" id="FN" name="fn">
</P>
<P>Case 2</P>
<P>
First Name: <Input type="text" size="20" id="FN" name="fn">
</P>
<P>Case 3</P>
<P>
<label for="fn">First Name:</label>
<Input type="text" size="20" id="FN" name="fn">
</P>
<P>Case 4</P>
<P>
Please enter your <Label for="FN">
First Name</Label> in the text entry field below.<BR>
<Input type="text" size="20" id="FN" name="fn">
</P>
</Form>

Hi Al:


     I used the empty label tags
just to see if JFW was reading the for attribute text.

     Thanks for the variation.  Interesting,  I hear "first name edit".
So, it seems to read only text between the label tags.
Would this be a safe conclusion?

Steve

AG:: You are varying things usefully.

It's not clear what the empty LABEL tag proves, but at least it acts as one
would expect.  And the negative result for the unmarked label wannabe text
is
dead on.

There is another case you could try.  Here we put more interference between
the
label and the edit field, without going to TABLE lengths:

<SPAN CLASS="example fragment">
 Please enter your
  <LABEL for="firstname">first name</LABEL>
 here:
  <INPUT type="text" id="firstname" tabindex="1">
</SPAN>

What does your setup tell you if you make that variation and tab to the edit
field?
