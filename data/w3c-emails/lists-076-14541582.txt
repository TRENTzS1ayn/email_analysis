Although not perfect, one solution for the use of Title at this time is to
include the naming and additional information as part of the title tag.

For example if you have an edit box with a title of first name, the title
for the edit box might be first name: 20 characters max.  This assumes
that you want to inform all users of the max characters that can be
entered as the tool tip.
