Sorry for a slightly newbie question. On a program I'm building, we're using
the following format, putting the "submit" button inside a <noscript> tag to
hide it from all but non-Javascript users, for design reasons. Can anyone
tell me, does this interfere with the accessibility? Many thanks for word.

<form method="post" action="/cgi-bin/something.cgi">
   <select onchange="JavaScript_does_cgi's_thing_unless_scripting_off">
     <option value="none" selected="selected">Click below:</option>
     <option value="foo">Foo</option>
     <option value="bar">Bar</option>
  </select>
 <label accesskey="s"><NOSCRIPT><input type="submit" value="do
something"></NOSCRIPT></label>
</form>
