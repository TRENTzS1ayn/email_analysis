This should work. The standard problem of users with screenreaders who leave
javascript on being surprised the first few times they select something
(until they learn that there are two different ways to work with a list box
like this) will still happen.

  Sorry for a slightly newbie question. On a program I'm building, we're using
  the following format, putting the "submit" button inside a <noscript> tag to
  hide it from all but non-Javascript users, for design reasons. Can anyone
  tell me, does this interfere with the accessibility? Many thanks for word.

  <form method="post" action="/cgi-bin/something.cgi">
     <select onchange="JavaScript_does_cgi's_thing_unless_scripting_off">
       <option value="none" selected="selected">Click below:</option>
       <option value="foo">Foo</option>
       <option value="bar">Bar</option>
    </select>
   <label accesskey="s"><NOSCRIPT><input type="submit" value="do
  something"></NOSCRIPT></label>
  </form>
