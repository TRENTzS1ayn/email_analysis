These are not true for HTML 4 transitional.

Unfortunately these are true.  Assuming that you have a DOCTYPE and
a title element, the only validation error is the NOSCRIPT in a %inline
context.

There is no evidence that XHTML was intended.

SELECTED=SELECTED is perfectly valid HTML even if there may be some
broken browsers that don't accept it.  Putting just SELECTED doesn't 
omit the attribute, it is simply a shorthand for the full form.

If you want a neutral block element, you should use DIV, not P.
