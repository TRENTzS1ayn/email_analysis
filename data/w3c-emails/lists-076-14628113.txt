What you say is right. My poorly English was the cause about this point.
However, is it good if even a grammar is valid?
If it was HTML document, it's better to write it as SELECTED, not SELECTED=SELECTED.

To be sure, HTML tags and HEAD tags are omissible. However, BODY element and tags are not omissible. Therefore, that sample takes
out a part from some document. DOCTYPE and TITLE element should be written to the document source.
Generally -- if DOCTYPE is lost, it cannot be said that it's not valid or invalid, either.
I assumed that they were HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0.

Why?

Let me suppose a natural language before he does that sample to be markup...

I could suppose as below:

Do foo
Do bar
...

IMO, the text are markup as below:

<p>Do foo</p>
<p>Do bar</p>
<p>...</p>

Or,

<ul>
<li>Do foo</li>
<li>Do bar</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

However, that example uses SELECT element.
By using SELECT element, one of the choice which has more than one is taken out, and it becomes to a sentence. Therefore, P element
is more appropriate.

In short, <p><select>...</select></p>

Point out if I misunderstand some.
