BODY tags are not required, e.g. this is valid (against the HTML4.soc
catalog in nsgmls, i.e. HTML 4.0 transitional; you can include the full
system identifier with the same result):

   <!DOCTYPE HTML SYSTEM>
   <title></title>
   x

Because the whole purpose of DIV is to provide an element that is block

Sentences are inline constructs, not block constructs.  You were faking
a block context in order to get NOSCRIPT accepted but really wanted
an inline construct.
