I've had a similar experience in my Accessible Web Design online
class; for the first time ever (11 previous sessions of the class),
the class which just completed was -full to capacity- and we had
to shut down enrollment early.  In the past, only general interest
HWG classes like Javascript and HTML had that effect.

Many of the people taking the course were employees of federal
agencies, one in particular enrolled somewhere around 30 people.
508 is definitely a "big seller" and I'm rather pleased about that.

PS:  New course starts next Monday; there is still some space left in
      this class, if you sign up this weekend.
