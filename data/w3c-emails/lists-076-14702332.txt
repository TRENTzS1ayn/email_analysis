Hello,

Vision Australia Foundation has decided that it needs to prepare a set of
guidelines for internal use to help staff make Word documents more
accessible. MS has material to assist disabled users to use its Office
products, but I could not locate any guidleines for authors to ensure that
the documents, spreadsheets, etc were accessible in the first place. While
we could write them from scratch (and WCAG would form a good starting point
- thanks Charles), we figure that there
must be some material 'out there somewhere' that we could re-use.

Can anyone point me anywhere useful? Or has anyone done this for their
organisation?

Thanks,  Andrew
