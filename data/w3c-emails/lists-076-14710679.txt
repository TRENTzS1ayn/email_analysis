My NZ 2 cents worth

Using Word styles is important (I don't know how
screen readers use the styles, if at all) but in terms
of exporting a document to HTML they are important.
I found this article helpful 
http://officeupdate.microsoft.com/legal/styles.asp

Also
There is an assumption when using Word that everyone
has it (which is ok in an intranet type environment)
but if Word docs go outside the office it may be
useful to give people a link to the Word Viewer.
