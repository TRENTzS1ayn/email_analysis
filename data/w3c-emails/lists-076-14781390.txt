If we wanted to break deep links ourselves in order to keep them from being 
broken in the future when we changed content, then this seems valid.

You're talking about web designers who are either intently malicious, or 
lacking knowledge. We are a professional business who has no interest in 
attacking or tricking our users. So this doesn't seem a valid point to 
argue against using frames.

Isn't this the responsibility of Web TV? How long have frames been in the 
HTML specs? Should one poorly designed UA keep everyone else from using a 
specific technology?

Again, isn't this the responsibility of Lynx developers?

Yet most of these "first line" web sites never had frames to begin with. 
Search engines have no use for frames. Microsoft does use frames when 
necessary (ie. MSDN documentation libraries).

This I will agree with, and I am in the process of changing the content of 
our NOFRAMES tags. But at the same time, it seems like you're saying that 
since no one uses it correctly, it shouldn't be used at all.

I agree again. We are currently working on a solution for this. But I still 
haven't heard a convincing argument as to why frames should be avoided. You 
have good points, but I have a hard time subscribing to the theory that, 
just because something is mis-used, or mis-understood, that it is 
automatically labeled as bad.

We're a bit leery about using GIFs on a commercial website due to the 
Unisys flaky-ness. But I will look into decreasing the JPG sizes where 
appropriate.

Thanks for your opinions and discussion.
