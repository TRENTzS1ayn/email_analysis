Thanks for the explanation, Gregory.

Actually, I would like to clarify this. The fault clearly lies in the 
document, and let me explain why. AT vendors, such as ourselves, don't need 
write access to legacy documents; we just need read access. The problem is 
neither the author, nor Adobe, is giving it (read access) to us. Before 
Acrobat 5, you could lock or not lock (meaning that the user could not or 
could update content) your document structure. In Acrobat 5, a new security 
bit exists stating that the user can not update content, but they can 
access it (through an API such as MSAA). If the author of this document 
you're having problems with would open their PDF in Acrobat 5, set the 
security bit that allows access, and save the PDF, you'd be set. Due to the 
number of PDFs publicly available, however, this isn't a logical solution. 
We are working with (and pushing) Adobe to resolve the issue. In the 
meantime, contacting the author is a temporary work around (assuming that 
they are willing to work with you).

You are absolutely right. Users just want "it" to work...period. And that 
is what drives us. Thanks for your comments.
