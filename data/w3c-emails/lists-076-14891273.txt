As a user of a regular old graphical browser I find being forced to 
use a form to send email extremely annoying. My email is contained in 
my email application where I can search and store as I see fit. I can 
easily compose mail and save drafts or mail which needs further 
considering before sending.

If I'm forced to send mail via a form this "breaks" my system. I 
generally end up copying and pasting from the form to a regular 
message I send to myself, thus losing the sender and addressee info.

In addition, the space on a form is often pathetic, forcing me into 
annoying scrolling.

I also hate it when the feedback / email address is kept secret from 
me via a form.

I have absolutely no objection to websites which give me a choice 
between a form and a mailto link.



Cheers,

Miraz
