Hi Kynn
Yes I see it in Opera, under File, Preferences, Email
As for whether this is a real problem or a theoretical
one, I am not sure.
I personally find it annoying when my browser chooses
to launch an email client I don't use (I use web based
email), but alternatively in this response
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2001AprJun/0621.html
Miraz says she doesn't like form based 'email'.
But these are basically only annoyances that impact on
usability.

I have to make recommendations for the best way to get
site feedback in terms of accessibility, so I am on an
intelligence gathering exercise.

The way mailto links are implemented on most sites I
have seen does seem to be a breach of checkpoint 10.1
because they don't contain a warning that the current
window is about to change.

Cheers
Graham
