Well you make some excellent points about the usefulness of forms, 
but you can't disagree with my being annoyed and frustrated by them 
as that's my experience.

Perhaps form design could incorporate measures such as allowing me to 
send a copy of the email to my own address, and revealing the email 
address to which the form is being sent (or a sensible contact 
address for the organisation).

Forms could also be designed to have sensible sized text areas for 
extended feedback.



Cheers,

Miraz
