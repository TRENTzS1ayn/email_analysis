Hi,

I'm doing an accessibility review of a frames-based site (that is required 
to remain nameless) and have a couple of questions.

Question 1:
One of the 7 frames used on the main page uses an auto-refresh to present 
ads (these are hosted at another site). Some JAWS users have indicated that 
this is a significant barrier because each time the frame auto-refreshes 
they are dumped back to the start of the entire page. There doesn't appear 
to be a way for them to get beyond this point.

I'm trying to understand:
1. Why (when this seems like a really significant barrier) is it only 
Priority 2?
2. Are there any Priority 1 checkpoints that cover this problem?

Any suggestions for overcoming this problem while keeping the rotating ads 
are very welcome.

Question 2:
HTML technique 12.1 suggests that <A href="javascript:">...</A> is a 
dead-end link for user agents where scripts are not supported or not loaded. 
  I've noticed there's a bit of this in the site I'm reviewing, but this 
technique is only listed as being related to the Priority 2 checkpoint 6.5 
(ensure dynamic content is accessible).

I would've thought this technique also be related to the priority 1 
checkpoint 6.3 (Ensure pages are usable when scripts, applets or other 
programmatic objects are turned off or not supported)?

Is the occurrence of <A href="javascript:>...</A> only a Priority 2 issue or 
is there a Priority 1 checkpoing to cover this?

Thanks for any advice you can provide.
Regards,

Ruth Harris
