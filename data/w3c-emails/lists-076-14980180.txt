I also find form only systems annoying because:

- I'm forced to stay online all the time, potentially accumulating
phone charges and tending to produce a worse response because of the
haste induced;

- I don't get a copy to keep;

- the comment may have arisen in work time but I want to reply at home;

- with Lynx, I can include the contents of the page in question easily, but
in forms mode it is very difficult text only and even GUI it involves 
opening a new window and cutting and pasting piecemeal;

- forms often do not cover the cases that I'm interested in..

Although not actually a web feedback context, I've been particularly annoyed
recently by certain ISPs that have started only accepting HTTP form input
for spamming complaints.

Generally forcing form input tends to favour the business running the site,
note the user.

In the context of mailto: URLs, rather than feeback forms, I see this as
a user agent issue, not a content authoring issue.  Lynx, for instance, 
does integrate the email sending function (but a common request at one time
was to allow people to use their favourite email program instead).
