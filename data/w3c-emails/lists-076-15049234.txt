EOWG: The Education and Outreach Working Group (EOWG) of the Web
Accessibility Initiative (WAI) at the World Wide Web Consortiumm (W3C) is
holding a one-day meeting on Friday, 22 June, 2001, at Centrum voor
Wiskunde en Informatica (CWI) in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. 

The focus of the Friday meeting is to exchange information about promotion
and implementation of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG),
primarily among people currently active on Web accessibility in European
countries. We welcome people who are engaged in promoting implementation of
WCAG in Europe, but who are not currently involved in the EOWG, to join us
at this meeting.

A detailed agenda and registration (required for participants) is available
at: 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/2001/06/agenda
For your background the EOWG home page and charter are available:

If you have questions or are interested but unable to attend the upcoming
meeting, please let me know (jbrewer@w3.org), as we may have a follow-up
meeting on this topic elsewhere in Europe later this year.

AUWG and WCAG WG meetings: There are also meetings of the Authoring Tool
Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (18-19 June) and Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Working Group (20-22 June) earlier in the
week. The WCAG WG will be discussing a working draft of an advanced version
of WCAG, to which input is welcomed. Agenda pages and separate
registrations for these meetings are listed at the top of this message. For
those unable to participate at these upcoming meetings, but interested in
the work of these groups, please contact the chairs or staff contacts as
indicated on the working group home pages.
