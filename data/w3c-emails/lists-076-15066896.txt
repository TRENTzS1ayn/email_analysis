I agree with Miraz - If I cannot find an email address (If I really need to I may spend uop to half an hour poking around a site to find one!) or find a waty to send *myself* a copy from a web-based form, I either do not send a message, or do not buy the product, or whatever. It has to be really, really URGENT to get me to use a form in such a case.

If you're seeking the "best way to get feedback", a web form is not the way, in my opinion: you'll have people electing not to send any feedback, because the can't keep a record of what they're sending to whom.

The best alternative would probably be to provide both an email link and a form.

BTW, I also encode a page name for the subject in the email links for my sites: that way I'll know what people are actually commenting on - at least in most cases. That's somewhat harder to do if you have access to server-side programming, and impossible if you don't.
