I'm faced with my first occurrence of inserting a short movie clip (.mpg 
file) into a page.  I'm afraid I'm not 'getting' all that is being 
suggested in the standards.  In order for it to be accessible, what is 
appropriate markup?   Don't know if I need to include the plug-in or 
not,  - or, if I need to synchronize the full text, rather than include a 
unsynchronized summary.  The clip is a narration of a missile. The narrator 
is not seen.

Do I need synchronization in this case?  If so, how is that accomplished?

I have read section 9.0 on audio and video, but am unclear.  Do I include 
the Object tag only if I include plug-in? If anyone can suggest a site 
where I might glean this information in an easily digestible manner, I'd be 
grateful.
