Not really a proble if you know how to fool the scrapers.

They need a "text" email address in your page source) code. All you need to do is to URL-encode the email address (even partially: just encoding the '@' would already fool most crapers); most email clients (as opposed to scraping robots) have no problem with it. (Some links checkers do - ignore them.)

In fact, this is *so* easy (and well-published) I did not even think of mentioning it. Once your address has been scraped, it's precious little use "hiding" it though: it just gets passed around by spammers - on those fancy CD's you get al the spam about!
