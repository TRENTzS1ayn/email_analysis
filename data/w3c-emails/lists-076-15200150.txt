aloha david!

i nominate our old friends at www.sony.com -- the entire front page is
javascript driven, which means it doesn't exactly degrade gracefully if
support for javascript is turned off or unavailable...  lynx, for example,
renders what's actually inside the BODY -- absolutely nothing...  and, even
if you are using a javascript-capable browser and have support for scripting
turned on, unless you can perceive the screen, you're still up the
proverbial creek as far as obtaining any information from the site or
penetrating any deeper is concerned...  even the fallback of reading
document source breaks down -- unless you are adept at reading other
people's javascript...  and even if you can see the screen, what actual text
is generated by the javascript isn't scalable, as there's nothing to which
one could apply a client-side stylesheet...  a good deal of the content that
eventually gets served to a version 4 or greater generation browser isn't
actually text, but, rather, un-ALT-texted pictures of text, and i'd be
willing to wager that one can only "really" experience the site the way it
was meant to be experienced if one's screen resolution and video display
adapter match that on the machine the author used to construct the site...

all in all, i think i actually preferred www.sony.com when it's front page
consisted of nothing but un-ALT-texted graphical hyperlinks -- a situation
which was "corrected" for a time through the addition of null ALT text to
each graphical hyperlink!
