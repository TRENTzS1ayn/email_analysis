No.  HTML has always taken the position that it provides information,
but does not dictate how it is presented.  This does cause conflicts,
as most commercial site developers want the PDF model of controlled
presentation but little structure, but want to work with pre-installed
browsers.

In addition, the traditional tooltip model requires a 2D pointing
device.
