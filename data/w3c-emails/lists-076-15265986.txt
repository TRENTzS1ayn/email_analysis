I think the excuse is probably that well under 1% of authors will use
any of these, except possibly OPTGROUP, even if they did implement them.
TITLE is only used because people think it should be called TOOLTIP,
and, for those targetting NS4, ALT is the alias for TOOLTIP.

Even OPTGROUP may be too technical, especially once people have stock
Javascript for doing all their menus and selection lists.

Only authors explicitly writing for assistive technology are going to
use SCOPE, AXIS and SUMMARY, so there is a chicken and egg situation.
Under such conditions, commercial rules apply and no investment will be
made.
