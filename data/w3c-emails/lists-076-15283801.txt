     I would like some opinions / ideas about how to skip repetitve 
     links -- which are server-side includes.
     
     We have a framed web site.  At the bottom of every page in the 
     "main content" frame, we are using server side includes to include 
     a file of text links for navigational purposes.  We are using the 
     server-side includes to make maintenance more feasible.
     
     Since the links are at the bottom, we can't put a link to skip over 
     them.  Without having to change the layout of the page -- and put 
     the links at the top, does anyone have an idea of how we can make 
     it easy for a disabled person using a screen reader -- to skip 
     these links?  
     
     Regards,
