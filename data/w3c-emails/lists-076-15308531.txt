David,

I agree with Kynn's comments on Jim Thatcher's site, which has 
navigation in the final column of a layout table:

By putting the links at the end of the page rather than at the 
beginning, you have arguably provided a method for skipping them. 
Depending on the page itself, perhaps it would be useful to include a 
link just before the bottom navigation allowing visually impaired 
users to "skip bottom navigation - return to top of page", but that 
depends on the page itself and how you expect visitors to use it. 
(Actually, if you're talking about http://www.sti.nasa.gov/, I see 
that you've already got a "return to top of page" link right before 
the bottom nav.) If your pages contain "last updated" and "contact" 
information below the bottom navigation menu, you would probably want 
to provide users with a method for skipping the navigation and 
jumping straight to the "last updated" line. A skip-nav link right 
before the SSI would do it.

By the way, I don't see why the fact that these links are SSIs should 
make any difference to the user. It all comes out as HTML on the 
user's end anyway.
