     As I said in my initial message --  A screen-reader, such as 
     "JAWS", will read every line of every page, therefore, will read 
     these repetitive text links from every page -- at the bottom, 
     before going to the next page.

>Since the user cannot see the end of the page 
.they do not know the links are at the bottom. 
.Possibly an image with an alt="Page footer 
.begins" (a stretched color square to immitate a 
>horizonal rule) and an option of a link to the 
."top" or "back".
