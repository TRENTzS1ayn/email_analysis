I'm not sure I understand.  when I use jaws, if the linav links are at
the bottom of the page, I can just stop before I get there and go to the
next page.

     As I said in my initial message --  A screen-reader, such as
     "JAWS", will read every line of every page, therefore, will read
     these repetitive text links from every page -- at the bottom,
     before going to the next page.

.they do not know the links are at the bottom.
.Possibly an image with an alt="Page footer
.begins" (a stretched color square to immitate a
>horizonal rule) and an option of a link to the
."top" or "back".
