Hi, One technique that seems to be of interest to some is the use of
what are called "bread crumbs" on sites to assist users in tracking
where they have been and where they are going, more easily within the
site.

One site wants to implement this using the title tag but the info in the
title tag is not spoken while tabbing.  Are there any thoughts about:
1> "bread crumbs as a useful site navigation tool?"
2> how best to implement them for best access?

3> Any alternatives if more useful to achieve the same or a similar
purpose?

I do not have an url but there are labels such as sub section, level 1,
level 2, and so on with a nink name for each level.  It does not seem to
me that this is useful for persons with screen readers but might it help
others and if it can be useful for us, how can it be made
comprehensible?

Thanks!
