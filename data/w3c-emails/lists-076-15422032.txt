MSIE for the Mac: version 5: yes - use the Control key and the relevant key.

iCab (Mac) v2.5 (but also earlier versions): yes: Shift + key

Netscape Communicator 4.7 Mac: not as far as I can see after trying a 
bunch of modifier keys

Opera 5.b1.xxx Mac: beta software and not complete. I can't find any 
triggers for using access keys.



Cheers,

Miraz
