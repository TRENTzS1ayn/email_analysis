I am just looking for some clarification on an article
on Microsoft's site about IE6 and CSS, url

http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/css/overview/CSSEnhancements.asp

under the heading 'Fix the Box Instead of Thinking
Outside It', is the following statement :-

'This section describes the way Internet Explorer 6
Public Preview or later versions calculate the width
and height properties of an element when you use the
!DOCTYPE declaration to switch on standards-compliant
mode'

My questions is as follows :-

1. Does this statement imply that identical code will
behave differently on IE6, depending on the existence
or otherwise of the Document Type Definition?

Clearly I can test this but at this stage don't have a
spare machine to install IE6 on.

Cheers
Graham Oliver
