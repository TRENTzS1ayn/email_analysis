However, one should note that IE 4+ and NS 6 have a better way of
doing this which degrades cleanly:  you can set the image for real list
bullets using CSS2.  (I think NS4 on Windows half implements this and
will honour alternative stock choices (disc, circle, etc.), but not
images.  Unfortunately most designers have stereotyped code for these
UL simulations, so probably don't realise there has been an alternative
for several years.

I'm not completely sure that NS4 doesn't do it with images; NS4
incorrectly interprets relative URLs in style sheets which can break
style images.
