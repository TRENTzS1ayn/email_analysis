NOSCRIPT is not permitted in the HEAD element.

A NOSCRIPT element (i.e. <NOSCRIPT>contents</NOSCRIPT>) contains whatever
HTML you want rendered when scripting is unavailable or disabled.  Typically
it will go round navigation links.  On a basically non-accessible page, it
may go round a message explaining that the page is non-accessible.
