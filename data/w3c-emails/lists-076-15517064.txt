Joy,

Most users prefer to know what the link is doing or where the link is 
going. Having a link that describes the image doesn't help them in terms of 
understanding what is going to happen when the link is activated. 
Window-Eyes users can read the status line to get the URL while the 
link/image is focused (assuming JavaScript isn't changing the status line), 
so that's a work-around. But the ALT tag should describe the action.
