I believe that the important information to convey is the function of the
link.  Whatever Adobe's logo happens to be in this case isn't nearly as
important as what the link will accomplish for me if I follow it.

I don't know that it is a hard and fast rule but more often than not I've
found that emphasizing the function of the image as opposed to a full
description for alt text is what works best.
