I suggest you use the HPR mailing list for the question you are asking about
HPR. You subscribe to the list by sending a note to requests@talklist.com,
and the body of the note should say "subscribe ibm-hpr yourName"  without
any quotes and filling in yourname. Once you have done that you can send a
note to ibm-hpr@talklist.com with your question.

Subject: Java applets and Screen Readers


I created a page to see how screen readers work with alternative text in a
Java applet (www.webaim.org/tutorials/uofa/java/news_good.htm).

When I tested the page using JAWS 3.5, the JAWS read the content I added
within the applet tags.

When I tested the page using Homepage Reader 3.0, HPR read the alt tag of
the opening <applet> tag and skipped the content I had added to the applet.

Is there a setting in HPR which tells it to read the content between the
applet tags?

Is my mark-up correct for the applet tag?

Thanks,
