Amy,

The file system of the computer where the PDF files are served from allows
blanks in file names.  You can't just change blanks to underscores and have
the
URLs point to the right files.

In places where URLs may not contain blanks, such as in the HTTP request a
browser sends to her server, the blanks in the file names must be URL-encoded
as aaa%20bbb%20ccc.pdf, not aaa_bbb_ccc.pdf.

You should make this substitution (use the %nn encoding) where the URLs appear
in the href attribute of your link elements.

Al

PS:  If you do a Google search for "blanks in URLs" you will find a few pages
which explain this, but I didn't find one that I consider a proper FAQ or
tutorial on the subject.  Does anyone know of a good FAQ writeup for this
point?  It's surely a FAQ.
