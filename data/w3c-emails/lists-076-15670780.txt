personally i have not yet found a better method than extracting the text
manually and putting it into properly hand-coded html.  i make the original
ppt file available for downloading, but since not everybody uses / can
afford / wants a bloatware product like ppt, and because 'save as webpage'
turns what is mainly text into inaccessible graphics, i always produce a
clean html version of it manually.
