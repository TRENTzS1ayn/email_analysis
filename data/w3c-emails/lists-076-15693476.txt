John Gunderson gave a great presentation at CSUN
(http://www.csun.edu/cod/conf2001/proceedings/0095gunderson.html)
on a tool he has developed for converting PowerPoint to html. This would be
another way to have accessible PowerPoint.

The tool is available at http://www.rehab.uiuc.edu/ppt/. Here's what he says
there.

This Power Point Accessibility Wizard offers an alternative to PowerPoint's
Web publishing feature. The standard Power Point Web Publishing option
creates XML based web content that can only be used by Microsoft Internet
Explorer. Even if non-XML options are selected, users cannot easily add
information that is required for accessibility. This Power Point
Accessibility Wizard simplifies the task of converting PowerPoint
presentations to text pure HTML through an easy- to-use user interface, and
automates much of the conversion of Power Point Presentations to an HTML
format that includes required accessibility information.

personally i have not yet found a better method than extracting the text
manually and putting it into properly hand-coded html.  i make the original
ppt file available for downloading, but since not everybody uses / can
afford / wants a bloatware product like ppt, and because 'save as webpage'
turns what is mainly text into inaccessible graphics, i always produce a
clean html version of it manually.
