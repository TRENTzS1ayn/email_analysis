I agree with the evaluation provided by Mike below.  My $0.02:

I have downloaded and looked at this browser.  It works but it follows some
assumptions about how a totally blind or low vision person may use the browser to
navigate.  It does use only keyboard for navigation but I think it verbalizes too much

and you quickly get lost as to where you are.  I have not fully utilized all of its
features but it is a pretty simple browser but it can be a useful tool.

I don't think a totally blind person can use it without a screen reader.  For those
with low vision like myself, I found it hard to navigate because I could not
differentiate between a link and text information.  The only way to do this was to use
the page map feature which gives a link list by number and text of the link.

Regards,

Darryl
