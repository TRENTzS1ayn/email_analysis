Not  quite the same thing, but you might also want to note that anyone
with proper configuration access to a web server can make it serve up
variants of pages in the user's preferred language, so you might want
to consider:

- encouraging Maori readers to include mi in their browser language
  preferences - it will probably have to be first choice for real 
  effect;

- providing Google with a Maori translation of their search engine pages
  (I seem to remember that they take translations from volunteers, although
  they might need to get someone to independently vet the contents).

(There is a down side to language negotiation in that it tends to defeat
caching; it is probably best only to negotiate the home page and to
negotiate a redirection, rather than the actual content.  Please redirect
with HTTP not Refresh or Javascript hacks!)
