Hi All,

Marjolein's queston reminds me of a good idea a corporate
type once asked me.  Why isn't there a real-time screen reader
emulator site?  That is, a site like Bobby wherein one could
enter a URI and hear how it would sound through one or more screen
readers with typical settings.  The learning curve of screen
readers is holding back accessible web design.
