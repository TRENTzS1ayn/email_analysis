Yes, I agree. While most screen reader programs have (free, session-time limited) versions you can use for testing, it's a steep learning curve. (And the reboot time to contuinue doesn't help if you can't afford the expense of the full package.)

A determined developer can maybe learn one - but testing with all (even the most-used) is just not feasible, unless you're a large company with a testlab and a dedicated person (wo)manning the lab.

Of course that makes a list such as this valuable - but then the question becomes: how many developers know about already, and how many would come here to ask questions?
