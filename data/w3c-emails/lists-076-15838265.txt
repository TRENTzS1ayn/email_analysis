and the screen readers are constantly changing.  There are reviews of
screen readers out there from afb and acb radio and others.  Perhaps it
might help to gather those resources together in a web page and keep it
up to date if it has not been done already.

Yes, I agree. While most screen reader programs have (free, session-time
limited) versions you can use for testing, it's a steep learning curve.
(And the reboot time to contuinue doesn't help if you can't afford the
expense of the full package.)

A determined developer can maybe learn one - but testing with all (even
the most-used) is just not feasible, unless you're a large company with
a testlab and a dedicated person (wo)manning the lab.

Of course that makes a list such as this valuable - but then the
question becomes: how many developers know about already, and how many
would come here to ask questions?
