This raises a sticky issue for designers. What screen reader do you design
for, and is there a lowest reasonable level of screen reader functionality
you can expect you user to have?

It seems that most designers now accept that it is reasonable to expect
sighted users to have at least version 4 of Internet Explorer or Netscape
and at least 800 by 600 screen resolution. Is there some lowest level of
screen reader capability that is reasonable to expect and, if so, is there
an actual make and version of screen reader that encapsulates this level?

Also, are there any statistics available, or even best guesses, about the
proportion of users who have each make and version of screen reader?

Thanks,

Mark Magennis
