800x600 screen resolution is not an acceptable minimum for people who are
using magnified screens - they effectively have much lower resolution (4x
magnification means that a 1024x768 screen only gives 256x192, for example).
Many people seem prepared to accept that they are inaccessible to some
portion of the community, but this does not sit well with the goal of Web
Accessibility...

The principle behind the WCAG (and the work at W3C in general) is that you do
not design to a piece of software, you design to a specification, same as the
software vendors do. Then it doesn't matter which tool people choose to use.
For example, I use iCab and Amaya as browsers - iCab has the best HTML
support I have found in any browser, and does things I find particularly
useful like easy zooming and reading the text out loud. I find it
particularly unreasonable to expect people to have either Netscape or
Explorer (even adding Opera, Home Page Reader, iCab, EAID and Lynx to the
list doesn't cut it, although it shows that the complexity of designing to
software is not scalable)

In the case of people with disabilities there are very many specialised tools
that are a small proportion of the total use, but are critical for the
particular users.

Even the best guesses that try to establish facts about particular software
are fairly unreliable I suspect. The kind of rigorous survey that would need
to be done is very rarely undertaken at all, let alone in this field.

  It seems that most designers now accept that it is reasonable to expect
  sighted users to have at least version 4 of Internet Explorer or Netscape
  and at least 800 by 600 screen resolution. Is there some lowest level of
  screen reader capability that is reasonable to expect and, if so, is there
  an actual make and version of screen reader that encapsulates this level?

  Also, are there any statistics available, or even best guesses, about the
  proportion of users who have each make and version of screen reader?
