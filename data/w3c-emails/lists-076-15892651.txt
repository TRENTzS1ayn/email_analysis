we may as well stop this before it gets realy bogged down.  The
assumption of functionality to expect from a screen reader is going at
it from the rong direction.  The question is actually, how can a site
bedesigned or delivered such that it does not matterly as nearly as
possible what you use but that it is accessible as nearly as possible.
this is why wcag came into being and on the other sides of the issue, we
have the user agent accessibility guidelines and the authoring tool
accessibility guidelines and some other tools that are available or will
soon be available.  Other problems with the email below are addressed
here as well.  I would not make a claim that a 4x browser and an 800x600
screen resolution are reasonable targets but again, this is addressed
above.

Subject: RE: What would a screen reader make of this?


This raises a sticky issue for designers. What screen reader do you
design
for, and is there a lowest reasonable level of screen reader
functionality
you can expect you user to have?

It seems that most designers now accept that it is reasonable to expect
sighted users to have at least version 4 of Internet Explorer or
Netscape
and at least 800 by 600 screen resolution. Is there some lowest level of
screen reader capability that is reasonable to expect and, if so, is
there
an actual make and version of screen reader that encapsulates this
level?

Also, are there any statistics available, or even best guesses, about
the
proportion of users who have each make and version of screen reader?

Thanks,
