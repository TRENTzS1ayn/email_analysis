If it really had a Re: in it, I didn't get it.  Scott Lubow's original
has an extremely bloated public key signature, questionably marked as
an attachment with a file name to which to save it, but doesn't differ
in that respect from earlier ones of his.  The email structure is valid,
but I don't know if the PKCS structure is valid.

Freezing Outlook is potentially serious, as it could indicate a buffer
o v e r r u n   s e c u r i t y    h o l e.
