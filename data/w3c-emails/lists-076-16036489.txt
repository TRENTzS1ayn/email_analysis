You are correct that it is not required by the standards to have an e-mail
address (on your website) to specifically address accessibility issues.  The
Department of Justice, in their Section 508 Self-Evaluation asked the
following question:

9. Has your agency designated and advertised an e-mail address to allow
people with disabilities to inform you of accessibility problems encountered
on your web site?

See http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/508/agency_questionnaire.htm (requires an
underscore between "agency" and "questionnaire").

Although agencies are not required to designate and advertise an e-mail
address to allow people with disabilities to inform the agency of
accessibility problems encountered on a web site - it is a good idea to do
so.

I've heard that you are not in compliance with Section 508 unless you
have an email address to specifically address accessibility issues.  I
do not remember reading this as part of the standards.  Is this a true
statement?
Thanks in advance
