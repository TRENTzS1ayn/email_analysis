It *is* expensive for those who are not a company and cannot afford to pay *anyone*! I'm not talking about companies - I'm talking about private people who just provide information and want to take care it's accessible - and *cannot* afford such services (however much they would like to).

I assure you *I* could not afford to pay someone to do any testing for http://hshelp.com - just the (subsisidized) cost of the hosting is all I can afford out of my own pocket.

There are tons of sites out there that provide valuable information - made by private people in their own time, at their own cost.  "Developers' programming rates" don't apply. People who just provide information as a free service are generally not paid for it, use free hosting or pay for hosting out of their own pocket, and cannot afford to pay anyone to to anything.

It is for me. And for many others who just want to provide information for everyone interested. Sorry, you don't succeed in dispelling that notion - it's too expensive for many people. Try thinking as a person, instead of as a company.

Most sites are not commercial.

OK, so how do the non-commercial information providers find out about that?
You now told me, and this list - but how many people will find this list or the HWG site?

Sure - but that's not what my argument is about.

Sigh - yes they are different - and that's what my whole argument *is* about!
