Well, this points out a serious problem for the web regardless of
accessibility -- this is why the web has a tendency to suck.  I think
we need to be promoting user testing with actual representative
users very strongly, both for accessibility's sake and for the sake
of general usability.

How about (RIP Len) WAVE?  How about IBM Home Page Reader?  Both of
these I recommend as excellent tools for sighted folks to spot web
accessibility problems which could hamper screen reader users, but
of course they will be limited.

I don't know why you would need a "screen reader simulation" when you
could instead just run a "a screen reader".  Both will give you about
the same results (and as I argued before, those results will be
inadequate compared to user testing).
