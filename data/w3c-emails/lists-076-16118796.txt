Hi, yes there are a few bits and pieces. First, there is a PICS scheme for
identifying WCAG conformance of pages dating back to June 1999 -
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999AprJun/0161.html

There is the EARL project, which aims to use metadata to provide detailed
information about accessibilty assessments - http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl

There is the RDF-based text-only SVG viewer - http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/ASVG
which builds on some work in chapter 5 of the "Accessibiltiy Features in SVG"
Note - http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG-access

Brian Kelly of JISC in the UK has also done some work on this topic...

From time to time I talk about the topic - an example of some simple slides
is at http://www.w3.org/2001/Talks/0506-semwai/slide1-0 but that misses the
bits that I explained during the talk...

cheers

  Hello

  A colleague of mine has asked if there is any information on metadata and
  accessibility.  I've not really come across anything about this - can anyone
  help?

  Thanks very much
