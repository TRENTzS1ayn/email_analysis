Hiya.

I have to say I think there is value in a screen reader simulation -- 
but I think it is most effective early in the accessible design 
learning curve, when a designer says "What does this thing look and 
sound like? I can't even imagine it." I use simulations and examples 
where it's helpful -- we all have.

For that, there is at least one simulation at 
http://www.websavvy-access.org/resources/formexample.shtml

To really get to know the software takes using it and Home Page 
Reader is a reasonably-priced option for that.

To really get to know the user experience takes watching the user. 
Sitting with someone who has to use a screen reader to be able to 
function with a computer will reveal surprising hiccups and a lot of 
insight. And that is the sort of learning that will help the most 
with applying accessible design to web sites.

Now I'm going off to follow Al's leads.
