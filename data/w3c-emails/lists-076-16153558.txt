These are actually the people most likely to produce intrinsically
accessible sites, although many emulate the commercial sites, with
all their defects.  (The really cleanest sites tend to be written by
academics who are veterans of the web.)

However, there are also the public institution sites and charities with
only the most marginal justification for their web site, and there
are individuals in commercial web site development teams who may try
to make sure that their part of the product is accessible, within the
contraints that they are subservient to marketing dictates and can't
extend timescales.  They certainly can't demand paid for resources to
meet an accessibility requirement that is very unlikely to exist in
the marketing brief.

These are the sites that I always seek out, but it is difficult to find
them because they don't have the resources to promote their sites, so one
has to trawl through dozens of pages of commercial site hits from search
engines, if there is any overlap with a commercial subject.  They
are also not the most visited sites; from what I've seen, a few major
commercial portals account for most web traffic, followed by commercial
selling sites and software support sites in some order.  They are the
real *web* sites, with most links outwards.
