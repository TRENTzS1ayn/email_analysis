In contrast to your evaluation, Kynn, I think the CNN article was unusually
well written, stressing a very important aspect of the Section 508
legislation, namely the effect it has on companies in general, not just on
their sales to the government.

The phrase "so called Section 508" is appropriate in such an article - It is
indeed a strange name for a law.

I am hardly an apologist for the press or CNN in particular. I am, however,
an apologist for Federal workers that have put 508 on the books and have
drafted the standards that are the foundation for Section 508 accessibility.
A very small band of these dedicated Federal employees work tirelessly to
support Section 508. They deserve our public praise and admiration.

That article is entertaining primarily for the "count the inaccuracies"
fun!  Web accessibility may be mainstream, but the CNN reporter sure
didn't understand a lot.

I especially like the "so-called Section 508" phrase.  Hee.

Good quotes by Mike Paciello, though.
