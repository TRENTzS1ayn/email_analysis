The SALT Partnership (Specifications for Accessible Learning Technologies) is working on extending the IMS specifications to handle accessibility needs. Metadata is one of the specifications we are examining right now. We are looking for ways to code information about the accessibility of instructional materials so that they can be delivered to users with disabilities in the most appropriate way, based on a profile of the user's needs.

Our Working Group includes some folks from the Open University. Martyn Cooper and Chetz Collwell of the PEARL Project are contributing their efforts to design an XML-based user profile/interface to our specifications work.

A project description for SALT is at:

The IMS Accessibility Working Group web page doesn't have much on it as we have just gotten started, but it is at:
http://www.imsglobal.org/accessibilityteam.html

The PEARL Project is at:

I hope this information is useful to your colleague.

Hello 

A colleague of mine has asked if there is any information on metadata and
accessibility.  I've not really come across anything about this - can anyone
help?

Thanks very much
