We so often focus on the benefits we are trying to attain for our 
friends/clients that we don't sufficiently trumpet the benefits to us all 
when empowerment through inclusion extends to those previously thought to 
be somehow "inferior".

"How it will be" is that we (all of society) will be far the richer 
therefor. I eagerly await the insights that have heretofore gone 
un-communicated because of our attitudes which still preclude inclusion of 
so many people.
