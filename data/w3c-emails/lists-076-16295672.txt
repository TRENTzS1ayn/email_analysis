Actually this is a big deal.  Depending on the punctuation setting you
have, the screen reader may not say anything for these punctuation
characters.

If you are using these on links, there's a way to get JAWS to read the
title text in some navigation modes.  If they are on input elements,
Window-Eyes will read the title text.

However with the current state of assistive technology, I believe the
solution that's going to give you the widest support from many different
products is to either use more descriptive text in the first place, or
turn the controls into images and then use the expanded text (next page)
as the alt tag.

Now this might not be a big deal if vision-impaired users are already accustomed to hearing "greater than" and knowing that it means "go to the previous page". Does anyone know if this is the case?
