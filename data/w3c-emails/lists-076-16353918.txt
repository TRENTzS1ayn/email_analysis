I believe it does behave the same way.

Actually, our developers also tested with the numerical
characters. Here is an excerpt from one of their emails to me:

It looks like using "&#139;", "&#171;", etc. instead of "<", "<<"
would give us a better screen reading using JAWS. 
It reads "&171;" and "&187;" as double left and right bracket respectively.
However, it does not recognize "&#139;" and "&#155;".

Does it behave the same if you use &gt and &lt vice the actual characters <
and >?
