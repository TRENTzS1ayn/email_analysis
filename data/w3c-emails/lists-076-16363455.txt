Hi all:

I'm attempting to figure out how to deal with making a database-driven web site accessible.  It houses scientific e-journals and this is far more challenging than the previous HTML site that I worked on before.

The site (http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov) includes new journal articles as well as an archive of previous issues.  There is an HTML abstract, a full text-version and a PDF version.  However, my thinking is that the images may lack the information a visually-impaired person may need to interpret the data.  Examples of a full text article is available at http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/b.cgi?artid=19905.  While the descriptions, or rather captions, of the images seem to be appropriate, is it safe to assume that a user should email the author of the article for further information.  PubMed Central acts as the holder and not the editor of the documents.  

I also believe that the footnotes and figure references within the article's text will need better descriptive links, i.e. link "fig. 2A" should actually read as "fig. 2A" to accommodate a user who is just listening to the links.  

Sorry, to be so longwinded. Any suggestions or insight will be most appreciated.
