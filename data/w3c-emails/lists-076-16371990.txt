This is pretty important, especially for people looking for the "what-to" of
508 (e.g., SOW foundations)--the Access Board is providing insight into what
they meant by compliance when they wrote the rules.

Subject: Access Board Update: Guidance Materials Issued on 508 Standards
for IT Access


Board Issues New Guidance Material on Section 508 Standards for Federal
Electronic and Information Technology

Accessibility requirements for electronic and information technology in the
Federal sector will soon take effect under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation
Act. This law requires that such technology be accessible according to
standards issued by the Access Board last December.  Access is covered for a
variety of products, including computer hardware and software, websites,
phone systems, fax machines, copiers, and similar technologies. Provisions
in the standards spell out what makes these products accessible to people
with disabilities, including those with vision, hearing, and mobility
impairments. 

The Board is preparing guidance material to help Federal agencies understand
their responsibilities under the law and to follow the standards.  This
material and additional information on Section 508 is available on the
Board's website at http://www.access-board.gov/508.htm and
http://www.access-board.gov/news/508.htm.  These pages include links to
other key sources of information.

Section 508 relies strongly on the procurement process to ensure compliance
with the new standards. In April, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council
issued a rule that effectively folded the standards into the regulations
that govern Federal procurement. The updated regulation, which takes effect
June 25, 2001, will help Federal agencies comply with the law. 

Questions on the 508 standards can be directed to the Board at
508@access-board.gov.
