These are both illegal in HTML.  &#127; through &#159; are all illegal.

They result from poor authoring tools which assume that the reference
character set for HTML is Microsoft CP-1252, when it is actually
Unicode (or its ISO 8859/1 subset, in earlier versions), with the C1
control set excluded.

The correct HTML code for CP 1252 code point 139 is &#x2039; and
the correct HTML code for CP 1252 code point 155 is &#x203A;.  These
are SINGLE RIGHT/LEFT-POINTING ANGLE QUOTATION MARKs, but I doubt if
the screen readers would know this.  There are proper arrow characters
but they are all presentational.
