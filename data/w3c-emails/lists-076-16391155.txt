There's actually another good reason to use some sort of explicit text,
although I haven't tested this with the presence of title tags.  But
people using voice input to browse would certainly need text to be able to
say the name of the item they wanted to click.  As I say I haven't tested
voice input browsing in a bit so don't know if programs would act on the
text in the title tag or not.
