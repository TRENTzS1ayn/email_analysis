you have to use &lt; rather than trying to put an actual character in for "<"
(this is only relevant to people who code by hand - tools do this
automatically and you don't need to worry). The point is that what you
provide for the end user should be real text, perhaps associated with a
graphic icon. Using characters to construct graphics (sometime called ASCII
art) is often very difficult for screenreaders and braille readers in
particular, and is not recommended in the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines - see checkpoint 1.1 of the guidelines
http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/wai-pageauth.html#tech-text-equivalent
for details

  Does it behave the same if you use &gt and &lt vice the actual characters <
  and >?
