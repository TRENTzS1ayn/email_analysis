From: ?Kurt Sahl sahlk@U.WASHINGTON.EDU

Anyone with an awareness of what "access" truly means might
want to look at the DO-IT Web site (Disabilities, Opportunities,
Internetworking, and Technology) at the University of Washington:

?http://www.washington.edu/doit/Resources/web-design.html

Web-based designers who access this information are likely to discover
a substantial amount about creating sites that are less exclusive.
