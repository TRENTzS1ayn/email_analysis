They should hire testers.

    Hi all --

I have been contacted by personnel from Yahoo to give input on how to
make
their web site and services more "user friendly" for all persons, but
especially for persons with disabilities.

If you have any input, or suggestions/requests, please pass them on to
me
ASAP.

I will be demonstrating how their web site impacts on persons who use
screen
review programs.

I am hopeful that our input will help make a difference.

Barbara Rhodes
