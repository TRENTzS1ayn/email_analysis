Graham -

I'm glad you started this thread, because this is an area that needs
renewed attention.   Both collaborative and online learning environments
are strategic areas that have poor records with respect to accessibility.
Collaborative products fall into two categories, synchronous (real-time)
and asynchronous (anytime), and present issues due to the human-human
communication they enable that are distinct from the [individual]
human-computer interface that has dominated the attention of the assistive
technology community to date.   Online learning environments also pose
issues due to many of the most educationally (pedagogically) sound products
being based almost exclusively on visual reinforcement.  Fortunately, the
work on multiple-intelligences (Howard Gardner and others) and learning
preferences (such as the Auditory/Visual/Kinesthetic models of Dawna
Markova) will be a primary driver leading to multimodal learning
environments.

Within the next few weeks, I plan to update portions of my website related
to the accessibility of both collaborative and online learning, and will
post another response once these updates are complete.   In the meantime,
I've provided a link to the paper that Susan Turnbull and I presented at
CSUN 2000, and a link to a paper commissioned by the Knowledge Management
Working Group (which reports to the CIO Council within the U.S. federal
government).

I am looking for existing web based discussion forums
(not mailing lists such as this one) used by people
with disabilities.
Any ideas?

TIA
