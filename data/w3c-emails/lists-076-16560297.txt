Hello Brooke,

Screen readers have facilities for reading down to the individual
character at a time if the user so chooses.  Whether the user knows what
the citation means is more a reflection of the familiarity with citation
format.  I would strongly suggest that you not change from standard format
because as an example then if I base my knowledge of proper format on your
site, I'm going to be wrong if I use it someplace else.

Does the actual citation on your page have alt text or something so the
user doesn't get the .gif which is included in your example?

The audience for the site (http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov) is mainly the scientific community.  Any ideas/suggestions?
