You don't have to install Flash support in the first place; I don't have
it on my IE 5.

This is something of a user agent issue, as the protocols provide for
signalling formats that the user can support, but browser developers are
more interested in providing a standard platform for authors, which
conflicts with the user centred model that underlies the web, but
aligns well with their commercial interests (they don't make much money
from users).
