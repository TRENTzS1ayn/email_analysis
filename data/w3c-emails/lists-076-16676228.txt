By images with no ALT text whatsoever do you mean it just says "IMAGE"
or the like?

I don't think it's simply a case of "getting Bobby approval"; I think
that in theory a screenreader should allow some method for skipping
the image if it's considered null content by the author.  I believe
the easiest way to do that currently is to use alt=" " (that's alt
equals quote space quote) or alt="" (alt equals quote quote).  In
my opinion, both of those should give the same results, which means
that -- apparently -- some screenreaders are broken according to
my definition of what "should work."

Well, you could make a chart of all the different screenreaders, ask
the user which one they're using, and deliver up a custom interface
which Does The Right Thing for that screenreader.  (I'm not joking
here!  This is what Reef EveryWare nee Edapta is all about.)

It's important to note that ALT text is used not only by people who
can't see, but also by people who use non-graphical browsers (such
as Lynx) or who surf with images turned off.  "Bullet" tends to be a
rather icky choice of ALT text for those users.
