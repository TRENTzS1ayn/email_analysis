Hi,

Bobby is one of the (now multiple) accessibility evaluation tools.

It was perhaps the first, and when it came out it checke a few simple things,
and if your site passed those tests it said you might like to put a "bobby
approved" icon on your pages.

More recent versions provide more testing, and also ask you to perform a
number of manual tests before saying anything is "Bobby approved". If the
manual testing has been done properly (unfortunately it isn't always) and if
the Bobby automatic tests have not been tricked (they can be), then
effectively Bobby tests for level-A conformance to the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines - i.e. it should be possible for anyone to use your
content, although it may still be very difficult.

Bobby has a version available on the web, where you can give it a single
page's URI and it will do a Bobby test, as well as being available as a
download for checking whole sites locally (for example before publishing).

Bobby is developed by an organisation called CAST, and more information about
the product is available at the Bobby website http://www.cast.org/bobby

There are a number of similar products now. Some include different kinds of
tests, some incorporate repair functions, some integrate with existing
authoring tools, some work in different languages such as french, spanish and
japanese, some are free and some must be paid for.

There is information about a range of tools on the "evaluation and repair
tools" page at W3C - http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/existingtools
