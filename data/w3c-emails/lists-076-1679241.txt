Have you increased the default font size in your browser?

Alt text really is not -supposed- to pop up.  Titles, perhaps, should
pop up.

Are you sure that your browser supports "popping up of titles" as
you wish it to do?

Maybe you're using the wrong tools, then?  It sounds like your browser
may not be providing you with access to the accessibility-related
information.

>This is beyond me. What do you all think. Would you consider this site accessible?

I didn't look at the site; I've only read what you've written here.  That
said, I think we need to be a little more clear on something.  "Accessible"
is neither a term that can be used without reference to specific audiences,
nor a binary term when used alone.

In other words, something is not "accessible" or "inaccessible" in a
vacuum.  Accessibility is a continuum -- and accessibility needs to
refer to the human element.  Accessible to whom?  _More_ accessible
to whom?

On nearly any site, you can find something that someone may consider
inaccessible -- even if you follow all of the W3C's guidelines.  This
is because there is no such thing as perfect accessibility (or perfect
inaccessibility).
