[DJW:]  This is real text, not the usual image trick.
There are no absolute font sizes, so selecting a large font
in the browser gets rid of most of the problems.  Moreover 
the layout doesn't break down if you disable font sizes 
altogether whilst using a large size.  (One exception is
the "click on the map message", but I didn't see that until
I'd already tried.)

I'd say there was no problem from a font size point of 
view.

Colour contrasts are good.

Bad points are:

It's not valid HTML, but the number of errors is small by
typical web standards.

Non-standard link colours in the side bar

No underline on links on side bar, or list of dates.

No title on image map (the job of title is done by javascript
manipulation of the status line - I disable javascript).
It still tool tips on IE.

Flat HTML.  Everything seems to be done with DIV and SPAN,
which should be last resorts  (in my view, sidebars are lists
and should be done with LI).

The reading order puts the menus before the main text.

Distracting flashing number on map.

I didn't spot the "click for details", but that should not be
necessary, and you should never say "click".  It's an 
inappropriate fix for removing the underline from the link,
thus hiding the fact that it is a link.

Compared with most sites, it looks good to me.
