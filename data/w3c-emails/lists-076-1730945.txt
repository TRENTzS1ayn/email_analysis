Kynn,

If I am perceiving the intent of your response incorrectly please let me 
know. But I just can't let this go. I have been working with people with 
disabilities since 1986. I started out doing basic computer training and 
eventually found myself working with people with assistive technology. In 
1995 I worked very hard to make one of the first "accessible" sites when 
there were no guidelines, no support and very little help and have made it 
my life's work.

In the beginning, I reached out through online groups and finally found 
some of the few souls who were trail blazing who helped me in my quest. 
Among them was Curtis Chong who was always gracious as well as technically 
knowledgeable.

When I read your message to this list I was taken aback. You ripped apart 
my comments without even looking at the page that I was struggling with, 
which I found surprising. You assumed that I wouldn't know the basics, such 
as changing the default font size on my browser and on.

Then you suggest I am using the wrong tools, without even telling me why or 
suggesting what tools may assist me.

I understand that you are internationally known as an expert in this field 
and I applaud your work. But I don't believe that this sort of response 
encourages or assists those of us who are reaching out. If this list is the 
wrong venue for this assistance, please let me know.

Thank you David Poehlman, Dave  J Woolley and Steven McCaffrey for your 
comments. This was the level of feedback I needed and will be of assistance 
to me when I discuss why this page will be useful to visitors, the majority 
of whom will be people with disabilities with my client.
