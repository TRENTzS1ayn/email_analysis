Hi. I think your best bet is to look at the archives - the same kind of
problem has been discussed (in terms of policy - the technical details were
different) recently in the thread that starts at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2000JulSep/0039

The basic idea is that there are existing requirements for accessiblity that
have nothing to do with the web, so there must be existing procedures (or
grounds for complaint) where people are unable to use a service just becuase
they have a disability.

cheers

  Greetings,
  
  I am not sure how to handle this problem.
  
  I have a gov't form that needs to be included on a web site. I have the form as
  a PDF. The PDF is even in secure mode so that it cannot be altered in any way. I
  know that I am not supposed to rely on the PDF and am to include an HTML
  substitute for it. But the thing is only valid in it's original format.
  
  I hope that someone can give me some insight. I have to solve this problem in
  the next couple of days.
  
  Thanks in advance
