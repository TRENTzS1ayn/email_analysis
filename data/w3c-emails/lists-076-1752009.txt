Apologies for not figuring this out sooner...

By the way, the people at Trace, Productivity Works, and Quad Media have all been wonderful.
However, I am very frustrated by the fact that pwKiosk ships with virtual no sample code.  Can
you imagine the outcry if something like ?Visual Studio? shipped this way?  Understandable, the
folks at Quad Media don?t have a perfect understanding of the features of pwKiosk (they were the
ones who told me my pages needed to have the on-screen keyboard encoded as HTML or JavaScript).
Anyway, Productivity Works assures me that pwKiosk will automatically invoke an accessible
on-screen keyboard whenever it comes across a textual element.  Unfortunately, I have no way to
test this as my content does not currently include any forms, and the kiosk will not be hooked
up to the Internet.  (And there is no sample code!)  Oh well...
