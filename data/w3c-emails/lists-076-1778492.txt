"Click" should be considered, in my opinion, common usage -- or
"slang" if you will -- for "select a link".  I think that trying
to get the masses of millions of Internet users to stop saying
"click on a link" is far harder than getting the small percentage
of people who can't literally "click" on a link to mentally
convert "click" to the appropriate term for their device.

I think that too much emphasis on telling people to never use
"click" for accessibility's sake is missing the boat.

PS:  About underlines -- they were never the best way to indicate
a link, to begin with.  People who have to have links underlined
should use the appropriate local CSS.
