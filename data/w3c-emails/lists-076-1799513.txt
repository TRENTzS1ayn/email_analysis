You can view the source of the HTML Writers Guild's web pages --
http://www.hwg.org/ and http://www.hwg.org/styles/ -- as they have
"raised buttons" that are done entirely in CSS + HTML tables, not
in graphics.  Note that this doesn't display as buttons in
Netscape, as Netscape has poor CSS support.
