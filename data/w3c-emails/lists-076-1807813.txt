Subject: How do I use CSS to fake a button?

| This is related to my earlier kiosk question.
|
| Is there a way to use CSS to make hypertext look like a button?
| I know how to change the appearances of links, but my
| experimentation has not gotten me anything that comes close to
| approximating a "raised three dimensional" look that users have
| come to expect of graphical image buttons.

You can take a look at a test case I wrote for the Mozilla browser <URL:
http://home.no.net/huftis/mozilla/gammalt/hover.html >. This works in (at least)
IE 5, Mozilla and Opera. You can also use background images instead of just
colours (but remember to specify the background colour too, for people who have
image loading disabled).
