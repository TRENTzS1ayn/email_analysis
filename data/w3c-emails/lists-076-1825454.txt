I note that text enlargement in IE 5, Opera 3.61 and NSN 4.7 does not change
the size of the pop-up alt-text over images.

Opera 3.61 superimposes the frames. It also shows a dynamic display on the top.

This site takes a long time to load.

I would not praise it as a good example of an accessible site for low-vision.
