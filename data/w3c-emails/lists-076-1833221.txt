Mr. Bartlett,

Thank you for your response to my earlier post. I will include the entire 
post below for those who would be interested, but rather than complicate 
the issue further, repose my original question.

First I apologize to you individually and to the entire list for 
misinterpreting your intent and imagining any slight.

My question was not from the position as developer of the page in question, 
but becasue I was being asked by my client if the site, which was developed 
by another organization is accessible. So there are three players here, my 
client, me as the developer of my client's web site and another web site 
which my client wanted to link to with resources for people with 
disabilities. As a developer, you can understand that the term "accessible" 
can not be clearly defined.

But when my client says to me - is that site accessible, or is that page 
accessible - it is always a challenge to answer. It is simple for me to 
answer when I go to a page that has poorly formed HTML and has no alt tags, 
I can confidently answer - that page is not accessible. The difficulty is 
when a site is clearly making the effort to be accessible, as the site I 
asked for feedback from is clearly trying, I want to be fair to both my 
client and to the site in question. Instead of slamming the site, I want to 
be able to tell my client, who is not a developer, why I believe the site 
in question is making an effort to be accessible while understanding the 
potential user problems.

I sincerely believe we are at a difficult juncture. As web development 
becomes more sophisticated while at the same time many small non-profits 
want to have their own presence on the web but have limited funds, more 
sites are being done by a staff member with an html editor.

Also, we each come to it with our own needs. A speech user's needs may 
differ from the needs of a person who is color blind. I see the challenge 
as being more of how can we acknowledge what is being done well and build 
on it.

And how do I educate a non-technically oriented client. There are no easy 
answers. In this case I just needed some help on how to answer this 
question being fair to all. The feedback I have received from this list has 
helped me to accomplish this aim. I hope to be able to come to the list 
with this sort of question in the future.
