Hi, everybody. (Hi, Dr. Nick.) After 20-odd years following 
accessibility, including running the Media Access mailing list, which 
may be past its prime--

<http://www.electricseed.com/joeclark/cc.html>
<http://www.electricseed.com/joeclark/axxlist.html>

-- and after freelance writing for ten years and being online for 
nine, my friends and I have started a new online *content* 
consultancy, contenu.nu.

The NUblog, a Weblog on content issues, is very widely read. Since 
I'm the one writing the HTML (and, thus far, every single word; the 
"we" is purely editorial), accessibility features are in full force. 
Think Tarantino actors holding up a diner, *that* full a force.

Not only is there an ALT on every graphic and a TITLE on every 
graphic, nearly every link, and many table rows, there are LONGDESCs 
and D.-links and ACCESSKEYs all over the damn place. I also discussed 
the richness such tags and attributes provide to online data in the 
archives: <http://www.contenu.nu/narchives.html#metadata>. (There's 
also a discussion of multilingual content you might like: 
<http://www.contenu.nu/narchives.html#multiling>.)

Warning: My pal Luke is still wrangling Zope, the content-management 
system, to serve the whole thing via a database, so file sizes are 
large, and we're dealing with nested tables here.

I am specifically asking WAI-IG readers with oddball combos of screen 
reader and computer and browser to attempt to break the NUblog page. 
Tell me anything that doesn't work. I would be surprised if anything 
doesn't, given that the page validates as HTML 4.0 Transitional save 
for quoted strings in URLs, which don't count.

Anyway, happy reading.
