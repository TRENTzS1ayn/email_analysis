[DJW:]  This is an area where HTML got it wrong.  There is a button
element, which does this, but there is no fallback mechanism for
this.
Moreover IE4 implements is wrongly (it fails to send the value when
used as a submit button - Lynx gets this right, even though it is
not graphical!).

Simulation with CSS doesn't work quite the same as a real button, 
because buttons can remain active after they are released (in
framesets,
at least).  Also Netscape 4 seems to apply the style to the next
block
element, typically resulting in a zero sized graphical button below
and
to the right of the intended button - this is not quite that
predictable.
