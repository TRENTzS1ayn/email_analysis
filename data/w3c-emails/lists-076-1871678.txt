[DJW:]  If the form needs to be printed and filled in by hand,
I would say that PDF was the best format.  The only other permitted
format that would allow this is GIF, and  that is much much worse
than PDF when it comes to accessiblity of text content!  If
necessary,
pretend it is an image and provide D links, etc.

Before you can move it to HTML you need to establish the
principle of electronic submission of the data.  As it is, the
chances are that processing the data in any layout except that
guaranteed by the page description will be quite expensive for
the government department that handles it.  In some cases, they
may even OCR the data.
