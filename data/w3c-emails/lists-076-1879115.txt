The real problem with "click" is it represents a failure
to think about appropriate hypertext, which, in my view,
should represent the application of the document, not the
mechanics of navigating it.  Terminology that assumes that
everyone uses GUI browsers is just one symptom of this.

[DJW:]  The issue is really a content provider one, not
a browser user on.

[DJW:]  An inversion of this, is if users don't like 
underscores, they should configure the browser to 
suppress them (which is much easier for most users
than creating an !important style sheet to cancel
the content provider's style sheet).

[DJW:]  In this context, the very need for the "too tip"
implies that the text is not clearly a link, and the
design has not been consistent, in that some links are
underlined and some are not.

The problem is not whether or not links should be underlined
but whethe content provider should change the presentation of
links from that which the user expects.  In combination with
non-standard link colours, http://www.useit.com/alertbox/990502.html
points out that people are now relying on underlines
to recognize links (and being confused when they aren't links.)
