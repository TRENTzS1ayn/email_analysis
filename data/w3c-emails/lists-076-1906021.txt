Hello all,

I have not found any info about this in the archives. I have to post a large doc
that contains redacted testimony. What would be the best way to accomplish this
from a compliance standpoint? I could use a black pixel that I stretch and have
an alt tag for it. Or would something else be preferred?

Thanks in advance
