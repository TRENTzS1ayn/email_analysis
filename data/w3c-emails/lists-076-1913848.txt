I think it is possible to use appropriate hypertext and still use the word
"click" in that hypertext.

Link copy should tell users what to expect when they follow a link. Making
rules for how we accomplish that misses the point.

Whether we use "click," "select," "follow," "read," "choose," "slam" or
"pound" as the active verb is a literary issue, not a literal one, as long
as meaning is clear.

Terminology is an appropriate part of design. Depending on the context and
purpose of one site, I may choose to use one hypertext phrase throughout.
On a different site, I may choose variety. That choice and the goal of
clarity rightly belong within the creative challenge.
