I guess a disabled person with learning disabilities who uses a
foot-pedal would prefer
"Press foot pedal" rather than "Click here" or something device
independent.  There's an opportunity for some personalisation here.

Kynn, in some of your message you mention that you're now involved in
developing personalised Web sites.  Is this the type of thing you're
involved in?

Feel free to promote your work in some detail - I've been intrigued by
the brief mentions you've made in the past.

Brian
