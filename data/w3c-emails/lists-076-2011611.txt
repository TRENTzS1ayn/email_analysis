Hi Kynn
   Thanks for the reply.
   I gave a brief talk at a WAI meeting held in Toronto after the WWW8
conference on the need for metadata to provide personalised interfaces
which could have accesibility benefits.   (Unfortunately my talk didn't
go as I'd intended, due, I think, to cultural differences in
interpreting the term "filtering").
   Anyway my slides (Powerpoint and derived HTML formats) are at:
http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/web-focus/accessibility/metadata/www8/
   In one of the slides (slide 11) I said:

Is "universal design" a false goal? Shouldn't we we aiming for
personalised services based on individual preferences?

I was arguing against the notion of HTML as a basis for universal design
and saying that be should be going for XML, and generating (possibility
personalised) XHTML from this richer resource.

Is this what you're involved in doing?

Isn't there a contradiction between this view and the universal design
argument which is perceived as using HTML as the basis?

Interested in your views.

Thanks

Brian
