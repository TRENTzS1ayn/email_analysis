DP:: "click is usually used in refering to a mouse action."

WL: In the current thread "click" is used as a human action to select
the link to activate. A mouse is only one kind of such actions. In fact
if dictionaries were as fast as the Web "click" would already have
included the definition "pursuing a hypertext link". IMHO. 'tain't
whacha say, it's the way howjasayit. Sticks and stones and all that.
"blink" or "crip" OK, "nigger" not. Whatever. <shout>NO MATTER HOW MUCH
WE RAIL AGAINST IT "click here" IS HERE TO STAY!</shout> 

Let's move on to something we might be able to do something about,
please.
