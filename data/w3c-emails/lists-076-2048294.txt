Kynn -- Are you suggesting that there be no standard for indicating links?
(Not that everyone follows standards anyway!) As a person with low vision,
I find it helpful to know what standard is being used on any one site to
indicate links -- the confusion arises when a designer sometimes uses
underscores, sometimes uses specific colors, or fonts, or graphics. Maybe
that's just a matter of poor design, making it difficult for any user to
navigate, not a disability-related issue.
