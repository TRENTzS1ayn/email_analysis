Oh, I'm all for individual expression.  I'll grant you that as long as it's
clear what is and what isn't a hyperlink, constency or a "style sheet" may
not be necessary.  But at the same time, it seems a site should be pretty
intuitive to use -- or visitors aren't going to stick around long enough to
figure out how to navigate it. And why risk the chance that folks might
miss important information? Isn't the point of informaiton design to ensure
people are receiving the information?
