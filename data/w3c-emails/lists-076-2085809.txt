[DJW:]  Whilst I think the aims of the current audience
are different, most web page design is about selling,
either oneself (juvenile web pages) or one's company's 
products.  Although personally, I would like to look to
advertising for real information to help buy a product,
advertising is largely about emotions, because, with 
real information, you'll learn the weaknesses of the
product and how little it differs from any similar one.

For some reason, people designing to sell think they must
look state of the art.

Unfortunately, designers trying to convey infomation are
swayed by the designs of those who aren't.

If I'm looking for information on the web, I try to find
amateur pages and the PDF white papers on commercial sites.
Academic HTML is also OK, but rarely hyperlinked. 
  
(Much high level advertising is designed to get enquiries
and allow the salesmen to control the real information that
they then provide person to person.)
