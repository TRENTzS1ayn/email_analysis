I have a question about a site on our campus I was asked to look at. The
dedsigner used graphics in the background. The graphics reflect the subject
of the site (computers and society) and visually are an interesting part of
the experience of the site, though they don't impart any information per
se.

Those using the text version of this site or using a screen reader do not
know there are graphics they're not seeing. I'm concerned (as are the
designers) that there is no indication or description of the graphics for
such users. Is there a way to add ALT tags to background graphics? Any
other suggestions on adding descriptions of the graphics?

The site is: http://www.computerethics.org
Thanks
Jan
