Universal Design is a fine goal.  Universal HTML is only one way to pursue
a Universal Design solution, however.  Thinking that Universal Documents
are the only option that satisfies the principles of Universal Design is
erroneous.

Alternatives to Universal Documents have their own problems and are not
automatically to be preferred, either.

But a Universal Service that dispenses tailored documents with a better
usability-vs-disability envelope that is achievable by Universal Documents
is not in principle impossible, so the disability community should listen
to all offers to try to seek the best deal they can get.  But be from
Missouri.  You want to be "showed" that it's going to work.

In particular for high-dollar business transactions, I personally feel we
very much need a Universal Document solution.  It needs to be universal so
that one can both audit to ensure that comparable terms are being offered,
meeting non-discrimination rules, and at the same time the recipient of the
offer can review the deal at their leisure in a computing environment of
their choice.  The latter is in order to provide adequate consumer
protection that works for all.  This tilts toward a document type defined
strictly in terms of _public standard_ markup and schemas.

And, by the way, digital signatures and XML make the latter solution
technically a piece of cake, if only there is the will to commit to it.
