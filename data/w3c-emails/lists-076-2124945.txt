[Just as a note about XML trends and the future]

The problem with explaining the BACGROUND image is much like the LONGDESC
problem.
Logically, these descrptions are about things that are themselves
attributes, whereas the SGML tradition only allows us to add attributes to
give information about elements.  Not to give information about attributes.
 Except via unpopular technologies such as architectural forms.

A clue as to a possible solution to this dilemma is the way that the title
information item in the SVG syntax is no longer an XML attribute but is an
XML subelement, even though its function is to give information about its
parent element.  This allows us to support international titles better.  It
lets us incorporate RUBY and other markup in the title that one needs
beyond UniCode text to present literate titles in a wide variety of
languages.  It also allows us to then come back and give information about
the TITLE by attributes within the TITLE element or by RDF metadata which
is then able to point at the TITLE element as what it is talking about.

So we should be thinking about migrating the background image to a
subelement in XHTML 2 as opposed to an attribute so we can associate a
description with it just as with any other image.
