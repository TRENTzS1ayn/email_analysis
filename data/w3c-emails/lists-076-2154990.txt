Click is slang for "follow this link" in the same way that "web
surfer" is slang for "user of the world wide web."

Trying to overcome things that actually cause people to lose
access to content is one thing; trying to change slang because we
don't think it's "inclusive" enough is another thing altogether.

Fights should be chosen wisely, and there's no reason to choose a
fight over "click here for <X>" -- the meaning is perfectly unambiguous
when used as slang in a non-technical setting.  (The same way that
it's appropriate to say "browser" instead of "user agent" in most
cases.)
