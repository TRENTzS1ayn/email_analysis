Intelligent browsers and/or edapting -- uh, adapting, sorry -- user
interfaces should be able to provide the _user_ with the ability to
identify links as he or she desires or needs.  There should be no
"standard", no, other than "links are indicated by the use of the
markup <a>".

Sadly, we're not quite at this point yet, but I hope you can see where I
am going.

I think you answered your own question, but ultimately, -you- should
have the control to instruct your browser "display links as <whatever>."
