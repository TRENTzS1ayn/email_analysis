Yes and no.  Each site may or may not have their own goals, and in a
real world setting, things such as "does the vice president like the
way it looks" may take priority. :)

Which is why we need to support anything that strengthens a web
publishing framework that gives control back to the end user --
such as support for CSS, which allows you to say "underline these"
if you want them underlined, "invert these" if you want them inverted,
and so on.
