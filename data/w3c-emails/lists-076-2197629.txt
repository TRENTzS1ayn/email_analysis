This is a very interesting question.  I think, though, that we should
keep in mind that the -map- is rarely the content we are conveying;
instead it is the -information on the map-.  So when we consider
the options, we need to focus on conveying the content of the map,
not the form.

You could print off, with a braille printer, a crude map -- I've
seen a map of the US, for example, at CSUN printed in this way.
But it may not be the best way to convey the info in the map.

What is the map conveying now, and how?  (Rhetorical question.)
That could provide some clues.
