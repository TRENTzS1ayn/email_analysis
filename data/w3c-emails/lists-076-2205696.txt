  Hello all,
  
  I have not found any info about this in the archives. I have to post a large doc
  that contains redacted testimony. What would be the best way to accomplish this
  from a compliance standpoint? I could use a black pixel that I stretch and have
  an alt tag for it. Or would something else be preferred?
  
  Thanks in advance
