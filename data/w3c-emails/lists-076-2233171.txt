[DJW:]  It's origins, though, was to give
concrete instructions to users of mice rather
than using something more abstract, like "activate".

Now, non-mouse users need to do two translations:
click to the abstract concept and then that concept
to the concrete one for their user interface.

People who still need to be told to click mice would be
the people who would have difficulty making these 
translations.
