Well, if you have a CSS-compliant browser then it is easy. But nobody does
:-(

So if you have one that supports floats, you can do the following. Split your
text into two <div>s

For the first one, make it class="left" (for example) and then use

 .left { float: left ; width: 50% }

This works on a collection of Netscape and IE versions, as well as some other
browsers, but notable new exception is Mac IE 5 (they must have changed the
code - floats did work in earlier versions) and something else taht I don't
recall right now...

  Apologies for abusing the list this way, but:
  
  How do I use CSS to put running text into two columns (newspaper style).  I
  could just use a table with two cells, but StyleSheets have done everything
  else I wanted so far...
  
  I believe this question was answered before, but I can't find it.
  
  BTW, the site in question (not much there really, but its a start) is at
  URL:

  Links of class "ez_menu" are incorporated into the "EZ Access" switch
  scanning.
  Anything of class "ez_text" is spoken.
