Thank you Charles and Karl,

Okay, but can CSS be used to "soft wrap" text so it naturally flows from one
column to the next?  It seems wrong that I should dictate "this stuff is on
the left" and "that stuff is on the right" when really I want to code
something like "that stuff follows this stuff and my preferred presentation
is that all of it appears as two side by side columns".
