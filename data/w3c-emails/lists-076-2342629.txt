Never mind, I changed that to:
.left { display: block; float: left ; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 50% }
.right { display: block; float: right ; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 50% }
'cause of the fat gutter in the middle...

Still need looking for a substitute for "<br><br><br>".
And a way to "soft wrap" columns.
