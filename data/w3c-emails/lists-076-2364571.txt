I think this gets back to the content of the link. After going 
through the machinations of adaptation (er, 'edaptation' <g>) you'd 
have a wonderfully accessible link, but it could still say 'CLICK 
HERE!' or perhaps if the user agent pulls in the title of the linked 
page before going there, 'Frame3.'

One of my pet projects (which I'll probably never finish) is to make 
a user agent which displays only the <A> links, with each link's 
surrounding context shown only when the user focuses on that link. 
Trying to navigate that way might give people an inside-out 
perspective on the web.
