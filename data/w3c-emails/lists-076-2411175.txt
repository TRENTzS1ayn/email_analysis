If I remember correctly, the advice was: read the hypertext link
out aloud and if it made sense it was good. With IBM's HPR, you
would end up with "Click Here" "Click Here" "Click Here" "Click
Here" for the links preview, which would not made sense to
anyone. Following the (I think it was Kynn's) advice "Click here
to go to Whitehouse.com" "Click here to go to W3C.com" or simply
"Whitehouse.com" "W3C.com" will make sense by it's self in HPR
links preview. In pwWebSpeak, It will read "LINK Click here"
followed by the regular text, which may make sense. However,
using the keyboard to navigate through the page to get to the
different links will result in "LINK Click here" "LINK Click
here" "LINK Click here" "LINK Click here" which would not make
any sense to the user while ""LINK Click here for Whitehouse.com"
"LINK Click here for W3C.com" or simply "Whitehouse.com" or
"W3C.com" would make sense.

N.B. I have changed the names of the links to protect their
innocence ;-)
