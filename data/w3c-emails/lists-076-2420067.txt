[DJW:]  
This breaks quite badly on NS4.5.  Off list correspondence
suggests that this was intended as a "best viewed on
WebKiosk v.v" page, rather than a "best viewed on Any
Browser"  <http://www.anybrowser.org/> one.

The question was raised as to whether there was any duty
on accessible content authors to author for anything other
than fully compliant browsers.  (I believe that the lack of
these means it is.)
