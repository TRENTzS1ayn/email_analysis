Yes, link text should IMO work just as well as if it has just been ordinary
text.

Example -- bad use link text:

_Click here_ to read some articles I've written about web design and palm trees.

Example -- good link text:

I've written some articles about _web design_ and _palm trees_ which you might
find interesting.

| to go to Whitehouse.com" "Click here to go to W3C.com" or simply
| "Whitehouse.com" "W3C.com" will make sense by it's self in HPR

| "LINK Click here for W3C.com" or simply "Whitehouse.com" or
| "W3C.com" would make sense.

You can find official information from the _White House_. The _W3C_ is the
consortium behind the _HTML Recommendation_.

Doesn't this look/sound better?

I might also mention that Opera 4 has a very nice feature, activated by Ctrl+J,
which displays a list of all links in the document (either in the order they
appear in the document or alphabetised). A long list of 'Click here' or 'Click
here to access Whitehouse.gov', 'Click here to access the W3C homepage' doesn't
look good.
