Have you found a solution to this? I am having the same problem. I need to use <Hn> text for search engine indexing purposes, but I cannot get rid of the space that follows beneath the text. I have tried using stylesheets, but I am not yet adept at them. 

Please tell me how to use headers and remove the following space. 

Kind regards,
