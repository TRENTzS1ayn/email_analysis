I can't match any article within the last 10 days to this,

You should be using them for accessibility reasons 
(search engine indexing is only a minor part) and in
my view, the only relevance of this to this list is that
an answer may prevent the abandonment of correct markup
in order to force the presentation.

[DJW:]  This is the suggested style sheet for some headings from 
the CSS2 specification (appendix A).

H1 { font-size: 2em; margin: .67em 0 }
H2 { font-size: 1.5em; margin: .83em 0 }
H3 { font-size: 1.17em; margin: 1em 0 }

Assuming that browsers behave somewhat like this, and that I
correctly understand "space that follows", overriding the margin
to 0 0 should cause the headings to be spaced the same as body 
text, and considerably less than the space between paragraphs.

More interesting is the case of headings that are written inline.
In principle display: run-in can be used on these, but
I'd be surprised if NS4 got anywhere near this.  (CSS2 
section 9.2.4.)
