Hello,
Please see my recent paper that discusses Section 508, ADA and the impact on
the States:  "An Overview of Law & Policy for IT Accessibility: A Resource
for State and Municipal IT Policy Makers" at

Hello.

I was wondering if anyone happens to know of any state laws in the US 
which might parallel section 508 in the federal government. I'm 
particularly interested in Washington and California.

In doing some research I found pseudo-accessible sites such as 
California's Orange County Office of Risk Management: 
<http://www.oc.ca.gov/ceo_risk/>, but there doesn't seem to be much 
going on at the state level otherwise.

Am I looking in the wrong places?

Many thanks.
