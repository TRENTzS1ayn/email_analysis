Hi folks,

I finally have a meeting with the powers that be at Suite101
(http://www.suite101.com) to introduce the concept of accessible web design.
In order to be thoroughly prepared for this meeting, I would appreciate your
comments on this site.  Please be as picky as you like.  I know missing ALT
tags is a major problem.  What else?

If you feel so inclined, please also check out the membership application at
http://www.suite101.com/join.cfm/42515.


Thanks kindly,
Glenda
