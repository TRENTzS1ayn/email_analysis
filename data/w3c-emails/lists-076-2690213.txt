Hi Kelly:
It's too soon to tell; the policy was the 'what' - implementation is the
'how' and 'when' - that's our next step.
I believe there is a pilot program going on here at the state using a
product called OmniForm - it allows you to save forms in HTML format and you
can add JavaScript for validation. That might be an option. Do you have any
suggestions for us to pursue?
