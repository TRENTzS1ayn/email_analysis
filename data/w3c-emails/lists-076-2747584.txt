I think what Paul is trying to say is spam is a fact of life on the 
internet, the worst thing you can do is to react to it, do not even 
unsubscribe from their lists, because ethics come very low in the spammers 
code of conduct, by responding or visiting their site you confirm a live 
email address. Besides it worked in your case didn't it? They then use and 
sell this list to others, and often access open ports to extract as much 
info as your hard drive will allow, so you create your own spam. Just 
delete it when it comes in, and silence is golden. basic stuff really.
