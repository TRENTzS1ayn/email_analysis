This is not a settlement, this is capitulation.

I rate this statement in the same league as "the cheque is in the post" and 
" of course I will still love you in the morning"

Pyrrhic victory perhaps? what ever it is it is just a bunch of promises, 
maybe's and provisos without definitive objectives.
