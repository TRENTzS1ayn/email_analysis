[DJW:] Generally by printing them out and filling them in
with a pen!  PDF is generally only an issue for people
who have poor vision, although one suspects that their PDF doesn't
contain PDF forms, so can't be filled in online and printed
with the contents, thus forcing those with poor dexterity to
print, then overtype (HTML browsers tend to be poor at
hardcopying form content).

I doubt that you will find many organisations that include
braille on the normal versions of their forms, and many that
don't provide it at all.

Unless forms are submitted online, PDF (which isn't actually
a pure graphic form) means that the data entry clerks know
exactly where to look on the paper, and there can be various
forms of automation, savings on which can help fund the 
braille versions.

PDF can be an issue for those not able to afford their own 
modern PC, but the solution there is probably plain text,
so that the form layout is more predictable, not HTML.

It might be worth thinking of this from the point of view
of the data entry clerk; in some cases, a predictable layout
might make the job available to disabled employees.
