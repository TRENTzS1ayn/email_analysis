I just got asked in private email -- does anyone know what the
current "deadline" for accessibility on web sites happens to be?
Is it "in effect" or still "in consideration" or what?  What's
the current status?

Originally it was supposed to be about 2 weeks from now (August
7), but from http://www.section508.gov/updateinfo.html I see that
it's been moved back to "six months after the access board's
recommendations are final."  What is the status of that process?
