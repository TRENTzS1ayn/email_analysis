On the CSS document, it might be worth mentioning
colour blindness in section 9.
http://www.labs.bt.com/people/rigdence/colours/index.html
is probably a good reference to consider including, even
though their corporate site has some very poor contrasts!

Section 13, on positioning, could do with a tactful warning
that the style sheet implementations on some browsers can
mean that layouts are useable on a fully compliant browser
and a non-CSS one, but may fail on browsers with incomplete
implementations.
