I'm having some trouble using relative units for a graphic's size while using hotspots.  When I assign the image relative units, the hotspots become disoriented and wind up in the upper left corner.


i.e. HTML code:  <img name="Image" src="images.gif" width="75%" height="90%"...

Has anyone else encountered this problem? Are there any ideas on how to deal with it?  
I want my graphic to be full-screen on low-resolution monitors, and there are several curved hotspots on the image.


Thank you for your time,
