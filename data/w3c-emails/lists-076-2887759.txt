[DJW:]  
I'm pretty sure that if you know how to write HTML
you can write good HTML in Front Page.  The problem
is that the user interface encourages bad habits, and
it seems that it is fairly easy to generate invalid 
HTML as well.  Early versions generate a document type
that only permits HTML 2.0, which will need fixing for
most pages!

The sorts of ways that it encourages problems are by
making presentational features easy to use, by putting
them on the tool bar, but hiding the proper structural
ones; I think that is consistent with the target WYSISWYG
market.

Obviously it also encourages the use of canned formats,
automation etc.

[DJW:]  
Dave Raggett's Tidy program was designed to try to
create valid HTML from it.  Accessibility requires
human intervention though.

[DJW:]  There's actually an accessibility thread running
on the lynx-dev mailing list in which two different sites
(I think Ohio State is the problem one and a newspaper the 
good one) are producing pages with a Front Page meta tag
(possibly hand retouched) and one is virtually unnavigable
text only, whereas the other is no problem.

The fundamental problem is almost certainly that the people
who like using Front Page don't like to think about information
(as against specified browser graphic) design.
