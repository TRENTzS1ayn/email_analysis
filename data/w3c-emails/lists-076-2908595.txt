Hello,

My first reaction is that if I could not see and had to rely on the linear
progression of a screen reader, it would take a long time before I could
learn what this site is about.  If they used a descriptive title and
included some text near the top of their main page, I might have a better
idea of why and for what I might want to search. 

I hope you find this helpful.

Hi folks,

I finally have a meeting with the powers that be at Suite101
(http://www.suite101.com) to introduce the concept of accessible web design.
In order to be thoroughly prepared for this meeting, I would appreciate your
comments on this site.  Please be as picky as you like.  I know missing ALT
tags is a major problem.  What else?

If you feel so inclined, please also check out the membership application at
http://www.suite101.com/join.cfm/42515.


Thanks kindly,
Glenda
