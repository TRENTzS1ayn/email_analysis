EMERGING TECHNOLOGY: "TextAloud MP3 by NextUp Technologies"

NextUp Technologies released version 1.0 of TextAloud MP3 in
April, 2000. This new software package, while not a new concept,
does offer a feature not found in other programs: it allows a
user to save the text it reads as a .wav or.MP3 as a way of
saving audio material in a highly compressed format with minimal
degradation in quality. These files allow the user to listen to
talking files without being tied to the computer.

Its uses for persons with disabilities include:

* Talking Books: Teachers can create talking books for students
with learning disabilities by taking one of the thousands of
e-texts available on the Internet and have TextAloud read it.
Once copied to a CD, this supplemental material can be used
over and over.

* Studying by ear: TextAloud software will read computer-typed
notes onto a file and students can listen and study with headphones.

* Augmentative Communication: Users who have speech impairments can
use TextAloud to record both emergency numbers and frequently used
phrases as MP3 files.

More information on TextAloud software can be found at
www.nextuptech.com/TextAloud/tafaq.html.

TextAloud can be tried for 15 days free by downloading a fully
functional demo at www.nextuptech.com/TextAloud/download.html.
