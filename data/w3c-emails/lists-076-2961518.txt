Dear WAI Interest Group members

Browsing is turning into an 'everywhere' thing.  The growing edge is
using mobile devices like cell phones to access the same kind of
information that you browse from your desktop computer. One way to do
that is using voice as the medium of communication both ways.  

The W3C has a Voice Browser Working Group <http://www.w3.org/Voice/>
which is looking to develop W3C Recommendations for a Speech Interface
Framework.

We are all invited to review two W3C Speech Interface Framework
documents authored by the W3C Voice Browser Working Group (available
from their home page given above).

Please help us to discern where the access issues and possible
solutions are in this scenario (comments can be sent directly to the
public mailing list <www-voice@w3.org> which is archived at
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-voice>)
