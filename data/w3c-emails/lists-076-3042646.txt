JK:: "...so that people can print them and fill them out...we are not
talking about interactive forms here."

WL: Hard for me to reconcile those phrases! Printed forms are just
pressed dead trees when one is in a darkroom - "filling them out" is
very tedious with slate/stylus or microphone. 

Because PDF has become notorious (wrongly or not) as the enemy of
accessibility it is difficult to be objective in these matters. Adobe
has apparently made a sincere (but unfortunately, largely unsuccessful)
to change all this but the impression we're often left with is that the
effort is often towards affecting the perception of inaccessibility
rather than the real problem - which may be intractable.

JK:: "Is there an alternative format which could be used for creating
electronic forms that would be more easily accessible to all potential
users of those forms?"

WL: Yes. In fact that's what all the WAI stuff addresses.
