[DJW:]  I don't see that this is particular 
incompatible with PDF.  In fact PDF text is
more likely to be real text than the text
on typical commercial web pages.  The only real
problem with the text in PDF files is it is
often produced by word processors that think
they can do a better job of spacing characters
than PostScript can do.  That means that you
normally get individually placed characters,
rather than whole words with a horzontal stretch 
factor, as allowed by the PDF primitives.  This 
can confuse tools that try to extract words from the  
text (I predict that the same problem will happen 
with SVG if, as I suspect, people use it for whole 
pages, not just graphics).

(It seems to me that there is a place for tools to
help marginally reformat PDF to take out the detailed
microspacing and replace it by stretch factors.  It's 
possible they are already in the commercial Acrobat 
toolset.)

PDF does have a fill the forms facility, even in
the version before last of Acrobat, and you can 
print the result.  This is not an ideal example 
from a size or accessibility point of view, but
it does demonstrate the feature - it needs the 
latest Acrobat reader:

(please destroy any printout if you are not a 
participant!).

Once you impose a constraint that the layout should
exactly match that of the printed form, I think PDF
becomes the format of choice.
