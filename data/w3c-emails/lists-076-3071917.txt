[DJW:]  The scanning is the problem, not the use of PDF.
(I believe Adobe have tools for maintaing PDF files which
contain a scanned image for exact reproduction and a text
version for cut and paste etc., but I imagine few people
take the trouble to buy/use it.)

Please only use plain text on public lists.  Use of 
HTML or text/enriched causes its own accessibility 
problems.  The latter is not understood by many GUI
tools that actually understand HTML.  (I can't recover
the source to see how well it reads as plain text, but
I suspect it is a bit better than typical HTML mail.)
