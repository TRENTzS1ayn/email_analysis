In a world where most information becomes bits in a database somewhere, the
requirement to exactly match some antiquated paper copy unduly constrains
development. In a perfect world this requirement would not exist, however in
the interest of not getting stuck on this point perhaps we should consider
that the requirement is really that the 'agency' receive the data in that
form (for ease of processing?). Then providing the form information in an
accessible format so that a person can at least 'read' the questions ahead
of time and be prepared to work efficiently with assistance to fill out the
'actual' form makes a lot of sense.
Compromise anyone?
