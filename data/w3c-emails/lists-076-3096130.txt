The compromise for me is that if you want my information on your paper 
forms in the way you want it to look, then you take the time to put it 
there.  Give me some accessible method of giving you that information and 
then you have the internal mechanisms for getting my information on 
whatever paper form you need it.

You, the organization needing my information, can pay someone to retype or 
write on your paper forms.  I shouldn't have to pay a reader or get a 
friend to put my information on your paper form.

If this is not acceptable then I suggest that the agency needs to seriously 
rethink their policies and practices because they are blatantly discriminatory.
   This attitude that I need to use technology X and since technology X 
isn't accessible I can avoid accessibility or force the burden on the 
person with the disability needs to stop.
