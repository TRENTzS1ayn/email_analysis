You are, of course quite correct. The problem is that people are so in love
with their paper forms that must have things in certain formats and
locations (seems it would be too hard to 'retrain' data entry clerks if you
move something a millimeter). As silly as this sounds it is a fact of life
and I for one would rather have a glass half-full than no glass at all.
Being the eternal optimist I would hope that once at least 'readable' form
information was out there people might begin to recognize it was not so bad
and move towards more fully accessible forms.
