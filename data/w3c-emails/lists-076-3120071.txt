Marti:: "...the requirement is really that the 'agency' receive the data
in that form (for ease of processing?)."

WL: Why would "ease of processing" be enhanced by data that requires
human intervention (actually a human with retinae and adequate
processing ability) to be read? Also by whom is this adjudged a
*requirement*? What we are about in part is to ferret out capricious
*requirements* so that women may participate in society and blind guys
can read Webstuff readily.

Marti:: "providing the form information in an accessible format so that
a person can at least 'read' the questions ahead of time and be prepared
to work efficiently with assistance to fill out the 'actual' form makes
a lot of sense."

WL: To me it makes about as much sense as to have people carry wheel
chair users up a flight of stairs to avoid ramps/elevators, etc.

Marti:: "Compromise anyone?"

WL: Maybe "anyone" but not "everyone" and our slogan is "everyone,
everything connected" and nothing less has much merit.
