I've gotten a lot of valuable input, both on this list and off - thanks, everyone.

For those few (very few) who were somewhat - let me phrase this delicately - "aggressive" in their messages to me, let me make this clear: I was not arguing in favor of inaccessible solutions. Just laying out our circumstances, and asking if there were alternatives.

The real solution has always been obvious - W3C standards-based, compliant, fully accessible HTML forms feeding data directly into a back-end processing system. Unfortunately, that solution is beyond our financial ability to implement, today. Next fiscal year, we will be able to afford it, but not now. Trust me on this - it's not a cop-out, or an excuse, we just don't have the money. But I am, and have always been, and will always be, committed to that goal.

Short-term, well, I've told the management here on several occasions that nothing goes on the web site until it can be made accessible. I'll continue to tell them that.
