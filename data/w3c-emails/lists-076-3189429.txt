I'm not familiar with the term "PDF-normal".  What is this format?  As distinguished from what?


Some pages are rendered well, but not all.  This is true for the other conversion options as well such as the Email service and the online tool at Adobe.
Simple pages are, well, simple, and are usually read by JFW with no problem. 
Complex pages are, well, complex and may make little sense when read by JFW.  The closer the original document is to linear text already, the more likekly it will be read by JFW well.
I believe there is a white paper on the Adobe site for preparing a document for accessibility so as to increase the liklihood of an accessible  post-conversion document. 

        The bottom line for all accessibility issues is test the resulting page.  If n-1 documents converted well, the n-th one may not.
The conversion tools are better now, but still the pages need to be tested after conversion.
Do other screen readers work with
 Acrobat 4.05 and do as well as Jaws? 
Still, for universal accessibility, we should not assume everyone  has the plug-in, (or any Adobe software for that matter), or any particular screen reader.
If the resulting converted document is accessible, that accessible version should be posted on the web site in addition to the original source PDF file, (save as HTML if the HTML is accesible! or save as text if the text vversion is accessible!).

, it was able to read PDF-normal
pages.  So has the policy been revisited?
