I'd like to assertain whether an may exists and if I can get hold of one?
it seems an obvious question and I confess I might already have one and not
know it.
your help would be greatly appreciated.

The map would look something like this:
element, access statement, example:
img, alt tag, <img source="path to image.gif" <morestuff if necessary>
"alt="this is a sample image">

It doesn't have to be 40.  transitional would work just nicely.
Thanks!
