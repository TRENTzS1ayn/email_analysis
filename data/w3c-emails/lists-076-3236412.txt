[DJW:]  
I think I really need longer than I can spare to cover this
well, but, whilst I accept that a well designed HTML document
will generally be better than current generation PDF, I think:

- there is a tendency to compare HTML as Tim Berners-Lee 
intended it with PDF in real life;

- to confuse tools and formats;

- to not consider the nature of the source material and
the clerical procedures associated with it.

On the first, most people, including, I suspect, many people 
interested in communicating information, treat HTML as a
WYSIWYG language.  As its not, the result of trying to force
it into that mould can be worse than the result of using a
language that is intended for page layout.

On tools versus formats.  The PDF format is actually designed
to make linear reading of text quite easy, and I doubt that 
much is needed to handle forms in a screen reader context.  However,
it is possible that the reading tools don't give adequate 
interfaces for screen readers, and it is certainly true that
most of the authoring tools (i.e. standard word processors)
make finding word boundaries difficult, by placing characters
individually.

(Even so, if you have material in PostScript or paper, converting
the PostScript to PDF will produce a document with 100% correct
character identification, whereas using OCR on the paper 
document will misread many characters.)

As to source material.  If you only have hard copy and you
have an imperative to reproduce it accurately, you would use
GIF with HTML in the contexts where you would use scanned 
material with PDF.  PDF can actually do better by matching the 
OCRed text with the image.  Basically, before worrying about
HTML versus PDF, you must first convert from paper to machine
readable documents and then to electronic submission.

[DJW:]  
The current PDF specification allows text to be annotated
with structure information, however, as well as having the
tools to create and use this, you also need people who can 
think other than WYSIWYG; they are very rare.  You really only
need to undo damage from printer driver microspacing in order
to recover the contents of textual documents to the same
quality as the average <font face...><br>++ flat HTML, that most
people write.

[DJW:]  Basically, in many contexts, plain text is the most
accessible format, in some you need features from HTML or
other structural markup languages, and in some, PDF may be the
most practical format, without expending a lot of skilled 
labour on reworking clerical procedures and marking up 
documents.  Government funded bodies tend to have limited 
amounts of this; commercial bodies look for a return on 
investment that exceeds that they could get by using those
resources in other ways; and people in between (like "agencies"
in the UK sense) tend to work like commercial organisations, but
minimising costs, rather than maximising profits. 

++ Even with fully revisable WP  documents, it is not unknown
for professional people to tab round the end of line to get
a new line.
