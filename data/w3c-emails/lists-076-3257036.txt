That still has the problem of requiring the existence of a database (OK, the database is there for most forms, but in most cases it's old software, unable to communicate with most modern tools, and would need to be replaced). And then there's the issue of purchasing the telephony integration piece - we really don't have any money available at all right now.

The solution to the problem - accessible web-based forms - is easy. We just can't pay for it this fiscal year.

Adam -
One alternative could be some of the telephony integration products.   It
seems to me that it should be possible to have a "phone-enabled" interface
to a database as an alternative interface for forms input.   I've seen
demos of this type of system to handle an organization's human resources
needs for changing employee benefits options.   While these haven't  been
web-based, the convergence of web-enabling and phone-enabling databases
could offer possible solutions.

Subject:  RE: PDF Alternatives?


I've gotten a lot of valuable input, both on this list and off - thanks,
everyone.

For those few (very few) who were somewhat - let me phrase this delicately
- "aggressive" in their messages to me, let me make this clear: I was not
arguing in favor of inaccessible solutions. Just laying out our
circumstances, and asking if there were alternatives.

The real solution has always been obvious - W3C standards-based, compliant,
fully accessible HTML forms feeding data directly into a back-end
processing system. Unfortunately, that solution is beyond our financial
ability to implement, today. Next fiscal year, we will be able to afford
it, but not now. Trust me on this - it's not a cop-out, or an excuse, we
just don't have the money. But I am, and have always been, and will always
be, committed to that goal.

Short-term, well, I've told the management here on several occasions that
nothing goes on the web site until it can be made accessible. I'll continue
to tell them that.
