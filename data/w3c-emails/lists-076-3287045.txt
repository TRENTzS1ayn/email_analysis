Hi Adam,

I hope I don't sound too aggressive with this message. If you are
looking for "cheap" solutions there are solutions for your problem
as cheap as ... free! Your problem can be solved easily by using a
server-side scripting language like PHP (free) which works with
many servers (Apache, in its differents flavours, and even MS
Information Server), to interact with a database to store the data
(for example, MySQL, free for non-commercial use), which is what I
would expect to manipulate information, and on the same time, PHP
allows to create PDF "on the fly" to be sent by email to the
bureaucrat. And everything comes from an accessible HTML form!!

Unfortunately, that solution is beyond our financial ability to implement, today. Next fiscal year, we will be able to afford it, but not now. Trust me on this - it's not a cop-out, or an excuse, we just don't have the money. But I am, and have always been, and will always be, committed to that goal.
