Hi Dave,

First of all, I disagree with you on your last sentence. There are many
formats as good, or even better than PDF for printing, including Adobe's
own Postscript. The reasons why Adobe decided to market PDF so strongly
are only known to them, although I am able to think of some.

Secondly, the discussion was getting to the point where PDF "was almost
unavoidable", argument which I strongly disagree. I offered to Adam an
affordable solution. My solution is still valid with your argument,
because the "only" thing you need to do is "learn" PDF, and embed the
HTML form results in the PDF form. In any case, the user does not care
about the process because it is server-side. Let's not put the burden on
the  user.
