[DJW:]  
PDF is essentially Postscript but with no user defined
procedures, variables or control structures, i.e. the 
graphics primitives from PostScript with literal arguments.
Added to postscript it has various navigations features.
The normal route to PDF involves interpreing PostScript
and outputting the prmitives that actually produce output.
(Some PDF primitives would normally be defined as functions in
the prologue to a PostScript document.)

I think PDF was largely intended as a simplified PostScript for
the desktop machines of the time that it was developed,
but there may be some reasons to do with better protection of
intellectual property in the content, although I can't work
out what they would be.

[DJW:]  I think I was trying to say that you could also
embed them in the paper form by overprinting, or simply
print out the key data.  If you can afford the 1 to 3 man
weeks per page to program things properly (validation etc.)
you will have only one variant format, so the only bureaucratic
concern would be to do with the legal validity of alternative
medium (does the form filler understand the nuances that were
in the original layout; has he got a signature, etc.)

You can meet all the requirements by spending money on 
developing the web applications, spending money on indivually
printing forms, and spending money on shipping those forms
to the originator for signature.  It's probably arguable 
whether you need to spend more money on supporting people 
filling in the electronic forms than you have to spend on 
people who can't understand the instructions on the printed
forms.
DJW:] 
(The easiest way of embedding into PDF would be to convert the
PDF to Postscript and insert the overlay at the end of the page
and then convert back to PDF, but there would be no real point -
you might as well send the PostScript to a printer (or, as I say,
have the base forma pre-printed)).
