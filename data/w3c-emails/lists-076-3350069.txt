Every single character in the test file for the Adobe
SVG Viewer is individually placed (to produce the arc,
rather than because of microspacing)
<http://www.adobe.com/svg/svgfiles/svgtest.svg>

PDF, from the very begining, has had parameters to tweak
the word and letter spacing, so that individual placement is
not needed, and the PDF coding guidelines say that spaces
should not be simulated by cursor positioning (the spaces need to
be identifiable for cut and paste and searching to work), so PDF 
basically has the same accessibility features in these areas.
I don't believe the real market for SVG and PDF are as different
as Chris believes, and therefore faults that show in PDF 
creation tools to show in those for SVG.

My concern is not so much the current beta state of SVG but
what happens when it comes standard with browsers and every
self proclaimed web design expert starts replacing their
hybrid HTML (table mosaic)/Flash pages with pure SVG ones, and
the popular book writers start producing hints and tip books
with folklore on how to do this sort of thing with no mention
at all of accessibility.  (Doing arched headings is likely to be
one of the first candidates for cook book examples in such 
books.)
