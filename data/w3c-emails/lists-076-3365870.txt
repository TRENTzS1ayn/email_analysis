Yes. I am tempted to produce a revised version of that file that says "its
time for adobe" "to implement text on a path". Since they do not implement
text on a path, they can't do this properly. Actually they could, using
tref instead of text eleents, but they didn't do tha either.

Maybe WAI shouuld start a "DON" "TBR" "EAKMYYWO" RDS" campaign?

I agree that SVG can serve the PDF market. I don't believe (indeed, i have
evidence to the contrary) that SVG is solely restricted to the PDF market.

Well, doing arched examples in SVG is easy. But the current Adobe
implementastion doesn't do them. Other implementations do. Spliting the
text up into individualy place d letters makes the designers job harder,
and makes it tricky to maintain and difficult to localise for different
languages. These practical considerations are likely to help.

Web pages from third parties that examine different ways of achieving the
same effect, and give the impression that peiople who do it a particular
way are cliueless, are also likely to help establish the right memes
ragarding SVG authoring.
