Dear Charles,

I can't say about Netscape 6 because I haven't tried it yet, but other
versions of Netscape are just a plain pain when it comes to web design.  I
design business web sites and when they show up in Opera, Neoplanet,
Explorer...they look great and just as they should.  When I check these
pages through Netscape, it _never_ fails that I have to adjust something and
yes, it does add considerable time to each job.  Netscape renders pages
horribly sometimes.

It really is frustrating and now after what you have said, I dread checking
my sites through the newer version of Netscape.  {{groan}}  I have over 31
sites I have done and I know that they will look great in all the browsers
except Netscape.  I have even had comments about good they look on web TV,
and yes, I design accessibly to the best of my ability.  But Netscape lives
and breathes in a part of cyber-space where mortals should not be allowed to
go.  Only my humble opinion.

Joyce Taylor
