Netscape 6 preview 1 is somewhat outdated as far as Mozilla development
goes. The latest builds <http://www.mozilla.org/> are working pretty well.
Milestone 17 is due anytime and will form the base of Netscape preview/beta
2.

My testing suggests that Mozilla 1.0/Netscape 6.0, Opera 4.01+ and MSIE 5.0+
can all do a good enough job of HTML/CSS sufficient to layout most
requirements to standards (i.e. no 'tweaking' needed).

Once accessibility concern: Mozilla 1.0/Netscape 6.0 use proprietary methods
for generating the UI - buttons, listboxes, menus are drawn by the browser -
not the OS. I presume this means screen readers and other accessibility
devices are going to have trouble hooking into the browser controls.
