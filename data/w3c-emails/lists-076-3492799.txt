Subject: Accessible Image Map Examples


Hi All,

Probably best if folks respond to me privately so as not to flood the list 
but I'm wondering if someone can point me to a web site that is using image 
maps in an accessible fashion.  I know they exist but the sites I frequent 
either don't use them at all or don't do them correctly with respect to 
accessibility and I'm looking for an example to point someone to.

Thanks,

Kelly
