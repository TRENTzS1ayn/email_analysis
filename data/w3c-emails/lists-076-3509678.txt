Hi Zachary:


     Speaking only for myself, as one member of the WAI IG list, my interpretation is that no checkpoint is in any way equivalent to "don't do this" - just make sure that if you do do this, also provide ...
"Alternative" does not mean "replace" but mostly "in addition to"
Images of text cannot be read by screen readers for the blind, so some alternative must be provided in addition to, not in place of such images.

What is the nature of the image?

-Steve
