Dear Group,
Just a short note to announce that my employer (and default email address)
has changed.
I understand that government employee posts to a public listserv are very
much discouraged, so I expect to become much more of a lurker.
I also look forward to having a better opportunity to meet the dot-gov
members in the flesh!
Sincerely,
Bruce Bailey
