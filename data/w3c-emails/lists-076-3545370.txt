[DJW] "... where they simply bulks out the contents"

What does this mean?

WCAG 1.0:
"The guidelines do not suggest avoiding 
images as a way to improve accessibility. Instead, they explain that providing a 
text equivalent of the image will make it accessible. "

My Statement of my interpretation of the checkpoints was 
no checkpoint is of the form "Thou shalt not do ... ",
but rather, "If you do ... then you must also provide ..."
which the above quote from the WCAG 1.0 itself says even more clearly than I.

It is not clear whether anything you raised is directly opposed to this.
