Couple of problems. One is that some text-only systems implement CSS, and
another is that some people are quite happy using a "graphical browser" as a
plain text browser.

So I would avoid the practice in general.

  What do you think about making certain text the same color as the page
  background, if it is intended for users of text-only browsers? I have done
  this with alternate text navigation links, which appear at the bottom of
  each page in a site I'm working on. My reasoning is that they pose an
  unnecessary visual distraction for sighted users, but their color poses no
  barrier to users with impaired vision.
  
  I'd be interested to hear what others think of this practice.
