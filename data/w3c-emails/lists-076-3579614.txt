The more common way of doing this is to use alt text 
on a 1 pixel transparent GIF.

The disadvantage with hiding with colour is that some 
people will override the colours (I had to do this recently
because of a page with particularly poor colour contrasts
<http://www2.btwebworld.com/netgeneration/surft/html/faqs.html>,
and left it off for a while afterwards).

   For more complex cases, you could consider using a
tranparent GIF with <object>, but check this falls back 
properly on object aware browsers with images off.
