[DJW:]  
The priority 1 guideline requires that alt text be provided
for images, However, the priority 2 guideline 3.1 goes beyond
this and puts, what I would consider a SHOULD level requirement,
that images not be used for text where there is appropriate 
text markup.  Where the intention is only to get a particular
font, there is appropriate markup available with CSS, so the
SHOULD requirement applies at priority 2.

I would consider trademarks to be graphics in most cases, even
if they have the appearance of words (although I can think of
cases where they should be treated as text).

Any requiremnt that a particular font is the only one acceptable
rules out even guideline 1.1.  (Marketing departments are often
very insistent on exact fonts and colours, but copyright may prevent
the use of that font as anything except a bitmap, and the font
can be overridden or unsupported.)
