CSS2 and SVG both support defining fonts - SVG allows pretty much any kind of
effeect you can imagine, and the text is still just plain text with the font
applied via a style sheet. Although SVG is only a candidate recommendation
the CSIRO viewer works with fonts.

For more details on SVG see the home page - http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG

  [DJW:]  
  The priority 1 guideline requires that alt text be provided
  for images, However, the priority 2 guideline 3.1 goes beyond
  this and puts, what I would consider a SHOULD level requirement,
  that images not be used for text where there is appropriate 
  text markup.  Where the intention is only to get a particular
  font, there is appropriate markup available with CSS, so the
  SHOULD requirement applies at priority 2.
  
  I would consider trademarks to be graphics in most cases, even
  if they have the appearance of words (although I can think of
  cases where they should be treated as text).
  
  Any requiremnt that a particular font is the only one acceptable
  rules out even guideline 1.1.  (Marketing departments are often
  very insistent on exact fonts and colours, but copyright may prevent
  the use of that font as anything except a bitmap, and the font
  can be overridden or unsupported.)
