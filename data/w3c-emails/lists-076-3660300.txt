It's a hack but not a particularly elegant one, and as an inelegant
hack has the potential to introduce serious problems and confusion.

I suggest that a CSS2 solution would generally work better -- oh, 
and as many people have used the 'same color as the background'
trick to try to fool search engines, using this strategy extensively
*could lead to your site being completely excluded from search
engines*.
