Yeah, I routinely override the colors on websites.  Opera allows
for toolbar toggling of designer styles vs. "my styles" (which are
just default black-on-white-with-blue-and-purple-links), which
means that if someone's got an ugly color scheme, usually it takes
just one touch for me to get rid of it.

I love Opera sometimes. :)
