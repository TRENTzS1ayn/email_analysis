Olympics Web site riddled with blind spots
By Rachel Lebihan, ZDNet Australia


Organizers claim there's no time to make the official Web site of the 2000 
Sydney Games accessible to everyone. One man insists that's not good enough.

Organizers of the Sydney Olympics fought to prove the Games' official Web 
site does not discriminate against the vision-impaired during a lengthy 
examination of the site at a Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission 
hearing on Tuesday.

Complainant Bruce Maguire, who is blind, first made the allegation in June 
1999. Some changes have been made to the site (www.olympics.com), which is 
expected to get 1.4 billion hits, but Maguire maintains that the site 
remains largely inaccessible.
