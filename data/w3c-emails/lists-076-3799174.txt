Hi,

Once the speech output components can make use of this information,
this will be very helpful.  Language changes in the inline level
elements, like in the example below, may not seem too important.
But for block level elements, such as <P>, <BLOCKQUOTE>, etc., this
information will be essential.

I don't know if any browser is using this information currently.
However, I believe IBM Home Page Reader (English version) looks at
the lang attribute on the HTML element, and changes the speech mode
to that language.  This demonstrates the usefullness and the
possibility of implementations that use the language information.
And I'm hoping that the same thing will be done at least for the
block-level elements.

Personally, I can't understand why 4.1 is priority 1 while 4.3 is
priority 3.  I can't remember if there was any discussion on this in
the process of developing the WCAG.  But I think both 4.1 and 4.3
are very important and helpful.

   Cheers,
Max
