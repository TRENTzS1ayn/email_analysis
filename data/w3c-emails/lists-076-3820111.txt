Ooops, I overlooked the words ``place-name'' when I wrote my
privious message.

I think the handling of the proper noun is different depending on
the primary language of the document.  Charles' comments seem to
well-summarize the situation in English while I think it doesn't
necessarily apply to proper nouns in Japanese document.
But the important point is that enough informaiton is provided in
the document so that user/user-agent can determine if that piece of
informaiton should be used.  The problem seems that there currently
isn't no easy way to determine if the word is proper noun.  (of
course, using class attribute could be one solution.)
     Cheers,
Max
