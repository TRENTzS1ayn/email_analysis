I'm doing a site that has numerous large PDF documents. We are offering
both PDF and Word versions. I also want to offoer an accessicble
alternative. Is it better to convert them to straight text documents or to
post them as html. Also, if I save them as web pages in Word and then use
the "clean up Word html" action in Dreamwever3, will this render accessible
html. If not what are the bugs I should look out for.
