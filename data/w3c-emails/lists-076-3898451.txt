Apparently Acrobat 4.05b is supposed to incorporate accessible features
into it.  With JAWS, I've only been able to read the table-of-contents,
but not the body of the document.  I'm hoping that this pans out.  We
have classes of documents that we cannot convert to HTML, due to huge
workload.  Some of these documens are over a 1000 pages of scientific
material with graphics, mathematical forumlas, etc. We use HTML
primarily, but some of the documents we only offer in Acrobat.
