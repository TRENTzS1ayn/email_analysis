I don't hold out much hope of getting away from providing an alternate
version of a pdf document any time soon.
Only the cream of the screenreader crop will be able to utilize the newer
technology they employ and by this I mean the latest and possibly not yet
released versions of those screen readers.  The ones soon to be released
have no support for it.
