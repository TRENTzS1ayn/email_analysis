This is a correction to the announcement of this session that
I posted last week. The session will start at 11:00 A.M. PDT
(not 11 P.M.)

Here is the complete announcement.

There will be a moderated, online chat on Accessibility support
in the Java 2 Platform on Tuesday, August 15, at 11:00 A.M. PDT.
The guests are Peter Korn, Jeff Dunn, and Lynn Monsanto, key members
of Sun's Accessibility team. They'll answer your questions about
Accessibility, especially about recent enhancements to the
Java Accessibility API and Java Accessibility Utilities in J2SE v1.3,
and new Accessibility tools such as the Java Access Bridge and the
Java Accessibility Helper. To join the chat, go to:
http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/community/chat/index.html
On that page, you will also find a tool to convert Pacific time
to your local time.
