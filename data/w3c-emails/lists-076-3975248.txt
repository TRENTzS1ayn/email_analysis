Apologies if this is an inappropriate question for this forum.  I'm 
researching accessibility requirements for a federal web site I work 
on.  We present a lot of tabular data on our web site in Excel 
spreadsheets (Excel only - not in HTML, too) so users can 
download and work directly with the data.  Now that we need to 
comply with Section 508 requirements, and have been trying to 
comply with WAI accessibility guidelines, we want to make sure 
we are providing accessible data.  However, I can't seem to find 
anything that says whether Excel is an accessible file format or 
not.  Can anyone point me in to some resources that might help us 
determine this? 

Thanks,
