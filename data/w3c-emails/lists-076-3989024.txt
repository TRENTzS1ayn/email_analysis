Hi All,

My point in mentioning this issue is not to engage in a debate over which 
presidential candidate should be elected in the U.S. this 
november.  However, in searching for some information about the Democratic 
convention I noticed a link on the page talking about ADA 
Information.  That link leads to the address:

http://www.dems2000.com/adainformation.html

The page states in part:

In the pursuit of an all inclusive and accessible convention, the 
Democratic National Convention has developed its web site to meet ADA Level 
A Conformance
(Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0).

As part of achieving Level A Conformance, for the site, we have added text 
equivalents for all non-text content. We have also added ALT tags so as to 
enable
speech synthesizer software to read text.

This is all well and good but I find it rather sad then to find links 
further down the page which definitely lack alt tags and in one case have 
an alt tag that says something different than where the graphical link 
leads.  Below is the HTML for one section of the page.  You'll notice that 
the first two links are missing alt text and that the link talking about 
coverage graphically mentions day 4 but in text mentions day 1.  This 
template appears to be used on most pages of the site.

Unfortunately I couldn't find a feedback address to comment on this 
situation.  If you are going to tell the world you are living up to a 
certain standard you should ensure that everything you do meets that standard.

Again this isn't the worst example of web accessibility.  Screen readers 
display the untagged text something like:

[link] _images081500/gaveltogavel_081700
[link] BehindtheScenes/06_americandialogues
[link] Click here for Day 1 Coverage
