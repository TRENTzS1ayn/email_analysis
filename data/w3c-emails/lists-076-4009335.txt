Here is an item that I think will be of interest, which I am forwarding from
an email from Cyndi Rowland, Project Manager of Web Accessibility in Mind
(WebAIM):



> The deadline to submit e-testimony to the Web-based Education
> Commission is August 18! This commission was established by Congress to
> develop specific proposals aimed at "ensuring that all learners are able
to
> take full advantage of the World Wide Web." They invite people to testify
> on public policy issues necessary to " help fulfill the educational
promise
> of the Internet."  They can be found at http://www.webcommission.org
> Readers of the WebAIM site are encouraged to provide congress with their
> testimony.
