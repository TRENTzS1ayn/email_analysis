DW:: "Is there any option, when contacting the webmaster fails, for
dealing with a site that claims AAA rating but fails priority 2
checkpoint?"

WL: Probably nothing very satisfactory. HOWEVER, there is hope with the
advent of RDF because we might very well then have a "web of trust" and
even though a site posts a AAA icon anyone interested (and knowing of)
the D. Woolley "truth about accessibility" site can find a believable
list of miscreants abusing the conformance claims' identifier.

Although it is unlikely that W3C/WAI will risk public finger pointing,
there is nothing (except possible libel/slander sorts of things) to
preclude any trusted "authority" from indexing metadata about sites -
especially those who stick their heads high enough to be easily located.
CAST may not want to monitor everybody using their imprimateur, but
others of us might well.
