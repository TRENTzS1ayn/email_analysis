Netscape6 is baced on Open Source Mozilla. This means you can participate in
making this Accessable!  There are a lot of things that are not finished
cooking yet. And we could use your help in many ways. If you code we could use
some help fixing Accessability bugs. If you don't we could use your help
fileing bugs to be fixed. This may already be filed as a bug feel free to check
it out or join  Mozilla and help out.

Here is a link with information on how to file bugs. it is a bit arduious but
it may we worth it if eventully they get fixed.  Bugzilla Helper
