I agree I like the approval icon.  It made it easy on the live side to see
if the page passed.

Dear Group,

I have not seen it mentioned here, but Boby 3.2 is now live and the default
version.  I am not sure when it went up.
My first impression is that the "Advanced Options" have improved, but the
ability to suppress verbose and probably irrelevant warning messages has not
been added.  I could not find any links to earlier version of Bobby.

Most peculiarly, even clean pages no longer register as "Bobby Approved".
The best one can hope for is a (rather buried) message that reads:  <Q>This
web page does not contain any Priority 1 accessibility errors that Bobby can
detect. However, certain items require human judgment; these are listed
below. Please review these items; if none of these apply to your page, it
qualifies for Bobby Approved status.</Q>  No "award" graphic displays at
all.  Pages which fail still get the banner with a big red X through it
though!

Cast now includes a button graphic, but rather than have it at the standard
size of 88x31 they made it 88x33.  I still think the one I made is better
(smaller, easier to read, transparent, the right size, web safe palette,
fewer colors, etc.).  Feel free to steal it from URL:
