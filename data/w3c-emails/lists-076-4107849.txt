I (and a few other people) have worked on different things required for
making conformance claims in RDF. If these are made on the web, and are
searchable (there is quite a lot of work being done to make sure this happens
for RDF) then it should become relatively simple to publish a discoverable
counter-claim. The question of whose claim to trust then is of course an
issue, but more a social one than a technical one, in my opinion.

  the D. Woolley "truth about accessibility" site can find a believable

  Although it is unlikely that W3C/WAI will risk public finger pointing,
  there is nothing (except possible libel/slander sorts of things) to
  preclude any trusted "authority" from indexing metadata about sites -
  especially those who stick their heads high enough to be easily located.
  CAST may not want to monitor everybody using their imprimateur, but
  others of us might well.
