When I looked today, I discovered another new redesign of the
W3C site, http://www.w3.org/ -- there's a link at the bottom
that asks for comments:

BEGIN QUOTE
W3C Site Comments Welcome
We welcome your comments and suggestions on this page in the
site comments discussion forum.
END QUOTE

The link is to http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/site-comments/
which isn't really a "discussion forum" but a public archive
of the site comments distribution list.  It doesn't seem to
tell -how- to contribute your comments (a serious problem in
documentation/usability), but from context it appears you can
send your comments to:

      site-comments@w3.org

It would be interesting to hear what users with disabilities
think of the accessibility of this site, as well as general
comments about the appearance and usability of the W3C site.

Disclaimer:  I'm not a W3C person asking for this, I'm just
someone who's noticed this and is nosy.  This isn't an official
request from the W3C at all, although they -have- requested
input via the notice on the bottom of the page.
