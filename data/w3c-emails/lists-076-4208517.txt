I don't think we disagree anywhere on that. :)  However, the
attitude of "I'll decide what's best for you" isn't really
intrinsic to the web way of thinking, and often that attitude
(if not this particular practice here) can lead to problems,
such as "well, blind people don't NEED that information."

Obviously we are dealing with subtleties and shades of gray
and not black-and-white, and a happy medium between the choice
of the author and the needs of the audience has to be struck
and any responsible author (such as Ian) is already thinking
along such lines. :)
