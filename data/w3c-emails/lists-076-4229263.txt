I generally stay clear of discussions on the WAI listservs due to time
limitations...but I found this discussion intriguing enough to toss in a
thought or two....

Jakob Nielsen, in his book, "Designing Web Usability" makes two interesting
points (amongst several) in Chapter 1, pages 14 and 15, under the section,
"Why Everbody Designs Websites Incorrectly":

Point 1: "Information architecture: structuring the site to mirror the way
company is structured. Instead, the site should be structured to mirror the
users' tasks and THEIR views of the information space." (uppercase letters
are mine)

Point 2: "Content authoring: writing in the same linear style as you've
always written. Instead, force yourself to write in the new style that is
OPTIMIZED FOR ONLINE READERS who frequently scan text and who need very
short pages with secondary information relegated to supporting pages."

Like Nielsen, I am in favor of user-centered structure. It's no doubt very
difficult for the author (or web content designer) to relinquish this
"right". But the fact is, the user controls the user agent. If you want the
user to come back, stay, peruse, or purchase, design your site for them.

As Kynn notes, there is no exact algorithm for determining information
importance for every user. But, as users, we tend to be creatures of habit
(cultural differences notwithstanding) and, as such, we perform tasks using
similar formulas and methods that can be easily captured and subsequently
presented on web sites.

Still, I think that Kynn's methodology is one that favors the author, not
the user. Kynn notes, "Okay, so how do I adapt that for someone who is
experiencing the page in a linear function?  Easy -- I decide what is most
important on the page and I place that first, and then the rest in
decreasing order of importance." (By the way, Kynn also notes that

I think the better way to approach this is through user walk-throughs. By
testing users (with and without disabilities) we can better understand how
information should be presented both in its graphical and textual
presentation. Following the walkthrough testing, implement the design.
Through iterative testing (generally 2 or 3 iterations are sufficient) you
should be able accomplish your purpose.
