Is the W3C homepage an example of  dynamically generated pages suiting the
user?

I had assumed that ie5,lynx and netscape4.7 linux would all represent the
w3c homepage in a similar manner.

Far from it.
Lynx and netscape have been selected to present the technologies section
near the top left whereas ie5 places it near the bottom right.
Hence the precedence of WAI changes somewhat.

Perhaps the grossest coding difference is represented by the table layout.

netscape:
>>    <table summary="Layout table: The first cell contains a navigation bar
of
W3C technologies, the second contains news, and the third another
navigation bar of W3C pages."

whereas ie5 :
>>    <table summary="Layout table: The first cell contains the body of the
page, the second a navigation bar."

I have not found it feasible to identify all the differences in coding, and
have hence attached sources for ie5 and netscape4.7
