The page is not generated, nor is there browser sniffing.

Please try not to read too much into the design. We use a LINK
element at the top so that Lynx users will have access to the
list of links, or the news, or the links to other pages, or the

I don't know what you mean when you say that IE5 places the
technologies section at the bottom right. Perhaps we have
a mirroring problem for I see essentially the same rendering
on NN and IE.
