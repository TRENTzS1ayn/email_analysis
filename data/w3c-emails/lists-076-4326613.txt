Ian you don't seem to be taking my comments seriously, I don't have time to
waste. The content is similar the rendering very different.

I posted both copies of the code as attachments, clicking them in ie5
clearly shows the differences. I wonder why?

If you have different code, please post it.

I don't know what you mean when you say that IE5 places the
technologies section at the bottom right. Perhaps we have
a mirroring problem for I see essentially the same rendering
on NN and IE.
