Jonathan,

The two files you enclosed are two versions of the home page.
The one labeled "ie5.html" is the version prior to 24 August. The one
labeled "netscape4.7" is the one we installed on 24 August. 

As I said in my previous email, we may have a mirroring problem
if you are getting two files served differently. Or, you may simply
have copied the files before and after we made the change to the home 
page. 

I have run a command on the Web server that I hope ensures
that the home page has been mirrored correctly. I recommend that
you point your browsers at http://www.w3.org/ and try again.

 - Ian
