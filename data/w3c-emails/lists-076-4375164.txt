Come on Ian,
There is little point in asking me for where my evidence is if you cannot
provide your own.
A fair percentage of the 131 messages are merely junk mail and should not
even be listed.
Perhaps you don't you have time to remove them? I will for a reasonable fee,
$5 say.

Members of the public are hardly likely to answer your request for comments,
they will already have moved on.
You need to get out there and pester.
Print your homepage, take it out on to the street.
Stop people, and ask them what it is all about.
It seems you'll get a nasty shock.
