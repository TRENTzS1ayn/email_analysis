I find it hard to imagine it would really take 368 days to make the web 
site accessible.

Olympic site must race for blind accessibility
By Rachel Lebihan, ZDNet Australia


Sydney Olympic Games organisers say it will "not be possible" to make the 
official Web site accessible to the blind before the Opening Ceremony -- 
despite an order from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission 
(HEREOC).

"This would cost in excess of AU$2 million and 368 working days to 
complete," a Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) 
spokesperson told ZDNet Australia.
