I don't think anyone has statistics on this, but a very common scenario for
blind people is to use Internet Explorer 5 or 5.5 with Jaws for Windows,
Window-Eyes, or another screen reader supporting Microsoft Active
Accessibility.  Also, the next version of HPR will be based on IE5 rather
than Netscape.  These screen readers function somewhat like Lynx, in that
they capture HTML from the browser, usually decolumnize any tables they
find, and in the case of Jaws give you some information about the rows and
columns of a table.  The latest versions of Lynx, by the way, can take a
really simple data table and display its rows in a nice way, which I think
is an improvement for screen reader users.  Lynx will not do this new table
rendering if a table row cannot fit across the current display width, so it
never does a table rendering when tables are being used for layout.  

Hope this helps.
