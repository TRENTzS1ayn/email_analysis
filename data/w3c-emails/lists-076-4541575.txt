[DJW:] The fact that converting headings 
from HTML to XML (in the form of
XHTML) is a non-problem makes me think 
that there is either a misunderstanding of 
XML behind the question or there is more to
the question that has been given here.

Could you please explain why translating
<h2>text</h2> into <h2>text</h2> doesn't 
meet your requirments.

On the more general question, both 
HTML Tidy and Amaya, both referenced from
the W3C web site, should be able to 
convert valid, almost valid, and in the
case of Tidy) somewhat broken, HTML into
XHTML, i.e. an instance of XML.
