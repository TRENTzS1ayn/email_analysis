Hi all,

at the url
              http://194.243.229.40/default.htm

you find an experimental website, in italian language, set up to test
programs for automatically creating accessible webpages and whole sites,
with only
limited manual interventions.

The group would highly appreciate your visits, tests and considerations
about the
ongoing work.

We are preparing also a website for our web-designers, containing
informations and tools regarding web-accessibility.
The url is:
              http://194.243.229.40/waiinps

Thanks for cooperation, comments and hints
Anton Auer
