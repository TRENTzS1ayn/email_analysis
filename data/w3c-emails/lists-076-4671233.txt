this was somewhat my point but when reading media, we usually refer to
it as assimilation of text? To put it another way, how can an animation
be read aloud?  you can describe it outloud, but that is not the same as
a one to one correspondence as with text.  I do not miss the point here
though that strides towards higher comprehention and interaction are
being made.
