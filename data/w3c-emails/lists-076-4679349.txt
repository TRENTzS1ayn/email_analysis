I know you understand, and I count on it.  This is what in the literature
on leadership is termed 'vision' -- the ability to think in terms of what
is possible but not obvious.

Please pardon the pedantry of my next [following] blast.

It could have been summed up in terms of thinking of the scenario of
reading a children's book to a young child.  The person reading the book
ususally both voices the text and talks about the pictures.  But at a
summary level, at the level of aggregation of the whole book, we still
refer to this as "reading the book."
