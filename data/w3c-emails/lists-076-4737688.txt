Ah, but you seem to be including "aloud" in the phrase above.  There's
no guarantee that "reading" can be directly translated into "aloud"
in English usage -- "reading" is an input action, and "aloud" is an
output action, so "reading aloud" is a composite action.

An animated gif can be -read-.  Reading it -aloud- is a different
matter and depends more on the ability to vocalize than it does
on the ability to read.
