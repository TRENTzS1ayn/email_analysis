Campaign of Collection of Signatures

 Accessible Internet for ALL

Starting from September 4 2000, it starts the campaign of collection of
signatures for an accessible Internet for ALL

The campaign, seeks to pick up signatures in an electronic way with the
purpose of demanding to the pertinent organisms that it is guaranteed that
Internet is accessible for all the people. This initiative is promoted by
the Seminar of Initiatives on Disability and Accessibility in the Net
(SID@R), of the Real Patronage of Prevention and of Attention to People with
Handicaps.

The services through the web are more and more necessary for the daily life
of the citizens: virtual administration, bank services, eComerce, formation
at distance, etc.; therefore it is legitimate to demand that this services
are accessible for ALL. That which includes to the older people, as to
people with disabilitys, the same as to those that have old electronic
equipment or slow connections.

To sign the petition it is necessary to enter in:

Those that have a Web page can also collaborate in an active way placing a
banner or announcement in their page that connects with the form of
collection of signatures. Several banner models offer to the Webmaster in:

Any internauta could help to promote the campaign sending its friends a
virtual post card from the page: http://www.sidar.org/cards /

Let us work to be able to consent to the society of the information in the
future.
