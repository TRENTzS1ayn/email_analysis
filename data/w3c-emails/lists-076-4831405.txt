It terrifies me to witness people driving with one hand and speaking into a mobile with the other.

Yet I occassionally witness people, who feel the need to tuck their phone under a cheek, and gesture with both hands.

Who cares about the bath water? Let's get over the weeding.

my favourite book references have been online for a while: http://www.signbrowser.org.uk/camitalk you'll need to read the talk first, the references are at the end.
