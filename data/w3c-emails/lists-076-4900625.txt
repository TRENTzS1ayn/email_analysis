These pages are generated dynamically using Cold Fusion. The extension is
.cfm. I presume that the server is sending them out as text/html (I have no
idea why it would do otherwise). If you or someone else can look at this
site in Mac with IE and let me know if you see the generated source code or
the page, I'd know whether it was a general Mac IE problem (let's hope not)
or a problem with my friend's set-up.

Is there an easy way to check the headers of pages? They don't appear when
you View > Source. Properties, maybe?
