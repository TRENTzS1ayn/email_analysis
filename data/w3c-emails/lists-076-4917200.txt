Results of a cursory site check for http://ucitd.com in Internet Explorer
for Macintosh:

5.0     site renders well

4.5     gaps in table

4.01   gaps in table

3.01   gaps in table, table cell background does not appear, does display
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> at top of page.

Your friend's trouble would appear to be due to a browser misconfiguration.

Yours,

Zac Mutrux
