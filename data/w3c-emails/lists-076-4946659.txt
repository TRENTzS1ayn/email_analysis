Hello,
I have a question about cookies. I have heard that they should not be used
in order to have an accessible website. However, I have not been able to
find anything at the WAI on this subject. Can anyone lead me to information
on the subject of cookies and accessibility, and how they are linked?
Thanks,
Shane Anderson
