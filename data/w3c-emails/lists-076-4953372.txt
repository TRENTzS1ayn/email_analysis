I think the main problem is that not all browsers out there support
cookies -- older versions of Lynx, for example, and some early web
browsers for people with visual disabilities, have no support for
cookies.

However, it should be pointed out that this is a limitation of old
technology more than it really is an actual accessibility hurdle.
Cookies themselves are just one technology which isn't inherently
inaccessible -or- accessible.

Any site which uses cookies should also account for the fact that
cookies can be turned off, deleted, unsaved, rejected, or otherwise
not use "as desired" -- regardless of whether or not the user is a
person with a disability.  As such, a well-planned site has alternate
options to cookies available when required.
