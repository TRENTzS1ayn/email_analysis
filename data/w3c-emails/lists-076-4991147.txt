Dear Paul and all:

First of all, our list is NEVER meant to be publicly available. As stated
when you fill
the form, your data are protected by the Spanish legislation LORTAD, which
explicitly
restrains the use of collected data for anything else that the objectives
stated when
collected. Our objective is to present to the Spanish parliament and other
regulatories
bodies a petition to pass a law similar to section 508 in the States.
Portugal carried out
a similar initiative with success a few months ago. Furthermore, we
represent SIDAR, which
is an organism part of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs to further
ensure your
privacy and avoid any attempt to make commercial use of the collected data.

We open our petition internationally because such petitions have a better
chance to
influence politicians when it is shown an international support for the
petition.

I hope this explanation will eliminate any doubts.

Regards,
Emmanuelle

Dear all,

I request you to give the maximum diffusion possible to the following
information:


Campaign of Collection of Signatures

 Accessible Internet for ALL

Starting from September 4 2000, it starts the campaign of collection of
signatures for an accessible Internet for
ALL...............................................



Well call me cynical, call me cruel, call me nasty, whilst I openly support
all action to promote accessibility, this would produce a ready made active
email list that any software producing company would die for, correction,
kill for. And you wish to publish this? I get very few spams on a weekly
basis, and even they are too many, I get a strong feeling that these would
increase once your list was made public. Have you thought this
through?................err.........if not....(can I have the UK marketing
rights?)
