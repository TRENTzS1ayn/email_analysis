[DJW:]  This page is invalid because it claims to
be simultaneously in UTF-8 and ISO 8859/1.  I'd
only consider the latter as accessible, especially
as there is not charset in the HTTP headers, so 
pre HTML 4.0 browser will default to 8859/1. 
(Syntax not checked.)

[DJW:]  lynx -head, which gives:

Note, this may not produce the same result as a GET for
some dynamic pages, so is not 100% reliable.
