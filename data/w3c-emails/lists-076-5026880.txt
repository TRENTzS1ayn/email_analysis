I wouldn't assume this.  There's nothing about "HTML tricks",
Javascript/DHTML, Flash, SMIL, or SVG that's inherently
inaccessible.  In fact, in many cases, a well done Flash
animation or DHTML effect can IMPROVE the accessibility of
a site, _for certain audiences_.

Let's not be too quick to condemn useful technology with the
label of "maximizing the inaccessibility" -- nothing about the
use of DHTML, Flash, etc. guarantees inaccessibility any more
or less than the use of HTML itself does!
