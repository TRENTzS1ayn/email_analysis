The HTML Writers Guild created the Accessible Web Authoring
Resources and Education Center -- acronym "AWARE" -- last
year as part of our annual web accessibility month in April.

Our web site is reachable at the following addresses:

      http://aware.hwg.org/
      http://www.awarecenter.org/

(Why two addresses?  Some people have problems figuring out
what the first one is supposed to represent, as "it doesn't
start with www!" -- we have also registered the .com and
.net domains, so you can reach us at awarecenter.com too.)

The purpose of the AWARE Center is to provide a "friendly
starting point" for web designers, developers, and authors to
learn about the issues and techniques related to web
accessibility.  We have a specific audience in mind -- people
who make web sites -- and a special goal -- making them more
informed about web accessibility and the role they play in
making web pages easier to use by everyone.

As it's time for "fall cleaning", we're going to be doing some
updates of the site:  Cleaning out old links, adding new ones,
possibly reorganizing sections of the site, and generally tidying
things up, so we can better serve our audience and meet our
goals.

I'd like to ask your help in meeting those goals, by asking you
to critique our site and offer advice, suggestions, and feedback
about the content on our site, and how we can improve our service
to our audience.  If you have any suggestions regarding the AWARE
Center web site, please email them to:

      aware@hwg.org

Thank you in advance for your assistance!
