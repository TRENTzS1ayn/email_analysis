However, the audience for this sort of thing, when
it appears in books, is generally people who
want cook book solutions to improving their ability
to impress people with spending power, rather than
their ability to convey information to everyone that
might want that information.  Generally such people
either have no concept of an accessibility issue, or
believe that adding accessibility will cost them
money, and probably compromise the effect of the site,
without gaining them money

If the conference really is there to put across
an accessibility angle, I think the re-post to the
WAI list should have specifically pointed that out.

The specific problem with HTML tricks is that
they treat particular browsers as thin clients, rather
than working within the defined semantics of the language.
You can use them to provide better fallbacks, but I think
this is rare.

Things like flash tend to be used either as pure
ornamentation, or to control a selling process such that
the prospect only gets the intended message.  They could
be used to really explain things, but that can often be
done by using them in simple and obvious ways.

Although I must admit I generally reject Flash, I don't think
I've ever come across a site where it looked as though 
it would help me, and I generally find it correlates with
sites which are difficult to navigate and contain little
information.
