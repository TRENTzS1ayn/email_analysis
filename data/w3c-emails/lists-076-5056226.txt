In other words, they're the target audience for WAI and other
web accessibility education efforts. :)

By labeling their -pet tech toys- as inaccessible, rather
than the -mindset-, we risk major confusion regarding what
we're trying to convey.  In truth, "HTML Tricks", Flash, or
DHTML is _not_ the threat; the threat is webmasters who don't
understand how to use them properly.

If we make sweeping statements that "DHTML is bad" or "Flash
is useless and hinders accessibility", then we are _forcing_
web designers to think they have to make a choice between
"being accessible" or "not compromising my site".  And
that's exactly why people think "well, either I can use
Flash, and reach my primary target audience with an optimized
user experience for them, or I can be 'accessible' and 
be unable to use Flash."

A more correct vision of the web is that it's ENTIRELY
POSSIBLE to use any of those technologies, as long as you
make sure the -content- is available in some other way.
By this approach, there really are no "inaccessible
technologies", because we are talking about _content_ not
about the forms that content is expressed in.
