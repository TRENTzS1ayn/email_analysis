[DJW:]  
In the context of books and conferences, I'd
say the real threat was authors and speakers
who pander to the "wants" of such people.  I 
don't know the speakers in this conference, but
most books and many authoring web site fall in 
that category.

[DJW:]  
I find it interesting to note that such a statement
is usually made about PDF (actually, on the
sort of site that is likely to use flash etc., it is the
PDF that is likely to contain real information, not the
HTML - I tend to treat the HTML as a hazard to navigation
in finding the PDF).
