BTW, just since it's semi-topical, I feel the "policeman" motif
and metaphor for Bobby is rather sadly mischosen...I feel there's
a negative aspect associated with the idea of Bobby "policing"
Web like some sort of "accessibility cop" instead of being a
useful tool for self-analysis.  It's unfortunate that an image
of authority and law enforcement was selected and is the most
visible "public face" of the Web accessibility movement.
