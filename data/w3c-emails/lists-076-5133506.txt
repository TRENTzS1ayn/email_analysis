Kynn --

Your view may be correct -- unfortunately, you're also fighting the market
presence of the Bobby brand. I'll wager that the public at large knows more
about who/what Bobby is than they do about CAST....I wouldn't change the
name or the icon at this point. Wait until market maturity has maxed out,
then make the change.
