Mike,

I completely agree with both you and Kynn. Though the name is, at times,
problematic, it is a very recognizable brand that is known in the broader
community.

There have been extremely strong rumors that CAST is planning to drop the
Bobby name entirely, for these reason\s. I believe that this would be an
extreme disservice to the whole web accessibility "cause".

Kynn --

Your view may be correct -- unfortunately, you're also fighting the market
presence of the Bobby brand. I'll wager that the public at large knows more
about who/what Bobby is than they do about CAST....I wouldn't change the
name or the icon at this point. Wait until market maturity has maxed out,
then make the change.

- Mike
