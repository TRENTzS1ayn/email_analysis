I think the litmus test is how industry reacts; frankly, I have never heard
anyone complain about the image or the name. The fact that CAST has received
industry support from Sun, IBM, Microsoft, and Mitsubishi is also a strong
indication that the name suits them fine.

I understand Kynn's feelings on the matter and, from a philosphical
standpoint, I agree. But this is all business to me -- and "our" business
mission is to build awareness and develop creative accessibility
initiatives. Bobby clearly fits that model.

After all, which do you remember? The NCAM web access symbol or the Bobby
constable! (Insert smiley face here!)

Kynn --

Your view may be correct -- unfortunately, you're also fighting the market
presence of the Bobby brand. I'll wager that the public at large knows more
about who/what Bobby is than they do about CAST....I wouldn't change the
name or the icon at this point. Wait until market maturity has maxed out,
then make the change.
