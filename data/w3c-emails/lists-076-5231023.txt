You guys play rough -- and I agree with both sides of the discussion.

The Bobby icon is now widely recognized, was not intended to represent
authority, and is problematic now that Bobby is used on every continent.  We
realize that some Websites avoid using the icon because it is a cop or, in
some cases, because it seems too goofy.  It is true that Bobby is more well
known than CAST, a small not-for-profit educational technology R & D
organization.

Briefly, the Bobby icon was originally intended to represent the friendly
English cop on the beat prepared to prevent problems before they occur.
Only later did it occur to us that an English cop might be viewed as a
symbol of authority or even imperialism in some parts of the world.  We had
modest expectations at the time.

We have commissioned the design of a new icon and it will be available soon
but we do not intend to change the name of the accessibility tool.  Bobby
will remain Bobby.  Your comments are appreciated and confirm our own
concerns with the current icon.  I sort of wish we could keep but its gotta
go.

By the way, I thought that Bobby got a pretty good review in the 9/4/00 GNC
at
http://www.gcn.com/vol19_no26/news/2841-1.html.  The author told me that it
was highly unusual for Government Computer News to evaluate freeware.
