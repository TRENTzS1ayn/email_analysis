The htmldesigners list has moved from egroups.com to mlists.com
to avoid the annoying front-loading egroups ads.  Here's a
description of the list:

The html-designers' mailing list is a list for the dissemination of
techniques that blind professional and personal web page designers
can use to make their job as designers easier. It is a place for the
discussion of html editors, the use of screen readers with this
software, configurations to make this software work better, and html
accessibility. Discussion on scripting such as java, vb, and cgi
using adaptive reading technology is welcomed.


To subscribe, send email to majordomo@mlists.com with a blank
subject line and a message body of "subscribe htmldesigners".
BTW, please note that I am the site admin but not the list owner;
that's Frank, who can be reached at owner-htmldesigners@mlists.com
