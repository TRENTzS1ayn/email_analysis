I don't know how WAI is addressing the issue of crashes.

This site causes Netscape to close, and I have had to rewrite this email
as a result.
http://www.the-times.co.uk/
also:
http://www.simplyorganic.net/

These are examples of a fairly rare event, though it is repeatable.
Do we offer some advice on this?

Perhaps I should change a setting?
