Hmmm.

There are a couple of areas of respnsibility for this, but in general they
fall outside WAI work. Those that fall to a certain extent inside are about
making the page valid, as part of meeting content guidelines (this is also
backed up by authoring tool guidelines). For very good reasons the rule in
XML is to not process a page that is not either valid  or well-formed.

But actually crashing is a responsibility of the software designers, and is
not so much an accessibiltiy problem as a general software problem - the
degree of impact on people with particular conditions may be higher, but
"make a robust piece of software that works" is not really an accessibility
guideline in my opinion. It is worth noting that it may also be a problem in
the underlying system rather than either the page viewed or the browser.

  This site causes Netscape to close, and I have had to rewrite this email
  as a result.

  These are examples of a fairly rare event, though it is repeatable.
  Do we offer some advice on this?
  
  Perhaps I should change a setting?
