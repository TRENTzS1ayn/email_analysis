Hi All,

Terry, (who is my main web designer) has placed a small request (nervously) 
for comments on the accessibility of ten-20.com web site in  our discussion 
group. Whilst we have tested the site, as Dave Woolley quite rightly 
pointed out to me recently there are still an abundance of older software 
programs in every day use that may struggle. We need to identify these and 
attempt to correct. The link to the request 
is  http://www.ten-20.com/bbsgroup/messages/44.html  and before I start 
getting hate mail, I promise I never shouted at her. I may have nagged her 
a bit.............

Kindest regards in anticipation.
Paul Davis
