Please forgive me if this question has been posted on this list before, but
I am in dire need of information on the accessibility of pdf files in Adobe
Acrobat. I would like to know if anyone has ever heard of using software
called Adobe Acrobat Capture 3.0 for added accessibility of pdf files...this
accessibility would have something to do with a higher OCR for the document
it scans and therefore allow screen readers to take advantage of the clearer
and more accurate text from the document. I know that Capture 3.0 allows for
more documents in to be scanned in less time but I need to know if it adds
something for accessibility of screen readers.
 
Any help would be greatly appreciated...
