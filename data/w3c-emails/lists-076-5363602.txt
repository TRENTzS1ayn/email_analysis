The HTML Writers Guild is proud to co-sponsor the Universal Web
Accessibility Symposium 2000, to be held on October 31, 2000 in
conjunction with the WebNet 2000 World Conference on the WWW
and Internet in San Antonio, Texas.  Speakers will include the
director of the Guild's Accessible Web Authoring Resources and
Education (AWARE) Center.

The Universal Web Accessibility Symposium will address the
legal and technical requirements for universal accessibility
to the Internet, and will explore the connections between access
by aging adults (the fastest-growing demographic group using 
the Web) and physically challenged individuals.  Specific topics
include:

       * Resources to make information originators' job
         responsibilities clearer regarding accessibility
       * Legal mandates for universal accessibility
       * Verification standards for web accessibility
       * Web accommodation techniques for seniors and
         physically challenged individuals

Speakers will include Cynthia Waddell, ADA Coordinator for the
City of San Jose (and AWARE Center advisory board member); Dinah
Cowen, Director of the Department of Defense Computer/Electronic
Accommodations Program;  LTC John Hill and LTC Curt Carver,
Assistant Professors, West Point; Cyndi Rowland, Director of Web
Accessibility In Mind (WebAIM), Utah State University; Kynn
Bartlett, AWARE Center Director, HTML Writers Guild; and others!

This Symposium is sponsored by the Association for the Advancement
of Computing in Education (AACE), Southwest Texas State University
College of Health Professionals, the HTML Writers Guild, and the
Institute for Quality Improvement in Long Term Health Care at
Southwest Texas State University.  Mette Baker is the Program
Coordinator, and Dr. Deanie French is the Program Chair.
