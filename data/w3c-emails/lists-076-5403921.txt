[DJW:]  
Until last week, there was a licensing conflict that
prevented the redistribution of SSL Lynx, but not of the
patches and Lynx independently.  Commercial use would
have required royalty payments in the USA, and possibly
other countries.

The patent on RSA has now expired, and the Lynx mailing 
list is currently considering the implications.  There
are still some issues to do with US export legislation,
although this probably amounts to getting the electronic
paperwork straight, as the export controls on opoen source
software were greatly relaxed early this year; SSL Lynx
would not have been exportable this time last year.

Note the copyright on RSAREF is probably still valid, so
previous US builds are probably still non-redistributable,
but an OpenSSL version should be.

NB.  some of the symmetric ciphers that can be used in SSL
may be still in patent, but (IANAL) I believe that DES and
triple DES are out of patent and that MD5 is royalty free.

SSL, itself, is patented (by Netscape), but royalty free.
RSA was not royalty free for commercial users, and Lynx's
GPL requires the software to be royalty free for all
potential users.
