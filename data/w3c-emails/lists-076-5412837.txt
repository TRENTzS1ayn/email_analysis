One other point to bear in mind is that some 
web sites insist on specific browsers being used
for SSL.  Part of the reasoning for this is that
they want someone to blame if there is a security
breach.  Some Lynx users forge the User Agent to
get into those site, but, in my view, anyone doing
so would be at risk of being accused of fraud (the
sites tend to be financial organisations).

(There is a tradeoff here between the fact that there
is a company with a reputation to protect behind
commercial browsers and the open source nature of
things like Lynx allowing independent verification.
In these plug and play days, it would not be difficult
for someone to distribute a compromised binary of an
open source program.)

IANAL
