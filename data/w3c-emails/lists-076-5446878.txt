[DJW:]  
Before last week, your only option would have been
to compile it from source yourself (or use a local
proxy).  You are asking a question at a time when
what you want to do is just becoming legally possible;
if you are unable to compile from sources, you should
find that someone does produce a copyright safe re-
distributable version in the next week or two.

Please be patient and either trace http://lynx.browser.org/
or subscribe to lynx-dev@sig.net (the latter will be a
more up to date source of information).
