Rima,

  I may be able to provide some help. Are you asking about using Capture to scan documents and create more accessible PDF files? Or do you already have PDF files that you want to make more accessible, and you want to know whether you can use Capture to transform them?
  In the first case, you can use Capture to produce a Searchable Image PDF or a Formatted Text & Graphics PDF, and these will definitely be more accessible.
  If you are trying to improve the accessibility of an existing PDF file, you can use Capture, but the resulting file may be more or less accessible than the original. The results might be worse because Capture would effectively "re-OCR" the PDF file, and this may introduce errors.
