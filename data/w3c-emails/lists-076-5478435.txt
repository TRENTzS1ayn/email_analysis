Hi All,

Microsoft is previewing a one-stop piece of software for accessing the net, 
playing audio and more at <http://preview.msn.com>.  In reviewing the help 
for the program I noticed that they urge web designers to comply with 
accessibility standards of the WAI.  Of course the help, which was written 
in HTML, didn't comply with those standards.
