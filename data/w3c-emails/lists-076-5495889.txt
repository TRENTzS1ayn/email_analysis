A couple weeks ago we had a conversation about bookshelf contents;
someone asked what's on mine.  Here's the URI to a web page I just
put up, listing the books physically behind me on the shelf right
now:

      http://kynn.com/books/

Enjoy!

If you've got a favorite book or set of books -- and it's on topic
for the WAI list -- I'd like to hear.
