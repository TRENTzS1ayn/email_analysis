Please note draft redesign of WAI home page at 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/WAI-homeA.html
Also includes new sub-pages: Resources, News, Contacts, About,
Participation, etc.

The Education and Outreach Working Group has been working on this for some
time; everything's still not in place but we'd like your feedback.

FOR COMMENTS: 

** Please send comments to w3c-wai-eo@w3.org, with subject line starting:
"WAI Home:"

PLEASE STATE: 

1. what browser version(s) and/or assistive technologies you are using
2. any immediate _problems_ with how the page works for you
3. things you might like to see in the future, with additional redesign
efforts.

Thank you,

- Judy
