I agree with this; if you can "untable" something you should be
able to "retable" it.  Likely this would require a programming
fix to the script which does the unwrapping.

The term "unwrap" is unfamiliar to me, as applied to tables; I don't
recall seeing this before.  This may be confusing to users, and 
especially note:

      "Tables" is geekspeak; it's an HTML tag.  _Users_ (who are not
      web developers) will think in terms of "columns" not of "tables."

Of course, you don't "unwrap" columns, so that word will have to go
as well.  Instead, how about "Single Column Layout" or something
similar?

>I think that the "search" selection in the navbar could be the exception to conforming to the others' compliance with the notion of staying on the page with a navbar selection. I think "search" is clearly a certain function and that the current plan makes one do two clicks to get to the entry field of the search.

In fact, I'd go so far as to say that instead of the first
"Search" link, there should be a (properly labeled) input
box and a submit button to allow searching right from the
top page, instead of requiring multiple clicks until a
search can be started.  (I feel this is a must-have for
the top page, and a "would be nice" for subsequent pages
on the site.)

More comments later.
