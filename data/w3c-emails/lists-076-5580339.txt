Chantilly, Va. -  AbleTV.net, the first web-based global TV network for people
with disabilities, and a network affiliate of TVWorldwide .com , will enable
its communities to participate in the President Clinton?s Digital Divide trip
focusing on opportunities for Americans with disabilities on Thursday,
September 21 in Flint, Michigan through interactive captioned video streaming.
Abletv.net?s technique known as ?Webcapting? developed in cooperation with
TVWorldwide.com, is being successfully deployed to caption a live video
streaming signal of the activities at the digital divide at www.abletv.net
beginning at 2 PM, EDT. The webcast is being made possible through the
sponsorship of Sun Microsystems, iCan.com, and Crossmedia Networks Corporation.

The event is part of President Clinton?s initiative to bridge the digital
divide and create digital opportunity for all Americans. This event will
highlight the importance of ensuring that new information and communications
technologies are accessible to and usable by the 54 million Americans with
disabilities. As with previous trips, the President will announce concrete
actions by the government and the private sector that will help ensure that
people with disabilities are full participants in the Information Age. The
President is traveling to Flint to highlight several model programs that are
empowering people with disabilities by providing access to cutting-edge
technology, increasing employment opportunities, and allowing people with
disabilities to acquire new skills using distance learning.

Sixteen years after losing his eyesight to illness, AbleTV President Jeff
Pledger said he is proud of the benefits webcapting technology is bringing to
over 54 million Americans and 750 million worldwide for people with
disabilities.  This event is very important to our communities,? stated Pledger
?We wanted to provide Americans with disabilities the chance to become full
participants in the activities. So far, the feedback from those with
disabilities has been overwhelming and positive.?
?The ?webcapting? we did was a success at the 2000 Democratic Convention and we
are preparing to support such huge participation again from this community,?
commented Dave Gardy, Chairman and CEO of TVWorldwide.com. ?It?s events like
this that make AbleTV.net one of our most popular Internet TV channels.?
