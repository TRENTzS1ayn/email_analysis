By the way, on my personal web site (http://kynn.com/), I use
text + HTML + CSS to create a "WCAG button" instead of the
graphic provided by the WAI for that purpose.

Anyone want to argue that I've proven that the WAI graphic
itself violates this checkpoint? :)  There _is_ definitely an
argument to be made, but I am not convinced of it. ;)
