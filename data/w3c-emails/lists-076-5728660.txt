As I see it, level 1 gives a lot of tolerance to
typical commercial use of HTML as a page description
language, but levels 2 and 3 require more and more 
rigid adherence to the orginal philosophy of HTML as
an information markup language.

As such, the fact that this requirement is at level 
two makes me think it is meant to be taken fairly
literally.

Modern HTML plus style sheets allows a lot of input
to the visual styling without having to use GIFs of
the text (although there are problems, like intellectual
property restrictions on scaleable fonts, and the lack
of a clean fallback mechanism for BUTTON elements, and
broken implementation of, at least, the latter).

Actually, even from the point of view of someone with
adequate vision and 128K+ access to the net, text as
graphics is almost always a barrier to access to the site
because of the time it takes to load on the first access
to the page.

[DJW:]  It's definitely a barrier, and I would say
it was even a significant one - in any case, HTML 
requires that the image have alternate text, which
should avoid that scrolling in text only mode.

I think you are taking a line that is halfway between
that which was intended by the guidelines, and that taken
by a couple of my colleagues when told about the Olympics
and AOL cases, namely that forcing commercial organisations
to support the last 20% of the market was an unwarranted
intrusion on their ability to operate their businesses.
