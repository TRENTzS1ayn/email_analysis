The real problem is that HTML in an inferior solution,
because it is not designed to meet the requirement of
a thin client page description language that commercial
designers really want.  They don't share the concerns
expressed by TB-L and the W3C.

[DJW:]  It takes even longer then to turn the feature
on an off, just to get fast access to the few sites
that use alt properly.

Even the rather visually oriented 
http://www.websitegarage.com/ considers load times
to be a significant factor, and I've certainly backed
out of sites waiting for all the graphic elements to
form a recognizable picture.

[DJW:]  
Speed bumps are supposed to be barriers to excess speed.
If they don't act as a barrier to some users of the road,
they are failing in their purpose.  (They act as a barrier
to the speed, and also a barrier to drivers wanting to
use speed, making it more attractive for them not to
cut through the back streets.)

[DJW:]  Actually I agree , and that was the sort
of point I was trying to make.  I find the person
on this list with the signature that says accessibility
is a right is being totally commercially naive. 

The colleagues are expressing the position that gets them
paid, which is basically that there is no money in 
even thinking about accessibility. I try to take into
account accessibility, but often have to forego it.

People on the list need to understand that the current low
accessiblity, and ubiquitous broken HTML, on web sites is
the natural consequence of, largely unregulated, market forces.

There are two problems here, one is the general 
government regulation problem as to how do you bias
the market to achieve your public policy aims without
getting voted out of office by the businesses that 
think they are incurring extra costs or losing 
business to unregulated countries.

The other is the one I pointed out above that HTML
was never intended as a thin client page description
and animation language, but as a way of marking up
the structure of information.  It is being used not
because commercial authors really want its design
characteristics but because browsers come pre-installed
on PCs and because people have learned to use it
in college, probably in turn because one could originally
hand code it, whereas hand coding of PDF is much more
difficult and you had to pay for the authoring tools.

(PDF won't meet the current demands for animation, but
is a better fit to commercial wants technically, but not
in the sense of a pre-installed thin client with 
free authoring tools.)

[DJW:]  I believe that the guidelines where written from the
point of view of the original concept of HTML, and really
were meant to discourage text as graphics.  A lot of HTML 4
is a, largely unsuccessful attempt, to manipulate authors
into better accessibility practices.

SVG is a better thin client page description language, but
my objection to it is that it removes the weak constraints
on authors to produce vaguely structured documents that 
are imposed by HTML.  However, the commercial reality is that
worrying about the likely ubiquitous inaccessible use will not
stop it, or similar tools being created.
