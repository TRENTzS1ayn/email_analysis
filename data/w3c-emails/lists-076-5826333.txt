A while back I made a joke, when discussing the "bobby" graphic, like:

"What, do they think people are maliciously leaving out alt tags or
something??"

And then of course along came the IBM Olympic website, where they apparently
did just that.  I must apologize for my earlier naivet?' in this area!  The
others were right!
