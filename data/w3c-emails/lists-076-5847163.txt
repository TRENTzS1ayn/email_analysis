[DJW:]  A problem with server side templates are that
they often do not keep up to date with minority browsers.
A common complaint on the lynx mailing list (I believe
quite a few blind user use Lynx and, at least at one time,
it was used to provide public access to the web from 
US libraries for those without their own machines) is 
that they are not given access to features of the page
that they could use because the site suppresses those
features because it incorrectly believes the browser
cannot cope (some also complain that they don't want
to lose the feature even though they have to do some 
source reading to work with the page).  (The typical 
commercial approach, of course, is to output an upgrade
your browser message, and give up.)

[DJW:]  Another problem with them, for static pages, is
that they are cache unfriendly.  This is a particular
problem for poorer countries.  Many ISPs in such countries
feel forced to configure caches to cache very aggressively
because too few static pages are cacheable these days.  This
causes security problems as they can cache dynamic content
like web email, but they still prefer that to refetching
what is really a static page, just because it was ASP 
generated.  In fact, there is something of a war going on
with sites trying to ensure that their banner advertising
pages don't get cached and ISPs caching more and more 
aggressively to ensure that they do.
