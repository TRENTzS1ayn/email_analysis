This is where current techniques for adaptive page generation
fail, and represents the major area of work for Edapta, Inc.,
my employer.  This is one reason why the W3C's Composite
Capabilities/Preferences Profiles (CC/PP) work is so vital,
because it allows for _self-identifying browsers_ that speak
to servers in terms of _capabilities_ not in terms of specific
browser type.

This is the future of web design -- a multitude of different
user agent types accessing intelligent servers which provide
accessible, optimized user interfaces dynamically based upon
the requirements of the user and access method.

This is Edapta.
