I hardly think you can call the accessibility problems with the Olympics 
site the result of laziness or ignorance.  The people behind the site 
clearly know about web accessibility as parts of the site are very 
accessible.  It is more that they lacked the commitment to stay the course 
and then fought against doing so at every turn.  I think the actions that 
have resulted in the problems with the Olympics site are a clear 
demonstration of willfully excluding people with disabilities from full use 
of that site.
