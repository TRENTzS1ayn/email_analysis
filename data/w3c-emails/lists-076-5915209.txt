Later in the guidelines it says "avoid causing the screen to flicker" 
[priority 1] to avoid seizures from photosensitive epilepsy.  This suggests 
that  "avoid X"  really does mean "don't to X".

I agree, but I don't think that using real text instead of a button is 
designing strictly for people with disabilities, certainly in those cases 
where the appearance is essentially the same.

Not all sites have the links at the bottom. For example, 
http://www.activematter.com doesn't have them. I'm not criticizing that 
site... in fact I think it's a good, clear layout.  It's just like, as in 
many sites, it missed the chance to use real text  instead of images.  Real 
text would have made little visual difference... In fact, it would have 
enhanced the look...the text would have been more crisp I think.  Text 
links at the bottom would have taken away from the visual appeal of the 
page, another reason to simply use text in the menu bar.

  And even if sites did use links, they are not as good as the buttons for 
people who can see buttons, at least for sites with good visual 
design.  Well designed graphics organize the links in a way that a mere 
unformatted rows of text links do not. For example, I think the layout of 
activematter.com, including it's use of the folder tab metaphor is a good 
example of how visual layout can help usability.  I'd like to see the 
benefits of that sort of good visual design available to as many people as 
possible, including people with low vision.
