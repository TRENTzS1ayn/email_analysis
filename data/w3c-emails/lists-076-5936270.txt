Hold on, a sec, I don't think the Olympic site was being _malicious_.
Let's not attribute to malice what is clearly ignorance or
laziness.

**Guess I should clarify, before I get sued by IBM, I was NOT calling IBM
malicious - I was referring to my own statement made earlier, when I 'joked'
about people "maliciously leaving out alt text tags", because I never
thought that any big corporation would do a website these days without alt
text for their graphic images, but then came the IBM Sydney 2000 website,
and the remark that it would take 12 months and 2 millions dollars to add
alt tags to the site.  When I said "they did just that", I meant they left
the alt text out of their image tags, not that they were malicious.  I can
see how my poor wording might convey the wrong image.  Lawyers please take
note..  (Obviously I should go work for IBM too, cause I am apparently being
way underpaid at current jobs when I put alt text in image tags..)
