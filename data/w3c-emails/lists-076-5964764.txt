[DJW:]  A typical commercial organisation doesn't set
out to exclude; what it does is apply an 80% rule and 
sets out to include the cheapest/most profitable 80% of
the audience, which may well be able bodied people, operating
IBM compatibles, less than 3 years old, with at least 32MB
of RAM and running IE5 or NS4 with scripts and cookies
permanently on and with at least a 33K connection and no
upstream bottlenecks and who never validated HTML against
DTDs.  Effort beyond supporting the 80%
is considered wasted effort.
