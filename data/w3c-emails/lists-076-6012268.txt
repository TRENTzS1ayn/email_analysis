[DJW:]  Software projects don't scale like this (I think
is actually the basis of the title of the well known
book, The Mythical Man Month).  There is fixed training
and familiarisation time for each person, but, more importantly,
you need to be able to divide up the work in a way that each
person can do it with minimum interaction with the others.

Whilst simply adding alt may be a job that can be decomposed well,
and therefore an exception, one would probably not hope to 
get a typical one man year project 
done in less than about four months using four people.
