I took that as an "action item" :) and I forwarded the request
with background info to the Wise Women discussion list (see
http://www.wise-women.org/), which is home to a number of very
skilled graphic/web designers who also are concerned with issues
of accessibility, usability, and backwards compatibility.

I have received several responses and Len asked me to post them
here on the WAI IG list for discussion.  Please keep in mind that
the purpose of this exercise is to increase the diversity of
opinion and hear from "real web designers" -- you may find yourself
disagreeing with some things and that's fine, but also keep in mind
that most of them are not on this mailing list and won't be here
to defend themselves. :)

Four responses are included below.  Hopefully this cross-section
of opinions can generate some discussion and brainstorming on how
to address the needs of both the designers and the users with
disabilities.

>a recent project of mine was the site for author graham joyce (http://grahamjoyce.net), the site needed to both transmit the eerie horror/dark fantasy style of his books and his personality. one of the themes for his book covers was a smoke/mist effect and on 90% of them his name was set in a specific font. carrying this brand/connection over from his books was very important and was a very good reason to use graphical text as opposed to html text.

>5) Sometimes I need absolute control how much space "text" should take up.

>6) Sometimes the only graphics on the page are the graphical text nav

>7) Maybe this has changed... but don't you need to use images (usually
