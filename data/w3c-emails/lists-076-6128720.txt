To convey information to a screen reader without affecting a "normal"
sighted browser, use alt text in a small transparent (or page
background-colored) image.

Such as:

<img src="spacer.gif" width="1" height="1" alt="The following sentance is of
extreme importance.">

In a visual browser, the user will not see the alt text, even if the images
are turned off since the alt text only shows within the size allocated for
the image.  They could see the alt text through the mouse-over effect, but
only if they managed to put thier cursor over that one individual pixel.

I have also thought of using this at the very top-left of pages, making the
image a link, and having it say something like "For an accessible, text-only
site follow this link."

Another question. Recently I wrote an article on the AOL/ NFB issue, I then
highlighted the get out clauses in red. This posed us a problem of how to
convey that these sentences are in red, without affecting the visual
versions' readability. I am sure this is elementary stuff, err, any
suggestions?
