The attachment of "importance" is hard to evaluate. The makers of Bobby 
suffer no delusions that a Bobby icon, or even its underlying "approval", 
are more than mild indicators of good intentions. Any tool attempting to 
evaluate accessibility or its necessary but not sufficient cousin, 
conformance, is always known by its authors to be on very shaky ground. If 
a bunch of sites sneak by with blatantly inaccessible features, at least 
we're going to get more alt tags?
