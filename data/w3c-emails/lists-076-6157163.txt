I have taken the liberty of reviewing and comment on the thoughtful
responses below.  yes, there may be grey areas, but rhe realm of opion is to
broad for our discussion.  Instead, we must deal in concrete realities and
functional solutions.
see my responses marked with dp below.

>a recent project of mine was the site for author graham joyce
(http://grahamjoyce.net), the site needed to both transmit the eerie
horror/dark fantasy style of his books and his personality. one of the
themes for his book covers was a smoke/mist effect and on 90% of them his
name was set in a specific font. carrying this brand/connection over from
his books was very important and was a very good reason to use graphical
text as opposed to html text.

dp what comes to mind here is that the web is not a book and that visual
presentation is all well and good but there is no reason why that cannot be
accompanied by something accessible.

dp nicely done.  I see nothing inherantly rong with the thinking here.  I
will be interested in the discussion.

dp good structure makes for good design. I hear and understand the
frustration.
