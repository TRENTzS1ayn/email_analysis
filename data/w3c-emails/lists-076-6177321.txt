Paul,

You could add a class to those sections (<span class="ww">the get out
bit</span> or <p class="ww">a wholoe paragraph</p> in HTML) along with a
style that makes those things red, or loud, or whatever (according to the
media used).

Alternatively you could emphasise them (<p>some <em>get out
stuff</em></p>) since the em element has a default rendering in most
systems. If you wanted to you could put a class attribute on the em element
(<em class="ww">). Either way, you could provide a style for the element that
made it red, or in a squeaky voice, or whatever.

This question should be answered in the Techniques for Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines - http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-TECHS - since it is
about how to meet checkpoint 2.2 of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

cheers

  Another question. Recently I wrote an article on the AOL/ NFB issue, I then 
  highlighted the get out clauses in red. This posed us a problem of how to 
  convey that these sentences are in red, without affecting the visual 
  versions' readability. I am sure this is elementary stuff, err, any 
  suggestions?
