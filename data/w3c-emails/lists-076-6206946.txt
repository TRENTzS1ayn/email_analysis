Well, if it happened in two years I would be pretty satisfied I think.

For mainstream systems it is available - there are plugins and browsers
available for all operating systems, and a project here working on a
text-only SVG browser. (The source for news is the Working group page -
http:www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG - which includes links to many implementations
and implementation projects, though probably not all of them.)

But predicting the uptake of technology is difficult...

  By "a little while" you probably mean "two or three years"?
  
  Just checking. :)
