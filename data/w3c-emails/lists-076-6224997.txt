Kynn,

Thank you for getting us back on track with this post.

I realize that mainstream web authors are not about to give up textual
images.  That's fine.  They don't claim AA conformance -- and so long as
they have the requisite ALT tags behind the textual images -- I am not going
to make a stink about their site.  Author aren't going to give up using
tables for layout either -- but they don't claim AAA conformance -- so few
of us complain about that.

Kynn, your post below very lucidly highlights the significant accessibiltiy
problems with textual images.  Yet I read your earlier messages on this
thread as being something we should not worry about too much.  Len is not
saying the WCAG "forbids" textual images (that word is reserved for P1
issues).  He is arguing that it _is_ a P2 violation, and so should be
avoided by those that care.

I, and others too I'll bet, am still waiting to hear from some of the folks
who claim AA (or AAA) compliance, but still employ this technique.  What is
the rational?

Kynn, what is wrong with acknowledging that the bar for level AA compliance
is, in fact, just as high as Len suggests?

P.S.:  One other reason for avoiding textual images (and for using CSS) is
that they look terrible in print.  Is your website useful?  Then people are
probably referring to printed hard copies.  Textual images print at the
resolution of the screen (e.g., 72 dpi) and not the resolution of the
printer (e.g. 300 dpi).  Those beautiful 24 bit color anti-aliased menu
folder tabs that look so good on the screen often look incredibly amateurish
in black and white!

Cheers, Bruce
