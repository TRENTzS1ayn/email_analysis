I think on at least some of those message I noted that I was
arguing from a devil's advocacy position.

When the bar is "stop using something useful and instead use
something that doesn't work", then the bar is not just "high",
it is misplaced entirely.  That _may_ be appropriate for a
priority 3 checkpoint, but as a priority 2 checkpoint it 
indicates that we (WAI) have to go back and do some work to
figure these things out better.

Unless you are arguing that "double-AA accessibility is an
undue burden on web designers?"

Keep in mind the implication of _that_ is that you're giving
various companies and organizations a "free pass" out of having
to implement any double-AA considerations, at least under US
law as I understand it.  :)  That's what it means if you say
"double-AA is hard and _should_ be hard to achieve" -- it means
that you are arguing the same as the IBM consultants who
testified in the Olympics hearing (and against Jutta).

I don't believe that the current WCAG checkpoint disallows
images-as-text.  I feel that as written, the requirements
("appropriate markup" to replace images) are not met, as current
styled text is not sufficient to replace image text.  Therefore
I feel that the bar for double-AA accessibility is at a correct
level, and I resist attempts to artificially raise that bar
based on the faulty assumption (which I have yet to be held by
any graphic artist) that styled text _is_ a replacement for
textual images.

This is a design issue and not an accessibility issue.  If
a designer is willing to have their graphics look poor when
printed, hey, more power to 'em.
