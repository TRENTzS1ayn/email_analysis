Actually this requirement is VERY problematic.  There is no
definition of a "published DTD" and logically speaking, anyone
could construct a "published DTD" by modifying the XHTML DTD
(or using XHTML 1.1 modules) or HTML DTD to add their own
custom tags and then reference this as a custom DTD.

Except the validator (a) has never been granted an official
exalted position such as this, and (b) will accept custom DTDs,
_as it should_.

Note:  Custom DTDs are a feature, not a bug.  The "published
DTD" rule is very non-XMLish and will not work for the future!
