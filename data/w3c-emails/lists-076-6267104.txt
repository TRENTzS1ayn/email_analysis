It will not accept relative SYSTEM identifiers, and
the error message implies that it won't accept any
system identifier.  I didn't want to use an absolute, http,
system identifier because I'm trying to convince the site
to adopt my changes and I think it is too much to 
expect them to really understand DOCTYPES and change
the absolute URL.

If someone can suggest how to have the validator accept
a relative address, could you let me know; I actually
validated the page by running nsgmls locally (metered
phone calls were a factor) with a custom SGML catalog.

The original of the page in question is 
http://www.wegalink.de/english/suneclipse.html, and the
reworked one is 
http://www.djwhome.demon.co.uk/wegalink/english/suneclipse.html

There are clear indications that the page is intended to be open
source,
but I've deleted the MP3 file, because of copyright concerns.

I haven't evaluated it against the WCAG guidelines and I have
reworked some
pages (the English ones, mainly) more than others.  It possibly
needs 
long descriptions.  It needs a home page link.  Some colour
contrasts
are poor, on the site.
