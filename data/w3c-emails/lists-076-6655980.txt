According to a friend in marketing, the purpose of advertising is to convey
information. According to him, there is enough return from web adversiting
to keep it a strong option for those trying to build business on the web.

For a site whose purpose is to convey this information neither download
time nor production cost are important. Presenting the information is.

Fails? fails what? Such sites are very popular, and more come online every
day! 

  It's getting close to commercial Christmas, and

Some people are irritated by muzak in the stores, others prefer it to the
more irritating noises of a store without a sound system. The fact that
some people don't like music shouldn't lead to the conclusion that music is
bad is mis-used. Same with graphics. Curmudgeonry shouldn't be an issue in
deciding what is "accessible" and what isn't. I fail to see any reason not
to use word art if the words it contains are put in an alt tag.

That seems an odd statement when you consider that commercial software
typically includes icons for fast use of the commands, and that many people
use these icons regularly. If adults found icons "impossibly difficult to
learn", they wouldn't have evolved from the word commands that were used
before GUI came about. In the training software we are using for Office
software with teachers, the training starts with use of the icons before
going into the features available only with the menus.

I'm not sure why it is supposed to. I cannot see any merit in using a cell
phone for education. On the other hand, the graphics and multi-media that a
cell phone can't handle are the very features that make a site
educationally useful.

I'm sure that your judgement of what is "no benefit to the users" and mine
would point to different features. Does that mean we should make the
choices for others? The purpose of the guidelines isn't to decide what
people can and cannot have on the web, but the allow them to choose how to
receive the information (etc.) that is provided. 
It really doesn't matter if one person gets the text as a recognizable
trademark and another the alt tag, if everyone gets what they
need/want/prefer.

All that the accessibility
>guidelines ask for in the case of appropriate use is a parallel text version.

Then why the problem over word art. If the alt tag is there, it seems there
is no issue. Whether or not it is "appropriate use" is decided by the user.
The user can always leave a page if it isn't to their liking!
