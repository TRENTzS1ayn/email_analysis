Anne!
in your message, you state in part:
"a person can always leave a site if they don't like it".  This could be
turned around as well.  one of the problems we have with heavy graphics
as you proppose is that they are load heavy and the books on good web
building practices all notably frown on this.  Perhaps one or two don't
but I can't read them because they are loaded with pictures.  It does
not matter that you put alt tages in word iconics, if people are sharing
the pc and a person who needs text does not have it because the
alternate in this case is the graphic, than there is no access. 
Further, it was stated that the problem with most sites that are using
them is that they don't standardize.  it is true as has been stated here
before that software uses standard iconics.  This is good and was said
to be so.  I fail to see though how a person will cope who approaches
things from a purely graphical or iconic point of view when the pc
crashes and the only route to recover is through textual means is is
often the case.
