Charles, if you have been reading my posts for a while, you should have
noticed that my interest in accessibility is for the web to be accessible
to all people with disabilities including those who depend on graphics and
multi-media to make the web usable. Mostly, I participate in the w3c-gl
list, but since I started on the w3c-ig list with my quest, I return here
from time to time to help one or another person here understand that
accessibility must include and direct graphics and multimedia because they
are essential to folks with learning, reading, and cognitive disabilities.
I am working with a broader definition of what accessibility means, and who
it can help. 

For many years I was a teacher to learning disabled and cognitively
disabled teenagers. The internet was useful in providing e-mail which
enabled some students to build their skills so they could join their
classmates in regular classes. But as a source of informtion, the Internet
was useless then, and still often is, when graphics and multi-media are
avoided. Currently, I am a teacher at a school for k-2nd graders and my
mission is to find uses of the internet for instruction to these children.
To be useful at all, a web site must, as a minimum, have some graphics to
convey the information, and multi-media presentations are even better. Most
text on pages is useless with these children, since it must be read to
them, and often, regurgitated for their understanding. 

I am not "against" accessibility, but am interested in expanding
accessibility to include those who are flummoxed by pages without graphics,
who depend on the multi-media constantly under development, to make the web
happen for them. Worrying about bandwidth and download time aren't
accessibility issues, and when they are mentioned as such, they are
divisive in the overall goal of accessibility. 

As to the web pages that you say reflect the "ego" of the designer, I'd
suggest you look further and find out who the designer is designing for.
You may be throwing out the baby with the bath water.

PS: To constantly belittle those who design in multi-media and graphics is
never going to get this group anywhere close to acceptance by those very
people you are supposed to be addressing.
