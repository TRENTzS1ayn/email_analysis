Wayne,

     Your rant wasn't bad, in fact it was informative, though nothing new
was said, but you said it well. 

The web is probably no longer what was originally envisioned, but the
original vision was limited and didn't take into account either the
mushrooming of bandwidth and technology, or the popularity that the web has
gained. At some time in the years to come, the "original" concept of the
web will go away and the "horseless carriage" as a toy of the privileged
will be gone ... it's almost there already!  

Unlike most on this list, I am very much "up" on cognitive issues because
the needs in this area, especially as they affect education, have been my
career. Because of long-term friendships in the adult disability community,
I have kept up with the issues and am part of this debate. I care very
deeply about the part of the population who labor through life inspite of
cognitive disabilities - they are friends and family a-many. I am proud of
each one who conquers the financial and learning hurdles and climbs on
board the Internet. I know that for each one, there was a different reason,
a different hope, a different need that brought them to this table. I could
bore this group to tears with specific stories of how things came to be. 

But I cannot say that any one of them came to the web expecting to cherish
"documents" ... Should they be sent back to tv just because the originators
of the web didn't envision they would be here? Perhaps purists can argue
so, but these people are too real to me for those arguments to have much
flavor. 

My concern with seeing the cognitive issues included in WAI is because the
published purpose is to insure the web accommodates all people with
disabilities. WAI says it promises accessibility to ALL, and, when they're
not damning business, promise the buying power of ALL disabled persons ...
therefore, if it's called "accessibility for disabilities", it can't ignore
some disabilities just because they weren't originally expected to come
onboard.

On the gl list there is a member who is both personally disabled
cogitively, but also works as a teacher to those with more severe
cognitively disabled. It's likely that a complete "translation" from text
to icons will sometime be technically possible, but these needs are the
extreme. The middle stream need is to illustrate text. If this is
expressed: Every web document would be illustrated to reach the widest
audience. Saying that document must be illustrated is a long way from
saying "if you have to put a graphic on your page do this ..." .... It
should say: "Illustrate your page; do this for each illustration ..."
Notice it doesn't say "decorate your page" ... Will there be "documents"
that can't be illustrated? Sure! but is it because the content isn't worth
the effort?

I would hope that more commercial sites would look at the IKEA-usa.com
site suggested to me this morining, and look at the "glitzy" directions to
put together a bookcase ... add the needed sound, and add a printable
version, and a basic text version, for every item sold with directions, and
leave it there so the customer could find it every time they needed it
(instead of cluttering up a drawer full of directions and schematics ...)
but this is much more than asking for mark-up language ... yet it seems to
be in the same spirit, at least to me ... 

Anne
