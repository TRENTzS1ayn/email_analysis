Hi Phill,

Do I have to stand to attention when replying to an email from Big Blue? 
(that now makes it twice in a week I have felt that urge).

My concern was the fact the older (and more numerous) text readers/speech 
browsers would struggle/fail with the javascript at the top of the index 
page. Plus the frames may pose a bit of a problem, here and there.

However, I was looking for confirmation of this from the WAI, it seems that 
older (and maybe wiser) heads have decided to leave the subject well alone, 
having flogged it to death over the last few weeks, and having caused a 
couple of (polite but firm) disagreements between senior members of the group.

But I am not totally convinced yet I want to.

I am spending the next few days running the site through a couple of 
readers to check my facts. I will if you wish inform you of my findings. 
Positive or negative.

Kindest regards
Paul Davis
