Hello,

I am part of a team that is creating a new program in Wisconsin, USA. The
boiler plate information is...
<DAWN is a new grassroots, statewide network of people who care about
disability issues. The DAWN will focus on issues affecting people with any
kind of disability and will include people with disabilities, family
members, friends, organizations and others. This network will allow people
throughout the state to stay informed about important public policy issues
and will give members of the network information to advocate for these
issues.>

Part of this program will require sending emails to members referring them
to specific Web pages. I am familiar with the Guidelines for the Web page
authorship, but what about the emails? I am unclear as to whether to send
text based email or <html> based email. What we would like is to have the
email contain hyperlinks to Web site.

If we send plain text messages, will hyperlinks be shown as such and will
they work as such?

And like the recent thread, we need to address the cognitively disabled as
well, so <html> based email has some real advantages. If we send email in
<html> should the style sheet be in-line or linked?

Thanks for any help.
