But that's not the Web, even originally.  That is an SGML idea, which is only
accidentally involved in the origins of the Web.  The Web idea was not of
"documents independent of the kit used to view them."  The Web idea required a
user agent that implemented hyperlinks encoded as URI references.  Tim used
SGML because it was there, and did something he needed, which was to provide a
very simple way to hide the hrefs in the natural-communication medium. 
Separation of content vs presentation was not an issue involved in the web
innovation.  Nor was the fact that the initial medium was style-free text. 
That was an accident of the initial implementation.

The central features of Tim's innovation were a) the hypermedia premise, that
links to more information were marbled through natural-communication media,
and
b) the URI premise, that the media carrying the hyper-references did not
distinguish in the surrounding media between references to ftp, gopher, WAIS,
local files, or HTTP.  To the hypermedia, they were all just references to
external resources.  Period.  The differences were strictly hidden within the
URI itself.

This put all external references into one superclass of object, and made the
URI namespace the World- [i.e. Internet-]wide scope of external references for
any Web media.  Any Web document could link to any Web resource and the user
_could get there_.

HTTP was a convenience function, and not an essential premise of the
architecture even 'though the as-build Web often acts as though there are no
URIs other than HTTP URLs.  But there was no Web-intrinsic principle of
device-independence; only embedded actionable references into one unified
namespace.  That was the essential innovation of Tim's synthesis of the Web.

It all makes perfectly logical sense.  What it fails is the reality check.  It
fails to face the facts of the Web either at its inception or today.  The
preponderance of new pages added to the Web content and the preponderance of
current hits against web pages today are part of a post-Mosaic genre where
point and click is much more intrinsic than "separation of content from
presentation."  It was the use in Mosaic of what had been learned through the
GUI revolution to _reduce_ the separation between what you see and what you
get
that was the final straw launching the Web into hyper-growth-rate.

I occasionally grumble about NCSA sometimes sounding as if it invented the
Web.  Tim made the most critical contribution, and he did not use a GUI.  But
that is the view of a computer scientist.  A marketing economist might well
say
that most of the current Web market is predicated on a Web which also presumes
PPP and the point-and-click GUI in addition to Tim's seminal work.

What we are actually facing today is a segmentation of the Web market in some
national/cultural areas that is not the same world-wide.  In Japan the DoCoMo
phone processes standard websites fine.  If somebody tried to sell that in the
U.S., they would fail, because the "standard websites" in the U.S. are more
visual-premise, bandwidth-hogs than the "standard websites" in the Japanese
market.  This is not to say they are wrong, or not the Web.  But they are
different, and the idea of one HTML document that fits all clients is limited
in what range of client processes (including communication bandwidth) it can
span.  Refer to the proceedings of the recent Device-Independence workshop for
discussion of how the content, and not just the presentation needs to
change to
address devices of different capability (if you divide presentation from
content more or less along the same lines as in HTML 4 vs. CSS2).

<http://www.w3.org/2000/10/DIAWorkshop/>http://www.w3.org/2000/10/DIAWorkshop/

The World-Wide ambitions of the Web to unify communication had better worry
about what is happening in response to broadband vs. mobile differences in the
U.S. because even 'though it is not world-wide yet; it is definitely the
future.  The strategy that "you just have to serve universal documents" cannot
necessarily be sustained in terms of the actual cost/effectiveness tradeoffs
facing the information-sourcing communities.

Making web pages or services 'universal' can only be justified to the point
where they are still saving you money by reducing the workload spent rendering
comparable service via email, phone, and personal assistants.  No web
documents
are totally device-independent.  For the best we know how to do [WCAG 1.0] the
class of devices on which they depend is broad enough to retain the
flexibility
to dodge the preponderance of sensory and motor disabilities.  [We're still
working on cognitive.]  But these flexible documents still can't deliver any
communication, let alone effective communication, without some device or
other.  And as the clients get more diverse in capabilities, we have to be
prepared to seek the point of commonality between different Web discourses
deeper and deeper within the server processes.

What we [e.g. in WCAG 1.0] call 'content' has measured, not categorical,
independence of device and client processing availability assumptions.
