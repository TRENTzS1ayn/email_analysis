At the moment your attempts to send plain text are failing in my copy of
Eudora
Pro 4.

It may be a Eudora bug but doing a 'reply' to your message loses all
paragraphing, not just 72-80 character line breaks.

The MIME backward-compatibility guideline is to put the plaintext morph of
your
message ahead of the first MIME part, not in the first MIME part.  You should
review the capabilities of MIME multipart/alternative and MHTML as you plan
your usage.

Warning:  The WAI has not paid much attention to MIME applications as compared
to HTTP applications using the same media.  You should regard the
WAI-interested as a good pool from which to find informative peers.

Search with Google for "email accessibility" for more sources of useful
information.
