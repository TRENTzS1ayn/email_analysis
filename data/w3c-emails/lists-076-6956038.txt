Hypothetically, WCAG should cover this case, but I fear it doesn't.

Email is one of the best areas to offer _two_ (or more) versions of
content:  One in HTML, and one in plaintext.  Users should be given
the choice over which email format to receive.

In general, "modern" email programs will highlight URIs as clickable
links, so you can send links in plaintext without requiring markup.
Older email programs will not do this, but they likewise will rarely
display HTML either.  (So they simply don't have the functionality
to make clickable links.)

Hope this helps.
