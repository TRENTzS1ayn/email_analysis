...it seems we are going in circles...
Anne!
have you or your husband been in a horriffic trafic jam on one of those
cool highways lately because of a huge pile up of fast movers?  I have
and it ain't pretty.  How's that for a graphic.

we don't want text only, we just want to take the lead in setting the
standards for social responsibility where the internet is concerned
after the geeny has already escaped from the bottle.  I don't know why
you don't have a problem with speed when as you say, some of your pages
are 5 to 7 mb in size and that with pictures only.  I become extremely
frustrated when I download a 30 second clip of audio waiting several
minutes for it to transfer only to find it won't play or was corrupted
in the process or requires a plug in that I don't have or the latest
achievement in one or another technology of the multiple formats for
audio that are available.  I try to keep up with them but some times
fail and it takes a lot of time for me to update all these little
things.  One of the things that must happen before substantial gains can
be made is that some sort of standard has to come forward so that
anything I get I can play whether it is audio, dancing images or multi
media.  I also want to play it on the server so I don't have to download
it or download something small that directly connects to the server. 
for an example of this, see:
http://www.acbradio.org and take a look at their little tuner that
doesn't require to download anything once it is downloaded <small> and
easily installed.  It opens the appropriate player, goes out to the
source and begins playing it almost instantly and allows you to switch
sources almost seemlessly.  Untill this kind of technology is more
widely used and becomes more realtime in action, what you proppose will
not be feasable beyond the classroom.  I too want and need multimedia
and other things like instant two way text and voice and visualization
with someone sitting in a live chair at the other end of that store
front web site but this is just not practical at this point.  I want
graphics for muy sighted and textually challenged peers and coleagues so
that we can share and work together but I hate traffic jams.
