Quite to the contrary, when I use commercial sites I find the graphics
useful as well as interesting. If they are not there, I feel the merchant
isn't serious about selling on the web, and I move on. A graphic cannot
take the place of descriptive text on a selling site, but it's absence
leaves a serious void in informative content ... 

As to rules, I want as few as necessary to meet needs.
