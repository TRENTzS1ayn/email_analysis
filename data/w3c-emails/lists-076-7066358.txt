Although nothing in there is "secret", it should be noted that this
is still a work-in-progress, and as a draft which does not yet
reflect consensus (even among the members of the working group),
it's hard to discuss what this does or doesn't say.  (And comments
on what it should say should probably go to the working group
mailing list, at w3c-wai-gl@w3.org, so that your viewpoints can
be reflected in upcoming discussions.)
