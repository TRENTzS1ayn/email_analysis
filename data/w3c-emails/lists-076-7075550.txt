I have dealt with this quite a bit and you raise some points which I
shall quote below.  NOte, the first point is merely philosophical.

dp would that this were true.  I can think of a thousand reasons why
this might be unfair.  I might be writing a book.  I might be helping to
train a driver.  I might be studying this in a course setting. ...

dp not to mention telling them what graphics to use.

dp The intended audience of the web should be anyone who can get to it. 
There is nothing more exasperating than to come to what for me is a
blank page or a page that says I am using the rong browser or some such
nonsense.  I figure that if it isn't intended for us all, it is wasting
space on the World Wide Web.

dp This is my point.  if you are going to produce in a medium, you need
to be able to use the medium.  you learn to use the medium before you
produce in it.  would you ask a person who knows nothing about hair
styling to write a book about it?  or do it?  bad alalogy I know, but it
achieves the purpose of looking at the matter.  any site should follow
accessability guidelines.

dp Speaking as a blind man, Yes.  the law exempts no one.

dp Yes! she does not have to hear it to mark it up.  she can get the
length of the file and the title of the piece and all kinds of info
about it.  This is not a stretch for either the blind man or the deaf
woman because the information is available in a medium that they can
use.  On the other hand, for someone to really build a site who needs
the access that a person with a severe cognative problem needs, would be
a real stretch because developping a site requires some use at least of
text.  This does not however exempt that person from following the
guidelines.  What shall we say.  Oh, I don't have any text on my site
because I don't use text so be forewarned.  We'd have to get someone to
write that one up for us or may we put it in an audio file and or use a
signed audio/video?  I am not making gest here.  I think as a blind
person, I'd be a pitifull excuse for a designer if I said, "I hate
graphics therefore, you won't see any of the little buggers on any page
I write.".

dp To put this another way, good web design including current
accessability cpractices can be learned and illusrated.  beyond that,
unless you are specially trained in it, It would be mearly if not
impossible to churn out designers that could meet the cognative need as
it has been expressed and is now percieved.
