I like it also very much, I only have one problem:

http://www.xtraport.de/der_richtige_Auftritt.html

page of my company is not shown correct. Ok, perhaps the HTML is not 
correct, but I dont know, what I did wrong.
On IE, Netscape 4.x, Opera there is no problem, only with Mozilla 
M15-M18 and NN6pr3

If you have any idea I would appreciate an answer to
c.loeffler@xtraport.de

thanks in advance
Christoph Loeffler
