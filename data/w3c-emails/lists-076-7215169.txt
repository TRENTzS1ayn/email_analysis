Hello Kynn,

I liked the list of responsabilities. I'm missing the web creation software
manufacturer (if different from browser), probably between points 4 and 5. I
firmly believe that we won't have accesible Internet until the editors are
capable of generating accesible web pages with just one click.

Regards,
Javier
