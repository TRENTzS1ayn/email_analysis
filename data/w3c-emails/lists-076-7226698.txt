In theory, yes.  Properly marked up text is ALWAYS (well, almost always,
if we looked hard enough we may be able to find exceptions) going to be
"more accessible" -- in theory -- than plaintext.

In practice, of course, we know there're several problems (size, user
agent support, security, privacy) with HTML mail which makes it hard
to deploy as a general solution.  A smart mailing list system would
be able to take either HTML text or plaintext, and send users the
output in the appropriate format according to that user's preferences
upon subscribing.
