Note that you can configure FrontPage (FP2000) to control which browsers and
browser technologies are enabled within the user interface.

By the way, which tags are we "notorious" for?  (I *knew* we never should
have put that Insert/Marquee command on the menus...)

This continued thread is probably off-topic - feel free to reply directly.

I am needing to make some decisions on the what software we purchase.
Previously they have been using old versions of FrontPage, but since they
are notorious for using proprietary tags that are not HTML 4.01 compliant,
I have campaigned for a change in web authoring tools.  Now, I have to tell
them which to get.  Does anyone have any recommendations?  Thanks for any
help you can offer!
