I vote to keep this discussion on the list, as I would like to participate,
please. It's a subject near and dear to my heart.  FrontPage 2000 used in
WYSIWYG-only mode does not produce valid code or pages that are accessible.
However, there are workarounds for some issues and for the others, you need
to use the "HTML mode' to fix them. I don't know if FrontPage as a tool is
accessible, however, there is accessible documentation at:
