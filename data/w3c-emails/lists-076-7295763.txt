I agree about keeping this on the list.  I think FrontPage 2000 is used by a
great many people, including many who are not web designers by job title.
It would be great if we can figure out some of the tricks to have it make it
more accessible sites.

However, for the record, I'm not sure what it does "wrong."  (I've recently
converted from writing my own html in notepad to FrontPage, so I'm a newbie
with it.) Can anybody enlighten me? 

Thanks!

I vote to keep this discussion on the list, as I would like to participate,
please. It's a subject near and dear to my heart.  FrontPage 2000 used in
WYSIWYG-only mode does not produce valid code or pages that are accessible.
However, there are workarounds for some issues and for the others, you need
to use the "HTML mode' to fix them. I don't know if FrontPage as a tool is
accessible, however, there is accessible documentation at:
