FrontPage does not include a DOCTYPE declaration in its pages; you need to
put it their yourself. I wrote up a workaround; you can find it at:
http://www.spiderwebwoman.com/tutorials/doctypesolution.asp

Also, it does not add alt text for images; again, this is something you need
to do yourself. My feeling is that it should prompt you for it, perhaps as
part of the Insert Picture dialog box?
