Thanks for mentioning the person in authority.  even when they are told
there is an issue and even when the designer knows how to implement
accessability, there are some managers that will not stand for anything
but the big corporate look a-like or that latest gizmo or whatever. 
Much of the time, the final say is that of the person paying the
designer no matter what the designer knows or can do.  I suspect that
the purchaser of the designer's service is high on the list of
importance because if someone is willing to buy, they can usually find
someone willing to sell.
