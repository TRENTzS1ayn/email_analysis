actually, if you code for what works in:
ie, netscape and oppera lynx if you like, you should be covered.  the
problem with some of the other browsers is that they are propriatary,
take a great deal to really master unless you have some background in
assistave technology and do not keep up with the times necessarily.  To
test with browsers that are built for particular targets, the best
solution is to find members of the target who use them well to assist.
