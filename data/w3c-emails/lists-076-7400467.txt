Two suggestions:

1st, check out the new IBM WebSphere Homepage Builder, version for Windows
or Linux.  It is the latest authoring tool, previously known as TopPage.
It includes accessibility checking and prompting.  It is advertised as
helping to create accessible pages, but I'm not sure if itself is
accessible.  You can get a free 60-day trial version - or update from a
competing product for only $19.

2nd, check out the list of tools on the WAI Tools list:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/tools

Personally I use a combination of Homepage Builder and Home Page Reader [1]
to validate my design decisions and create the templates, then Homepage
Builder to add content, then Homepage Builder to check for accessibility of
those new pages.  Then I use Bobby to check the whole site and make sure
the pages stay accessible - very few sites that are created and maintained
by one person these days, and no one tool gets the job done - but a
repeatable process with good tools seems to be the "silver bullet".
