It is perfectly ridiculous to argue that the phrase <Q>When an appropriate
markup language exists</Q> could be used to exclude CSS when "style
sheets" is explicitly referenced twice in the following two sentences!  CSS
has attributes that were specifically included for the formatting of
textual-links-as-buttons.  Granted, the support for style sheets by
Navigator (and earlier versions of IE) is severely lacking.  This does not
mean that we should give up advocating that pages be coded properly,
especially for sites interested in AA compliance!  We should also continue
working on Microsoft and Netscape to release standards compliant browsers.

Kynn, please also explain what you meant by:

I believe the premise of the "Kynn Challenge" (that a site can be P1
compliant without significant impact on its superficial graphical
presentation).
Would you argue that this is (or should be) true of AA conformance?
