Amy,
A partial answer to your question # 1, "According to the U.S. Census
Bureau, 21 percent of Americans currently have a disability. That's 54
million consumers. Of these, more than 4 in 10 are online, a Harris Poll
reveals."

This is a quote from an article that was posted to the w3c-wai-eo mail
list earlier today. You can read the whole thing at the archives:
