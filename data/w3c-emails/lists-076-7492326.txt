I second this opinion. Also,  the original author of Homesite also does a
great stylesheet editor call Topstyle (available from
http://www.bradsoft.com/topstyle/index.asp).

If there are any Mac users, the equivalent to Homesite is BBedit - also very
good.

Hope this helps.

I highly recommend Allaire's HomeSite 4.5, possibly combined with Adobe's
Dreamweaver. I use it without Dreamweaver (which is quite expensive), but I
know many good developers who love Dreamweaver.

HomeSite puts the emphasis on hand-coding (while greatly easing the task),
but also offers a WYSIWYG mode. Haven't tried it, but you can download a
30-day trial version from Allaire and try it yourself.

I've tried many other authoring tools - including HotMetal Pro, FrontPage,
Dreamweaver, PageMill, and more - and I think that HomeSite is head and
shoulders above them all.
