Reply:

As far as I know there is no relationship between BBEdit and Homesite. What
makes them "equivalent" is that BBEdit is widely believed to be the best
editor for Mac, and Homesite is (to a lesser degree) believed to be the best
HTML editor for Windows. I think that Allaire makes a version of Homesite
for Linux as well, but it would be difficult to supplant Emacs (and
Emacspeak) as the "best" editor for Linux/Unix.

If you are using Windows (or Linux), definitely check out Homesite. BTW, it
comes with HTMLTidy, Dave Raggets program, for it's internal validator.
