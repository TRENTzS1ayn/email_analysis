Charles,

I think in terms of the Content Accessibility guidelines it is a bit much to
include "economic hardship" as a disability. Yes, agreed, it does constitute
a barrier for the user in terms of accessing the content, but it is not the
fault of the content per se. You can't blame the content when the problem is
actually lack of access to the technology as a whole.

However, would you (could you) draw the same parallels with Television or
radio? There is a certain amount of economic divisiveness here also - cost
of a TV, cable etc; same with radio. Is there, and should there be, an
initiative to make sure that all people have access to TV content regardless
of disability/disadvantage?

It is an ambitious and laudable goal, making the Web available to all
regardless of their situation in life. However, I think ensuring that those
people who _can_ access the 'Net are able to utilise the content is a good
first step.

Cheers
Steve
