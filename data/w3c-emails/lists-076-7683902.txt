Hi all, 

Just I thought I'd throw some library science into the mix as far as access!

Michael Buckland, a prof. at Berkeley's School of Information Management,
has identified 6 barriers to access in the library world, and I believe #3-5
are quite applicable to this discussion.

1. Identification - If it hasn't been properly identified, you can't find
it. (search engines)
2. Availability - Potential user needs to be able to see the source.
(Interlibrary Loan, etc.)
3. Price to User - what does the user need to see the source? (hardware,
software?)
4. Cost to Provider - what does it cost to provide this information?
(knowledge, hardware, software?)
5. Cognitive ability of the user - can the user understand the source (this
should also include physical ability/disability).
6. Acceptability - is the source credible, does it satisfy the user's need?

#4 might cause some arguments. Although, we all know it does not cost much
more to make something accessible, but most clients see only the price tag.
In any case, these are the things I look at when trying to organize and
retrieve information.
