Hi All,


>5. Create tables that transform gracefully. Tables for layout equals NO-NO.

When I speak about web accessibility, this is one of the most controversial 
issues.  I know this has been talked about here before but it is my 
contention that most tables used for layout do transform gracefully in the 
web browsing solutions used by people with disabilities and are not a major 
impediment to accessibility.
