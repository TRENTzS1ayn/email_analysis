I believe this is a misreading of the guidelines by the author
of the article.

I think Kelly is correct.  I do not believe that layout tables are
currently a major accessibility barrier.  I believe the current
guidelines (WCAG 1.0) reflect this; however, there is an education
problem because for so long, many people were running around equating
tables with inaccessible design and promoting CSS-P as an alternative
(despite the fact that it still is not viable to this day).
