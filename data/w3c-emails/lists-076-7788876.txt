I am wondering what people's read of what is currently required of
web-sites in terms of accessibilty, from colleges and universities that
support their e-commerce efforts, such as on-line bookstores?  I have a
pretty good idea of what would be ideal.  However, I am looking for
information on what is currently legally required.

Thanks.

John
