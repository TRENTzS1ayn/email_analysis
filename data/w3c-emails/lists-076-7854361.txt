I'd certainly go for a general definition.  In a recent survey, only 75%
of younger people in the UK had access to the internet and this is even
less in older people.  Older people are often afraid of the technology and
have missed out on the building of Windows 3 on DOS and WIndows 9x on 
Windows 3, etc..  They and people with only modest means may find WebTV TM?
type solutions attractive, and they are certainly being pushed in the
shops now.

These have limited upgrade capability.  The most promoted UK one claims to
be HTML 3.2 plus some version of Javascript compatible, but detailed
technical information seems impossible to find (unlike US WebTV).
These people are likely to be locked into this three year old technology
for five to ten years.
