That's too strong a condition.  Even in the USA, I believe you used to
have, and maybe still have, "freenets", which were sort of charitable
internet cafes.  They often ran text only browsers, both because you
could use obsolete PCs as terminals, and because they tended to take a
high moral view, and text only tended to work with sites of educational
value, but not with pure entertainment sites.  (This is still true to a
large extent; I did a search for some information on recent history at
the weekend and all the sites worked well text only - trying to search
for information on technology products is likely to be a different story.)

Being selective in this way also meant that there was no conflict
with the commercial internet cafes.

They haven't really happened in the UK, although I've heard of one
similar programme.  Libraries often provide access, though.
