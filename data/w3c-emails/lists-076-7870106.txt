I've recently come across Webbrain at http://www.webbrain.com/

This provides a 3D visualisation of search categories (it provides a front
end to the DMoz open source directory).

In the light of recent discussions about the need for visualisation in
certain areas and for certain categories of users, I wondered how this
fitted in.

The Windows (or Mac) desktop is another example of a graphical metaphor.

A colleague of mine came across these other visualisation products --  the
demos are site-specific rather than web-wide.

Table Lens

Hyperbolic Tree (also see their own site map)

    from Plumb Design:

about Thinkmap

http://millennium.sonymusic.com/
example on Sony site (clues: the expand "button" in the lower right corner
is a toggle, the horizonal text line that builds up to the left of it allows
you to return to places you have been)

kind of fun to play with

Any thoughts on these types of services?
