I am a JFW user and am currently on the University of Arkansas at 
Little Rock Chancelor's Committee on People with Disabilities.  I am 
also on the Programs subcommittee and the Online Course Development 
Policy Subcommittee.  

We are developing policy guidelines for the University Faculty to use 
when creating online courses.  Do any of you know of other 
universities who are doing this?  Are there any universities who 
already have guidelines?  

Next, the university is using three online course shell 
applications:  Web CT, Blackboard, and Math XL.  Do any of you know 
if there are any scripts out there to help make these applications 
accessible?  

Any information you can give me would be appreciated.  My email 
address is:  

donbery@swbell.net.  

Again, thank you for your help.  

Don Berry
