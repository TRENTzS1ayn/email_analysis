Hi, Brian,

Just checked out the webbrain.com and it will contribute nothing
towards meeting the needs of those who depend on vision and graphics.
The search engine was horribly slow, the links were only text, no
pictures, and it took almost 10 minutes to hitting dead ends to find
information on "kids" and "education" ... when found, the sites
offered were useless for kids' education, but were intended only for
adults and grad students or professionals. So, not only is the search
engine an exercise in futility, the sites it provides aren't worth
much either ... Much better results from the Altavista, Lycos and
Excite!
                                 Anne
