I far too often see mainstream consumers complaining and multi-clicking
in frustration over high glitz commercial pages.  Most of the sites I
know of are glitsy because they want to be for one external or marketing
reason or another.  Consumers for the most part seem to be concerned
with content.  They would like it fine if it was useable.
