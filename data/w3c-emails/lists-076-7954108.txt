This is very true.  Commercial interests often suffer because their designers
don't understand usability very well.  But you cannot push this as far as
Jakob
Nielsen does.  He goes past the point of balanced assessment on this point. 
[It is in his commercial interest to do so.]

We are still faced with the two-facedness of consumers.  What they will tell
you versus how they vote with their feet.  I can't gage this disparity well. 
But I do believe that the advertising people are onto something, here.  People
will not tell you they respond positively to attractive styling, but in the
final analysis they do.  'Tis a puzzlement.

Since starting to learn about web accessibility, I have become more alert to
just how quick and sharp are the snap judgements I make on the basis of
appearances.  This is contrary to my rationally held value that "appearances
shouldn't matter."  I am not trying to start a twelve-step program for
sensitive new age guys, here, just trying to offer evidence from one sample
blindless person.
