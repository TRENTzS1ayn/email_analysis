Hi,

Does anyone have any experience in Cold Fusions CFMAIL. I know how to make
an email function through coldfusion so that you can recieve mail through a
pop server. But when I go to reply to anyonne that sends me mail, I have set
up CFMAIL to reply like any other mail program. But the problem is that when
it puts the senders informatio in the To box, it puts it in a format like:

  "First Lastname" <email@emailadress>

Now how is coldfusion supposed to send this? It doesn't unders stand it. I
have tried to send it this way and I don't recieve the reply, but if I take
out the name and brackets, it sends the mail fine.

 Does anyone know how to set up the reply so you cna format the
HTMLEditFormat(From) field?

 Thanks for any of your help.
