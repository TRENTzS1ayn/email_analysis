Anne  & Brian -

I've been working with the Brain products (particularly the Personal Brain
client) for several months, and have been in discussions with the company
about addressing accessibility issues such as keyboard equivalents for web
navigation and associating graphics with keywords (thoughts).

Regarding the http://www.webbrain.com site, an important point to consider
is that when reviewing new technologies, we (the disability community) need
to evaluate the technology as independently as possible from specific
implementations.  In the case of Webbrain,  the technology issues are 1)
the scability of the product, which is providing an interface to the open
source directory project with over 300,000 categories and indexing over 3
million pages, and 2) the capacity to integrate with search engine
technologies.    My experience with the Webbrain site performance has been
positive, even when accessing the web via a modem.  The initial page takes
longer to load, but you can actually move through the keyword hierarchy
quite rapidly, finding the most relevant keyword for your inquiry before
the page even loads.

Regarding the underlying technology with respect to accessibility, I
believe this technology has tremendous potential for meeting needs of
people with some types and degrees of cognitive disabilities, since this
interface is based on an "associative computing interface" which can model
the way a person thinks about a particular task, or even the world from
their unique perspective.

_____

I'll review the other visualization products that Brian mentioned, and
bring this issue up with contacts working in the visualization area.
Several of these contacts will be attending or presenting at two
Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) conferences that will be held
here in the Washington, DC area in November:

Hi, Brian,

Just checked out the webbrain.com and it will contribute nothing
towards meeting the needs of those who depend on vision and graphics.
The search engine was horribly slow, the links were only text, no
pictures, and it took almost 10 minutes to hitting dead ends to find
information on "kids" and "education" ... when found, the sites
offered were useless for kids' education, but were intended only for
adults and grad students or professionals. So, not only is the search
engine an exercise in futility, the sites it provides aren't worth
much either ... Much better results from the Altavista, Lycos and
Excite!
                                 Anne
