Well... you're right, it's a good idea.  The CPB/WGBH National Center for Accessible
 Media (NCAM) recently received funding for a three-year project to develop
 resources specifically for making multimedia accessible.  It's called the Rich-Media
 Project.  We're planning to develop solutions for designers and distributors who
 want to offer accessible multimedia of all kinds; these solutions will be available via
 a resource-center Web site which will provide a centralized source of information
 and applications.

By the way, for those of you already using NCAM's caption-authoring application,
 MAGpie, this software will be redeveloped during the first year of the project.  (The
 current version of MAGpie is avaialble at www.wgbh.org/ncam).  

Thanks.
