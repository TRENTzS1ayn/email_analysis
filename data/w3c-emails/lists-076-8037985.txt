The problems that you are describing are not directly related to the
innovative interface that they use. The fact that the links weren't quite
what you expected is not a reflection on their interface but on their
implementation of the database. I believe that the original question to this
mailing list was asking about the visual mode of presentation which Webrain
used, rather than the quality of the database which it accesses.

I personally found the interface rather simple to use. I understood it and
thought that the graphical lines connecting related topics was a good way of
diagraming the information. They used a spatial metaphor. I often find it
helpful to conceptualize things spatially. I'm not saying that their
interface is better than more traditional versions (e.g. the Yahoo site
accomplishes the same type of organization, without the spatial metaphor),
but, at least for me, it was just as good.

How can something like Webrain be made accessible to those who dislike (or
that cannot access) spatial metaphors? One possible solution is a simple
one: create an alternative interface using a more traditional scheme,
Yahoo-style.

There's nothing wrong with coming up with new and innovative modes of
presentation, as long as there is a fallback mechanism to present things in
a way that is still "accessible." Using spatial metaphors (not just on this
site, but in a general sense) can be very effective. It's not the only way
to present things, but this method has merit, especially for those who tend
to think spatially.
