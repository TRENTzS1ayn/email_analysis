Paul,

I visited the webbrain site again today, and had a rather different
experience. Yesterday I went to Home, to Family, to Children, to Education
and hit garbage ... today when I went from Home to Family, Children was
gone and the best next link was Kids, from which there was a School Zone
link. This is one step less than yesterday, and the results were decent.
Perhaps yesterday I hit a redundency to an older version that wasn't all
the way corrected ... guessing...

     Yesterday when I looked at the site, I couldn't perceive a reason for
the lines ... after reading your note, I looked more carefully, and saw the
connection, but still don't know how one is to use them. I did notice that
if I had written the categories, I wouldn't have put both Games and
Recreation on the top level, and I would have put Education in the top level. 

     Also, I noticed today, that the screen, tho very short, scrolls
sideways quite a ways. Yesterday nothing clued me that this was possible,
so I missed it... 

Again, returning to the offerings for education, there was no way for a
student to search for information for a specific subject, if the site was
to be used by a student. The presentation precluded any search for a topic,
such as, say Christopher Columbus... 

The search engine felt very limiting in use. I don't see that I'd have
much use for it. Download time seemed long both days, and I usually don't
mind download times ... 

If he's up to it tonight, I'll get my husband to give it a try when he
gets home and see what he makes of it.

As I said before, there are many variables in how various "brains" work,
and in this diversity there is room for many possibilities ... no one is a
"cure-all".

Anne
