 Hello, My name is Donny Miller and I am a director of Rapidfind Pty
Ltd, a Brisbane Internet Technology company which has designed a user
updateable business web site platform which we believe addresses web
site accessibility issues. Rapidfind is a member of the Internet
Industry Association, and also the IIA Internet Accessibility
Taskforce. The team at Rapidfind have been trialing our products through
Bobby and W3C compliance validators, and would really appreciate
feedback and suggestions on improving the accessibility of our
platform. Please feel free to visit our sites and forward any comments
or suggestions which you would like addressed to
donny@rapidfind.com.au I can also be contacted on 0754 286612 Our web
site address is http://www.rapidfind.com.au  and our site outlines our
platform objectives. Regards, Donny Miller.
