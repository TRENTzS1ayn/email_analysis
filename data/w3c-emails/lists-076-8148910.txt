I want to comment on the second issue, long URLs generated by automated
software. 

I find Cnet News  <news.cnet.com> to be quite usable with Window-Eyes and
Lynx.  But they have a feature whereby you can read and comment on messages
submitted by readers of the current article.  Most of its output is just
fine, except for one button which allows you to submit a comment, which has
no title or alt.  In the article at

http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-3310477.html?tag=st.ne.1002.lthd.1005-2
00-3310477 
about Congress wanting to crack down on hackers, the offending link in the
"message boards" section of this story reads
<a
href="/news/reviewentry/1,10799,0-1005-602-3310477,00.html?tag=st.ne.ni.ucwy
tnav.wytfm"><img src="/Images/News/Graphics/UserReviews/button_21.gif"
width="78" height="34" align="right" border="0"></a>
in which Window-Eyes reads the unintelligible URL 
news/reviewentry/1,10799,0-1005-602-3310477,00.html?tag=st.ne.ni.ucwytnav.wy
tfm
and Lynx instead parses the name of the image and provides 
[button_21] as the name of the link.  If this image had an alt or a title,
both programs would use it.  I never until now tried to find out where this
link takes you, but using Window-Eyes to read the long URL in the midst of
intelligible text is disruptive enough that I sometimes stop the automatic
reading of the story, skip that line, then resume the read-to-end function.
   

Databases should produce alt or title attributes for all clickable images,
period.  It would be even better if they meant something in the current
context.
