The item you're referring to is a image representing a button with words
"Post a comment" in the graphic.

It's some god-awful HTML.  I don't blame the authors for having long
URLs - that's necessary for this kind of stuff with the current
technology, but not having a ALT attribute is the first mistake.  I'd
also like to see a TITLE attribute on the <A> element - not as a
substitute for the ALT though. 

So, in psuedo-code...

<A TITLE="Add your own comments on this story" HREF=....>
<IMG ALT="Post a comment">
</A>

I want to comment on the second issue, long URLs generated by automated
software. 

I find Cnet News  <news.cnet.com> to be quite usable with Window-Eyes
and
Lynx.  But they have a feature whereby you can read and comment on
messages
submitted by readers of the current article.  Most of its output is just
fine, except for one button which allows you to submit a comment, which
has
no title or alt.  In the article at

http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-3310477.html?tag=st.ne.1002.lthd.10
05-2
00-3310477 
about Congress wanting to crack down on hackers, the offending link in
the
"message boards" section of this story reads
<a
href="/news/reviewentry/1,10799,0-1005-602-3310477,00.html?tag=st.ne.ni.
ucwy
tnav.wytfm"><img src="/Images/News/Graphics/UserReviews/button_21.gif"
width="78" height="34" align="right" border="0"></a>
in which Window-Eyes reads the unintelligible URL 
news/reviewentry/1,10799,0-1005-602-3310477,00.html?tag=st.ne.ni.ucwytna
v.wy
tfm
and Lynx instead parses the name of the image and provides 
[button_21] as the name of the link.  If this image had an alt or a
title,
both programs would use it.  I never until now tried to find out where
this
link takes you, but using Window-Eyes to read the long URL in the midst
of
intelligible text is disruptive enough that I sometimes stop the
automatic
reading of the story, skip that line, then resume the read-to-end
function.
   

Databases should produce alt or title attributes for all clickable
images,
period.  It would be even better if they meant something in the current
context.
