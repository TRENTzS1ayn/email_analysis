The branching metaphor is certainly well known, unfortunately it remains
text based.

I believe that the 3d space is even more universal, perhaps in the meantime
a tree of icons would serve some purpose.
A very real issue is that whilst words and shopping are easy to represent
textually, most abstract concepts are not easy to represent graphically.

parts of speech are a special case, but even say pop music, any graphical
representation will tend to be connected to a marketed product.

My concern would be that we make a start....

I have created a java based drive thru with web-links to numerous topical
issues including:

unfortunately it is currently offline.
