I agree with Anne that for the present webbrain is not functional, however
by using small graphics it could be a real hit.

eg consider that by marking our site in favourites your favourite image of a
pussycat.
whilst it may be small, it loads fast, and allows a non-reader to identify a
link they might learn to like.
