Charles Opperman is right on the money as I see it. As to Dave's original
request for database-backed software to ensure that there is alternative
text, it is a requirement covered by several different checkpoints in the
Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines, so getting increased conformance to
those will hopefully improve matters considerably. 

Cheers

  It's some god-awful HTML.  I don't blame the authors for having long
  URLs - that's necessary for this kind of stuff with the current
  technology, but not having a ALT attribute is the first mistake.  I'd
  also like to see a TITLE attribute on the <A> element - not as a
  substitute for the ALT though. 
  
  So, in psuedo-code...
  
  <A TITLE="Add your own comments on this story" HREF=....>
  <IMG ALT="Post a comment">
  </A>

  I want to comment on the second issue, long URLs generated by automated
  software. 
  
  I find Cnet News  <news.cnet.com> to be quite usable with Window-Eyes
  and
  Lynx.  But they have a feature whereby you can read and comment on
  messages
  submitted by readers of the current article.  Most of its output is just
  fine, except for one button which allows you to submit a comment, which
  has
  no title or alt.  In the article at
  
  http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-3310477.html?tag=st.ne.1002.lthd.10
  05-2
  00-3310477 
  about Congress wanting to crack down on hackers, the offending link in
  the
  "message boards" section of this story reads
  <a
  href="/news/reviewentry/1,10799,0-1005-602-3310477,00.html?tag=st.ne.ni.
  ucwy
  tnav.wytfm"><img src="/Images/News/Graphics/UserReviews/button_21.gif"
  width="78" height="34" align="right" border="0"></a>
  in which Window-Eyes reads the unintelligible URL 
  news/reviewentry/1,10799,0-1005-602-3310477,00.html?tag=st.ne.ni.ucwytna
  v.wy
  tfm
  and Lynx instead parses the name of the image and provides 
  [button_21] as the name of the link.  If this image had an alt or a
  title,
  both programs would use it.  I never until now tried to find out where
  this
  link takes you, but using Window-Eyes to read the long URL in the midst
  of
  intelligible text is disruptive enough that I sometimes stop the
  automatic
  reading of the story, skip that line, then resume the read-to-end
  function.
     
  
  Databases should produce alt or title attributes for all clickable
  images,
  period.  It would be even better if they meant something in the current
  context.
