Hi,

I've been developing software which integrates information from diverse
sources into a single form for a user, e.g. a web page.  One application
of the software can be integrating information about user errors when
filling out a form on a web page.  There are various ways that user
errors can be integrated into a web page.  I've set up a web site which
tests some of these various ways to see which improve the efficiency of
blind web users.  Both blind and sighted users are welcome to try the
test.  Currently, the test only work for Netscape 4.0 or Internet 4.0 or
new versions of these browsers.  The web site starts at:

Thanks,
