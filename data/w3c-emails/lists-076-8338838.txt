All,

I apologize for the cross post....however this is important and urgent.

Does anyone know of any public domain artwork or photos that could be used
in the NYT Digital Divide Supplement that is coming out on NOV 16.  This
artwork should show a person with a disabilit using a computer.

Any help would be appreciated.


Sincerely,

Mike Burks
