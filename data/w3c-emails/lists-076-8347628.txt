I think I didn't explain my intention clearly, no surprise there then.
Rather than each image having a series of defaults, if the header gave the
list of libraries to default through, then each(library) image could be
tested against these.
(That is similar to the way the proprietary applications work.)

I did try object in ie5 after Chaas suggested it a while back with less than
any success. (Another project)
