Perhaps also it would be worth mentioning again that currently the
applications that use these libraries are not cheap. They also do not fit
well with the concept of universality and the web.

The european initiative on email with graphics uses a similiar and
proprietary system.

It is surely time that w3c investigated ways to allow this disadvantaged
minority the means to browse and communicate with freeware like the
majority.
