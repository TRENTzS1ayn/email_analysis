> I'd like to recommend the report of the RNIB Internet Project - the one
that
> Lesley Waddell informed SENIT about a few weeks ago.  The project was
> carried out by RNIB Technology in Learning and employment (TiLE).  It
> considered how children with visual difficulties utilise the internet both
> socially and within the curriculum.  The report is a very clear account of
> the challenges and opportunities presented by the Internet to learners
with
> visual difficulties.   It should be compulsory reading for people
designing
> websites!
