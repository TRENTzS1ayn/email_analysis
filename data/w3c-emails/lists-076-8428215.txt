Though I do not agree to the fact so much, but 
one reason is that in lower resolutions than what 
the site has been designed for, fixed size will 
give horizontal scrolling.

Another reason could be greater use of available 
space at any resolution.

However,
Working in percentage mode, might increase blank 
spaces, and disrupt the layout as well, thus 
affecting accessability in a different way

I believe that one has to focus on audience and 
then take such decisions. Generalizing, is 
probably not the right thing here.

just my 2 cents..
