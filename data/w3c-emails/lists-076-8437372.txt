As you say, using the available space is also helpful. On a 1600x1200
browser, it is possible to use a large font, and take the available
space. But again, with a fixed width layout, this may only appear in half the
screen, which is a big waste.

In fact, the most common way of doing fixed widths is to have tables for
column layout. This is not ideal anyway, but if it is going to be used then
tables are pretty good at reflowing content in most browsers that support
them.

Cheers (and I think you should revalue it to a few more cents ;-)

  Though I do not agree to the fact so much, but 
  one reason is that in lower resolutions than what

  give horizontal scrolling.
  
  Another reason could be greater use of available 
  space at any resolution.
  
  However,
  Working in percentage mode, might increase blank 
  spaces, and disrupt the layout as well, thus 
  affecting accessability in a different way
  
  I believe that one has to focus on audience and 
  then take such decisions. Generalizing, is 
  probably not the right thing here.
  
  just my 2 cents..
