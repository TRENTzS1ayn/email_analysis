On a related topic.

If an author specifies a font family using CSS, I understand that it is not
possible for an end user to change the font easily - the user must have a
local CSS file available (which I suspect not many do) and know how to
choose it.

Does specification of a font family cause accessibility problems?

Should font families (e.g. Times, Arial, etc) be omitted from CSS (as I have
heard suggested)?  Or would this be unacceptable for those concerned about
the design, and possibly case accessibility problems for users who don't
know how to change the default settings?

Or am I mistaken in how CSS values can be changed?
