It depends on the browser. Good browsers actually provide a very simple
override interface - effectively processing the user's selections in
presentation preferences as if they are CSS declarations marked !important
(which is technical speak for saying they override the author).

As an example of a style sheet proper that does this, I offer the following:

body { font-family: Sans-serif !important !inherit ; font-size: 54.7pt
!important !inherit }

This should work with browsers such as IE, Conqueror, Opera, Amaya, ...

So I don't think that we should be recommending against setting fonts in CSS
(besides, the alternative that people will / do use is to put all the text
into an image, which is much more difficult to change).

  On a related topic.
  
  If an author specifies a font family using CSS, I understand that it is not
  possible for an end user to change the font easily - the user must have a
  local CSS file available (which I suspect not many do) and know how to
  choose it.
  
  Does specification of a font family cause accessibility problems?
  
  Should font families (e.g. Times, Arial, etc) be omitted from CSS (as I have
  heard suggested)?  Or would this be unacceptable for those concerned about
  the design, and possibly case accessibility problems for users who don't
  know how to change the default settings?
  
  Or am I mistaken in how CSS values can be changed?
