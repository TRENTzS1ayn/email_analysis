Dear Sirs,

Please be advised that your company's main page on accessibility at URL:
<http://www.macromedia.com/macromedia/accessibility/>
Can not itself be consider accessible because it violates one or more
priority one checkpoints of the W3C WAI WCAG 1.0.  (The page that provoked
me to write cites this resource, so I won't repeat the link address!)

Specifically, the frames on the page do not have meaningful titles.  Also,
your NOSCRIPT content is not adequate.  I get the message "Your web browser
does not support frames. Please upgrade to the latest [4]Netscape or
[5]Internet Explorer browser."  Actually, I am using Lynx, which handles
frames quite satisfactorily, thank you very much!

The frame with the main content is at URL:
<http://www.macromedia.com/macromedia/accessibility/contents.html>

This page also had problems in that some ALT content was missing for some
spacer elements.  This was odd because you, quite appropriately, used ALT=""
on many of the content-free GIFs used for positioning.

I am very interested in the accessibility of Flash and other MacroMedia
products.  I am especially interested in learning how Flash (with the
accessibility hooks) compares to SVG.  I could not find any reference to SVG
on your web site.  Also, could you post or reference or send examples of
accessible Flash content?

Thank you very much.

Sincerely,
Bruce Bailey
