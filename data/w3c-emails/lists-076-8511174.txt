Please read the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines draft which is
currently in
Last Call.

If what it says there don't address this issue adequately, please holler.? 

Where the font family causes a problem, the user should have an expeditious

to gain relief.? But hopefully that doesn't require denying the author access
to fonts in styling.
