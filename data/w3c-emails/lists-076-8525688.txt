WAI Interest Group:

Please note that the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 
http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-UAAG10-20001023
are currently undergoing last call review.

The last call review period ends 13 November 2000. W3C welcomes review
comments before that date, sent to w3c-wai-ua@w3.org . This review request
may be forwarded to non-W3C organizations.

These guidelines address accessibility of browsers, and other software that
retrieves and renders Web content. They are one of the three complementary
guidelines for Web accessibility produced by the W3C's Web Accessibility
Initiative; the other two guidelines are the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines 1.0, and the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 1.0, both
of which are W3C Recommendations.

This last call draft addresses issues raised in a previous Proposed
Recommendation version of this document. Additional information on this
Last Call Review Request, and a copy of the formal last call notice, are
available at 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0140.html

Comments at the last call stage are most important towards stabilizing the
document before it re-enters the Candidate Recommendation (if applicable)
and the Proposed Recommendation stage.

Please note also the request for implementation reports included in the
formal Last Call review request.

The User Agent Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (UAWG) has also
published an updated version of the Techniques for User Agent Accessibility
Guidelines 
        http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-UAAG10-TECHS-20001023/
on which the UAWG also welcomes comments at w3c-wai-ua@w3.org .

Thank you,

- Judy
