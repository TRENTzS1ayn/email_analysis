Perhaps this is a bit too theoretical to be of much use, but I have thought
of a possible compromise for using images to represent text.

To designers, using style sheets is not a true substitute for using an image
file to display text.  And the reverse is true for HTML purists.  So perhaps
we could have the best of both worlds...

Adding an attribute to the image tag could help define the image as text,
which would still define the "meaning" of the piece of information such as:

<img src="abc.gif" alt="Contact Us" equivalent="h1" height=...>

Browsers could display the image for this element if the user has images
turned on, or could render the alternative being:
<h1>Contact Us</h1>

This would be an improvement for accessibility and designers.  Designers
wouldn't have thier design destroyed if someone turns off images, and other
users would be delivered more meaningful content.

Just my $.02
