That's OK for how to code in current technology, but "If I ran the Zoo"
solutions are also valuable to create and collect at this time.

Step past html:img and html:object to smil:switch.  Then step back consider
how
it should work.

Sketches of "it would be good if it worked like this" will be useful to the
HTML Working Group as they consider how they re-baseline lots of things to use
X-Link.  the OBJECT element is high on their list.  Son-of-OBJECT could well
look something like what Ben is thinking.

What if an IMG had a TITLE and DESCription, each of which was hypertext, with
arbitrary markup captured within it, as a drawing subgroup (svg:g) now has in
SVG?
