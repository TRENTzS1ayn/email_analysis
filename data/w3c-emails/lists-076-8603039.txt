If this is just a button down image, you shouldn't be describing the
image, just the function of the button, if it visual annotation for
mouseover on another link, you should provide the relevant information
in the title attribute of the link; putting it elsewhere on the screen
would just be confusing.  If necessary provide a hidden (or even 
eplicit) help link for the link.

In neither case, it seems to me, is it right to associate the descriptions
with the image.
