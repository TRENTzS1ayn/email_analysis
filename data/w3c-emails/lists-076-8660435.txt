POP-UP WEATHER ALERT ON THE WAY
The latest in severe weather warning technology was unveiled Wednesday
by
the Dept. of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information
Administration -- it's a new system of pop-up computer screen weather
alerts to warn computer users of problem weather in much the same way
television and radio stations broadcast alerts. If an alert is issued
by
the National Weather Service, a user who has the system turned on
first
hears an alarm, and then sees a red-bordered box pop up on the screen,
warning of a tornado, flood or other threat. Users not interested in
receiving the warnings can turn them off. (AP 1 Nov 2000)
