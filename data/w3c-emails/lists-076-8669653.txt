As I understand it, this is really a style effect, not achange in content (in
most cases). So the better way to do it would be to use the :hover
pseudo-element selector in CSS2, but I am not sure how well that is
implemented.

Alternatively, match the onMouseover/onMouseout pair of triggers with an
onfocus/onblur pair and get the script to change the alt attribute of the img
element whose src attribute is being changed, but that depends on the
DOM/script implementations.

This can also be done in SVG, using animation. But the requirements to meet
SVG syntax restrictions make it a little odd. An example of how can be seen
in section 5.2 of the note Accessibility Features of SVG -
http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG-access/#Animations - (Technical jargon and content
warning).

   Hi
  I'm new to this list so please forgive me if this has come up already. 
  
  Has anyone come up with a solution for making swap-image javascript
  functions accessible? I know that ideally these should be avoided, but I am
  keen to push the boundaries of the guidelines a bit and see what is
  possible. My solution so far has been to simply create a D tag (and a
  longdesc attribute for the image tag) for the default image and then
  describe what each image will look like as the user holds their mouse over a
  different link (for an example see
  http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/dnzb_exhibs/index.htm ). 
  
  Is this an 'acceptable' solution? Are there better ways of doing this?
  
  Thanks
