Dear Group,
I site I am reviewing generates context-sensitive "pop-up" help using
JavaScript.  I imagine they are doing this for the effect that:
(1) The main window stays open;
(2) The new pop-up window is smaller than full-screen and has none of the
normal browsing controls -- so it doesn't really look so much a web page.

The pop-up is invoked by code like:
<A href="JavaScript:Help('foobar.htm')">definition of FooBar</A>

Obviously, the HTML file is available if one can figure out how to hunt it
down (it's fairly well hidden).  Lynx just generates a message:  "Alert!:
Unsupported URL scheme!" and nothing happens.

Is there an alternative way to code this so that 4x browsers still get the
no-frills pop-up version, but Lynx (and other JavaScript-free) users get the
regular URL for the help text?

I need help with this kind of urgently.  If the techniques document goes
into this much detail, please feel free to slap my wrist after referring me
to the right section!

Thanks.
Bruce Bailey
