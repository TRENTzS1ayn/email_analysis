Hi All,

Assuming the user has his or her system configured correctly, a mailto link 
should launch the e-mail program and open a new message properly 
addressed.  In my experiences using most screen readers this is not an 
accessibility problem.  When the focus changes the screen reader alerts 
that this is happening, especially if a new program is launching.

Personally I prefer mailto links because it avoids having to copy and paste 
the e-mail address into another program.
