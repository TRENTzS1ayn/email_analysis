Well, yes i had visited favicon.com and read their FAQ.

I have 
deleted my history file
deleted cache
deleted favourites
renamed home
deleted shortcuts
force refreshed 
searched and deleted all favicon.ico resources
shift left click drag on icon in address bar to no effect

any further ideas welcome.
This just does not seem very well thought out.
Obviously no one else would go to this trouble.

Equally it is not true to say that
