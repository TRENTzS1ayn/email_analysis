Maybe there is something wrong with your installation of IE.  We have 1200
users in the agency I work for and there have been numerous times when the
browser behavior was unexplainable.  In these strange cases, once we
reinstalled the browser, things worked properly.

I know that I personally lost all my icons once when clearing out history
and all I did to get them to return was save the favorite again.  It could
be that you are doing the right thing and the browser is not!

Best wishes,
Dan Cathers

Well, yes i had visited favicon.com and read their FAQ.

I have
deleted my history file
deleted cache
deleted favourites
renamed home
deleted shortcuts
force refreshed
searched and deleted all favicon.ico resources
shift left click drag on icon in address bar to no effect

any further ideas welcome.
This just does not seem very well thought out.
Obviously no one else would go to this trouble.

Equally it is not true to say that
