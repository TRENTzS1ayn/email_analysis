Hi all - I have a question about the accessibility of user controls that
automatically update a page.

Some search engines will allow a user to click on a button or link called
"more" to retrieve additional information about the search result in
question. Often this will load a new page with the description or a
JavaScript function to pop-up a second window.

My question is this: is there a problem with using that technique to load
additional information in the same page with a server-side language, thereby
avoiding the issues of JavaScript? The function could load additional
information on the search result from the database and post the information
below the result the user wanted more information about. This means the page
will reload but retain the original list of search results with the
additional information posted below the "parent" result.

I suppose this could cause a conflict with WCAG #6.2, though I'm unsure of
how this technique applies to that checkpoint. Checkpoint 10.1 states to
"not change the current window without informing the user". My hunch is the
button "more information" would alert the user that the content is to
change.

Using this technique could make large chunks of data - like search engine
results - more manageable if the user is listening to the results. 

Thanks for any feedback!

Joel
