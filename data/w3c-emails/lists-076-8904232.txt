On the web there is a phone number to place orders but no TTY capability is
not listed. However, if a person using a TTY device calls, they are
automatically forwarded to an operator that will take the order.  this
operator is not part of the call center but a service offered by the
telecommunication carrier.

what is the proper way to describe a process without offending anyone?

for example, would you say.  For customer orders call 800-123-4567 (TTY
enabled)

in the future we will have TTY capability from the call center.


thanks, rob neff
