I would give you your choice of how to say it.  Actually, you should go
straight to SHHH and/or other consumer-advocacy groups for advice on this as
well, and not stop with WAI.

This is a rule that applies to print advertising of the TTY-enabled phone
number as well as to advertising this capability on the Web.  And the issue is
what will the TTY-user community recognize, not anything web-technical.

The range of options that make logical sense include:

[Separate entries, because that is what the text telephone (TTY/TDD) users
expect.]

[example]

For orders call 800-xxx-yyyy

Text telephone (TTY/TDD) users, call this number as well.

[end example]

[Integrated listing. -- three examples]

For orders call 800-xxx-yyyy.  Note: this number will get you to text
telephone
service (TTY/TDD) as well.

For orders call 800-xxx-yyyy (text telephone (TTY/TDD) users, call this
number,
too.)

For orders call 800-xxx-yyyy (TTY OK).

-- end of examples.

I lifted the language 

Text telephone (TTY/TDD) users

out of the telephone book.  This is verbose but probably the phone company as
the omnibus monopoly utility has been under the closest scrutiny and pressure
to say it clearly.  So how they say it is probably a good way to say it.

The word 'enabled' is too geeky.  'TTY-capable is better plain English, but
still on the pointy-headed side of popular argot.  I would like to see
something very brief like "TTY OK" emerge as the code word for this
capability,
because during the transition, it is going to have to go on _lots_ of
telephone
numbers in print and other text-bearing media.  But that should be OK'd by
consumer representatives adn/or representative consumers before it's promoted.
