Hello,
The US Access Board, in their guidance on compliance with the ADA, recommend
that the description "TTY" be utilized rather than TDD since it is more
inclusive of people with speech disabilities.  (TDD refers to "Telephone
Device for the Deaf"). As a result, the practice in California local govt is
to say, "For customer orders call 800-123-4567 (V/TTY)."  By using this
description "(V/TTY)" the deaf community in California would know that both
oral and deaf customers should call this number.

Best regards,
Cynthia Waddell
Formerly ADA compliance officer for City of San Jose

and than there is something like:
call this number for all orders in all modes.
this is not a finished thought but I think in the electronic age, we
need to begin to think more universally.  even if we have to explain
it at the outset, it will be worth it in the final annalysis.

I would give you your choice of how to say it.  Actually, you should
go
straight to SHHH and/or other consumer-advocacy groups for advice on
this as
well, and not stop with WAI.

This is a rule that applies to print advertising of the TTY-enabled
phone
number as well as to advertising this capability on the Web.  And the
issue is
what will the TTY-user community recognize, not anything
web-technical.

The range of options that make logical sense include:

[Separate entries, because that is what the text telephone (TTY/TDD)
users
expect.]

[example]

For orders call 800-xxx-yyyy

Text telephone (TTY/TDD) users, call this number as well.

[end example]

[Integrated listing. -- three examples]

For orders call 800-xxx-yyyy.  Note: this number will get you to text
telephone
service (TTY/TDD) as well.

For orders call 800-xxx-yyyy (text telephone (TTY/TDD) users, call
this
number,
too.)

For orders call 800-xxx-yyyy (TTY OK).

-- end of examples.

I lifted the language

Text telephone (TTY/TDD) users

out of the telephone book.  This is verbose but probably the phone
company as
the omnibus monopoly utility has been under the closest scrutiny and
pressure
to say it clearly.  So how they say it is probably a good way to say
it.

The word 'enabled' is too geeky.  'TTY-capable is better plain
English, but
still on the pointy-headed side of popular argot.  I would like to see
something very brief like "TTY OK" emerge as the code word for this
capability,
because during the transition, it is going to have to go on _lots_ of
telephone
numbers in print and other text-bearing media.  But that should be
OK'd by
consumer representatives adn/or representative consumers before it's
promoted.
