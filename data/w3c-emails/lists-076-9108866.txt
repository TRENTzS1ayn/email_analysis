Err.....from whose perspective? a disabled person, the individuals 
concerned or the beasts involved, you must forgive the fact I will not be 
checking it out for my web sites that suck feature in my on-line magazine!!

But it does pose an interesting marketing question as to the feasibility of 
an accessible porn site. Writing the alt tags could prove interesting. 
Especially as there are now three blind individuals who are now taking a 
group of lap dancers to court claiming they are providing an unaccessible 
service to blind people. Their case is built around the fact that a blind 
person see's with their hands, and of course they are not.......sorry I do 
not really need to explain.
