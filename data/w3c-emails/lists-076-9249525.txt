Jamie,

I would put them in an unordered list.

And I am not sure that you need more than a newline anyway - perhaps you
should take that question to the WCAG group.

I agree that using a gif seperator isn't really helpful.

Cheers

Charles

  Simple question I gues, but has anyone got a good way for breaking up lists
  of links?

  I just want to list 6 navigation links one under the other on the front
  page. According to the guidelines I need to have more than just a <br> or
  <p> and they suggest using a numbered list to break up the links. However
  this solution would not be appropriate for what I am trying to achieve (and
  it seems very anti-usability to unecessarily impose order on navigation).

  I guess another option is the old single pixel gif (with blank alt="" of
  course), but this seems like a backward step to me, and goes against the aim
  of separating formatting from content.

  Any suggestions welcome
