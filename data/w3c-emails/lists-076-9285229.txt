I faintly recall a post complaining about this some time ago...
Do current versions of MS IE 5+ not offer the ability to disable JavaScript?
Asked without the double negatives:  Am I forced to have JavaScript enabled
when using MS IE?
Can anyone direct me to more information about this?
Thanks,
Bruce Bailey
