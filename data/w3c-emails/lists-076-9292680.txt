Hi,

To disable JavaScript, choose Internet Options from the Tools menu.  Then 
choose the Security tab from the resulting dialog.  Choose Internet as the 
zone for which you want to change security and then Custom level.  The 
options for disabling JavaScript will be near the end of the long list of 
options that come up.
