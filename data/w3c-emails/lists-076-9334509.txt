While developing a Web-based virtual tour for an art museum, I have 
had no difficulty identifying most of the changes in language that 
occur within a site of this nature.  However, in addition to French, 
Italian and other familiar languages, I have also encountered some 
obscure languages, such as those spoken by tribes rather than nations.  
I've been referring to a list of ISO language codes located at:

  http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/iso639a.html

It does not include certain languages such as Bamileke (Cameroon), 
Baule (Ivory Coast) and Hemba (Democratic Republic of the Congo).

Questions for the list:

  1. Is there a better source for language codes that might 
     include these languages?

  2. If I am unable to find official language codes, what are my 
     options, besides ignoring this Priority 1 checkpoint?

Thank you,
