Hi,

Forgive me for  cross posting this request from my web site in an effort to 
get some constructive ideas for an interesting subject.

"I'm looking for data or ethnograpies about how the deaf community use of 
communication media. I cannot find studies about this subject. Could 
anybody help me and indicate some resource?"

Thanks in advance
Paul Davis
