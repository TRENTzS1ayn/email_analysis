Hi
I am unsure what to suggest when referencing W3C
documents in legislation.
On the one hand it would seem that the legislation
could refer to a *specific version* of a W3C document
with the possible consequences that:-

1. A web site is accessible in terms of the law but
because of changes in technology etc. it may not be
currently accessible, or
2. Adherence to the law causes unnecessary work
because the law is outdated and no longer 'makes
sense'.

On the other hand if the legislation refers to *the
current version* then the law is always a moving
target which makes the provision of accessibility
particularly onerous.

Is there a straight forward way around this problem?

Regards
Graham Oliver
