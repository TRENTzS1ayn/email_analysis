You probably should ask the developer of the site. :)

The main arguments _for_ using server side maps are:

1. Funky shapes and other custom coding (you can actually get pretty
    detailed if you want to for reason, but in most cases you won't
    want to)

2. Backwards compatibility -- at one time, only "new" browsers
    supported server side maps, but that time was about 4 years ago


The main arguments _against_ using server side maps and _for_
using client side server maps:

1. No way of encoding accessibility information via alt in
    server-side

2. Faster processing because it doesn't have to make a server
    roundtrip with client-side

3. Client-side can be used in offline browsing situations just
    fine, because doesn't need access to server

4. A lot easier to make and maintain client-side maps, from the
    webmaster's perspective

5. Client-side works great in all current browsers including Lynx

6. Server-side maps require additional, redundant textual links
    which are not required for client-side maps (but they are still
    a good idea)
