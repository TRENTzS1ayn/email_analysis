Hi All,

Frontend has published a white paper "Accessibility and Usability for
e-Government - A Primer for Public Sector Officials".

This paper is intended as a primer for public sector officials who are
responsible for or otherwise involved in the creation of web sites and
although it is written within an Irish context, it may be of interest.

I would be grateful for feedback and comments from the group - positive and
negative! If anyone would like a copy, please let me know and I will happily
forward it - it's available in PDF, MS Word 2000 format ot as a text file.

We have also posted it on our website, at the following URL

regards,

Anthony
