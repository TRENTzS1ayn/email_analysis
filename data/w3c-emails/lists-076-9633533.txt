At the risk of appearing to be insensative and on the impropper side
of this question, I have to ask:
1> have you talked to mm about this?  I must confess here that I did
not read the entire article only to the point where we got to the open
question aire because it was unclear as to where to go.  there was a
link that spoke its self to me as:
<> or something to that effect and above that was "beyond the press
release".

2> are you going to go after adove as well?  the damage they have done
here is magnificent.

I also want to comment on braille as you have it in your article.
braille is still the best means no matter how few people use it to
deal with certain types of information.  Also, it is a bit of a secret
but braille useage is and will be on the rise so braille is something
to be payed attention to.

I take isue as well with the contention in the article that alt stands
for an image.  My view however is unpopular.  alt should convey the
same thing that the image would convey.  for instance.  if you have a
logo for xyz you need to put xyz corporation in the alt tag.

Lastly, this is a first attempt and should be commended and recognized
as such.
