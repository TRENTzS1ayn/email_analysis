Hi Anthony

Sorry if this sounds like a smartass comment -  I actually think what you
are doing is great -  but I would have thought that such a document should
be presented in a more accessible way. For example, according to Wave, the
main text doesn't start until the 61st cell of your table - lots of stuff to
wade through if you are relying on a screen reader. 

This is particulary important for a web page which people new to desinging
accesible sites will look to for design and layout ideas as well as for the
content it contains.
