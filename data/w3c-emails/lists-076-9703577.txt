David/Michael,

Are you saying that JAWS ignores the text you had as "some text:" in your
example, or that JAWS does not recognize the fact that you have specified
"some text:" as the LABEL for the INPUT? The answer from Freedom Scientific
seems to have these two issues mixed up as well.

I would be very surprised if the first is the problem.

There is an explanation it yours is the second issue. Your code is wrong. It
isn't just your example below either; the error is on the referenced page
(http://holstius.com/span_tags.html). The value of the for attribute in the
LABEL element must be the id of the corresponding form element, not the
name.

Yours is a beautifully laid out form and adding id="..." for each of those
form elements should really do the job.

Subject: JAWS discards SPAN content?


I've been messaging the kind folks over at Henter-Joyce since a problem with
"missing content" on a web page appeared a week ago. Appearently, JAWS VPC
discards content between SPAN tags; the problem's been reported with IE 5.5
plus Jaws 3.7, if I recall correctly, but not with IE 5.0. An example is
available at <http://holstius.com/span_tags.html>. Code in question looks
something like:

  <span class="X"><label for="MyField">Some text:</label></span><input
name="Myfield" ...

where I was using a rule:

  .X { width: 12em; text-align: right; }

to make the form's input fields align nicely with their labels without
resorting to a TABLE. (Just wanted to see if it worked.) Could have just set
the class on the LABEL tag, yes, but still this is syntactically valid. I
got a reply from an HJ representative:

Workable, yes, but does anyone want to see content they've put between SPANs
(in many cases, put there to avoid deprecated or improper markup) rendered
inaudible for users of JAWS and IE 5.5??? I urged this representative to put
this high on his priority list of fixable bugs. If you visit the above page
(<http://holstius.com/span_tags.html>) and don't hear anything like
"Author", "Title", "Publisher", etc. before the form fields, there's a
problem. Thanks to anyone who takes the time to check this out.

JAWS users, you may especially wish to ask HJ about this.
