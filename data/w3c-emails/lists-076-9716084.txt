it is the second problem we face.  Thanks for the tip.  I'll be
interested in what the change results in.

David/Michael,

Are you saying that JAWS ignores the text you had as "some text:" in
your
example, or that JAWS does not recognize the fact that you have
specified
"some text:" as the LABEL for the INPUT? The answer from Freedom
Scientific
seems to have these two issues mixed up as well.

I would be very surprised if the first is the problem.

There is an explanation it yours is the second issue. Your code is
wrong. It
isn't just your example below either; the error is on the referenced
page
(http://holstius.com/span_tags.html). The value of the for attribute
in the
LABEL element must be the id of the corresponding form element, not
the
name.

Yours is a beautifully laid out form and adding id="..." for each of
those
form elements should really do the job.

Subject: JAWS discards SPAN content?


I've been messaging the kind folks over at Henter-Joyce since a
problem with
"missing content" on a web page appeared a week ago. Appearently, JAWS
VPC
discards content between SPAN tags; the problem's been reported with
IE 5.5
plus Jaws 3.7, if I recall correctly, but not with IE 5.0. An example
is
available at <http://holstius.com/span_tags.html>. Code in question
looks
something like:

  <span class="X"><label for="MyField">Some text:</label></span><input
name="Myfield" ...

where I was using a rule:

  .X { width: 12em; text-align: right; }

to make the form's input fields align nicely with their labels without
resorting to a TABLE. (Just wanted to see if it worked.) Could have
just set
the class on the LABEL tag, yes, but still this is syntactically
valid. I
got a reply from an HJ representative:

> Currently Jaws VPC does not support these tags and therefore

Workable, yes, but does anyone want to see content they've put between
SPANs
(in many cases, put there to avoid deprecated or improper markup)
rendered
inaudible for users of JAWS and IE 5.5??? I urged this representative
to put
this high on his priority list of fixable bugs. If you visit the above
page
(<http://holstius.com/span_tags.html>) and don't hear anything like
"Author", "Title", "Publisher", etc. before the form fields, there's a
problem. Thanks to anyone who takes the time to check this out.

JAWS users, you may especially wish to ask HJ about this.
