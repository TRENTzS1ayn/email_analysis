I was just at:
http://www.infobeat.com
and was surprised to find that after I think it was three attempts to
enter my correct password, I was warned that the next failed attempt
would lock me out of the site for 24 hours.  So, I guess if I have a
motor problem and have trouble with things like this it's too bad.
