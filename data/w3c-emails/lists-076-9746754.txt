Hello all!

I've completed the first of several accessibility articles.  The initial one
was included on our Unisys internal product information (PI) site.  My
intent was to make some of my co-workers -company wide - aware of the
issues.  The response was as expected.  Most didn't have a clue that blind
accessibility was a problem.  The good news is that they were all interested
and willing to learn about it.

I suspect that will be the familiar response to the other articles I've
planned.  The one that I've linked to below was just printed in the December
newsletter of the Orange County chapter of the Society for Technical
Communication.  The parent STC is one of the world's largest groups of
technical writers/communicators.  A larger variation of this article is
slated for their monthly magazine - to be published sometime this Spring.
(I will try to include some more tips, some quotes, and some info on
screen-readers in that article.)

I would appreciate your comments on this article and anything you think I
should add to get the message across.

I hope to continue with these types of articles for web designers and the
managers who direct their web staff.  Any suggestions will be cheerfully
accepted.  I don't want the article to become the "total reference" for the
subject -- just a serious overview to get people thinking. (There are too
many good websites providing additional detailed info for the more
complicated items.)  

By the way, if you think this article worthy of reprinting or posting, I'd
be happy to accomodate.  Please ask first.  (And use my email address of
mrcalc@usa.net for contact info.)

Thanks!

Guy
