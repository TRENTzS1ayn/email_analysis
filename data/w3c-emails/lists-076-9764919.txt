I didn't want to send a Word file to everybody on the list without their
permission.  I will send one to Kathleen and will send one to whomever
requests it.  Just drop me a line here.  (I'll be out of the office until
the end of the day but will respond promptly)
Thanks for the interest!
Guy

Dear Mr. Ball:
Unless I'm missing something, the link below leads to a page with links
to PDF documents. Can you provide the newsletter in a more accessible
format please?
Thank you,
