Hello,

Re: Can you provide the newsletter ON YOUR SITE in a more accessible format?
HTML and/or text would be fine.  You'd get a much wider audience that way.

I have several clients that offer their newsletters in PDF format like the
example above. Obviously html would be preferable, but their budgets do not
allow for the newsletter(s) to be made into html while the commercial
printer will provide a PDF version at little or no cost. The impression I am
under is that Adobe offers PDF to text/html translation through their web
site. Does this service work in a both an official and practical sense?

Outside of the span issues, this page looks wildly different in I.E. 5.0 and
Netscape 4.5.
