Kathleen:
Unfortunately I don't control that site.  I will forward your message to
their webmaster.  This is a great example of people who need to understand
what my article was all about - accessibility of a website to all.  So many
people (technical writers, companies) are moving their documents and printed
materials to pdf formats - which may or may not be accessible (depending on
whom you talk to).  We need to push the message out that ease of publishing
(which is what pdf offers) does not mean total accessibility to an important
audience.
Guy

Guy:
Your were right about not sending the Word version to the list; thank you
for that.  I guess my question was too subtle. Can you provide the
newsletter ON YOUR SITE in a more accessible format? HTML and/or text would
be fine.  You'd get a much wider audience that way.

Thanks,
