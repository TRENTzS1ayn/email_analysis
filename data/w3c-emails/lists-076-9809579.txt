Officially, the Adobe thing works. Practically it works too - it translates
PDF into HTML. How useful the resulting HTML is depends a lot on the original
PDF - some PDF can be translated into extremely useful content, other PDF
turns out more or less pointless.

Authoring good HTML or authoring good PDF is preferable - it is possible to
use both formats to make something that is more or less useless to readers.

  Hello,

  Re: Can you provide the newsletter ON YOUR SITE in a more accessible format?
  HTML and/or text would be fine.  You'd get a much wider audience that way.

  I have several clients that offer their newsletters in PDF format like the
  example above. Obviously html would be preferable, but their budgets do not
  allow for the newsletter(s) to be made into html while the commercial
  printer will provide a PDF version at little or no cost. The impression I am
  under is that Adobe offers PDF to text/html translation through their web
  site. Does this service work in a both an official and practical sense?

  Outside of the span issues, this page looks wildly different in I.E. 5.0 and
  Netscape 4.5.
