Hi Jamie,

An emulator will never really be as good as the real thing - although the
Wave is handy, especially for doing quick checks of things as you go. I'm
not sure about using an audio browser to simulate a screen reader either. I
don't have much experience with IBM's home page reader but I know that PW
Web speak, for example, can parse tables, so it doesn't provide you with the
insight you are looking for.

One thing I would suggest is to try to involve someone who uses a screen
reader in testing your pages. You will need to be there yourself, or arrange
to have someone run the test with them. If you can somehow arrange for your
boss (or some other colleague who can help influence whoever signs the
cheques) to go along, that should certainly help your case, as they will
then have a better understanding of what you are trying to do and will at
least realise that you are not just trying to buy some fancy IT equipment
for the hell of it. A very simplistic approach, I know but worth
considering.

The other major benefit of involving real people in your development process
is that you will get feedback which will help you to overcome usability
problems you did not even know existed in your design in the first place.

Hope this is useful.

Anthony

Hi Anthony

I just used The Wave for checking your page. I am some way off being able to
convince the Powers that Be to fork out for a screen reader for me to use
for testing (though I have used IBM's Home Page in the past). I would be
interested to know if others have found if The Wave accurately represents
how a screen reader works.

Jamie
