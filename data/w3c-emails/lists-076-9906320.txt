Nancy,

Adobe has a white paper called "Optimizing Adobe PDF Files for
Accessibility" (http://access.adobe.com/white-paper.html). It includes some
very basic Optimization Guidelines.

My initial experience with the Adobe Access Plug-in has been quite positive.
The limitations are similar those of the early web screen readers, e.g.
graphics without descriptions and complex multi-column layout are the main
problems. I believe some of their future enhancements will focus on
identifying the appropriate reading order for complex layouts. For now,
simple (single-column or uncomplicated multi-column) documents convert very
well for use with a screen reader.

Mike

Charles,

I am intrigued by your comment of "good PDF". Up until recently I have not
had occasion to need to create PDF's for clients, but will be very shortly.
Can you suggest any resources where I might learn more about good vs bad
PDF.

Thanks,
-Nancy
