Hi all,

There is now a mailing list (with web archive) for gateway users to
support each other.  I expect (hope) that the traffic will be quite
low.  Anyone is welcome to join.

To subscribe, send an email to majordomo@accu.org with the following
subject:

subscribe access-gateway-users

Best wishes, Silas

(Sorry if this mail is not relevant to you - I tried to pick the right
addresses from my list, but mistakes do happen.)
