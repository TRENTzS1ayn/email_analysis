Can anyone on the list help with this discussion? thanks in advance.


No..actually this still doesn't clarify it for me..I read that info
online, too...which at least helped me to guess that 1.4 referred to
syncying. But what I still don't understand..text equivalents INCLUDE
auditory descriptions...SO how does including auditory descriptions help
when the priority states that some user agents can't read them
automatically? And what are they referring to when they talk about text
equivalents if not auditory descriptions?  And if user agents don't
automatically read them, how does adding additional text equivalents
solve anything?  And Why would you need an additional priority to tell you
that these auditory descriptions need to be in sync?

In my mind, 1.3 is still trying to say something different..and I don't
really know what...
