>  I have been recommending using ALT=' '

If you include the space in-between the quotes, then the graphical browsers
may pop-up a tool tip with a space in it.  This is, as Mike Scott said, a
slight annoyance to sighted users, and some graphical designers consider it
a major annoyance (their opinion).  But more importantly it is  confusing
to the learning disabled - in other words it is not a recommended practice
to but space or any other special character between the quotes.

Since newer browsers are now using the title attribute first, if it is
there, as the source of the tool tip, then that needs to be considered as
well.

The HTML 4 spec requires the alt attribute to be valid HTML.  Bobby and
other checkers look for the existence of the alt attribute tag at least, so
the alt attribute is required.  The content of the alt tag is what is
usually debated.  Considering all disabilities, alt equals quote quote is
best!
