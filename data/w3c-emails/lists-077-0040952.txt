In principle either should be fine. In practice there are usability questions
that can arise - some browsers give a tool tip for one but not the other,
some screen readers try to add something for one but not the other, etc.

There are several threads on this list discussing the same issue.

  This may be a silly question but we've run multilple validators against our

  Different validators give a different result.  Should we use " " or "".  For
  the non sited that is Quote Space Quote or Quote Quote.
