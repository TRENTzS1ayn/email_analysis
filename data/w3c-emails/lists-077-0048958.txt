I too urge for alt="". Quote Quote with no space. It is the empty text
string. No information. If any "validator" complains about that, it is
the
validator's problem.

This may be a silly question but we've run multilple validators against
our
site.  My question is with an alt tag for a blank, clear or empty image.
Different validators give a different result.  Should we use " " or "".
For
the non sited that is Quote Space Quote or Quote Quote.
