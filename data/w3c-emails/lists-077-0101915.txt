David, I sure agree that listening to "blank.gif" is not a good thing. But
which assistive technologies are you testing this with. I just did a double
check with Window-Eyes, JAWS and HPR and none of them announce anything when
alt="" (quote quote no space) is used. For example there are lots of those
at http://www.ibm.com/able.

I should clarify this.  I want a character that does not print to the
screen or to an at and returns nothing as it should because of the wide
variety of ways that this is implemented in assistive technology untill
it is fixed in the ats.  It is quite annoying to have to look at
.blank.gif to see if it has an alt and nothing we have to date cures
this.  blank.gif is returned whether we use:
alt="", that's two quotes with no spaces between, alt=" " that's quote
space quote, or "x" that's quote x quote where x stands for a single
character.

Why do you want a  "non-printable character?" The empty text string is
perfectly valid. Sometimes called the null string. It is very different
from
the text string consisting of one space.

I too urge for alt="". Quote Quote with no space. It is the empty text
string. No information. If any "validator" complains about that, it is
the
validator's problem.

This may be a silly question but we've run multilple validators against
our
site.  My question is with an alt tag for a blank, clear or empty image.
Different validators give a different result.  Should we use " " or "".
For
the non sited that is Quote Space Quote or Quote Quote.
