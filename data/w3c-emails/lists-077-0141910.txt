I disagree.  we know it is an item, we want to know if it has a
designation.  if you want to designate a bullet, you use something that
stands for a bullet like -- or -.  if you want to charactize something
with different types of bullets than the same thing that applies for
regular images with alt applies here.  what are you trying to convey.
new is a good word in place of the bullet that represents a new thing.
if the green bullet represents new and the red bullet represents
discontinued, you put new in the alt for the green and discontinued in
the alt for the red.  Function is what we are aiming for in knowing what
something does on a site.  description is for another tag or place.

>> I've been recommending the use of ALT='bullet' for graphic list
bullets
(when people seem unwilling to use the HTML list markup), but I'm
wondering, does ALT='*' has much support? <<

Tyler:

The best suggestion I've seen for graphic list bullets is <IMG
alt="item">.
If you're using a special graphic to denote special items, the <alt>
text
should convey that special meaning. For example, <IMG alt="new item">.
