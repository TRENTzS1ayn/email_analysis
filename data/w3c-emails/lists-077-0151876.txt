For the last few days I haven't been able to run WAVE 2.01 at

http://www.temple.edu/inst_disabilities/piat/wave/

and the contact address for Len Kasday, kasday@acm.org, is a 
reflector to kasday@astro.temple.edu which expands to 
kasday@concentric.net and returns "User unknown".

Does anyone know why I get the following error?

   Forbidden

   You don't have permission to access /cgi-bin/wave/wave.pl on this server.

   Apache/1.3.19 Server at pa-at-loan.org Port 80

Is this tool (yes I know it is only a prototype) permanently offline?

Larry
