Is there a w3c javascript/dhtml working group?

If one object (which has a transparent area) is placed above another, there
is a logical inconsistency, in that the user sees themselves clicking one
object, but is taken to the other object's location.
http://www.peepo.com/crap/lbv/ (ie5 only) is an example.

Does anyone know of any workaround?  Who could I write to, in order to get
this
matter addressed, it seems fairly fundamental....


thanks
