Actually, I would say that using that in title _is_ appropriate,
as it's a statement of what purpose and function the element
serves on the page.  "Picture of..." should never be in ALT
but I think it is very appropriate for TITLE of an image.

Frank, as you can see, there is often some disagreement about
