unless you are going to really work to make it fit, picture is a poor
choice of title as is logo, image, or any other content label.  I'd
put it in a sumary of th ediscription if at all as in:
this is a photograph of three men and a woman....
this would be in a d or description of image link though.  or perhaps
longdesc which will replace d.  Read it with images off on a browser
that supports the attribute.  I know that many do not adhere to this,
but a good audible flow goes a long way toward grounding your pages in
accessability.  We've debated this before and I have seen no
convincing argument to use any of the symbolic terms for the mark up
in conveying the meaning or intent of the item.  I have and do support
the use of the labels in a description.

Actually, I would say that using that in title _is_ appropriate,
as it's a statement of what purpose and function the element
serves on the page.  "Picture of..." should never be in ALT
but I think it is very appropriate for TITLE of an image.

Frank, as you can see, there is often some disagreement about
how best to mark up certain parts of a web page.
