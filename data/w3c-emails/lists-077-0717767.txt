Just wondering on what people on this forum think about applications like
Betsie which convert webpage content to text only on the fly. For more info
see:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/betsie/inverse/index.html

It seems to work as far as I can tell and is a solution to the problem of
people not updating their text only pages - the code is very ugly, but is
presumeably fine for a screen reader?

Is anyone aware of other applications that do this better?
