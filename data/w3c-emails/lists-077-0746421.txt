Subject: Webcast on Section 508 Regs and On-site Resources


EASI's webcast is a continuation discussion on section 508 regs and
Federal
procurement of hardware, software, and other items.  Doug Wakefield,
the
primary author of the regs discusses the impact the regs will have on
government purchases, on government employees and how it will have a
giant
impact on the products major vendors design when they hope to sell
products
to the government.  This will spill over to impact hundreds of general
consumer items for people with disabilities.
