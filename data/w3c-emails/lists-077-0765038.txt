We are in the final stages of completion and welcome any feed back in
regards to what we have developed.

Rapidfind http://www.rapidfind.com.au is a server based platform that has
been designed to create Websites that are streamlined so that web surfers
can easily navigate the site, without restrictions created by technologies,
bandwidth or common disabilities.

Web sites are unique in that the system has been developed to allow for easy
update and administration by the tenant without the intervention of the
platform personnel. The update is completely handled by the Rapidfind server
and does not require additional software at either the customer end or the
tenant end, only an Internet connection and browser.
