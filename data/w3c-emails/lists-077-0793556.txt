1.
I would like to see the title of Guidelines 1 and 2
altered to read
'Design in a way that allows........'
My reason being that the word 'content' is used to
make an important distinction in Guideline 1.5 and has
a specific meaning within that guideline.

2.
It took me about 10 minutes to realise that the title
of Guideline 1 was different to the title of Guideline
2. Perhaps an emphasis on the word that is different
in each title would be better.

3.
I found guideline 1.5 hard to understand. I can
discuss this with anyone who may be remotely
interested ;-)

Another possibility
1.5 Separate content from the way it is presented
By separating content from the way it is presented,
the range of people that can usefully interpret that
content is increased.
The primary way of achieving this is by the use of
external style sheets.

4.
I am confused about one part of Guideline 1.7
To me a style sheeet is an example of 'newer
technology (that) is (/can be) not supported or turned
off'.
So having a style sheet as one of the technologies
that can help mitigate against these circumstances
really confused me.
This may be helped by an example.

I really appreciate the emphasis in the new guidelines
on the 'end user'
