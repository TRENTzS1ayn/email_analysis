I am currently setting up a New Zealand based company
to provide 'accessible web site design and build
services'.
As part of the set up process I have to find out the
size of the market for the services.
I am totally stumped as to how to go about this and
all my efforts so far have drawn a blank.
Can anyone give me any generic advice?

TIA
Graham Oliver
