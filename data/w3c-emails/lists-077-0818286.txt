Thanks for this response Wayne

I guess my main worry about something like this is that it is an 'easy fix'
that will stop people from making the effort to make their websites properly
degradable and accessible. A New Zealand government web forum group I am
part of is currently considering recommending Betsie for its members- yet I
know for sure that most of these members are ignorant of the requirements
for accessible websites and there is a real danger that they will decide
that using Betsie is enough.

Not your problem I know, and I agree with your argument that Betsie provides
a real-world solution right now for people relying on text only rendering of
pages and is therefore generally a good thing. 

My only suggestion would be that you could make some explicit disclaimer on
the Betsie site about how this should not be seen as a  total solution for
making sites accessible and perhaps state some of the other things people
need to consider.
