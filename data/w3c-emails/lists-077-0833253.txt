I originally wrote this article entitled "Welcome The The
Fancy Colored Paper Universe" up as an informal email
follow-up to a message from Jason a few months ago.  It's
generated significant interest in some working groups  after I
used the metaphors introduced in the article to discourage
the use of proprietary document formats on some W3C working
group lists.

Here is a pointer to a cleaned up version of the article
http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/raman/publications/colored-paper.html
published as a living document on my WWW site --hope it
proves useful in other WAI endavors to encourage the use of
standard, inter-operable HTML.
