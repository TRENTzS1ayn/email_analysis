Some generic advice:

There are requirements that the US government is setting itself known as
"section 508" or more properly I think it is section 508 of the Workplace
Rehabilitation act. This is similar to the requirements for level A
conformance to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

The Australian government is exempted from claiming the defense of undue
burden as a reason for not making things accessible, and the case against the
Sydney Olympics site has established legal precedent for amking
discrimination claims against governments and private providers in Australia.

The e-Europe Intiative has committed the governments of Europe to reaching
double-A conformance to the WCAG in all their online rpesence within the next
couple of years.

Unfortunately, that only looks at some potential purchasers. Further
information about who is already doing the work would be interesting. It
seems that IBM is - they produced the Website for the Australian Tennics
Open, and considerable work had been done to make it accessible.

I believe that some members of this list represent providers of these
services. I know of others that are not on this list.

Anyone care to identify themselves, or to try and add to the information
here?

Cheers

  Can anyone give me any generic advice?
