Hi Graham,

I think Charles was attempting to galvanize some others into offering their
5 cents worth. I think this subject is a bit too off topic for many members
of this list to respond to.

In a gesture of goodwill if you email me with exactly the questions you want
answers to, I will try to help but you must understand that generally the
Pacific rim and that part of the globe are lost areas statistics wise to
many of us. But I may be able to help in pointing to the sorts of
organisations you need to go to in order to obtain the info.

I would also need to know what is your target market? It helps to know where
you are starting from to find the best route. Just plain accessible web
design is too broad a spectrum to cover, and information pollution will
result.
