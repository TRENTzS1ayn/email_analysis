Hi Charles and Graham,

Point taken Charles. I will wait for Graham to let me know the few specifics
requested, and do my best to answer. I have a gut feeling however that it
may be better if I post it on my website if the answer is a lengthy one
which would bore the pants of many list members. (interesting concept) Then
just post the link on the WAI-IG? Your call.

Oh and by the way Graham, I usually charge for this sort of
thing..............................................(shhhh just between
us!!!!!!!!)
