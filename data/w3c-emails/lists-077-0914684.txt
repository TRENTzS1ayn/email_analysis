I have a question on 12.1 (Priority 1):

<Quote>
12.1 Title each frame to facilitate frame identification and navigation.
<end quote>

If each frame page has a (good, informative) title element, but there is no
name attribute or title attribute on the frame elements within the frameset
element, do you think that satisfies 12.1?
