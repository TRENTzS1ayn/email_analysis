Stop right there -- that's not clear at all.  There is no
consensus that anything marked up with the <acronym> tag is
meant to be pronounced in any given manner in any given
language.

Yes, and inconclusively so.  There is no link between <acronym>
and any given pronunciation of the content of the element.

There is currently no way to mark up a specific pronunciation
for any text in (X)HTML.  Your question can be applied equally
to non-acronym text as well:

    Do I spell 'wright' the write way when I right it with my
    rite hand?
