I know that we are not "meant" to lay out pages with text in 2 or 
more table cells side by side.

But, how many people really really stick to this ?

I would have thought that most screen readers would be able to read 
the first cell's contents, then the next cell etc etc -- rather than 
reading right across the page and turning it all to mush.
