Hello Denise,

I am chocked by your sentence

. The former government of Afghanistan has pledged the
> entirety of its 15,000 troops to support the United States.



It is impossible in the same contest to say something  like above and citate
people as Ghandi, who are  against every  kind of violence...

Greetings
Ineke van der Maat
