Andrew,

While this may be a work around for using screen readers, it presents data 
represented in the table incorrectly.  If the field element of a table is 
to be empty (null), then that is what must be represented in the 
table.  Let me take your work around further, if you can put this "00" into 
a field to represent an empty (null) field in the table, why restrict it to 
just the first row of the first field.  Carrying it out into other fields 
and rows further muddies the waters.  Smile.
