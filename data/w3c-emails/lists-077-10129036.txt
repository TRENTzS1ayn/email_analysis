Jeffrey,

I beg to differ in this circumstance.

In the NZ Immigration table, the value is not "null" but is actually "zero"
(is this correct Jamie?), or possibly "n/a", so placing a "0" (or "n.a.")
in the empty cells would be technically more correct than leaving them
empty as most people are want to do to improve the visaul appearance. The
added benefit is that a JAWS etc user gets more information too.

Andrew,

While this may be a work around for using screen readers, it presents data
represented in the table incorrectly.  If the field element of a table is
to be empty (null), then that is what must be represented in the
table.  Let me take your work around further, if you can put this "00" into

a field to represent an empty (null) field in the table, why restrict it to

just the first row of the first field.  Carrying it out into other fields
and rows further muddies the waters.  Smile.
