Andrew and others

While it is true that the value is zero for these cells, the reason is
probably closer to 'n/a', though this is not quite right either - a
simple dash (-) indicating an empty cell is how I'd put it if published
in a hard copy medium, and perhaps this is the best solution here?

I'm also interested to know if the way I have tied headers to cells in
the code is correct (or more importantly, if it works for screen reading
user agents).


Thanks
Jamie

Jeffrey,

I beg to differ in this circumstance.

In the NZ Immigration table, the value is not "null" but is actually
"zero"
(is this correct Jamie?), or possibly "n/a", so placing a "0" (or
"n.a.")
in the empty cells would be technically more correct than leaving them
empty as most people are want to do to improve the visaul appearance.
The
added benefit is that a JAWS etc user gets more information too.

Andrew

Andrew,

While this may be a work around for using screen readers, it presents
data
represented in the table incorrectly.  If the field element of a table
is
to be empty (null), then that is what must be represented in the
table.  Let me take your work around further, if you can put this "00"
into

a field to represent an empty (null) field in the table, why restrict it
to

just the first row of the first field.  Carrying it out into other
fields
and rows further muddies the waters.  Smile.
