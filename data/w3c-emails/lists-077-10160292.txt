Deare WAI Interest Group Members,

As several list members have already pointed out, the Web Accessibility 
Initiative Interest Group list is not the place to discuss last week's 
events. There are many other lists which are more appropriate for those 
discussions.

Please keep the topic to Web accessibility:
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/Overview.html#Uselist

Thank you for your cooperation.

- Judy
