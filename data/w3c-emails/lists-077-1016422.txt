No.  Unfortunately my copy of Lynx won't use titles, so you also need to
gives frames sensible names (left, middle and right are not helpful), but
in principle, titles allow a frames aware, but non-frames browser to 
construct a sensible menu of the frames, and may be easier for authors
than using <noframes> properly.
