Hi Everybody

I have a PC on which I can run SSB Technologies'  InFocus 4.0 and fix the
violations easily. But on other PC, with same configuration, the button for
"Fix" is not becoming Enabled, it stays "GRAYED" for ever.  So I am unable
to fix violations from that PC.

Is there any configuration required for that !!

Thanks
Viral Patel
