lynx 2.8.3 in default mode appears to render alt rather than title content.


I had understood that title was more appropriate for describing purpose of
link, and alt description of image.
thus this seems contrary to what I've understood.

Could someone please expand, or point me to a relevant link.

Yet again this concerns our beta: http://www.peepo.com/crap/argo2/ where the
various alt and titles are.
