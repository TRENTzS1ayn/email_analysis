title provides additional information about any element rendered
element (i.e. those elements that relate to something seen, heard, or
otherwise communicated to the user such as <body>, <p>, <em> but not
such as <head>, <meta>, etc.), which can be rendered in any way that
a browser chooses to aid a user. Not rendering title at all is a
valid choice.
alt provides an alternative to an image, not a description of it
(longdesc does that). Generally a description of the image is a poor
choice of alt text.
