I found a strange error with IE3 on Mac where it would respond
strangely to the <?xml ...?> if the document was loaded as the
default document of a folder. Colleagues have even found problems
with <!DOCTYPE> that forced them to break standards-compliance.

It's funny that while one of the arguments for making HTML an XML was
that browsers would no longer have to attempt recovery from as many
erroneous situations and yet those same browsers can't handle a few
changes which aren't (in these cases) breaking or radically breaking
HTML4.0.
