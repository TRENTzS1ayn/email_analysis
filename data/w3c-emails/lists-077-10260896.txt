I am grateful for your responses, perhaps part of the problem I'm having is
that ie6 renders the title as a 'tooltip' whereas lynx renders the alt.
This leaves me a little non-plussed. The title is additional information,
however if the image is rendered, then the user first needs the alt tag....
so I am still muddled.
Is ignoring the title attribute maybe simplest?
