O.K., let me understand this problem, which seems to be more semantic than 
anything else.  The field data contained within the specific cell is not 
null , but contains a zero,'0'.  if this is the case, then put a zero in 
the cell, if that is the value you want to be represented in the field 
data, or put a "-" or 'N/A", just be consistent.  If a screen reader can't 
determine the value in afield data cell when it is populated with some 
type/form of text data, that is a problem in the screen reader and needs to 
be fixed on the assistive technology end.  What should not be done is to 
have different representations of the field data contained in the cell for 
any and all users.  Speaking from a database perspective, that is a major 
"no-no".  Smile.
