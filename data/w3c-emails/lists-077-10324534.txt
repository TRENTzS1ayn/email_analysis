Broadly I think that's correct.

I believe IE 6 has a strict mode and a loose mode - one is forgiving and the
other works for standards-conformant content, but I ahven't played around
with it much.

(and there are a number of other XML browsers which are strict)

By the way, general questions on HTML, XHTML and the like are probably better
handled on a mailing list directed more closely to those topics.

cheers

  I'm starting to use an xhtml header for our beta and I'm getting very
  different response from these 3 browsers.
