Charles I'm well aware of the very xhtml ish natureof my previous post.

However surely it is an accessibility issue, if we are being 'sold' a new
'strict' language.
It may have many benefits(1), ease of implementation appears not to be one
of them.
html is very forgiving, and it is important that we consider any new
language in that light.

It is a more serious problem, if this:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en">

can mean that a page is not rendered(2), when with <html> it is.

The above certainly would turn off(3) most potential web page authors,
looking at the source code for the first time.
Is it a temporary measure until (xhtml) suffices?

I'd like to add that(4):
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
is rendered on the screen of my pda running windowsCE 1.0

thanks again
