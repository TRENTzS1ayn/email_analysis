Hi

I've been involved in developing a web based document creation and
management tool, MKDoc [1]. 

I was wondering if anyone on this list would like to get an account [2]
and try creating some web pages and give me any accessibility feedback.

We have tried to comply with WAI WCAG and WAI ATAG wherever possible.

Chris
