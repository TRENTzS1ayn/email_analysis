Hi all,
I am not trying to speak for everyone else here, but I wold think that
the more the merrier! I would love to help someone else in this field,
so Chris, please send me the details. I am a busy person, but I am
willing to provide you with some feedback on your product as much as
possible - and there are plenty of people in my office who will help me
do that (I work for a multimedia company).

I look forward to hearing from you in the near future, and I will do my
very best to provide you with constructive criticism.

Kind regards
Simon

Hi

I've been involved in developing a web based document creation and
management tool, MKDoc [1]. 

I was wondering if anyone on this list would like to get an account [2]
and try creating some web pages and give me any accessibility feedback.

We have tried to comply with WAI WCAG and WAI ATAG wherever possible.

Chris
