Course Title: Designing Universally Accessible WWW Resources for People 
with Disabilities

Course URL: http://cita.rehab.uiuc.edu/courses/2001-10-REHAB711NC/index.html

Description:
This course is designed for web content developers to learn about the 
disability access issues faced by people with disabilities in using the web 
and how web resources can be designed to improve accessibility. The course 
provides a foundation on how people with disabilities access information on 
the web using mainstream browsers and specialized assistive technologies 
like speech renderings. Participants will learn about the two main 
standards for web accessibility, the <A 
HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/">W3C Web Content Accessibility 
Standards</A> and the <A 
HREF="http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/508standards.htm">Section 508 
requirements</A> for web materials. The strengths and weaknesses of 
different evaluation and repair tools will be presented to help 
participants understand how to use the available tools to evaluate and 
repair their web resources. Participants will learn about common HTML 
accessibility problems, and HTML and CSS techniques that can used to 
improve accessibility. Captioning of multimedia materials is also covered 
for Microsoft Media Player, Real Player and Quicktime, and the 
accessibility of non-W3C technologies like PDF and Flash will also be 
discussed.
