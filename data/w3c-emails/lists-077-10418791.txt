Hello,

I tested the two examples of drop down menus with JAWS and Home Page Reader.

The one mentioned by Jonathan is very accessible with keyboard bu not usable 
with JAWS in virtual PC cursor mode. This mode is the default mode and most 
users don't know how to bypass it. The user have to be warned to deactivate the 
virtual PC cursor because without warning, he don't know that some menu item are 
missing.

In HPR all the menu items are their but at the end of the page. It's not very bad but 
a bit confusing.

Because the problem described with JAWS and because the large market share of 
JAWS between screen readers, I think this example can't be qualified like 
"accessible".

The second example mentioned by Emmanuelle, works correctly and JAWS and 
HPR see all item of the menus but because the page is reloaded, JAWS and HPR 
restart reading of the page from the beginning. It's an important drawback.

If somebody have other examples to share. I'd very like to have a technique for 
accessible drop down menus to suggest to web developers that I have to traine for 
web accessibility.

Thanks
