Joe,

         Interesting that you could find such a small  handful of research 
papers available. Jonathan's site has many more you can add, plus Lisa's. 
And if you do a search for some of the other disabilities, you will find 
quite a bit out there. Sites with information on cognitive disabilities 
have been shared on this list so shouldn't be hard to find.

          If the Blog is supposed to collect all articles and research on 
the web, it has woefully missed the mark. Perhaps that is your goal, but 
it's premature to announce your success. You missed an awful lot. Not a 
useful site.

                                         Anne
