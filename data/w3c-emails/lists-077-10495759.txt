Well, here we go again with the obnoxious habit of progressives to 
declare "You are insufficiently progressive. You are missing at least 
five obvious components. And no, I won't tell you what they are. If 
you were truly progressive you'd know already."

Not to the WCAG's in-house fundamentalist, no. How surprising not to 
read a complaint that there aren't enough illustrations. Thank 
goodness for small mercies.

Of course, if the AccessiBlog is "not a useful site," explain how it 
has scored 5,273 hits with next to no publicity.

If, however, anyone has links to articles I've missed, which is 
*really* the more effective strategy: Dissing me because I missed 
them (as if I failed some undocumented test of purity) or actually 
giving me the links so they can be posted?

And by the way, sites that recapitulate the WCAG are not immediately 
posted to the Specs & Tutorials page 
<http://www.joeclark.org/accessiblog/ab-specs.html>. So I suppose the 
AccessiBlog attempts to catalogue original and distinctive resources. 
Readers are actively encouraged to start their own Weblogs (a list of 
which is already available: 
<http://www.joeclark.org/accessiblog/ab-otherblogs.html>) if they 
wish to catalogue multiple redundant sources.
