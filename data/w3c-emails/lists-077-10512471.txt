Hallo Joe,

Thank for your interesting AcessiBlog site.

 Do you want to link also articles in other languages as German, French and
Dutch?

I am Dutch but get every day  also German and French papers as email and
their special editions about internet . I mean important international
papers as the German "Die Zeit" and the French "Le Monde"  and "Liberation".

Greetings
Ineke van der Maat
