See, the whole problem here is that you took Joe Clark's tongue-in-
cheek boasting seriously.  If you take Joe a lot less seriously --
think of him as the class clown out to get attention, who still
manages to produce useful stuff -- then you don't have these problems.

You read claims like "I know the most in the world about accessibility"
or "nobody else is as great as me" or "this is the most complete
site" or "they all got it wrong, I'm the only one who knows the
score" as just part of the classic Joe Clark 'tude.  Just shrug and
say "oh that wacky Joe, let's go see what he's really got for us"
and ignore the rest of it.

Because Joe really _does_ produce some great and useful stuff, and
it's even more useful if you learn to employ appropriate mental
filters.

(Note:  You can probably do this with many other people, and thereby
increase their usefulness also.  Me too, for example!  Although I am
too close to myself to be able to tell you what's the right filter.)
