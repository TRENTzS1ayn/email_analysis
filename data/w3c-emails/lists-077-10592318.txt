AG:: will HPR render the ALT text in the graphics view where the image is
rendered?

That's what it sounds like Jonathan needs.

PJ:: YES!
Not only will HPR show the alt text - if that is what the users wants
displayed in the graphics view, but will also allow the user to have the
alt text expanded outside the size of the image it is replacing - basically
the same as Internet Explorer 5.x.  Since HPR is a standard Windows
application, the "mouse over" functions are also available, so the sighted
user would see the title attribute in the tool tip as well as the alt text
at the same time.

However, you also get the visual tracking (or highlightingof text) and
audio as the text is read by HPR.    Since HPR meets the 508 accessibility
standards it inherits the systems fonts, sizes, and contrast settings.  All
these features benefit the low-vision, dyslexic, and or  learning disabled
user.

Jonathan, have you tried HPR and is this what you need?
