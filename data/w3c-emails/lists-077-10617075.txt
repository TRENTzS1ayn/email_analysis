Ah, Kynn and Chaas, the Peacemakers! And Chas made some interesting points. 
I will be curious to know when Lisa's and Jonathan's stuff will be added.

Kynn, teachers are not usually overly fond of class clowns. They waste a 
lot of class time, and often keep a teacher from meeting everyone's needs. 
And, to be perfectly honest, what I enjoy most about teaching elementary 
children (other than their openness to all learning) is that they generally 
are still free of 'tudes .... 'Tudes are tolerable, but they waste a lot of 
time.

 From Joe's use of Blog to describe both his list of resources and his 
in-process book, I suspect Blog is an index to his work with a few other 
pieces thrown in to round out what he hasn't written yet ...  Joe?

I do think Joe understood that when I said his site wasn't useful, I meant 
it wasn't useful to me because it wasn't a source of information I'd be 
referring folks to.

         Oh, Kynn, did you look at that picture of Joe on his page? He's a 
bottle blonde for sure! <grin>

                                         Anne
