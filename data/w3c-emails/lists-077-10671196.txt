Web News Still Fails Blind Users

"Not everyone watched the images of the recent terrorist attacks
on television. Visually impaired individuals turned to newsgroups
and select websites to find emergency information and vivid
descriptions. By Kendra Mayfield."

Cites Gregory Rosmaita's VICUG news site, quotes me and David
Poehlman and other folks.

Also of note is the following:

"(Editor's note: At this time, Wired News does not conform in full
to the Consortium's guidelines. Staff programmers are currently
looking into updating publishing codes in order to make the site
more accessible to the visually impaired.)"

Yay for Wired News!  Hopefully they will follow through on this.
