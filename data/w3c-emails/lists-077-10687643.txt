Link to the new White House website now up and running

It has come to our intention that some of the links to the newly
refurbished
White House website of specific concern to people with disabilities were
not
functioning at the time that you were informed of the site.

The White House staff has worked dilligently to correct the problem, and
it
has
been fixed.

Please utlilize the below links when accessing inormation from the White
House
website:


Accessibility Features

"Go to" Buttons


? The site includes an invisible "go to content" button in
the top of the header that allows site visitors who are
using screen readers to skip to the content of the page and
bypass repetitive information included in the navigation.
http://www.whitehouse.gov/

? In addition to the "go to content" the site provides a
"go to text only" and a "go to search" button in the
header, which again allows users to bypass repetitive
information and go directly to the search or text only
areas of the site.

Alt tags
? The graphics and photos on the site include alt tags.
When screen readers encounter a graphic image, it reads the
alt tag to the user, which provides a richer experience and
allows the user to better understand the photograph or
picture.

Forms
? Whitehouse.gov makes use of web forms, and these have
been tested for accessibility. For example, the
Appointments application includes several drop-down menus,
which are often difficult to code for accessibility. These
were built according to W3C standards and then fine-tuned
based on user tests.

Tables
? To make tables more accessible, header fields clearly
label the columns.

Closed-Captioning
? In addition to text transcripts of speeches, the site's
on-demand video takes advantage of web captioning
technology that provides closed captioning of videos.

Text-Only
? The site's text only section is updated at the same time
as the rest of the site. This serves not only the
disability community but also users who prefer text-only
surfing.
