Using ie6 tabbing in ie6 seems very chaotic, please try:

tabbing at the wai homepage: http://www.w3.org/WAI/ it is very hard to
navigate.
Tab to an anchor link, press enter, and tab again. not what one would
expect.
a similar problem is here:

I don't know whether this is an insoluble problem, however I'm finding it
very frustrating.

Anybody have any ideas, the navigation works fine in lynx for instance?
Is it a bug, or perhaps I need to adjust some setting?
