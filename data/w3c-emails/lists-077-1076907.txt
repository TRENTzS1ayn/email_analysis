Hi Robert:

     I have not seen this before. I know he made this proposal during the campaign but have not seen anything since.  Do you know if it will be placed on the whitehouse web site?  I searched for it this morning and could not find any information at all.  I hope this will pass congress.  It looks very good and was more than I had hoped for.

-Steve
