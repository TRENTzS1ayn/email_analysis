Call for Articles

Special Issue of Library Hi Tech:

Accessibility of Web-Based Information Resources for People with
Disabilities

Library Hi Tech invites articles for a special issue on the
"Accessibility
of Web-Based Information Resources for People with Disabilities". The
aim of
this special issue is to promote a barrier-free virtual library
environment
that affords all users a maximum of independence. This aim is to be
accomplished (a) by encouraging evaluative research on the
accessibility of
electronic information resources for people with print disabilities,
(b) by
enabling librarians to make informed procurement decisions, and (c) by
providing information to encourage vendors to develop truly inclusive
products.

Welcome are articles on the accessibility of any web-based information
resources, including those currently emerging on the market. These may
include:

        *       Online catalog systems (Voyager, ExLibris, etc.)
        *       Aggregated database services (Ebscohost, WilsonWeb,
FirstSearch, ProQuest, etc.)
        *       Specialized electronic indexes (Books in Print,
Anthropological Index Online, etc.)
        *       Electronic reference works (Britannica Online, New
Grove
Dictionary of Music & Musicians, Encyclopedia of Science and
Technology,
etc.)
        *       E-journals (JSTOR, Project Muse, HighWire Press,
Emerald
Press, Taylor & Francis, etc.)
        *       E-books (especially NetLibrary)
        *       Library Web pages

Articles discussing other issues pertaining to web-accessibility of
information and learning resources will also be considered. Such
topics may
include: the accessibility of courseware, the legal mandate under ADA
and
Sect. 508, online distance-education for people with disabilities, and
strategies for creating an accessible online environment.

Authors considering contributions to this issue should discuss their
ideas
with the guest editor and send an extended abstract of the proposed
article
in advance of full submission. The abstract should be received by May
1,
2001. The full article must be submitted by September 1, 2001.
