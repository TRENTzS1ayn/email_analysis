Anyone know of a workaround? in development? ie a skip button?

I'm very dissappointed to notice that various film sites such as ifilm and 
atomfilms have significantly increased the amount of pre-show advertising one 
seems to be obliged to watch.

this might not appear to be an accessibility issue, but given that the 
viewer/user wishes to access the ends and not the means it is a serious one.

thanks
