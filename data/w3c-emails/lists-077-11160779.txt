Scott,


Let me just deal with one point.

The web was originally designed as a research tool to share information,
that is text via hyperlinks.

If you not want to take my word for it, send a message to Tim Berners Lee
who is head of the W3c and ask him.  He invented it.  He is head of the W3C.


Sincerely,

Mike Burks

Hi,

I don't quite understand what you are saying.  I'm not quite sure
what you mean about "multiple serves" and the "correct way".
I'm also not clear on what you mean by:

    "because of insistance on having the web be a different medium
    than it was originally designed"

Also, what do you mean the multiple serve is over used?
