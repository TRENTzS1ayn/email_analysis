Hi,

The phrase "multiple serve" is not very clear since there are a number
of interpretations depending on various aspects.

While some people consider multiple versions of a web page to be a cop out,
other people consider it to be a reasonable use of technology to
accomodate the needs of varying types of users.  Since the text that
I've quoted before is a consensus item, it would seem that the guidelines
group see providing multiple versions of the same page as a reasonable
use to technology in addressing the needs of a variety of people.

Going back to universal design, a common approach is to provide both
ramps and stairs so people can have their choice.  Providing multiple
versions of a web page would be consistant with that approach.

From a technology point of view, it is probably often easier to
offer different versions of a web page rather than trying to get
everything in one page.  Different versions helps to reduce the conflicts
that can arise in a single version.

The web, like much of technology, is evolving.  While some people may wish
the web was more fixed, other people look at the initial web as being
the seed from which newer aspects have sprung.  If guidelines are developed
with the goal of holding back development of technology, they have a
good chance of being signored or seen as irrelevant, unless there is
some regulatory obligation.

PS  It would be helpful if you indicated which particular Trace documents
you think I should be aware of.  I'm familiar with a number of them.
