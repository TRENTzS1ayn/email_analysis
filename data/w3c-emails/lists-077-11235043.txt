       Right...but how many companies are going to want to chase after the 
small number of people that are actually afflicted (for lack of a better 
word) with those disabilities, or severity thereof, that actually affect the 
use of the web?

       Furthermore, nobody teaches accessible web design. No college student 
I know taking IT-related major with a web concentration has to learn 
accessible web design. And after college...why would the developers want to 
take the time learning something that after one or two projects is going to 
be useless?
