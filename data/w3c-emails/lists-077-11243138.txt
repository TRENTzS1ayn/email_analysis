Well, in Australia the distinction between government and private providers
in terms  of requiring accesssibility is only that governments do not have
the defence that it is too expensive - they have to do it anyway. Private
companies can claim a defence if it can be demonstrated that it is too
difficult, but in practice (the Sydney Olympics case, and other cases not
about the Web) it is often very difficult to show that, and the burden is on
the person making the claim to prove it is too hard - just  saying so carries
no weight.

So the Australian case is "you and your client can avoid breaking the law".
Which can also be applied to things like online learning software.

  I agree in principle with everything you have said here Kynn but wouldn't it
  strengthen the business case as well as the Section 508 compliance pitch if we
  edited your response to read:

  "Hey, web design companies - if you write accessible HTML you can extend your
  client market to include xxxxxx people with disabilities as well as increase
  your prospects for securing government contracts !"
