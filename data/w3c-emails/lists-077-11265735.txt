There are browsers such as iCab, and Web-based proxy services available, that
allow you to do quite sophisticated filtering. This can be used to get rid of
most advertising (although you often need someone to maintain the filters on
an ongoing basis, so there is a cost to be carried somewhere), especially
banner ads and the like, although it isn't perfect.

And many sites that use advertising would not exist without it, so they have
a strong interest in making sure that you see it.

  I'm very dissappointed to notice that various film sites such as ifilm and
  atomfilms have significantly increased the amount of pre-show advertising one
  seems to be obliged to watch.

  this might not appear to be an accessibility issue, but given that the
  viewer/user wishes to access the ends and not the means it is a serious one.

  thanks
