I agree. That's why I generally stress that the core principles of
disability access are the same as those of good customer service.

What are some of the basics of good customer service?
* Business is inviting and comfortable.
* Listen to customer wants, questions, and concerns.
* Only requirement on customers is willingness to spend money.
* Customers can shop independently without feeling rushed (minimizes
staffing too).
* Several options are available to meet customer preferences.

What are some of the basics of accessible practices?
(See above substituting "wants" and "preferences" with "needs" if
necessary.)

Most people associate opening new markets with large up front expense and
many are content with existing markets. However, almost everyone is engaged
in trying to improve customer service within its existing market. That is
the budget money that needs to be the focus of efforts at improving access
for persons with disabilities.

If you can meet the accessibility standards well, you can be fairly
confident that you have good services available for all your customers.
Using the accessibility standards as part of a comprehensive business plan
allows the business to improve its existing efforts using its existing
budgets to better serve its existing customers AND you open a new market
with minimal additional effort.
