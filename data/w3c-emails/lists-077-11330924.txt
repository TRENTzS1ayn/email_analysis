       If that's the case, then it's a lost cause, especially in the current 
economy. What's right and what's profitable are 99% of the time 
contradictory. As has been demonstrated throughout history, businesses will 
only do what's right if it is PROFITABLE. And, really, except for companies 
whose main market is the disabled, accessibility in their internet presence 
is a gigantic expense that provides zero profit at either the short, medium, 
or long term.

       And, about the elderly and disabilities: That would be valid except 
for the fact that most of the elderly with disabilities refuse to admit it 
and seek help (in my experience, anyway), so do not use the AT needed in many 
cases to utilize accessible web design...and those that do recieve help are 
often forced to recieve it by families or others, or the person in question 
is also afflicted with conditions that make use of the internet impossible in 
any real way. (Think Alzheimer's and the like.)
