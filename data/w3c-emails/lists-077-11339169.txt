>I still believe that the only _real_ argument for web accessibility is
because "it's right" -- be that for moral, religious, ethical, fairness,
justice, perfectionist, or legal reasons.

>I'm sure there isn't anyone among us who considers this to be
worth doing just because of the financial gain

Yes I am sure you are right Kynn. Most of us (if not all) contributing to this 
discussion are converted not just because we believe it is the right thing to 
do but more importantly we know it makes no sense to exclude gifted, talented 
and highly skilled people just because they have a particular impairment that 
might impact on their performance in some aspects of their lives. We also know 
that technology when appropriately applied can be an enabler - a bridge for 
people in these situations. But we must still strive to educate others about 
the benefits offered by accessible design even if it is perceived to be a 
"minority issue".

The ultimate "ace up the sleeve" is to cite the legal requirements - but we 
should still aim to educate as best we can even if we still have to fall back 
on the legal case to reinforce our position.
