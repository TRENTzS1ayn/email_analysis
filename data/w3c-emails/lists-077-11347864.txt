       I admit to being a pessimist, but I think that education, while giving 
US the feeling of doing something good, may be wasted w/ regards to many 
commercial entities. More often, I think, a club would be far more 
productive, and have a far more lasting effect. Whether that club be legal or 
otherwise is up to the applicator.
