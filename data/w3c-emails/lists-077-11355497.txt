Which is why traditionally -- offline and online -- the only way to 
make companies do
something if they haven't already decided to do it for PR or moral 
reasons is to make
it not profitable due to regulation.

It's not profitable to be accessible, really.  The markets aren't 
necessarily worth
reaching, at least not currently.  The better arguments are "you'll 
look like big jerks"
or "your CEO won't be able to sleep at night". Those are 100% more 
effective than
"you'll make lots of cash by selling to disabled folks."
