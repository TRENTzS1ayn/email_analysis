>By the way, the WAI Education and Outreach group http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO has
been working for some time on a document about the business case for
accessibility http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/ - I hope people who have
been discussing this topic here can take a moment to read the draft of that
and send comments to the working group who are editing it.

Thanks for reminding us about this working document Charles. You are right - 
it would be good to return to this lively discussion after everyone has had 
time to read the document. I am sure there will be even greater debate then - 
based on the specifics contained in the draft.

It would be good to follow-up with comments to the working group. May be some 
of the comments made through this forum could be captured in summary form and 
sent to the working group. What do others think?
