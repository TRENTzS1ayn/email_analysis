I strongly suspect that a lot of places don't even teach valid HTML, or
any of the original philosophy behind HTML.  I don't know about specific
paid courses, but I was thumbing through a self teaching book on the
European Computer Driving Licence, and the HTML example they had was badly
(structurally broken) - I seem to remember that that one had the mistake
that HEAD is a visible heading, not meta data, that is somewhat prevalent.
