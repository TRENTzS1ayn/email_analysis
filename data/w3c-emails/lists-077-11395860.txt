I think it may well be that it may be hard to make a business case for
accessibility if we say that you can access people with disabilities as then
it makes people feel we are only accessing a limitted range of people.  Many
businesses survive  with the profit they from the bulk of the population
which covers al the operating and general design costs for the sites.  An
accessible site however is all cream after the very minor extra cost of
making it accessible is taken into account,  all of the extra customers they
get from the disabled population increase their profit,  can many afford to
throw away 10 or more percent of customers?

    It's not profitable to be accessible, really.  The markets aren't

    look like big jerks"

    effective than
    "you'll make lots of cash by selling to disabled folks."


         Problem is, I don't think people these days would CARE enough to
consider the offending companies jerks...And I doubt many CEOs would find
their sleep very disturbed.
