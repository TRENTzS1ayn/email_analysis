This is true. Harry's real point, I think, was that the cost of this
under-exploited 10% is often extremely small, making the cost/benefit
analysis that is so important to the financial commitment to decision making
a lot clearer. More particularly, it is that the benefit of accessibility to
the bottom line is often simple to get and very good return on investment -
accountants might not know that, but will be interested in it if it can be
backed up.

cheers

  The normal rule for a business that is not locked into a saturated market
  is that they can afford to throw away 20%!
