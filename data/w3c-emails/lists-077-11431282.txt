The UK's legislation is a bit differnt (until about a year ago it didn't
apply to Universities, whereas they are among those with the biggest
obligations in  Australia), but yes, it is overall similar. And that includes
the fact that enforcement and compliance is not universal (although that
applies to every law I know of).

But the laws in all countries can be used, and from time to time they are.
Combined with education this leads in general to sensible laws being more
often complied to, and bad laws being repealed, changed, or officially
ignored. In general. On average. And the education component is important.

  The UK has legislation in place that makes it illegal to jam open fire
  doors.  It's not enforced.  I've seen stairwell doors jammed open even
  in libraries.  The UK has legislation that probably parallels the
  Australian disability legislation....
