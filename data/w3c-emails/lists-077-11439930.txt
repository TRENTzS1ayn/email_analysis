Generally each cost centre within a business is expected to be as efficient
as possible, so a 30% increase in the cost of the web site, which represents
1% of the company's spending, is not treated as a 0.3% cost, but as 
a 30% cost, unless there is a specific ruling from the top level.

(This is basically an application of looking after the pennies and the
pounds will look after themselves - an English proverb.)
