Very good question. :-)
I would like to see McDonalds with *readable* menu boards.
Now it's really stupid (and terrible) - I need to get glasses to read menu.
In fact, I have one "weak" glasses which are ok to read newspaper, work on 
computer, etc., and other "strong" one which I use to drive car; so I have to 
swap two sets of glasses to read McDonalds menu.

it's not the case here (in Russia)
They do not have menu on counter/checkpoint, except one "dinner menu" which 
they put as nutkin.
BTW: I would be really surprised to see "pictoral braille on one side, large 
print other side" McDonalds menu, it should be probably a lot of fun ;-)
