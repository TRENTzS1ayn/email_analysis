>> When I know how to build accessible sites, I have the democratic duty to
build them, no matter what it costs.

Ineke I couldn't agree more. Cost-benefit is a red herring. It doesn't take
all that much thought to make a site accessible and the web community should
be setting the standards rather than treating it as another market. Wouldn't
it make more sense to build it into everything we do rather than treating it
as an "add-on"?

Could someone please explain to us non-US types what 508 implies? TIA.

Rowan
