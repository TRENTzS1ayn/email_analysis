out of curiousity, Denise:
Why do you think that those companies (Macromedia, Adobe, etc.) will exist in 
2-3 years?
I have to admit that I am working on several Open Source projects, and I do 
(and will do!) my best to decrease power of those companies.
So, I would not advise to students to learn something just to have 
possibility "to be hired by  Macromedia, Adobe, Microsoft, etc."
It amy be that those companies would not exist by the time they finish 
colledge or university ;-))

BTW: stocks of those companies are already moving into *right direction*.
If you haven't noticied - Macromedia stock slipped by 30% last week, and 
Adove's revenues dropped by $100 mil. last quesrter (30% decrease)
