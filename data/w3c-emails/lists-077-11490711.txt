I can make even stronger statement.
"...A lot of places don't even teach Good Programming Pratice (like 
structural programming, data incapsulation, etc.) - as we have a lot of 
programmers in C, less in C++, and just a few people knowing how to program 
in Modula-2 or what is _Oberon_"

BTW: "valid HTML" is an oxymoron, IMO.
HTML4 is terrible broken and badly documented.
If you rephrase your statement as 
"a lot of places don't even teach XML" - it becames much more correct (and 
self-explaining)
There are places where teach HTML, or books about HTML.
In most cases, they teach 9or write) about *broken HTML*, even  without 
mentionig it.
Number of people who understand XML is much lower - just because you can't 
write *broken XML* and still get it interpreted/rendered, even with MS IE.
In addition to pure XML, you will have to study CSS as well - which is a task 
on its own :-)
