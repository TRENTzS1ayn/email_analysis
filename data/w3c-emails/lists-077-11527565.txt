Hi,

Looking at the consensus item:

     RE: CLIENT SIDE AND SERVER SIDE SOLUTIONS
     S1 - serving content in different forms is an acceptable way to comply
     with the guidelines as long as equivalents for all of the information
     are provided in the different forms and it is all available through the
     same URI (though it may be linked to it) (server side solutions are
     acceptable - as specified)

it seems that providing multiple versions of web pages is acceptable.
It doesn't seem to convey the impression of the approach being a "cop out".
It does seem to indicate that using multiple versions of web pages is an
adequate design.

There was the statement:

    "You keep saying that this is in the consensus appendix but as I
    explained before, you have to look at the first and last lines of that
    excerpt to fully appreciate its impact."

Perhaps it would be helpful to clarify what is meant by the first and last
lines.

Multiple versions of web pages avoid the problems of having to choose
whose needs to serve when there are conflicting needs.  With the
increase in bandwidth and computing power, more visual and interactive
technology will be delivered.  There will be an increase in conflict of
needs.  For example, in terms of limited screen real estate,
the space could be used to provide some accessibility feature or some
feature which will be used by the more general public.
