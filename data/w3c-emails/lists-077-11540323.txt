Hi,

Thinking back on the universal design architecture ramp/stair example.
Why are stairs ever used?  At first thought, ramps serve more people.
However, if there is some rise like on a hill, stairs are more efficient.
To rise 1 foot means walking an additional 12 feet on a ramp. With
stairs, there is not such an increase in walking to go up a foot.
I guess people in wheelchairs could demand that no one uses stairs
if a ramp could be provided, but what would that accomplish?

Scott
