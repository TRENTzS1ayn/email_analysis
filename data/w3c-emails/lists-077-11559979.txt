       Vadim,

             You bring up some very good points, thast I think may 
unfortunately be only SLIGHTLY unique to Eastern Europe/Russia.

             One of the things we seem to forget here is a characteristic of 
the market, one that DEFINES it in business: The disabled are usually 
incredibly poor. In the US, saying that most people with disabilities (under 
65) survive basically because of SSI (For the jobs most people with 
disabilities can get, the salary scale is not exactly high, assuming they can 
get a job, ADA be damned.) with minimal income beyond that.

       John
