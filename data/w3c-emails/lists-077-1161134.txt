Just looking at the 'posting conditions' for this
group....

(This mailing list is for..) Activity in terms of
meeting agenda, presentations being made, results, but
also exchange ideas, and give input to the working
group

This seems to fit in the 'exchange ideas'?

W3C are also clear on only posting to _one_ group, so
if this doesn't get posted here, where would it get
posted?
Do we need clearer guidelines on the type of postings
acceptable in this list?
I would be loath to miss the opportunity of seeing
something like Robert's post. It seems relevant to me
even though I live and work in New Zealand.

Clarification Sought.

TIA
Graham Oliver
