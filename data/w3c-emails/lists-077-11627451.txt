but you buy "rent"           is the apartment accessible?
    you buy "food"           is the food store accessible?
    you buy "heat"           does the oil company have TTD/TTY?
    you buy "clothes"        are the stores accessible?

it may not be a lot of money but it together is a lot of money.  not
saying it is only argument, but it together with other is a powerfull
argument.  of course we frequently "co-op" our considerable power by using
places that are not accessible, or say "I am only one person"
