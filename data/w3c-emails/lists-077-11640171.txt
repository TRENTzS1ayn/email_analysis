Is it a flame?
I thought that WAI mailing list shoud be out of politics or nationality. ???

Anyway, I will respond about laws and how they are working:
 it seems that we (people in Russia, over 180 different nationalities) have 
nowdays much more freedom that people in US.
Nobody was making something "extraordinar" from known acts in NY, and there 
was no censorship effected after Sep.11 on national TV stations or national 
newspapers.
Yes, country still recovering from 70+ years of socialism - but many  
industries have been already rebuilt, and they operate in much more effective 
way than somebody in US wants.
Rules to make business are different here from Eastern Europe - there was no 
intention (and will never be) to sell out national industry to *foreign 
investors* like it happened in Czech, Hungary and Poland.
What's wrong with that, BTW? key industries should be owned by national 
capital, not by foreigners. And current laws protect *national capital* and 
*national industries* - not foreigners.
If you expect that this will be changed - you are going in a wrong way.
It will never happen. :-))

And YES - we are very close to Americans in this.
Can you imagine for example that General Motors can be sold to some Arabian 
millionare? Don't think so.
So everything is pretty much inline with US laws.
