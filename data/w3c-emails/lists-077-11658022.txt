Not really.
yes, people here are rather poor, but much more reach than, say, in Africa.
I know that it's now not very popular nowdays to speak about Arabian world 
and muslims - but there are over 1 billion people living there...
Plus, India with 700 mil. people (most of them - very poor) and China (over 1 
billion).
So I would say situation in _US_ is _SIGNIFICANTLY_ different from other 
countires.

very well said.
I can only add that I have seen how *poor* pensioneers (old people) in 
Bulgaria - small country which has borders with Turkey, Romania, Yugoslavia, 
Greece and Macedonia. I was working there for more than one year, and I know 
what I am speaking about.
Many old people there just can't pay for _heating_ in winter time, and they 
can afford to buy for food just bread and potatoes.
So, when you speak about web accessibility for people with disabilities - I 
just recall those people (without disabilities) and understand that they do 
not have computer or internet at all. If they have food today - they just try 
do not think about tomorrow. And they are dieing every day, just because of 
these poor living conditions.
