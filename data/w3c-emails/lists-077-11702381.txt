       Much agreed. IMHO, the W3C as an advocate for anything but technical 
stuff doesn't make sense. In the case of WAI, it's probably far better to 
round up the various advocacy organizations existing (NFB, ACB, the ARC, 
RNIB, etc.), introduce them to the situation, induce them to cooperate, and 
let THEM run with it as a group. The W3C overall loses credibility if we make 
it an activist.
