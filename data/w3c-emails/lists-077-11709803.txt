Hello Kynn,

 When I exclude one group of   people (here disabled people)  from
 information I have,  I consider that as not  being democratic..and also
 discriminatory.. .

The Media Carta (see www.pccharter.net)  says the right to communicate must
be a fundamental  human right in the constitutions of all free nations..

 When you or others  will react, please do it off- list... then we discuss
 till we are blue.. (or  is this too Dutch)

 greetings
 Ineke
