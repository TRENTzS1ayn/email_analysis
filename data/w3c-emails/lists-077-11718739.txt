It's discriminatory, but not undemocratic.

There's a right to communicate.  There's not a right to information
necessarily.  And a "free nation" does not necessarily mean the same
thing as a "democratic" one.  There's no principle of "democracy" which
says everyone has equal rights to information.  It may be a basic
human right, but human rights don't equal democracy.
