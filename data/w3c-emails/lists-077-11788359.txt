paper.

Indeed he did Cynthia. There were numerous quotes in that paper attributed to 
Lucas in his statement before the hearing. It is good to have your 
clarification of the original source from which Lucas "borrowed" those 
statements. I will certainly take time to review the original paper and would 
urge others with an interest in this area to do the same.

The excerpts from your paper attributed to Lucas are most certainly helpful 
legal and policy statements to which I often refer. Better still, I can now 
refer to the complete document and quotes from the original author :-)
