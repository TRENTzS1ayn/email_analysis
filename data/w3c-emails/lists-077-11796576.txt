I apologise if this sort of question is inappropriate for this list but I
have seen similar questions so have posted it. Please let me know if it is
inappropriate.

I actually am not all that au fait with how to make accessible HTML (one of
the reasons I joined this list) because I don't know how totally blind
people use the web. Some sites which totally blind people find easy to use I
can't actually use at all and my basic approach has been keep it simply and
let the browser do the rest. I saw the below question on another mailing
list and thought someone might be able to point me in the right direction to
advise them. It was also surprising to me since this form is how I would
have done it and considered it to be clean and simple and hence accessible
so will learn something myself.

Thanks in advance and here's the question:
