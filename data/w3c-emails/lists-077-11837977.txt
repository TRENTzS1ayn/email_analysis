I was trying to watch a film at this address:
http://www.urbanentertainment.com/1/shortfilm_prev.asp?obj_id=1080&aff_id=1&cat_id=112
well not this one in particular....

however when I select a 'connection speed' the combi box does not register it.

I believe this might be an issue specific to non-ie browsers, but more than 
likely not a mozilla specific bug.

anyone have any ideas?

sorry if this is slightly off topic
