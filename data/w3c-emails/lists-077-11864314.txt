not kidding, and don't ask why it is not publicized more, sure hasn't been
my fault I have given away every flyer I can get my hands on and have been
making copies when they are out of print...in the USA the IRS publication
can be ordered from 1-800-829-3676,  publication 907 the form needed for
the tax credit is IRS form 8826.
