Hello everyone,

I am pleased to announce that Mozilla's accessibility alpha is now ready
for 3rd party testing. Mozilla is the basis upon which the Netscape
browser is built, so this is the place to start when working on Netscape
accessibility. Almost all features are now available through keyboard
commands, and we now support Microsoft Active Accessibility.

The purpose of this announcement is to encourage testing of our keyboard
support and MSAA implementation. Nightly Mozilla downloads are available
here:
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/nightly/latest/mozilla-win32-installer.exe

Known bugs in our current MSAA implementation:
- No PDF support yet
- No tree or outliner widget support
- No XUL listbox support (none exist in the Netscape user interface anyway)
- No slider support (none exist in the Netscape user interface)
- No support from the dropdown button in XUL combo boxes
- Radio buttons reveal themselves through focus events, but not through 
AccessibleObjectFromPoint()
- HTML select lists are not exposing their MSAA nodes through focus

We believe this implementation to be fairly solid, although we expect a 
number of refinements will be necessary for a complete implementation.

Any feedback will be welcome and appreciated.

Thank you,

Aaron Leventhal
