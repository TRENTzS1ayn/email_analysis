Hi

Can someone tell me, if I have a number of pages on my site and I name them
all for example

Company - Section1 - Page Name 1
Company - Section1 - Page Name 2
Company - Section2 - Page Name 3

etc

Is that really annoying for those with speech browsers as it says everything
all the time, or is it quite useful as it tells you exactly where you are?

Any ideas?

Thanks

Jo Donkin
