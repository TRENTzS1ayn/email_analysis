I don't know much about SVG but could it be used to produce the same output
as UML? If it could, it could be possible to transform an SVG equivilent UML
file to produce a descriptive "inturpretation" of the graphic. For example,
I don't know the specifics but suppose SVG looked like this:

<process_flow_diagram>
<entity_box>
<text_in_box>Entity Name</text_in_box>
<height>h</height>
<width>w</width>
...
<one_to_many>Another entity</one_to_many>
... same for other relationships
</entity_box>

This could be inturpreted descriptively as:

Entity name comprises whatever entities, has these properties, data flows
between entity name and whatever other entities and comes in from whatever
entities...

This specific example may not necessarily be appropriate for this list but
the approach could generalize to handle any SVG representations? 

Am I dreaming again?

Cheers
Ian
