Strictly this should be:

<object type="image/svg+xml" data="someSVGimage">
  <object type="image/png" data="plainPng">
examples can be dull
  </object>
<object>

however, the implementation of object is so poor, after all it has been
in the standard for only 4 years now, that the first one is safer.

As hinted at in Jon's question on www-svg, people are actually advised to
use the, proprietory, element "embed" for SVG, because of the poor object
implementations.
