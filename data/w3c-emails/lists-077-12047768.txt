I don't have time to give a full and fair consideration to the points kynn 
has raised.


Advances are rewarded in many forms of human endeavour. Accessibility remains 
very hard to assess, and this will continue to make funding hard to justify. 
I sincerely believe that gains will be small and relate to demonstrations 
that are effective. However the situation is most complex, and the 
juxtaposition or placement and relation of these small elements of 
demonstration is key.

Do we consider that adequate social provision will allow our client group to 
have financial independence?
People who are disadvantaged, with a severe or mild learning difficulty, with 
a mental health problem, or of restricted economic means, are unlikely to 
ever experience financial independence. The business model is not one that 
naturally suits them, their family or carers. Unfortunately we have not yet 
developed a suitable means of sharing that nurtures competition, prevents 
monopoly and raises awareness.

thanks
