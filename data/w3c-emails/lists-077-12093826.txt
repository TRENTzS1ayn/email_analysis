AG::

Users do have problems with the page changing when they didn't expect it.
This
technique has been a recurring source of trouble as reported on the WebWatch
mailing list.  I don't know how many of those reporting trouble were using
Jaws
or not, and how many had ALT-downArrow available to them and just didn't
realize they needed to use it at that point in their browse.

The view from the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines Implementation Report is
that this workaround is working around a mis-implementation of onChange by IE,
and not the basic behavior that one should expect of that event.

This would seem to indicate that this technique unsafe, because of the
widespread use of IE.  

Many users need keyboard activation access who don't need screen readers,
so it
is not a question of the assistive technology having a problem.  Keyboard
access should work without resort to assistive technology.

Please consult the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines Implementation Report.
