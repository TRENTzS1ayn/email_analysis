I have problems with it using regular IE*, with no special Access
Technology.

I don't (well I do, but it's not a mechanism I use, and I have no external
way of knowing if I need to for a dropdown box, however if you use onclick
rather than onchange, you get near similar functionality without the
problem - you still need a submit button - but then you need one of those
for the non-javascript people or people who have javascript but no
onclick/onchange event support.

* Okay it's actually a modified IE, but not modified with relation to
this.
