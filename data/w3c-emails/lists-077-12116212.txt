Yep, and this is why I gave an example that used the img element, (but at
least it is valid html) and even one that uesd embed, although that means you
have todecide whether you are going to break forwards or backwards
compatibility...

The good news is that object is implemented in a number of browsers. The
current (Macintosh) versions of all graphic browsers I have (IE, Mozilla,
iCab, Opera and Netscape) running support object, although IE has a bug in
the way it handles png images in object.

  Strictly this should be:

  <object type="image/svg+xml" data="someSVGimage">
    <object type="image/png" data="plainPng">
  examples can be dull
    </object>
  <object>

  however, the implementation of object is so poor, after all it has been
  in the standard for only 4 years now, that the first one is safer.

  As hinted at in Jon's question on www-svg, people are actually advised to
  use the, proprietory, element "embed" for SVG, because of the poor object
  implementations.
