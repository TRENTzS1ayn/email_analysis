Why is there any surprise that web accessibility is getting more commercialized?  Push for accessibility and someone has to fill the market to provide the resources.

This is no different than the fact that the need to make computing accessible is largely a commercial venture.  Companies like GW Micro, AI Squared, and Freedom Scientific make their livings off of providing accessibility solutions.

In the end I think this is a good thing.  There will probably be some sorting out of the good from the bad but when web sites are held accountable for some accessibility bar this helps.  And those web sites are as likely to seek a professional resource to meet this bar as they are a volunteer effort.
