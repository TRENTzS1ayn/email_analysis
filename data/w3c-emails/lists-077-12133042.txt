Hello,

I use titles similar to those mentioned below, but for ease of reading in
search results list, and when displayed for the page (general usability
really).

The titles are from most descriptive to least descriptive 

Page Name 2 - Section 1 - Company
Page Name 5 - Section 2 - Company
Page Name 1 - Section 4 - Company

This way users reading from right to left would read the most unique part of
the page title first. And if we used the other method mentioned below, a
search results list would look more like a list of the same pages repeated
at a quick glance.

Company - ...
Company - ...
Company - ...
Company - ...

Cheers,
Grant Perry

As I understand this, you want to have a unique page title for each
page.  this is good.

Hi

Can someone tell me, if I have a number of pages on my site and I name
them
all for example

Company - Section1 - Page Name 1
Company - Section1 - Page Name 2
Company - Section2 - Page Name 3

etc

Is that really annoying for those with speech browsers as it says
everything
all the time, or is it quite useful as it tells you exactly where you
are?

Any ideas?

Thanks

Jo Donkin
