This is browser specific.  It's also platform specific - not all platforms
have ALT keys.

Lynx, used by many blind on limited incomes, can't use them.  Lynx and other
text mode browsers are also used by people who want fast access to sites with
real contents; I use it for Google and for government sites and those by
academics.

IE when used in a security conscious environment (high security, always,
and medium security, after many new security alerts) can't use it.

Search engines can't use it, so will not index the internal contents.  Note
that search engines can't use them even if the scripting is purely server side.
The actual link names are unlikely to be indexed, either.

Amaya, the W3C's own test bed browser can't use them.  Charles has an 
interest on that one!

They are difficult or impossible to search client side.  (One of the
advantages of Lynx is that you can very rapidly search for a link on a
page - press '/' a substring and return - everything is on the main 
keyboard, so you can touch type this very quickly.)
