well today something interesting happened.

I need to rebuild the ramp to our building, we decided to put heat coils
into the concrete while it was being rebuilt.  There are two companies
that make what I was looking for.  Son of a gun, one had an accessible web

from??    quite a few bucks riding on that job!
