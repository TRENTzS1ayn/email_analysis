|   Strictly this should be:
|
|   <object type="image/svg+xml" data="someSVGimage">
|     <object type="image/png" data="plainPng">
|   examples can be dull
|     </object>

This should be:

<object type="image/svg" data="someSVGimage">
? <object type="image/png" data="plainPng">
examples can be dull
? </object>
<object>

I just wonder why people want to support non-standard type="image/svg+xml"
I understand that Adobe introduced this non-standard "image type", but this 
is some kind of trick like Microsoft did to tie people to Windows.

type *is* "image/svg", not "image/svg+xml" or "image/svg-xml!" !
Please do not support such broken practice!

If you want to support Netscape Navigator 4.x than you have to use IMG.
Otherwise, recent Mozilla/Netscape 6.x build have rather good support for 
OBJECT. So if you can afford to force all users of your web site to upgrade 
to Mozilla or Netscape 6.2 (on Windows platform, or on Mac), than better use 
OBJECT.
I still wonder what Authoring Tools can generate OBJECT for gif, png and jpeg 
images (at least).  As far as I know, all tools from *major* companies use 
IMG.

as about EMBED used instead of OBJECT - yes, Adobe tends to use this tag on 
their site heavily (http://www.adove.com/svg). So, Adobe contributes in this 
case to Bad Practice, bringing more confusion than innovation. There is no 
excuse for that. 
But their sales already dropped by 30% last quarter - so probably we don't 
have to wait too much until that practice stopped :-)
