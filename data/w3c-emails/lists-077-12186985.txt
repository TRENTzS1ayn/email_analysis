It's Adobe pushing SVG as Flash replacement.
They failed to catch up on Macromedia / Flash, and a whole web-animation 
market is leaded by Macromedia at a moment.
It's a pity that there is no SVG-Core specification, which has only static 
objects (no animations, no sounds) and reasonable set of primitives - 
polygons, lines, beziers, circle, plus some set of gradient and standard 
fillings.
Anyway, I doubt that SVG will be some replacement for HTML.
First of all, SVG is well-formed XML, therefor browser supporting SVG should 
be able to parse XML as well.
 MS IE accepts a lot of broken HTML, but will report you an error on bad XML.
If you have page designed in XML+CSS, than I doubt you need SVG unless you 
want to add something specific (circle, rotated rectangele, gradient, etc.)
Problem is that web masters do not want (or don't know how) to design pages 
in XML+CSS. 
And 99.9% of all *real-world* pages (on Web) is not-valid HTML. :-((

That's true.
I think SVG-Core is what we need in order to make SVG mainstream.
It's really stupid to use 10MB "plugin" just to draw rectangle or circle on 
the web page. All browsers (absolute minimum: MS IE and Netscape) should 
support such primitives, and complete SVG specification is obviously too 
*fat* for this.
