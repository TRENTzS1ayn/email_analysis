There is a requirement in Accessibility Guidelines that site should be 
accessible with JavaScript turned Off.
If you turn off JavaScript,   "combo box" control will never receive OnChange 
event. So, user browsing your web site will never reach location if you use 
OnChange even to make selection and navigate further.

No, it's not know technique (at least to me)
I have to admit that I do not have accessibility problems and always use 
mouse. I use keyboard only for entering text.

Can you explain what do you mean here, please?
What do you refer to as "assistive tools"?

|     This sounds like a case of Document Object Model (popularly called
|     JavaScript) onchange events being used.  The change wouldn't be
|     recognized until the mouse button was released.  It's not an HTML
|     problem, but a designer problem (designing only for clicking with a
|     mouse).

Indeed, OnChange event is related to DOM.
You may want to read DOM specification to see how it works.
Modern (and valid) technique is to use EventListener (addEventListener DOM 
method). Than you will have more flexibility *what to do and where*

|     Plain HTML will not do this.
