  It's Adobe pushing SVG as Flash replacement.

I guess it isn't just Adobe - they have the most heavily promoted SVG stuff
(plugin, authoring and export in lots of products) as far as I can see, but
BitFlash, the Apache project, IBM, Sun, Mozilla, Corel, Amaya, SodiPodi
(another open source project), sketch (and another), and others are all
producing editors and/or browsers.

In addition Semantic Web tools such as RDF author and GraphViz are generating
SVG output - it is useful because it can include representations of complex
data in ways that are nice for people to read, and can include the bits that
machines can read and process easily.

Also you should look at the  W3C Technical Reports page
section on Working drafts - there are several profiles of
SVG in development which are more basic than the full SVG
1.0

  They failed to catch up on Macromedia / Flash, and a whole web-animation
  market is leaded by Macromedia at a moment.
  It's a pity that there is no SVG-Core specification, which has only static
  objects (no animations, no sounds) and reasonable set of primitives -
  polygons, lines, beziers, circle, plus some set of gradient and standard
  fillings.
  Anyway, I doubt that SVG will be some replacement for HTML.
  First of all, SVG is well-formed XML, therefor browser supporting SVG should
  be able to parse XML as well.
   MS IE accepts a lot of broken HTML, but will report you an error on bad XML.
  If you have page designed in XML+CSS, than I doubt you need SVG unless you
  want to add something specific (circle, rotated rectangele, gradient, etc.)
  Problem is that web masters do not want (or don't know how) to design pages
  in XML+CSS.
  And 99.9% of all *real-world* pages (on Web) is not-valid HTML. :-((

  That's true.
  I think SVG-Core is what we need in order to make SVG mainstream.
  It's really stupid to use 10MB "plugin" just to draw rectangle or circle on
  the web page. All browsers (absolute minimum: MS IE and Netscape) should
  support such primitives, and complete SVG specification is obviously too
  *fat* for this.
