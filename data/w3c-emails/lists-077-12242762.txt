I forget which draft the type was changed in, but I believe that it is using
the +xml in order to allow recognition of xml data in various non-text MIME
types.

  "1.2 SVG MIME type, file name extension and Macintosh file type" of
  SVG 1.0 Recommendation [1] says:

     The MIME type for SVG is "image/svg+xml" (see [RFC3023]). The W3C will
     register this MIME type around the time when SVG is approved as a W3C
     Recommendation.
