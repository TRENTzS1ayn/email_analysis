Fulfilling America's Promise to Americans with Disabilities

     http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/freedominitiative/freedominitiative.html

President Bush: "My Administration is committed to tearing down the 
barriers to equality that face many of the 54 million Americans with 
disabilities."
...
"Internet access for Americans with disabilities is half that of people 
without disabilities."
...
"I am committed to tearing down the remaining barriers to equality that 
face Americans with disabilities today. My New Freedom Initiative will help 
Americans with disabilities by increasing access to assistive technologies, 
expanding educational opportunities, increasing the ability of Americans 
with disabilities to integrate into the workforce, and promoting increased 
access into daily community life."

---

"Disability is not the experience of a minority of Americans. Rather, it is 
an experience that will touch most Americans at some point during their lives."
...

"Computer technology and the Internet have tremendous potential to broaden 
the lives and increase the independence of people with disabilities. Nearly 
half of people with disabilities say the Internet has significantly 
improved their quality of life, compared to 27 percent of people without 
disabilities."

"The computer and Internet revolution has not reached as many people with 
disabilities as the population without disabilities. Only 25% of people 
with disabilities own a computer, compared with 66% of U.S. adults. And 
only 20% of people with disabilities have access to the Internet, compared 
to over 40% of U.S. adults."
