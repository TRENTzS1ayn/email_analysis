well, you're dreaming up the syntax, and when it was dreamed up in the SVG
group it was slightly different. But the idea is the same...

There is a box, which is called "the box", and it needs to be drawn the right
size (and the right style) and labelled, and it is linked to a couple of
other boxes...

translates to something like

...
<g id="boxN">      <!-- g is a grouping element -->
  <title>Box N</title>
  <metadata>You can put anything you like in here really, including
    information about relationships</metadata>
  <rect width="34" height="33" class="plaintype" />
</g>
...

You might like to look at the way we dealt with this in the SVG accessibility
note, although at that time we were working from a version of the spec that
required all metadata to be collected in one place, rather than being
attached to all kinds of eleemnts as it is now.
http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG-access/#Metadata

There we were desccribing how the pieces of a network were connected. This
led to surther work on using RDF in SVG to describe other kinds of
relationships, which I think is also a cool start, ubt perhaps
overcomplicated - http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/ASVG/ with some discussion about
further development starting at

  I don't know much about SVG but could it be used to produce the same output

  file to produce a descriptive "inturpretation" of the graphic. For example,
  I don't know the specifics but suppose SVG looked like this:

  <process_flow_diagram>
  <entity_box>
  <text_in_box>Entity Name</text_in_box>
  <height>h</height>
  <width>w</width>
  ...
  <one_to_many>Another entity</one_to_many>
  ... same for other relationships
  </entity_box>

  This could be inturpreted descriptively as:

  Entity name comprises whatever entities, has these properties, data flows
  between entity name and whatever other entities and comes in from whatever
  entities...

  This specific example may not necessarily be appropriate for this list but
  the approach could generalize to handle any SVG representations?

  Am I dreaming again?

  Cheers
