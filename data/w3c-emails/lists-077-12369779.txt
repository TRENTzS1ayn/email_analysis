In fairness, there is a small chance that the full text of the book 
will be posted online. It's actually quite commonly done and actively 
helps sales. But I don't know what I think about it, really.

On the plus side, though, the full text of the book is *definitely* 
going to be provided on the book's CD-ROM, so nobody has to wait for 
an audiotape version if they don't mind listening to my crap via a 
screen reader.
