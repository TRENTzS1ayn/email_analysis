Hello Jon,

Thank you for your answer.

But see  the changes below: the lang  attribute has been totally removed in
XHTML 1.1 and so not valid XHTML 1.1

The guidelines 11.2 say  don't use attributes that are depreciated...so
Bobby does not apply to the guidelines???

A. Changes from XHTML 1.0 Strict
This appendix is informative.

This Appendix describes the differences between XHTML 1.1 and XHTML 1.0
Strict. XHTML 1.1 represents a departure from both HTML 4 and XHTML 1.0.
Most significant is the removal of features that were deprecated. In
general, the strategy is to define a markup language that is rich in
structural functionality, but that relies upon style sheets for
presentation.

The differences can be summarized as follows:

On every element, the lang attribute has been removed in favor of the
xml:lang attribute (as defined in [XHTMLMOD]).

Cheers
Ineke
