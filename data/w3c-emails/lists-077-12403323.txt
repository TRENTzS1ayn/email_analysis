Agreed, but there is a balance to be struck between avoiding
deprecated elements and attributes and backwards compatibility.
Purely from the point of view of accessibility it would seem that
more immediate real-world problems could stem from the absence of the
lang attribute than from its presence, and there is a good argument
for staying with the 1.0 standard for the time being.
This is not to say that long-term it's a good idea to continue its
use (after all we want it to die some time), or that accessibility is
the only criteria on which to make these decisions, but I think Bobby
is justified in penalising the absence of lang, although perhaps it
should give a warning explaining the two sides of the decision as to
whether it should be used, rather than an error.
