Probably I have made my statement not clear enough.
I fully agree with you - many companies are contributing to SVG standards and 
developing of SVG tools.
But I suggest that Adobe is the *only* company which needs to make from SVG 
"Flash replacement".
And this explains why Macromedia is not in your list :-)
Therefor, most of the companies you listed would be happy IMO with static SVG 
(or SVG Core, whatever you call it)
At least that's very good for beginning. Than you can extend it to further 
level.

BTW: What is also quite visible from your list is absence of Microsoft.
What are in fact Microsoft plans concerning SVG?
So far, MS bundles Macromedia Flash plugin with every copy of MS IE, and this 
just increases installed base of Flash players.
I have conducted analysis of plugins available on desktops of different users.
Flash is presnt almost on *any* desktop/browser, while SVG ... is not visible 
at all !  And I am speaking about auditory of computer-literate users, not 
newbies!
It would be nice if Microsoft will bundle with MS IE either own or 3rd-party 
SVG plugin, as this increase SVG availability dramatically. But that hasn't 
happened so far.

Thanks, I will look for more details on that page.
I just downloaded SVG 1.0 specification as zip file, and was reading it.

There is a more serious problem out there, though:
it seems to me that Adobe is the only company which made SVG plugin available.
Without wide availability of SVG plugins (or other form of SVG support), this 
wonderful specification/standard will fail (or go to niche markets)
