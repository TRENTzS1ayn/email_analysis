Here you are wrong.
Of course you can't make WinXP or Win98 more bloated by adding *just another 
11MB*.
But this size matters for Linux, and especillay for PDAs.
How you will put extra 11MB, say, on Compaq iPAQ?

Or make their SVG plugin open-sourced - than people with good coding 
knowledge will strip all fat from that plugin. :-))

Note that there are people who run Linux (or other OSes) on PowerPC, Alpha 
and other platforms, I know some people run KDE on IBM zSeries servers 
(previously known as mainframes)
Adobe just can't catch up on all those platforms. And there is no SVG plugin 
from Adobe for those platforms.

Abyway, about putting a rudimentary XHTML browser/XSLT Processor into SVG 
Viewer - this will not help in case of Adobe.
I tested Adobe plugin for Linux with Mozilla 0.9.5. Mozilla is bloated by 
itselkd, takesa around 20 sec. to load here. And .. SVG plugin takes another 
15 sec. to display page.
Yes, you can get rid of Mozilla, it will save you 20 sec. But 15 sec. for 
startup is still enermous!..
