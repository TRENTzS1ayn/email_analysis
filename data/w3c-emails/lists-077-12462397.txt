Hi Ian!

I believe you should use XML for this task and translate it to SVG later.
Such approach is used, for example, in Kivio (flowcharting program from 
KOffice, www.koffice.org)
Internal representation of Kivio data is in XML.
At a moment, Kivio can't export exactly SVG - but exports drawings in other 
vector formats, like EPS. I guess it will be extended to support SVG for 
KOffice 1.2 release (somewhere spring 2002)

I have heard that some people were using Kivio for UML modeling (or at least 
were trying to use it :-)

|   <process_flow_diagram>
|   <entity_box>
|   <text_in_box>Entity Name</text_in_box>
|   <height>h</height>
|   <width>w</width>
|   ...
|   <one_to_many>Another entity</one_to_many>
|   ... same for other relationships
|   </entity_box>
|
|   This could be inturpreted descriptively as:
|
|   Entity name comprises whatever entities, has these properties, data flows
|   between entity name and whatever other entities and comes in from
| whatever entities...
|
|   This specific example may not necessarily be appropriate for this list
| but the approach could generalize to handle any SVG representations?
|
|   Am I dreaming again?

No! :-)
