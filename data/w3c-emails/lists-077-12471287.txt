I thought that Lunux users are more computer-literate, and don't need extra 
support :-)
Mozilla on Linux supports same features as Mozilla for Windows. Therefor, 
OBJECT tag is supported.
It's also supported by Konqueror.

most people can use P/400Mhz, with 128MB of RAM - as it really costs nothing 
nowdays.
128MB of RAM is enough even for Mozilla. Other browsers should work ok in 
64MB of RAM.
I doubt though that you can buy such low-end computer nowdays. Most likely, 
you will have minimum 800Mhz CPU...
