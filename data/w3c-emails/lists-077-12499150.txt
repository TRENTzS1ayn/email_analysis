>The only problem with this is that Tim Berners-Lee did NOT invent the 
World Wide Web, or even a very significant part of it.

Thanks for your elaboration on that point Charles. I was not expressing a 
personal view just citing the actual headlines of the article i.e.
"Berners-Lee wins Japan Prize for invention of World Wide Web" - their words 
not mine.

I too have a problem with the notion that one individual invented the WWW. 
Perhaps your are right, our society has some kind of need to single out 
individuals and has a problem accepting that some of the greatest achievements 
are the results of collaborative endeavor and evolution of the ideas of many 
contributors over time.

Regardless of the accuracy of the article, it is a fantastic achievement for 
Tim Berners-Lee :-)
