Hi Cynthia

The valuable contributions that you have made to this field along with the 
work of W3C WAI and the feedback I gain from participation in the interest 
group that assist me in my work. There is so much to be achieved and it is 
early days for us. I would not feel confident in addressing these issues 
without having the literature and expert commentaries from people like 
yourself available to support my case.

Thanks

Denise

Thank you for your kind words, Denise.  Recently I spoke at "European Day of
the Disabled" in Brussels, Belgium, and truly enjoyed meeting people face to
face those who have read the paper and have adopted the issues to heart.  I
am glad to know that the University of South Australia has you on faculty to
inform the academic community about the efforts of the W3C WAI and others in
the international community.

>Thank you, Denise.  My paper, "The Growing Digital Divide in Access for
People with Disabilities: Overcoming Barriers to Participation," has been
widely quoted and at times without acknowledgment of the authorship.

I imagine that has been a problem Cynthia. In a way it is probably a
compliment in that people are almost regarding your paper as some kind of
Gospel now. In the documentation referred to in my previous email you can
imagine how easily this could happen since the document was a report from a
Congressional Hearing and includes transcription from verbal statements made
at that hearing. There would certainly be a high risk that experts appearing
at such hearings could fall into the trap of talking around and about issues
using material they had read from articles such as yours - without thinking
about citing material in the way that one would in a formal journal
publication. Probably little consolation to you but I think it is a
reflection of how valuable this document has become to those working for the 
cause of
accessibility.
