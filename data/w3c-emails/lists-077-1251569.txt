Understand the inability of log files to sniff for screen readers.  Would be
'cool' to have anyone using an assitive device use a special program that
register were PWDs are going and have that information collected somewhere.
The trick would be the privacy hurdle, bandwith and 'big brother' fear.  But
I do not know how else to do this.  Need to get numbers and stats to prove
the point to the commercial world that we are a market force to listen too.

I know double click and other use this methodology.  I stopped marketing
from using it for the privacy issues.  Cookies are one thing, but accessing
information is another.

This could send anonymous information to a trusted source for collection and
data mining. Name could be optional, but think if we could get zip code,
city, state, and income level.  This could also be a money making adventure
to turn money back into the PWD community to further research.

I wonder if we could get media metrix and pcdataonline to do this, because
you need to volunteer to be a member of their research community.  They
could also collect the methodology you use to track the web.  This may be a
easier route to go.  Will ask media metrix.

Just brainstorming here, so pls do not launch big darts at my email address.

Rob,

I've seen buying power numbers but, given the low employment figures
for people with disabilities (which I think should be relatively
accurate), I'm not sure how much confidence I have in anyone's buying
power number. I might change my mind if I were also given the
assumptions used to come up with these numbers.

With respect to dollars spent online, how can anyone tell when the
spending is by or for someone with a disability? My browser doesn't
provide the info that I have a disability.

Larry
