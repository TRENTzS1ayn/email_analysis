I note that they also don't bundle Acrobat and that Adobe is, to me,
the apparent prime mover for SVG.  I draw some conclusiions from that.

This is why I tend to qualify reservations about SVG by "if it becomes
widely adopted".   I would go further than plugins and say that unless
it is included directly in IE, or, at the very least, a reccommended
update in Windows Update, it will not achieve general market penetration.
