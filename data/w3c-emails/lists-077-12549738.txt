Thanks, Kynn, but you haven't answered my questions. I'm aware of the 
issues regarding backwards-compatibility. If you'll reread my original 
email, you'll see that I asked several specific questions. If you don't 
have the answers, no problem -- just say so, and I'll look elsewhere for 
them. But if you do know of specific problems -- not "compatibility 
issues" but specific accessibility problems caused by XHTML 1.1 -- could 
you please post them?

Note that most of the compatibility recommendations -- such as using <br 
/> instead of <br/> -- are perfectly valid XHTML, so they do not inhibit 
the use of valid XHTML 1.1 or XHTML 1.0 Strict.

You've said that we should not use the latest XHTML. The W3C is 
recommending that we do. I'd really like to know what evidence you can 
provide to support your point of view.

Thanks!
Chas.
