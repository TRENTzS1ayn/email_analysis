ok, I think not too many people heard about Konqueror/Embedded.
I believe it fits perfectly in your scenario.
Konqueror/Embedded is part of KNOX (KDE no X, where X is "X-Windowing System")
Idea around KNOX was get KDE running without X-Windows (right name for it is 
"X-Windowing System" but I think it's better to refer in more *traditional* 
way) - saving memory and CPU cycles.
Konqueror/Embedded [Konq/E] is in fact real (not stripped) version of 
Konqueror 2.2, which I use only desktop regulary. The only limitation 
comparing to desktop version of Konqueror that Konq/E can't use Netscape 
plugins, therefor you can't use macromedia's Flash plugin with Konq/E.
And this is good driving factor for SVG adoption in Konq/E (and replacing 
Flash with SVG) - as it's unlikely that Macromedia will release Flash plugin 
for Qt/Embedded or StrongARM architecture used in Compaq iPAQ or Sharp Zaurus.
And Open-Source developers are not very keen on spending their time 
implementing closed-sourced specification owned by one company [Flash]

At a moment, key target market for Konq/E is PDAs.
It works on Compaq iPAQ and Sharp Zaurus, and should work on any other 
platform where Qt/Embedded was ported to.
But its usage is not limited by PDAs.
AtheOS (http://www.atheos.cx) operating system has own port of Konq/E, and 
there were announcements about port to BeOS.
Besides, you can use it in any other device which has basic framebuffer 
support - think of ATM, built-in industrial devices, kitchen appliances, 
phones, etc.

It depends what you understand under 3rd world.
Average salary in Russia is $50 per month but there is a market of 1.4 millon 
computers (approximately) per year.
Of course, it also depends on region. Same figures for Moscow are much higher 
comparing to other regions - I would say that average salary here is around 
$300 with first class specialists receiving world-class compensation 
($2000-$6000 per month)
This also explains the fact that around 60% of Russian Internet users located 
in Moscow.
I was living (working) for a long time in Bulgaria. This is small country 
(South Europe), around 8 million people, with borders to Turkey, Romania, 
Yugoslavia, Macedonia and Greece.
Yes, most people in that country expect computer (to be affordable) to cost 
around $150 (completed system, with monitor) - that's what all dealers were 
telling me.
Still,. computer market is around 60 000 units per year which is quite good.
Computers are widely used in offices, even while they are not very 
"accessible" for home users.  
Macedonia and Yugoslavia have close to Bulgaria standards of living - but 
anyway I have to admit that Bulgaria and Romania are considered as poorest 
countries in Europe. So I believe these 2 countries can be a good reference 
regarding "consumer buying power in 3rd world countries" (not to offend any 
citizens in those countries)
