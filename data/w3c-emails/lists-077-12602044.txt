It is simply amazing what has been done with SVG so far, see for
example:
http://www.jeffsouthard.com/demos/grove/index.html
and the maps in:
http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/xml-batik/samples/
and the fractals at:

And the interactivity in the SVG and with the HTML (or ideally XHTML) is
essential to many applications.  See for example:
http://www.carto.net/andi.n/about_vienna_svg.html
and
http://www.xml.com/2000/03/22/style/parts-catalog.htm

To date few if any of the interesting things that have been done with
SVG have resembled Flash.

I think for tiny devices a scaled back spec makes sense, but compared to
the size of typical browsers and operating systems of Today there is
nothing bloated about Adobe's SVG Viewer on a PC.  

Rather than put a crippled form of SVG in web browsers, perhaps Adobe
should put a rudimentary XHTML browser/XSLT Processor into their SVG
Viewer.
