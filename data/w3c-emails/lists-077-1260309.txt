Hey everyone! Talk about a response and service from WTOP.  The archived
interview with Craig Luigart - Dept. of Education in "Ask the CIO" is now
available, see http://www.wtopnews.com/askcio_luigart.shtm

Would like to extend our thanks to alyson at WTOP for using light speed to
repair the link!  If you need a text version, pls let her know.

Cheers, rob
