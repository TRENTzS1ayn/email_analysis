CMN on the other hand, many of the interesting things I have seen done with
Flash could easily be done with SVG and be more accessible.

  I think for tiny devices a scaled back spec makes sense, but compared to
  the size of typical browsers and operating systems of Today there is
  nothing bloated about Adobe's SVG Viewer on a PC.

  Rather than put a crippled form of SVG in web browsers, perhaps Adobe
  should put a rudimentary XHTML browser/XSLT Processor into their SVG
  Viewer.

The SVG group is working on several profiules, for smaller kinds of devices
that can't hold a full animated SVG viewer (and a static profile was already
defined in SVG 1.0 - Batik is almost completely conformant to that).

On the other side, Jon Ferraiolo, editor of the SVG specification and an
Adobe SVG guy, was one of several SVG implementors who worked on the
production of a document explaining requirements for a component extension
framework, that would allow an SVG plugin to call an XHTML vrowser or XSLT
processor as a plugin for included content. This is going to be more
important as more types of content are used on teh Web - Math, music,
chemical information, etc. http://www.w3.org/TR/cx It is my hope that this
work will progress to a specification, and be implemented, to make the idea a
useful reality.
