Necessity to support PDF (Acrobat) is still questionable to me.
PDF is not W3C standard/recommendation, and is based on PostScript which is 
good but aged technology.
I think XML+CSS, plus SVG for vector-based pictures suites needs of modern 
desktop much better than PDF.

Besides, missing PDF/PS support in Windows is not critical at all - as you 
can install GhostScript and it will do all this stuff for you.
To prevent (possible) questions about Linux - GhostScript comes as standard 
with all major Linux distributions, and KDE/QT uses it for printing and 
"printing to PDF" (PDF generation)

My major concern with Microsoft is SVG support. MS supports XML and 
(partially) CSS2, and there are even some CSS3 properties implemented. 
XHTML support is not listed among "available features" of MS IE, but so far 
it works ok.
If MS is kind enough and can add SVG to MS IE - it would be great for 
everyone.

That's what I was keeping in mind speaking about Microsoft.
I wrote "plugin" but exact packaging of "SVG-enabler" application is not so 
important.
Adobe's plugin for MS IE/Windows is an ActiveX control, if I remeber 
correctly. But it works also with Netscape6 if you copy 3 DLL's manually to 
Netscape's Plugins directory.
Was my second mail (clarification to first one) is again not clear enough?..
Than I probably should switch to Russian ;-)
