Apologies if I've not picked up something but it sounds like XML/XSLT + SVG
(mixing in one "page"?) combination could be where browsers are heading? I
was originally thinking that SVG could be an opportunity for the visually
impared to possibly get some useful information from a graphical
presentation? I know it's been said that it is not a Adobe replacement for
Flash but if I use flash as an example then we are talking about something
which is completely inaccessible correct? It obviously doesn't make sense to
provide an actual alternative but if we could even get the information out
then that would be an improvement? I recently came across 3 fantastic offers
on books but they were in Flash and so completely useless to me. Is it
possible or likely to be possible to say get the text from such a book if it
were in SVG format? I'm concerned that we might be missing an opportunity to
possibly define specific standards (as opposed to the general guildelines
given in the SVG specification on Accessibility) before SVG becomes more
commonly used?

I'm getting the feeling that my fundatmental lack of understanding of
exactly what SVG is and how it works may be letting me down so apologies if
the above is simply rubbish!! But my concern is genuine.

Cheers
Ian

Necessity to support PDF (Acrobat) is still questionable to me.
PDF is not W3C standard/recommendation, and is based on PostScript which is 
good but aged technology.
I think XML+CSS, plus SVG for vector-based pictures suites needs of modern 
desktop much better than PDF.

Besides, missing PDF/PS support in Windows is not critical at all - as you 
can install GhostScript and it will do all this stuff for you.
To prevent (possible) questions about Linux - GhostScript comes as standard 
with all major Linux distributions, and KDE/QT uses it for printing and 
"printing to PDF" (PDF generation)

My major concern with Microsoft is SVG support. MS supports XML and 
(partially) CSS2, and there are even some CSS3 properties implemented. 
XHTML support is not listed among "available features" of MS IE, but so far 
it works ok.
If MS is kind enough and can add SVG to MS IE - it would be great for 
everyone.

That's what I was keeping in mind speaking about Microsoft.
I wrote "plugin" but exact packaging of "SVG-enabler" application is not so 
important.
Adobe's plugin for MS IE/Windows is an ActiveX control, if I remeber 
correctly. But it works also with Netscape6 if you copy 3 DLL's manually to 
Netscape's Plugins directory.
Was my second mail (clarification to first one) is again not clear enough?..
Than I probably should switch to Russian ;-)
