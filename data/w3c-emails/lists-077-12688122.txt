Hi,

There are various ways to use the technology.  After the general
page is created, the universal page can be created and stored in
the web sites hierarchy.  This would avoid uncacheable web pages
if that is a problem.

The reason I proposed three levels of approaches was to offer
various options depending on the situation where the web page
is being developed.  The lowest level might be useful for places
where getting the web site done by Tuesday is more important
than maintaining the purity of a structured language.  For those
places where they have more resources or time, they could implement
the self-configuring level or the XML level.

CSS is not currently a reliable approach since support for it
ranges from browser to browser.  Another problem is that it
adds another language that the developer has to learn.  Some
developers have the time to do that.  Others may have limited
time or resources and will kludge what they need to.

Actually, the lowest level can be rather easily implemented.  For example,
I have a very basic perl script which can extract a universal web page
from a standard web page which contains the appropriate extractor
comments.
