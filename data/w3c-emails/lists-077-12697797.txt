Because RFC 3023 says that all media types that use XML should do
that. Since PNG and GIF and JPEG are not written in XML they don't
have the +xml addition.

I don't see why it would be confusing, the SVG 1.0 specification seems
very clear and unambiguous on this point.

You seem to be saying that it should be possible to guess MIME types
rather than simply looking at the specification. i would have thought
that looking at the specification would be easier, beause different
peope will guess different ways.

 http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3023.txt

  Major differences from RFC 2376 are (1) the addition of text/xml-
  external-parsed-entity, application/xml-external-parsed-entity, and
  application/xml-dtd, (2) the '+xml' suffix convention (which also
  updates the RFC 2048 registration process), and (3) the discussion of
  "utf-16le" and "utf-16be".
