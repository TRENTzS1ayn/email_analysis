Dear Ishikawa-san,

Thanks a lot for clarification.
It's a pity that correct (according to [4]) mimetype for SVG is not listed in 
HTML4 specification. (I was making my assumption basing on HTML4 
specification) 
Obviously, SVG was somewhat ignored in this W3C recommendation:
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224

6.7 Content types (MIME types)

Note. A "media type" (defined in [RFC2045] and [RFC2046]) specifies the 
nature of a linked resource. This specification employs the term "content 
type" rather than "media type" in accordance with current usage. Furthermore, 
in this specification, "media type" may refer to the media where a user agent 
renders a document.

This type is represented in the DTD by  %ContentType;.

Content types are case-insensitive.

Examples of content types include "text/html", "image/png", "image/gif", 
"video/mpeg", "text/css", and "audio/basic". For the current list of 
registered MIME types, please consult [MIMETYPES].

 [MIMETYPES]
List of registered content types (MIME types). Download a list of registered 
content types from ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/.
~ ~ ~

Now I just wonder how many web masters in fact downloaded [MIMETYPES] from 
the URL above, and wether latest changes you have menetioned were reflected 
in that document.
Still I do not understand (and guess that many other people will not 
understand) why you have "image/png", "image/gif" but "image/svg+xml"
I personally find this quite confusing, and making transition from IMG to 
OBJECT tag rather difficult for people not reading *all* standards available 
on Internet (and this is just not possible to follow *all published 
standards*) 

I am cc'ing www-SVG list with hope that reasons for such practice can be 
clarified, and may be added somewehre as FAQ.
