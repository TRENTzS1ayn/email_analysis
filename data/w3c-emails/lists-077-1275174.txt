Just one "Huh?" moment as I read this:

"Making sure that the blind person who is using a screen reader can hear 
the label and understand the nature of the image they are scrolling over 
with their mouse."

Erm ... Hopefully just a slip of the lip/brain, rather than betraying lack 
of knowledge of how blind folks actually use computers. ... OK, OK! He's a 
big-picture guy, I geddit. :)

Also liked their question about implementing "these accessibility things."

But otherwise a very good article, & credit to them for doing it.

Patrick, also has accessibility doohickies & thingumabobs
