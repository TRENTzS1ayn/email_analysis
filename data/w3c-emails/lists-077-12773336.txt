I'm not sure what you mean here bob but I think I agree <grin>  The
trouble with the whole pdf thing is that html has been around since the
beginning of time and can be accessed by just about anything although I
remember a time in the dim and distant past when there was no such thing
in my world as an internet browser or an html converter so it wouldn't
have done me much good.  Having said that, much of pdf if it is produced
propperly can be accessed or converted into something accessible by one
tool or another provided that one of the considerations that it is
treated with is allowance of the opperation.  Trouble is that there are
too many documents out there already done rong and too many people still
doing documents rong and it is still too easy to do it rong lots like
the web to make pdf worth the trip.

This is not opinion.
