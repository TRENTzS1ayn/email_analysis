Question:

If you have an accessible HTML version of a document, do we need to make
the
PDF version of the document accessible too?  What if the PDF version is
only
made available for printing purposes (and marked as such)?

In that case, I'd concentrate on making the HTML accessible and forget
about
the PDF.

What does everyone else think?
