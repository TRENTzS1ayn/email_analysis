It's a poor choice for ALT text, but it is highly appropriate as
a TITLE, in my opinion.  If someone chooses to have their browser
read TITLEs at the same time it reads ALT text, hey, more power
to 'em, but it _is_ correct to identify an image as a picture (or
photograph or logo or whatever) in a TITLE="" element of an IMG
tag.

The rules for TITLE are not the same as the rules for ALT.
