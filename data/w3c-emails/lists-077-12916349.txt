PDF is intended to be a final form document (although you can replace
pages).

Most web site designers would also like final form documents, it makes
controlling layout much easier.  Final form is also like by the lawyers,
both because layout may be considered legally significant and because it
is less easy to plagiarise.

However, one of the design principles of PDF is that it should be possible
to extract the text part as plain text.  As indicated in another reply, the
fact that this is unreliable is more to do with the word-processors than
with PDF.

Note that SVG is more like final form in this respect; it doesn't
support reflowing of text and physically places the text.  Also, the
only guaranteed accessibility feature of SVG is the ability to recover
plain text, which is much the same as PDF (it does support grouping,
which has only just been added to PDF).
