>If you have an accessible HTML version of a document, do we need to make the
PDF version of the document accessible too?  What if the PDF version is only
made available for printing purposes (and marked as such)?
In that case, I'd concentrate on making the HTML accessible and forget about
the PDF.

Sounds like a reasonable solution to me Joel. However, Web 
developers/administrators would need to ensure that both formats are updated 
at the same time.
