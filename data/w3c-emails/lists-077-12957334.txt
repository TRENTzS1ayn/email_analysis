PDF is significantly older than HTML (at least in popular use); Adobe
simply failed to realise the signficance of extending they hyperlinks
they already had to the internet, until it was to late, even though it
better fits the wants of commercial web designers.  In addition, I think
that Adobe stood up against Microsoft, so Microsoft don't bundle Acrobat
in the way that they bundle Flash.

To some extent, HTML was originally done in rejection of the need for
a high end machine and the presentational and visual nature of PDF,
even though people now try to force it HTML to be a high end machine,
visual, presentational language.  Designers who thing they are making
HTML progress by gettiing those features are simply completing the
circle and returning to the pre-HTML world.
