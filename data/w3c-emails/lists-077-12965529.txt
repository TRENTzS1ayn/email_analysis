It is quite obvious that there will always be more obsolete equpment around, 
and we need to ensure it remains in service.

I have an hp320lx running winCE1.0 and although it does not display jpgs it 
does render the earth.gif in both the embed and object SVG code tests.

the upgrade to CE2.0 was free at the time,but now costs ?60 or $130 for what 
is definitely an obsolete pda from '97. it just happens to have a pcmcia 
card...
