I think you are talking about HP Jornada?
Any chance to install Linux on that device?
Than I guess you can have even SVG rendering :-)

Yes, the price of this upgrade is close to what low-end PDA's will cost at 
the end of 2002.
So it seems you need just to wait a little bit and buy a new PDA later.
IMO recently released Sharp Zaurus is great, and by the way it the first PDA 
to have mini-keyboard - you can type text (mail, etc.) using this keyboard.
And, for Opera fans: it comes standard with Opera browser (plus, you can add 
Konqueror/Embedded to it easily, it's fully supported)
