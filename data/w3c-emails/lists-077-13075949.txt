Dear folks,

A minor correction and I will snip out extraneous items.

George's comment: The World Wide Web *Consortium* W3C does not develop in
secret. It is composed of member companies and organizations who all
collectively contribute to the development of specifications. This is
accomplished by clearly defined working group activities that are staffed by
its membership (all those companies and organizations) who develop the
specifications. The importance of having working implementations before a
specification is approved has been a welcome change in the development in
the W3C over the last few years.

Hope this correction helps.

Best
George
