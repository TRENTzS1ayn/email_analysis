I agree with joel.  With all the trouble it takes to make the pdf
accessible it is just easier to go ahead and put it up in html.

The rare PDF that includes internal navigation is tolerable, but I have
never found a PDF that is as easy to read in a browser as a standard
HTML
document.  If I want to read the content in full, I will usually print
the
PDF.  I've gone through many wasted reams of paper that way.  :-)

Much like with HTML pages, PDFs can be done well and PDFs can be done
poorly.  The fault often lies with the document's designer/coder.

For viewing online, you can make a PDF document work much like a
standard
HTML page.  But why bother?  Just make a standard HTML page!
