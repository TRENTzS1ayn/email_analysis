Hello, All.

I too agree that making an HTML page is easier and less likely to hinder
accessibility, but one can make an accessible PDF file easily with the
Adobe plug-in with Microsoft Word and PageMaker 7.0.  The plug-in adds
HTML-like tags and the .pdf file can be added to a webpage, maintaining
the document's appearance for printing for sighted users.  Images and
tables can be tagged and formatted for alternate text and the flow of
information can be altered as well. 

Again, I feel that accessible PDFs should be used when it is absolutely
necessary to maintain the layout of an original document for printing.
In my opinion, there should be an option for a text only document as
well as the PDF file.

I agree with joel.  With all the trouble it takes to make the pdf
accessible it is just easier to go ahead and put it up in html.

The rare PDF that includes internal navigation is tolerable, but I have
never found a PDF that is as easy to read in a browser as a standard
HTML
document.  If I want to read the content in full, I will usually print
the
PDF.  I've gone through many wasted reams of paper that way.  :-)

Much like with HTML pages, PDFs can be done well and PDFs can be done
poorly.  The fault often lies with the document's designer/coder.

For viewing online, you can make a PDF document work much like a
standard
HTML page.  But why bother?  Just make a standard HTML page!
