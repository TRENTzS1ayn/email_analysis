If we count _under PDF_ PostScript as well - than PDF is 20+ years old.

Yes, good explanation. :-)
Now I just wonder about Microsoft's position on SVG.
If they decide to support SVG - than it will become standard. Otherwise...
It can be that Web Designers will have to study ActiveGraphics technology :-((
(which of course would be superset of SVG and WMF with *almost all features 
of SVG implemented*, but just BETTER!)

XHTML (basic) or XML - is the way to go.
For content presentation, everyone should use CSS (not to offend SVG here).
CSS is rather mature technology and recent version of browsers do very good 
job of CSS formatting.
