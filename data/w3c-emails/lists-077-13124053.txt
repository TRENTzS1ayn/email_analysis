yes, that's correct.
You can solve equations using PostScript, and print out results on rendered 
page. :-)
Besides, you can execute some *PostScript programs* and get no output at all 
- it will either do some internal work (recoding fonts, conversion, etc.) or 
export/import operations (good example is ps2pdf utility in GhostScript) or 
both.

Can someone explain to me what do you mean by *accessible* PDF?
Is it PDF without "microspacing" and "words being broken up"?
// I apologize in advance that I don't have time to read numerous Adobe 
specs, so simple explanation in 2-3 sentences would be enough.

It seems to me that KWord-generated PDF (which uses Qt for this, plus own 
layouting engine) is quite different from what you described above.
If you send me off-list some small (<30K) .doc or .html or simple RTF file, 
and explain *how* should good PDF file produced from that doc look like, I 
wil do the testing and post results here.

How many people understand PostScript and PDF? Not too many, IMO.
I was studing PostScript around 7-8 years ago, but since that time PLRM 
version 3.0 was published, it's 950 pages, and I just don't have time to come 
through...
Most people use auto-generated PostScript (Windows or MacOS "PS driver", some 
publishing software, Adobe tools after all)

You may want to take a look at Xerox Document Centre (DC330 or DC340, for 
example).
Fully-configured machine can not only print documents and copy them, but also 
scan-to-PC and automatically produce PDFs from those scanned pages.
IIRC text is recognized (OCR'ed) and stored as text in those PDFs.
[yes, I was working for Xerox some time ago, and although I was working in 
different division, I used this from time to time]

Don't know though how accessible those PDFs. Hope they were not bad. :-)
