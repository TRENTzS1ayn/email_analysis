Hi Dave,

have you thought about using IRC? There are a lot of clients available on
different systems. Do other people have experience with trying to use IRC?

It is proposed as a possibility for the AU group, in the event that someone
joins who cannot take part in telephone meetings, and it has been used in the
WCAG group a bit.

  Hi,

  I am trying to find an accessible chat program to install on a site I am
  working on. I have found some that are perl-base (and therefore tweakable),
  but all seem to be dependent on meta-refresh.

  Any ideas?

  Thanks,
