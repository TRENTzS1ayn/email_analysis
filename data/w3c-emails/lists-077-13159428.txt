The reason one might bother is that PDF is designed to reproduce the
page as seen by the designer, whereas designers are currently producing
contorted HTML to achieve this effect in a language that was not
intended for tbe purpose.  It does not necessarily help accessibility,
except, possibly, that the time wasted on making HTML pixel perfect
and inaccessible could be used to make the PDF accessible (unlikely
of course).
