Thanks, Joel.  The reason I'm asking is not for my own access but because I want
to link to the document from an accessible page that I'm creating.  I've used
the converter before, and it is not ideal (but not bad in a pinch for pdf's
without images) -- I don't think it meets the WAI priority 1 or Section 508
standards, does it?
