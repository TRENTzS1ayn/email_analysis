which is?  my point is

no, of course not  but Lynx and text are independent of operating systems,
they will both work on windoz machines, and I have but rarely use Netscape
and Mozila and a number of other browsers, I happen to like text only and
lynx is fast and bullet proof, not to mention, pretty much universally
accessible no matter what platform it is operated on. 

the Operating system, be it Linux, Unix, Mac, Sun, windoz, or what ever
should not be a requirement to view anything on the internet..that was the
beauty of the internet, it was independent of operating system
archetecture

and as far as I know every operating system in the world can read ASCII
accurately
