Hi Joel:

I could only find the conversion to HTML button, but not to txt.  I thought there used to be a txt option also.  Have I missed it?
I know there is a pdf2txt by email and it works well but I thought it was online as well.

Steve

Hi Carol,

Did you try using the PDF to text converter?
    http://access.adobe.com/simple_form.html 

At first glance, it looks like an okay conversion job.

Joel
