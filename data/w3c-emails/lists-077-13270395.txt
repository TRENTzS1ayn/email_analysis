I don't know where to begin with this. <http://www.flash508.com/> is 
a site allegedly teaching people how to make Flash presentations 
508-compatible, which everyone knows is completely impossible at 
present, though that will change in a few months.

And guess what you see when you visit in Lynx?

I suppose the whole thing is commendable in a way.

Not entirely clear who is responsible for the site, even after 
looking up the domain registration.
