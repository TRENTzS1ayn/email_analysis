As far as I'm concerned it's a Bobby bug, even when the Language is set
in the HTTP headers Bobby has this:

   1.  Identify the language of the text. (1 instance)
       Line 3

The last version of Bobby came up with loads of 'browser compability'
errors when one was using XHTML rather than HTML, most of these seem to
have been fixed apart from supporting xml:lang.
