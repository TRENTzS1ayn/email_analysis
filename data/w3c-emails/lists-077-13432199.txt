actually, you cannot run a fully secure document through any of the
publicly available free conversion tools that I know of without getting
a similar message to that which you get when you bring them up in
acrobat reader 5.05. or 5.5.  The security issue is a grave one because
in order to grant access to screen readers the propper flag must be set
by the author unless this has been changed with 5.05.

This is a good point. But I would be surprised if the result of running
a
document through a PDF to HTML conversion chagnes the copyright status,
which
would mean that having tested / improved the result, you can post it as
an
alternative form.
