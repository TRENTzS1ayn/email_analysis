This ought to be default behaviour, without any headers attribute!

At a guess, the support is not there because it would either not be
useful for the vast majority of pages (which in any case code headings
as <td><b>...</b></td>) or might even be counterproductive (inappropriate
use of <th>...</th>.  On that basis, any attempt to work round it will 
lower the priority of implementing it in the speech browsers.

It may also be that the feature is there, but turned off by default.
