It's the way the vast majority of current web pages are written, i.e.
as a table to force a particular layout, often with one cell per line
of text.

Authors, producing content for a house style page, only need to be
taught proper HTML, plus a few special conventions.  The people who
set the house style need to do a little more work.  Basically, it should
be easier for someone who understands what they are writing as content,
but more difficult for the person controlling the house style - the
former only needs to know how the various elements of the page match
the house style; the latter have to define rules that will automate
the current manual hacking of layout by authors.
