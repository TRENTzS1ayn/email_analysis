Did you mean can't post, rather than can post?

This is a feature of PDF that may well make content providers reluctant
to provide alternative forms with lesser technical imposition of IPR
constraints.  (PDF, in general, has a lot of features aimed at commercial
users.  The only real IPR support in browsers at the moment is that which
requires downloadable fonts to be tied to a site - one reason why 
downloadable fonts aren't much used.)
