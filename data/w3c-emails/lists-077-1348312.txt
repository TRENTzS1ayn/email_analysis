I am simply amazed at how many sites post the bobby approved icon on their
site.  The sites I am seeing are not compliant and never were as they are
missing the basic level 1 subjective requirements.  Even if they were
compliant, they are not using a positive quality assurance program!

Better yet, most sites do not even validate to HTML standards!
