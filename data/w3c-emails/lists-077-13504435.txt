Hi,

I believe the point of my comment was missed.  The issue actually was more
in terms of whether markup languages always need to be used in the most
elegant format.  It is possible to use a less elegant approach as that
in the low level approach, but still be accepted by validators.
In fact, one of the reasons why the design was chosen was so that it
would not create problems for when the web page is validated.
