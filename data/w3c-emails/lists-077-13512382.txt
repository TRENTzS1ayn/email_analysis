Hi,

I'm still somewhat confused.  Many web pages use tables for layout, but
many cells have more than one line of text.

In the statement:

  "...I would suggest that a reasonable approach would be to write the page
  as structural HTML, with classes, and divisions, to impose the higher
  level structure, then transform it into the table based page description
  HTML for the GUI browsers."

there is mention of structural HTML being transformed into a table based
description.  It is not clear what is doing the transformation of
structural HTML or when this transformation actually occurs.  This is why
I asked what server/technology would be required.
