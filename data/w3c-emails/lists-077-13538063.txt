Very little if they control the design.  A great deal if they don't.
If they have a strong mandate to produce a particular appearance, it
could more than double the cost, or even be impossible. 

If the will is there at the higher level, then the I'd suggest that
a competent designer would need an extra one to two days of initial
learning of the principles.  However, a lot of designers cut and paste,
without understanding HTML, so, without plenty of good examples to
copy, those designers would not be able to learn.

The point of my reply is that, for a competent designer, the problem
is not accessibility, but resolving the conflicts betwween accessibility
and the other customer requirements.  Very few are prepared to tell the
customer that they are wrong.
