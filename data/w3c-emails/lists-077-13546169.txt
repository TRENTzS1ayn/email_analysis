I was answering part of the message not all of it.  There are a lot of
assumptions being made here and I was addressing one of them.
Accessibility in the broadest senxe is not an absolute target nor is it
absolutely obtainable but a couple of things I know.  If one follows the
guidelines for the end result no matter how that end result is achieved
and if that end result validates and if propper human judgement is
employed, than the accessibility as a result of that effort is vastly
improved.  This is not rocket science.  Creating an accessible end
product under most circumstances confining that accessibility to what
the guidelines document was meant to do no matter how it is achieved
will serve the purpose.  A multi-model end is a fair way to achieve
this.  We have enough anechdotal andother evidence now to answer all the
questions about this topic going back several years and the original
poster should do some reading to see what questions should really be
asked.  Following this thread you end up with my post because the rest
has already been covered in one way or another and As I said, we serve
the technology so that it can serve us.  I will go further to say that
if we ever get to the point where the technology truly serves us as the
poser of the question asks, we will become subserviant to the technology
which may not be a bad thing depending on how much benevolence we build
into it.  I would not want to live in that world however.

I don't see why validity demands a single HTML version be delivered.
Multiple versions of a page are good because they allow for usability
to be delivered, not just accessibility -- and even the accessibility
of many pages is in question because HTML is limited both in theory
and in application.
