Hello Scott!

Separating "content" from "presentation" (which is necessary for web 
accessibility) requires *web page creater who starts with no background in 
accessibility guidelines* to learn (at least):
* XHTML
* CSS
both of these tasks are rather complicated, and require *re-thinking* of 
traditionally used methods (for example, re-design of "copy-and-paste" 
process, and other important points raised by David Woolley in answer to your 
mail) 
Making content in XHTML (or XML) is more close to programming, while (broken) 
HTML4 can be coded with no knowledge of programming.
Knowledge of CSS requires understanding of design principles, and basic 
knowledge of DTP (Desktop Publishing)
If you combine both requirements (programming+DTP) in one, you will 
understand that it's quite difficult to find a person who can do both.
And such person will definitly cost you a lot of money.

One more point is with making site accessible without SCRIPTs.
As many designs (Macromedia Dreamweaver, for example) rely on scripts from 
the beginning (findOBJ, rollover images, etc.), redesigning site for 
accessibility will require ... just making completely new site, no less!..
Of course, costs associated with this are enermous, and I hardly imagine any 
company which would like to do this at their own good will.

I still think that it worth to make site accessible. Let's say that it will 
take your designer/programmer (with good skills *in general*) one month to 
learn XHTML/XML and 2 months for CSS. Than I guess one extra month for 
accessibility looks like reasonable for me.
But you can'tr expect *all this done* in one month, for sure.

Hope that I have answered your question.
