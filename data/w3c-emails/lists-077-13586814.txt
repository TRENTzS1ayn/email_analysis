And Dmitry Sklyarov's case definitly comes here in mind.
What about e-Books?
Are the rights to read them *in a way you prefer* (like Screen Reder, or with 
increased/changed fonts) granted to us by the Constitution, or given by 
Content Publisher?
 
to rephrase my question:
Do you break any law by applying "publicly available free conversion tools" 
on some content which is *owned* by you?
(either you loaded it from the intrnet, or bought in shop/online, or leased, 
or rights to use this content was given to you by friend, etc.)
