we don't own them.  we own the right to use them.  if that means
altering them in some way, we technically violate the copy right.

And Dmitry Sklyarov's case definitly comes here in mind.
What about e-Books?
Are the rights to read them *in a way you prefer* (like Screen Reder, or
with
increased/changed fonts) granted to us by the Constitution, or given by
Content Publisher?

to rephrase my question:
Do you break any law by applying "publicly available free conversion
tools"
on some content which is *owned* by you?
(either you loaded it from the intrnet, or bought in shop/online, or
leased,
or rights to use this content was given to you by friend, etc.)

|   This is a good point. But I would be surprised if the result of
running
