Nielsen's specialty is Usability, so his recommendations are bound to be
different from accessibility guidelines.

For example, a transcript of an audio presentation would make it accessible to
deaf users. But if the transcript lacks the visual layout to make it easy to
follow dialog or changes in topic, then it is accessible but less usable.
