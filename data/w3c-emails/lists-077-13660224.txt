I just made a new tour of the www.amazon.com/access site. Whether in
response to
user feedback or as a result of hooking it into more databases, things seem to
be improving.

Doing a search yields a page with the top result, with a link under it to More
Results. These are shown in subsequent pages in groups of six at a time
(remember the PDA screen).

Choosing a particular result (in the music section) shows an information page
for the item including price, the top one or two reviews, etc. Links to track
listings & further customer  reviews are linked to by unlabeled graphic links.
However there are only a couple of these mystery links, so you can't go too
far
wrong. Previous attempts I made last week didn't show any track listings
(although the page was there). Now the tracks are there but no links to sound
samples.

I haven't tried purchasing anything yet, so can't comment on the problems of
the system not recognizing purchase information.

When & if they get it implemented properly I would use this version all the
time. Breaking content up into more pages means more clicks/Enter keys, but
it's well worth it if the subpages are more intelligible.
