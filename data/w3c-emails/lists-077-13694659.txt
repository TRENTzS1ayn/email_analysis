your question along hese lines was do we serve the technology or does it
serve us.  I'm not sure I understand the rest of your message here.  I
still do not know the difference between eligant and non eligant.  I
only know from valid and invalid or non valid if you will.

Hi,

Ah, this might explain the misunderstanding of the discussion.

One of the posters said that the low level approach is a "travesty".
I might have been wrong, but my interpretation of that characterization
was that it was a travesty because additional information was being
encoded into the HTML using the comment structure rather than using
a more general markup approach.  Purists would prefer the elegance
of such information being encoded in tags.

My comment about who controls who with regards to people and technology
was along the lines of whether a person needs to use the more elegant
approach when a lesser elegant approach serves the needs of the
particular application.
