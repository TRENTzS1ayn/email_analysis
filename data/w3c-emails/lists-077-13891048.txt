Hello David!

By "them", do you mean "e-Books" or ... everything?
I have checked several normal, printed books I have on a bookshelf.
There is nothing written on those books about "right to use them" or wether I 
own this book or not.
I guess as soon as I passed checkpoint (cash register) in bookstore with that 
book (and paid for it) - I own that book. But of course I can't claim 
ownership for content, as its author is clearly indicated.

Than I checked AudioCD.
For example, I have "A song for you" CD.
(p) and (c) Excelsior. ... Manufactured in the USA by Excelsior.
WARNING: All rights reserved. Unauthored duplication is a violation of 
applicable laws.

As you see, "duplication" is prohibited, but nothing is said about converting 
to other (different) formats, either to audio tape on cassette deck or to mp3 
on hard drive. 

Now I want to return back to traditional books, as it's on-topic with subject.
I think I have mentioned somewehere that Xerox manufacturers DocumentCenter 
(DC330, DC340) machines, which can *save to PDF* any document (with 
auto-feeding scanner) or book placed on the glass (you need to turn pages 
manually inthis case).
I believe it's pretty legal when you bought book to have an electronic copy 
of it (either in PDF format, or converted further to HTML+CSS, or XHTML, or 
XML)
Your house can disappear in fire (or in earthquake), together with books, 
bookshelfs, etc. But if you have electronic copy  (placed supposely on your 
web server) - you still have it.
And this, BTW, one of the key moving factors for the Internet Revolution.

So I think possibility to make copy of book I won is my fundamental right, 
and transforming its content via some technical method (either screen reader 
or scan-to-PDF/convert-to-HTML method) is absolutely legal (and necessary, to 
prevent protection of my stuff in cases of fire, earthquake, etc.)

|   And Dmitry Sklyarov's case definitly comes here in mind.
|   What about e-Books?
|   Are the rights to read them *in a way you prefer* (like Screen Reder, or
|   with
|   increased/changed fonts) granted to us by the Constitution, or given by
|   Content Publisher?
|
|   to rephrase my question:
|   Do you break any law by applying "publicly available free conversion
|   tools"
|   on some content which is *owned* by you?
|   (either you loaded it from the intrnet, or bought in shop/online, or
|   leased,
|   or rights to use this content was given to you by friend, etc.)
