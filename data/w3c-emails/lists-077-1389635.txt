I believe that it's simply a matter of using the correct DTD on
the top of your page when you submit the URL to the validator.

For example, an old page on Idyll Mountain Internet is the
tinywar/tk mud client page -- if you go to the validator and type
in http://www.idyllmtn.com/tinywar/, you'll see that you can
correctly validate it to the 3.2 specification.

Why?  Because the DOCTYPE statement refers to HTML 3.2, not 4.0
or 4.01.
