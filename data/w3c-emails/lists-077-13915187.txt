Why do you think that his report is important?

about "accessibility improved by guidelines"
I think that CSS is a key part for good web design, and is a key (but not 
*the key*) for accessibility.
Unfortunately, you can easily make CSS stylesheet badly designed - and even 
Validator (I mean here, CSS validator) can't prevent you going in wrong 
direction.
Problem is caused by the fact that ... CSS specification is badly designed.
If you want to know *why* - check www-style mailing list.
In aprticular, "How is it possible to devise such a feeble system?" thread 
started by Jesse McCarthy on Oct.24, 2001.
Have a nice reading! :-))

How to fix this?
I guess we need to fix CSS specification first, than fix other issues.
CSS3 is even worser than CSS3, so I think it either should be completely 
scratched and started from the beginning, or completely re-designed.
Second is less painfull and is the way to go.
