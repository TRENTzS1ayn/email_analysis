When acrobat 4.05 with the access plug in came out and you could export
a useful document to text or html and there were tools available for
accessing pdf documents on platforms in addition to windows, We had fair
access.

With the emergence of acrobat reader 5.0 even though the mark up
capabilities have improved for rendering in it, we still have issues
with rendering in other than windows platforms and till recently could
not even export to text.  The only improvements to access of pdf
documents are for those running the latest assistive technologies that
support the accessible features of acrobat 5.0.5 and for those who are
able to recieve the newly marked up documents converted by the tools
that have been also been improved.  This leaves out quite a substantial
portion of who is still alive and likely to be for a long time to come.

But not by all definitions -- for example, by Adobe's definitions,
if they made it with the latest software using the techniques to
improve screenreader access, it may very well be accessible.

(I don't know if it was made in such a way or not, but PDF may not be
an absolute barrier to access these days.)
