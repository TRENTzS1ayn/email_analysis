seems to me that if he was writing about accesibility, he'd have had a
perfect opportunity to demonstrate it.

I don't think that's necessarily the best idea -- nor have I seen
anything conclusive saying the Nielsen report is "inaccessible"
(I don't know; I just know it's way expensive).

It's possible, for example, for great wisdom to be contained within
a book, even if that book isn't yet available in electronic format.

Is Nielsen's book full of "great wisdom"?  I don't know.  But I do
know that we shouldn't necessarily dismiss it out of hand.
