I agree with statement number 1 but statement #2 takes the view that the
technology is being designed from the ground up which is rarely true.
Accessibility technology is almost always layed ontop of or forced into
something that is usually already badly designed.

Hi,

Coming from the usability world, I look at as accessibility as being
one of the specializations of usability.  Also, if something like
a transcript introduces some accessibility, but has usability problems,
then its effectiveness for providing accessibility is diminished.

Look at how much better accessibility technology could be if it was
designed with better user-friendliness or usability.
