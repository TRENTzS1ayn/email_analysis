The only bug in this respect, and it's presumably deliberate, is that
it validates HTML without a DOCTYPE as HTML 4.01 rather than the correct
HTML 2.0.  That probably reflects the very low level of usage of 
DOCTYPE.

If you provide it with a conforming HTML 3.2 document, it will validate
it as such.  HTML 4, I seem to remember, uses the same SYSTEM identifier
as HTML 4.01 as it is a bug fix version, rather than a real new version.

I don't know of a way of doing this, but it's rather academic because
no browsers implement any particular level completely.

There is no formal specification of DOM0.
