Hi,

The underlying assumption is that there is a right page.  Why assume
that there is a right page rather than a right set of versions of
pages each presenting the same information?

With regards to CSS versus table, Kynn wrote:

    "Just so that we don't leave rhetorical questiosn unanswered:

    Tables, definitely.  Tables are much more friendly to older browsers
    than CSS."

The approach of saying that a person should learn what they need
to learn without asking why or how hard may be appropriate in some
situations.  However, in companies or organizations where there is
competition for resources, this view would be seen as less than informed.
In general, one of the common rules of allocating resources is to
use them where the balance between resource allocation and benefit
derived is as far as possible towards the benefit side as possible.
If CSS is desired, then the arguement would need to be how using CSS
rather than tables would be benficial enough to the organization
to justify the allocation resources.  (Sometimes, it is helpful to imagine
making the presentation before the CEO of an organization to see if an
idea makes sense from their point of view.)
