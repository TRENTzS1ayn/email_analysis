Hi,

Actually, some of the usability people I know are pretty amazed at
how poorly designed the usability of the access technology is designed.
The decisions made often cannot be excused by the technology being
built on top of what is already been badly designed.  The mistakes
were more lkely to have been made because the access technology
programmers (like most programmers) are unaware of usability
principles and techniques.  (Many people outside of the usability
world don't have the experience to see how that happened.)
