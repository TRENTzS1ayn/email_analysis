It seems that there is an opinion around that you can make web pages without 
CSS.
This is terribly wrong - at least if we keep in mind modern browsers, like MS 
IE, Netscape/Mozilla, Konqueror, Opera.
Any of those browsers have *default stylesheet*.
(try # locate html4.css
/usr/share/apps/khtml/css/html4.css
or # locate html.css
/usr/lib/mozilla/res/html.css
if you run Linux)

This means that even on page like this:
<html>
<body>
<p>Hello, World!</p>
</body>
</html>
CSS properties are *calculated* for every element in DOM tree (html, body, p)

You don't need to write custom CSS for example like this, but still can 
notice that NN 4.7 will render "Hello, World!" in Times/Times New Roman, 
while MS IE - in Arial and Konqueror - in KDE's default font. 
It's like the fact that you can drive a car without knowledge of driving 
rules, but knowing some rules definitly helps. Especially if you see 
something like "STOP" sign in front of you, or traffic lights.

In fact, you don't need to learn CSS for example above but you still *will be 
using CSS*, wether you like it or not.

Besides, you can easily explain following changes added via CSS to newcomer, 
plus enhance document's perception:
<html>
<style type="text/css">
 /* add extra margin around body element and highlight body with lime border 
around */
 body { margin: 2em; border: 2ps solid lime }
 /* increase font size and make it bolder */
 p { font-size: 200%; font-weight: bold }
</style>
<body>
<p>Hello, World!</p>
</body>
</html>

Good point about CSS is you can always disable unnecessary element(s) by 
defining, for example, 
p { display: none }
-> than all paragraphs will disappear, and you will see only headers.

CSS? :-)
