I would have thought there were few accessibility issues with the service,
only with the clients (which may correlate with the service if it uses
a closed protocol).

Even the addressing is fairly flexible, e.g. British Telecom market a
directory service for NetMeeting that uses telephone numbers (they think
that people will already be familiar with these, so there is no learning
cost for the general public).
