Bob, if this is done correctly, lynx will be seen as non java and served
accordingly.  We won't miss anything because it will be provided.  I
agree about the future though.  Even now, you can hide your user agent
from being sent in the header of the request.

enable it in Lynx or if it is even possible)

I say it again, there should be no assumption what so ever that there is
any user side support for anything.
