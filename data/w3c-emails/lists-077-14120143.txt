Er, sorry, no.  CSS support is _not_ currently good enough that you
don't need tables, and in fact, apart from older screenreaders which
did not understand them, tables for layout are not a barrier to access,
no more or less than CSS.

Lemme say that again since it rarely gets said:

      LAYOUT TABLES DO NOT PRESENT ANY MORE OR LESS A BARRIER TO
      ACCESS THAN DOES CSS.

Sorry to shout.
