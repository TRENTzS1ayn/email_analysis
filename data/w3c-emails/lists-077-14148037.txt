Hi, Seth

I think what was being asked was along the lines of how easy was it
to learn accessibility guideline issues.  Learning about graceful
degrading was just an example.

Using a browser to get a sense about how tables may linearize can
be helful. The question becomes more complicated about how a beautiful
visual layout which uses nested tables will linearize and still
be efficient for understanding.  One conflict that develops is whether
to keep a complex visual layout because of its beauty or to sacrifice
it because of the confusion that nested tables can create when linearized.

The multiple browser and multiple versions becomes more complicated
when accessibility is added to the mix.  It then becomes multiple browsers
and multiple versions of browsers interacting with multiple access technologies
and multiple versions of access technology.

I'm not sure I'm saying there is no need to learn how pages degrade.
I think there are ways to reduce the effort for handling the issue
of web pages degrading.  Multiple versions can be of help with
appropriate approaches.  For example, very simple layouts probably have
fewer degradation problems.

I would probably lean away from browser sniffing, though that may not
always be possible.  An introductory page may be appropriate with the
right design.
