I guess many people mix JavaScript and DOM.They are *not the same*!
JavaScript is just one more programming language, like C, C++, Pascal or 
Visual Basic. You can make computations, store results, etc.
To make some DynamicHTML effects, you need to have DOM implementation (at 
least DOM1). To capture mouse or keyboard events, you need DOM2 being 
implemented.
It's pretty much the same as compiler (gcc) and libraries (stdio.h, or glibc)
You can use one compiler with different libraries. And you use library with 
different languages (language bindings).

BTW: what are advantages if using text-based browser?
I really do not understand that.
Graphics environment has so many advantage over text so I am quite confused 
to hear this.

And, IIRC, my example exactly provides NOSCRIPT section :-)
JavaScript was turned Off in first releases of KDE/Konqueror by default (say, 
KDE 2.0 and 2.0.1, one year ago) as some people think that JavaScript and 
security is an oxymoron.
I have to admit that testcase/example was written by me in Oct.-Nov.2000  and 
mostly untouched fromn that time.
I still monitor userAgent progress using this example (as Nestcape 6.0 was 
based on M18, nad Netscape 6.2 uses mozilla 0.9.x; it's also always funny to 
test Opera in its "emulation" mode with this code)

|   support for HTML 2.0?  What about HTML 3.2?  What about HTML 4.01
|   Transitional?  What about HTML 4.01 Strict?  What about CSS level
|   1?  What about CSS level 2?  What about ECMAScript?  What about
|   DOM?
|
