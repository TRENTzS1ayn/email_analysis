|   Er, sorry, no.  CSS support is _not_ currently good enough that you

CSS is *good* enough, and you don't need tables at all for most layouts.
Just make sure that you put HTML4 Strict DTD when render page in MS IE6.
(for most layouts, MS IE5 is also good enough, but as IE6 is available you 
may want to try it first)

Tables, in general, is not a problem.
But Tables for *layout* is indeed an Evil(tm).

BTW: I don't understand why you try to treat Tables separatly from CSS.
yoy can define
a { display: table }
b { display: table-row }
c { display: table-cell }
and than use following XML
<a>
  <b>
    <c> cell 1</c>
    <c> cell 2</c>
    </b>
</a>
to dispaly table on screen (printer)

to proove that, I attach below one working XML+CSS example
Works nice in Mozilla/Netscape6, Konqueror and even MS IE.
You can add aureal rendering for this example easily, it will be jsut few 
lines of CSS rules.
