I live in the real world and this is getting way off topic but I can
tell you that most of the blind people I know do not have scanners and
have you ever tried to use a scanner to access auditorily a complex
document like this?  If you think pdf is a nightmare, try doing that
with one of those expensive packages developped for the blind.  Yes,
there is a lot of good use for this software but I would not want to
depend on it for say learning how to write html or css or js or c++...

The fact remains that if the topic of something is accessibility, it
should be available in at least one widely accessible form.  I have
found that in most cases, people who do not require a widely accessible
form won't use it for their love of paper and paper form so I doubt it
would detract from his money making to make it available in an widely
accessible form.

Hi,

If the report is being sold in hard copy, wouldn't it be accessible to
blind people with scanners?

In terms of size of audience, how many blind people have the background
and interest to get the report?  In the real world of selling, these
facts
influence decisions.
