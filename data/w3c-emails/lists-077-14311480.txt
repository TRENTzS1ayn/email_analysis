Hi,

There is a difference between philosophy and practicality.  It is easy
to make a philosophical judgement.  The hard part is implementing
it in the real world with its limitations.  Given that Norman-Nielsen
group is not a non-profit organization and that a fair amount of
money was spent conducting the research in various countries,
what are the alternatives?  Perhaps WAI needs to look at ways to
support such research so that the results can be distributed
without concern for recouping cost?  Or perhaps WAI could
buy the rights to the document?

PS  Are all documents concerning accessibility available in some
widely accessible format?  Are there any books on web page accessibility
not available in a widely accessible format?
