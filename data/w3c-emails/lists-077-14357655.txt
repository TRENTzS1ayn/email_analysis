How many assistive technologies will understand the above, and
how many will understand <table> tags? :)

But as you say, <table> tags are just arbitrary elements with
CSS table styling pre-applied.  If using tables for layout is evil,
then surely so is the above, which is CSS!  You can do just as much
evil with CSS as with <table>, and -- see my other message for a
discussion as to why generic tags like <div> are less useful than
double-use tags like <table>.
