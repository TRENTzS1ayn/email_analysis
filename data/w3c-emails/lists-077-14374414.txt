the alternative is simple.  It would not have cost them much on the
scale of things if they didn't want to do it in house or could not do it
in house to turn it over to someone who could produce it in an widely
accessible form.  I do not think it is the job of the wai to undertak
paying for all the inaccessible documents out there to be made
accessible.  I'd have done it for him for comparitive peanuts if he'd
but asked.

Hi,

There is a difference between philosophy and practicality.  It is easy
to make a philosophical judgement.  The hard part is implementing
it in the real world with its limitations.  Given that Norman-Nielsen
group is not a non-profit organization and that a fair amount of
money was spent conducting the research in various countries,
what are the alternatives?  Perhaps WAI needs to look at ways to
support such research so that the results can be distributed
without concern for recouping cost?  Or perhaps WAI could
buy the rights to the document?

PS  Are all documents concerning accessibility available in some
widely accessible format?  Are there any books on web page accessibility
not available in a widely accessible format?
