The Japanese Society for Rehabilitation of Persons with Disabilities (JSRPD)
is working on development of accessible IRC chat software to invite
deaf-blind users to "the real time caption service of TV broadcasting on the
net".

"The real time caption service of TV broadcasting on the net" is an
achievement of the disabilities community in Japan as a result of the
revision of the Copyright Law in 2000.  Information Centers for the Deaf and
JSRPD are officially entitled to distribute the real time caption of the TV
program through IRC chat.

If we could develop accessible IRC chat system for deaf-blind people, they
may extend their currently most limited real-time information sources.
I strongly suggest to include "accessible chat software development" as one
of the target issues of WAI.
