At some point that may very well become necessary.  It's not really
reasonable to continue to build applications to run on 1992
technology.  For example, these days very few applications are
designed to work with Windows 3.1 or MacOS 7.

Eventually, browsers like Lynx which don't meet the current -- or
even five-years-old -- standards _will_ need to be left behind.
That doesn't mean the users should ever be left behind; in fact, it
means there should be strong pressure on browser makers to conform
to the standards for minimal browser functionality.
