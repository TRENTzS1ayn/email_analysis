Hi,

I might be wrong, but I heard that one of the reasons that the Jakob
Nielsen report was in PDF was because it has some feature which
can lock the file or limits its copying.  If I minderstood, then
that's a different set of issues.

Why can't WAI funds be used to make accessible some key relevant documents
which are inaccessible?  Perhaps the question to ask is why was the
research done by someone not working with WAI.  Why wasn't WAI
supporting such research before someone else started doing it?
