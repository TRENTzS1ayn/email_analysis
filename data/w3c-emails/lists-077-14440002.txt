I guess that is a matter of opinion, it is pretty good at what it does and
while I have a later version of netscape, I so rarely run it because I so
like what LYNX does so much better.   especially it is "Clean and Fast"

so far I have yet to find a browser that is better there.  not to mention
that access is almost a "gimmi"
