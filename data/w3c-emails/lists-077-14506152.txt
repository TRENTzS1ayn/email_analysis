I have a "gripe" with Lynx?  No, I'm merely pointing out that it's
limited in what it supports and what it doesn't, and it shouldn't be
considered a full web browser by the standards of 2001-2002.

Whether or not other browsers support "every W3C standard" is
immaterial; if Lynx doesn't and something else doesn't, that means they
are both behind the times -- it doesn't magically make Lynx standards-
compliant.

By the way, I use Lynx a lot, but not as much as I could, because it
is _so_ limited in what it does.

Are you saying it _does_ do CSS, DOM, JavaScript, and the other
things I listed?  Nothing on the pages cited indicates that.
