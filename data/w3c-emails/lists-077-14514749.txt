By "do HTML 4.01" do you mean "it fully supports everything in the
HTML 4.01 specification" or do you mean "if you give it HTML 4.01, it
can render it in some worthwhile manner?"  The two are not the same.

E.g. -- and I don't know this (but I'll download a version of Lynx
2.8.4 now and test) -- what exactly does it do with longdesc attributes?

I'm not stating a popularity contest of browsers here -- I like Lynx
myself -- but I feel that the limited capabilities of Lynx make it a
poor baseline for accessibility.  It is too limited of a browser to
make it the minimal browser; it doesn't meet the basic requirements
of a 21st century web access software system.
