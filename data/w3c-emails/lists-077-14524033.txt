Hello,

I am trying to make my site compliant to level 3 accessibility and was
wondering if you could answer these questions?

*I have been told that menu items should be created in text however
this is not on the checklist. Does this mean that you can have graphic menu
items as long as you have "alt" tags?
*What do these points in the checklist mean?

*Create documents that validate to published formal grammars.
*Use header elements to convey document structure and use them
according to specification. 
*Provide keyboard shortcuts to important links (including those in
client-side image maps), form controls, and groups of form controls.(What
type of short cuts? Anchor tags?)
*If search functions are provided, enable different types of searches
for different skill levels and preferences. (What skill level and
preferences?)
Could you please give me some examples of sites that use each of the above
techniques?
Thank you for your time.
