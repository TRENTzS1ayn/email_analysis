As a first try, I think Minimal Browser Capabilities should be:
* XHTML basic (or XHTML 1.1, dependind on platfrom or on developer's opinion 
what version of XHTML is more simple to be implemented)
* CSS modules: Selectors, Visual Box Layout
(so that you can use #aa, .bb definitions for 'id' and 'class', plus apply 
them on DIV or SPAN in XHTML or define {display: block}, {display: inline} 
for XML elements
You can also add Background and Colors modules to the list, but they are easy 
to understand for traditional web-developers.
NOTE: I think Fonts module should be really optional, due to its bloatness.

* ECMAscript (JavaScript), I believe, is really *optional*
It should be requirement for *minimal* browser capabilities.
Besides, it can be that other languages (Python, for example) will be betetr 
suited for web-pages & scripting, so putting JS as requirement is not very 
wise.
* SVG , I think, is too fat to be included. May be, SVG Core? 

So, I think XHTML basic + CSS (without Tables, Positioning modules) is a way 
to go, and should be considered as a minimum requirement.
Under CSS, I was referencing to CSS3 modules, but of course many of them 
should be re-worked before becoming Recommendation.

As about Lynx - it seems that 
a) XHTML support should be added to it, if it's not done already
b) CSS Box Model can be emulated even on text screen.
You can suggest , say, virtual screen size of 800x600 (80x30 text) and use it 
for layouting, and make *rounding* to nearest *full* character.
Most likely, you will be able to get even CSS borders - if border is 
thick enough, of course. 

The best solution, of course, would be to have *rendering engine* separated 
from *User Interface*.
Than you can use same engine with Text Layout (terminal, DOS, your 
refrigirator on kitchen, whatever), Framebuffer (like QT/Embedded, SVGAlib or 
GTKembed) and normal 2D accelerated screen (XFree86, MacOS, Windows)
So far, none of browser vendors achieved this.
Opera, most likely, is the closest to this, but it seems they do not plan to 
make text-only browser.
I guess Opera in Sharp Zaurus PDA will operate over Qt/Embedded, so they have 
Framebuffer solution (also used in Opera for QNX), plus Windows, Mac and 
Linux ports. Now we should just ask Opera to add text-only browser :-)

|     support for HTML 2.0?  What about HTML 3.2?  What about HTML 4.01
|     Transitional?  What about HTML 4.01 Strict?  What about CSS level
